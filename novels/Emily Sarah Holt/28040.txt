robin tremayne by emily sarah holt emily holt was a historian of no mean calibre many of her books are set in the middle ages or a little later this one is set in the s and a little before and after this was the time when the catholic mary was on the throne and catholicism was enforced as the official religion it was also the time when protestantism which had been on the rise was checked and many protestants burnt at the stake when elizabeth came to the throne this was reversed and protestantism was once more the official religion this book which is quite largely based on wellresearched fact tells of the family life of a few people who were protestants and who preached the gospel unerringly throughout despite in the end some of them being imprisoned including robin tremayne himself his account of the prison in which he was held is quite amazinghow wickedly unkind people can be to one another at one stage in the story people were being burnt at the stake quite wholesale when elizabeth came to the throne all the bishops were catholic and at first none could be persuaded to officiate at the coronation eventually the bishop of carlisle agreed to do it but as he hadnt any suitable vestments he had to borrow some from bonner the bishop of london who wouldnt do the coronation himself full of anecdotes like this based on fact the book is fascinating there is a watereddown version of elizabethan speech a few decades before shakespearean english and so reasonably understandable the footnotes are there to explain the more unusual words and phrases robin tremayne by emily sarah holt preface more than three hundred years have rolled away since the events narrated in the following pages stirred the souls of men since john bradford sat down to his merry supper with the lord since lawrence saunders slept peacefully at the stake lifted over the dark river in the arms of god since ridley and latimer on that autumn morning at oxford lighted that candle in england which they trusted by gods grace should never be put out and how stands it with england now for fortythree years like a bird fascinated by the serpent she has been creeping gradually closer to the outstretched arms of the great enchantress is she blind and deaf has she utterly forgotten all her history all the traditions of her greatness it is not quite too late to halt in her path of destruction but how soon may it become so how soon may the dying scream of the bird be hushed in the jaws of the serpent the candle which was lighted on that autumn morning is burning dim it burns dimmer every year as england yields more and more to rome and every living soul of us all is responsible to god for the preservation of its blessed light o sons and daughters of england shall it be put out chapter one the folding of the lamb and then she fell asleep but god knew that his heaven was better far where little children angels are and so for paths she should have trod through thorns and flowers gave her this sod he gave her rest for troublousness and a calm sleep for fitful dreams of what is and of more that seems for tossings upon earth and seas gave her to see him where he is wm rossetti arbel look forth and see if thy father and robin be at hand i fear the pie shall be overbaken the speaker was a woman of about forty years of age of that quiet and placid demeanour which indicates that great provocation would be needed to evoke any disturbance of temper gathering up the garment on which she was at work arbel note crossed the long low room to a wide casement on the outer mullions of which sundry leafless boughs were tapping as if to ask shelter from the cold and after standing there for two or three minutes announced that the missing members of the family were approaching and a third party withal added she that seemeth me so far as i may hence discern to be doctor thorpe he is very welcome an it be he returned her mother still calmly spinning i trust to ask his counsel touching robin figuratively speaking for more than a century was yet to elapse ere george fox founded the society of friends it might be said that custance note tremayne was born a quakeress it had hitherto proved impossible through all the annals of the family experience to offend or anger her she was an affectionate wife and mother but nothing roused in her any outward exhibition of anxiety or annoyance the tenor of her way was very even indeed before arbel had done much more than resume her seat and her needle the room was entered by two men and a lad of sixteen years the master of the house mr anthony tremayne note who came in first was a man of more demonstrative manners than his quiet partner he who entered second was shorter and strongerbuilt and had evidently seen a longer term of life his hair plentifully streaked with grey was thinned to slight baldness on the summit of the head his features otherwise rather strong and harsh wore an expression of benevolence which redeemed them his eyes dark grey were sharp and piercing when he took off his hat he carefully drew forth and put on a black skullcap which gave him a semipriestly appearance the lad who entered with a slow and almost languid step though in face resembling his father was evidently not without an element of his mother in his mental composition his hair was dark and his eyes brown but the same calm placidity of expression rested on his features as on hers and his motions were quiet and deliberate good morrow dr thorpe note said mistress tremayne rising from her work the like to you my mistress was the response well how fare you all be any of you sick or can you do without me for a sennight whither go you doctor gently asked custance the doctors brow grew graver on a sorrowful errand friend he replied our noble friends at crowe are in sore trouble for their little maid is grievous sick what little honor cried arbel pityingly ay methinks the master is come and hath called for her we might thank god if we could see things as he seeth the sorrows of her house shall never trouble her poor child said custance in her quiet voice why good doctor we be none of us truly sick i thank god but in sooth i did desire you should step in hither touching robin touching whom asked dr thorpe with a faint sound of satire in his tone but the tone had no effect on custance touching robin she repeated i would fain have you to send him some physic an it like you what shall i send him said the doctor with a grim smile a bottle of cider he lacketh naught else nay but i fear me he groweth too fast for his strength answered his mother then give him more meat and drink was the rather contemptuous reply the lad is as strong as a horse he is only a trifle lazy he lacketh but stirring up with a poker send us the poker said his father laughing i am not an ironmonger retorted the doctor again with the same grim smile but the boy is all right women be alway looking out for trouble and taking thought but i count you know a mothers fears answered custance calmly how should i said he i was never a woman let alone a mother i know all women be fools saving a handful of whom isoult avery at bradmond yonder is queen mr anthony tremayne laughed heartily his wife merely replied as quietly as before so be it doctor i suppose men do fall sick at times and then they use not to think so for a little while at the least well i said not you were not in the handful said he smiling again all that you yourself do know make the handful i count said tremayne ah doctor your bark did alway pass your bite but who goeth yonder come within the door opened in answer to his call and disclosed a goodlooking man in the prime of life whose dark hair and beard were particularly luxuriant in growth ah jack avery god save thee resumed tremayne heartily thou art right welcome what news such news was the response in a clear musical voice as we be scarce like to hear twice this century may i pray you of a cup of wine to drink the health of the king fetch it robin said tremayne but what hath the kings grace done avery not surely to repeal the bloody statute his sickness making him more compatient note unto his poor subjects that were good news i sorrow to say it replied avery but this is better news than that should be and holding up the cup of wine which robin offered him he said solemnlythe kings majesty edward the sixth god save him from all except custance there came in answer such a cryhalf amazement half exultationas we in this nineteenth century can scarcely imagine for such an event for the last eight years of the reign of henry the eighth england had been in slaveryfast bound in misery and iron every year it had grown heavier murmuring was treated as rebellion and might have entailed death to know that henry was dead was to be freeto be at liberty to speak as a man thought and to act as a man believed right ay resumed avery gravely king henry the eight is gone unto the mercy of god how much mercy god could show him let us not presume to think we can only know thisthat it was as much as might stand with his glory dr thorpe and john avery left tremayne together for both were on their way to crowe a walk of twenty minutes brought them to the house of the latter an erection of some fifty years standing bradmond comprised not only the house but a large garden and a paddock in which averys horse bayard took his ease there was also a small farm attached with its requisite buildings and when the gentlemen arrived tom note the general factotum was meandering about the flowergarden under the impression that he was at work while averys little daughter kate note aged nearly four years was trotting after him from one spot to another also under the impression that she was affording him material assistance in his labours john avery brought his guest into the hall then the usual family sittingroom when particular privacy was not desired here they were met by a lady a little under middle height with a fair pale complexion but dark brown eyes and hair her manners at once very quiet and yet very cordial this was isoult avery in due time the next morning the party set forthnamely john and isoult avery and dr thorpeand after two days travelling reached crowe crowe was a smaller house than bradmond less pleasantly situated and with more confined grounds the door was opened by a girl who to judge from her dress and appearance was a maidofallwork and with whom tidiness was apparently not a cardinal virtue good morrow deb note how fareth the child good lack mistress was all that could be extracted from deb get thee down to the kitchen for a slattern as thou art and wash thee and busk dress thee ere thou open the door to any again said a rather shrill yet not unpleasant voice behind deb and that damsel disappeared with prompt celerity the maid is enough to provoke all the saints in the calendar isoult sweet heart be a thousand times welcomed and the speaker advancing kissed her guest with as much affection as though they had been sisters and how goeth it with the child mrs philippa a quick shake of the head seemed to give an unfavourable answer demand that of dr thorpe when he hath seen her but our apothecary feareth much very unlike either of the women already described was philippa basset there was nothing passive about her every thing was of the most active type and the mood in which she chiefly lived was the imperative while really under the common height of women in some mysterious way she appeared much taller than she was her motions were quick even to abruptness her speech sincere even to bluntness every body who knew her loved her dearly yet every body would have liked to alter her character a little generally speaking she seemed to take no part in those softer feminine feelings supposed to be common to the sex yet there were times when that firm voice could falter and those bright quick greyblue eyes grow dim with tears whatever she did she did thoroughly and heartily she loved fervently and hated fervently that capacity for indignation which it has been said lies at the root of all human virtues was very fully developed in philippa her age was thirtyone but she looked nearer forty perhaps isoult avery who had gone with her through the storm of suffering which fell on the house of lisle could have guessed how that look of age had come into the once bright and lively face of philippa basset come in dear heart continued philippa and speak with my lady my mother and i will carry up dr thorpe to see the child so john and isoult went into the parlour and philippa conducted dr thorpe to the sick chamber in the little parlour of the little house at crowe sat a solitary lady she was not yet fifty years of age but her hair was only one remove from white and though lines of thought and suffering were marked on her pale face it yet bore the remains of what had been delicate loveliness her complexion was still exquisitely fair and her eyes were a light bright blue though she moved quickly it was with much dignity and grace she was a small slightlymade woman she sat as upright as a statue and she inclined her head like a queen it was no marvel for she had been all but a queen for twelve years of her life her velvet robes had swept over palace pavements and her diamonds had glittered in the light of royal saloons and for seven of those years she had herself occupied the highest place an invitation from her had been an envied honour a few minutes conversation with her a supreme distinction for this was honor plantagenet viscountess lisle sometime lady governess of calais but that was all over now she was a widow indeed and desolate the house of lisle had fallen seven years before and honours high estate as well as her private happiness fell with it and with her as with so many others it ended in the old fashion where be thy frendes sayd robin syr never one wyll me know whyle i was ryche enow at home grete boste then wolde they blowe and now they renne awaye fro me as bestes on a rowe they take no more heed of me than they me never sawe note of the scores of distinguished persons who had enjoyed the princely hospitality of lady lisle at calais not one ever condescended to glance into the little house at crowe she had friends left but they were not distinguished persons and foremost among these was isoult avery who for two years had been bowerwoman to the viscountess in those old days when she sat in the purple as governess of calais many minutes had not elapsed before philippa and dr thorpe entered the parlour together well what cheer asked lady lisle quickly even before her greeting for the grandchild who lay ill in the chamber above was very dear to that lonely womans heart madam the child is dying alack my poor lamb and lady lisle rose and went above to the little sufferer dr thorpe turned to isoult what aileth the mother he asked her shortly frances she replied in good sooth i wis not i have not yet seen her doth aught ail her save sorrow the lady frances he repeated methinks somewhat else doth ail her what it is essay you to discover he broke off rather abruptly as the door opened and the lady under discussion entered the room taller than lady lisle or philippa she was more slender and fragilelooking than either hair of pale shining gold framed a face very white and fair of that peculiar pure oval shape and those serene regular grecian features which marked the royal plantagenets for this lady was of the bluest blood and but for an act of cruel treachery on the part of king edward the fourth she might have been the princess royal of england and never had england a daughter who could have graced that position more perfectly to a character so high and pure and a taste so delicate and refined as were almost out of place in that coarsest and most blunt of all the centuries she united manners exquisitely gentle gracious and winning the lady frances basset was a woman taught by much and varied suffering she had known both the climax of happiness and the depth of sorrow the crushing blow of her houses fall had been followed by two years of agonising suspense which had closed in the lonely and faroff death of the father from whom she derived the fairest features of her character and whom she loved more than life three years ensued filled by the bitter pain of watching the gradual fading of the husband whom she loved with yet tenderer fervour and at the end of that time she was left a widow but with two children to comfort her and now two years later the lord came and called the elder of those cherished darlings joseph was not and simeon was not yet benjamin must be taken away but no tears stood in the soft clear blue eyes as frances came forward to greet isoult they would come later but the time for them was not now when little honours life was ebbing away the mother was tearless come she said softly and isoult rose and followed her on a little trucklebed in the chamber above lay the dying child had she survived till the following spring she would then have been eight years old as isoult bent over her a smile broke on the thin wan face and the little voice saidaunt isoult this was honours pet name for her friend for there was no tie of relationship between them isoult softly stroked the fair hair aunt isoult the faint voice pursued i pray you tell me if i shall die my lady my grandmother will not say and it hurteth my mother to ask her isoult glanced at lady lisle for permission to reply speak thy will child she said in a steeled voice we can scarce be more sorrowful than we are i count yet i do marvel what we have sinned more than others that god punisheth us so much the sorer a grieved look came into isoults eyes but she only answered the question of the little child ay dear honor she replied methinks the lord jesus shall send his angels for thee afore long send his angels she repeated feebly ay dear heart wouldst thou not love to see them i would rather he would come himself said the child i were gladder to see him than them isoults voice failed her a minute and frances laid her head down on the foot of the bed and broke into a passion of tears go thy ways child murmured lady lisle her voice a little softer it shall not take much labour to make thee an angel aunt isoult said honor again faintly will he not come himself maybe he will sweet heart answered she doth he know i want him to come she said and shut her eyes wearily ay he knoweth darling said isoult doth he know how tired i am thinkest broke in lady lisle bitterly are three dread woeful crushing sorrows in six years not enough for him to give will he take this child likewise and maybe frances and philippa as well and leave me to creep on alone into my grave what have i done to him that he should use me thus was i not ever just to all men and paid my dues to the church and kept my duty like a christian woman are there no women in this world that have lived worser lives than i that he must needs visit me answer me isoult canst thou see any cause frank will tell me tis wicked to speak thus if she saith aught or maybe she shall only sit and look it is it wicked for the traitor on the rack to cry out why then should not i who am on gods rack and have so been these six years and yet am no traitor neither to him nor to the church mother dear mother whispered frances under her breath well she resumed is that all thou hast to say i am so wicked am i thus to speak but wherefore so come isoult i await thine answer it was a minute before isoult avery could speak and when she did so her voice trembled a little she lifted up her heart to god for wisdom and then said dear my lady we be all traitors unto god and are all under the condemnation of his holy law shall the traitor arraign the judge and unto the repenting traitor gods hand falleth not in punishment but only in loving discipline and fatherly training you slack not i count to give honor her physic though she cry that it is bitter and loathsome nor will god set aside his physic for your ladyships crying yet dear my lady this is not because he loveth to see you weep but only because he would heal you of the deadly plague of your sins our lords blood shed upon the rood delivereth us from the guilt of our sins but so tied to sin are we that we must needs be set under correction for to make us to loathe it i pray your ladyship mercy for my rude speaking but it is at your own commandment ah tis pity thou art not a man that thou mightest have had the tonsure replied lady lisle drily ah me children if this be physic tis more like to kill than cure little honor lived through the night and when the morning came they were still awaiting the kings messenger as those who loved her sat round her bed the child opened her eyes aunt isoult she said in her little feeble voice how soon will jesus come and take me isoult looked for an answer to dr thorpe who was also present he brushed his hand over his eyes would you liefer it were soon or long little maid said he for mothers sake i would liefer he waited she whispered but for mine i would he might come soon there will be no more physic will therenor no more pain after he cometh poor heart exclaimed lady lisle who sat in the window nay little maid answered dr thorpe nor no more crying honor said isoult i would he would take mother along with me pursued the child she hath wept so much these two years past she used to smile so brightly and it was so pretty to see her i would she could do that again thou shalt see her do that again dear honor said isoult as well as she could speak but not methinks in this world but her voice failed her for she remembered a time when that smile had been brighter than ever honor saw it if he would take us all the child continued faintly me and mother and arthur and grandmother and aunt philippa and father is there waitingis not he i think he is honor answered isoult that would be so good she said as she closed her eyes aunt isoult would it be wrong to ask him it is never wrong to tell him of our wants and longings dear heart was the answer only we must not forget that he knoweth best please to ask him the child whispered but isoults voice broke down in tears ask him thyself little maid said dr thorpe the child folded her little hands on her breast lord jesus she said in her faint voice i would like thee to come and take me soon i would like thee to take us all togetherspecially mother and grandmotherwith me and please to make grandmother love thee for i am afeard she doth not much and then make haste and fetch her and mother to me amen god bless thee little maid said dr thorpe in a low voice all the singing of the angels will not stay that little prayer from reaching his ear but list the child whispered lady lisle under her breath honor lay a minute with her eyes closed and then suddenly opened them and clasped her little hands again i forgot to ask him one thing she said please lord jesus not to send the angels but come and fetch me thyself and her eyes closed again frances came softly in and sat down near the bed and a few minutes after her philippa looked in and then came forward and stood in the window she and dr thorpe looked at each other and he nodded philippa whispered a word or two to lady lisle who appeared to assent to something and then she came to frances dr thorpe confirmeth me in my thought said she that twill not be long now therefore i will fetch father dell but frances rose and laid her hand on her sisters arm nay philippa she said i will not have the childs last hour disturbed disturbed by the priest exclaimed philippa opening her eyes what do ye chaffer about cried lady lisle in her old sharp manner go thy ways philippa and send for the priest the noise aroused the dying child must the priest come asked the faint little voice from the bed will jesus not be enough frances bent down to kiss her with a resolved look through all her pain ay belovedjesus will be enough she answered and no priest shall touch theemother forgive me for disobeying you this once but i pray you by all that you hold dear and blessed let my child die in peace if not for my sake or if not for hers for their sakesthe dead which have linked you and melet her depart in peace philippa shook her head but she sat down again have your way frank answered lady lisle with a strange mingling of sorrow and anger in her voice there is more parting us than time or earth as i can see i thought it sore enough when jack set him on his dying bed against the priests coming and then thou saidst never a word but now there was no need said frances in a quivering voice have thy way have thy way said her mother again i was used to boast there was no heresy in my house ah well we live and learn if thou canst fashion to reach heaven by a new road prithee do it methinks it will little matter for her and when my time cometh thou wilt leave him come to me maybe there was silence for a little while afterwards and their eyes were all turned where honor lay the little life ebbing away like the tide of the ocean her eyes were shut and her breathing slow and laboured suddenly while they watched her she opened her eyes lifted her head and stretched forth her arms with a cry of pleasure oh she said delightedly motherit is not the angelshe is come himself what she saw how could they know the dying eyes were clear but a film of earth over the living ones hindered their seeing him for an instant hers kept fixed on something unseen by the rest and they shone like stars then suddenly a shiver came over her her eyelids drooped and she sank back into her mothers arms is she gone asked lady lisle with god said dr thorpe reverently little honor was buried at crowe the evening of her funeral found isoult avery in the painful position for it is both painful and perplexing of a general confidante each member of the family at crowe took her aside in turn and poured into her ear the special story of her troubles this as it always does involved complaints of the others of these complaints lady frances uttered the fewest and had the greatest reason and isoult now found that dr thorpe was right for more was troubling her than her maternal sorrow in the first place they were very poor the priory of frithelstoke granted some years before to lord and lady lisle by the king their nephew was all that remained to the widow and from this piece after piece of land was detached and sold to supply pressing necessities the second trouble was of older standing for the house of lisle was divided against itself and the gospel had brought to them not peace but a sword nine years before while he was yet governor of calais lord lisles heart had been opened to receive the truth while his wifes remained closed frances followed her father philippa her mother and there was in consequence a standing feud in the family as to which religion should be taught to arthur the remaining child left to frances but the third trouble was at that moment pressing the sorest mr monke of potheridge a gentleman of good family and fortune had requested lady lisles permission to seek the hand of her widowed daughter for frances was lady lisles child by affinity in a double manner being both her husbands daughter and her sons widow lady lisle under the impression that mr monke was of the old doctrine which she professed herself not only gave him her leave but aided him by every means in her power in the hope that frances might thus be converted from the error of her ways very bitter was this to the bereaved mother of the dead child to be asked to marry again at all was no light matter but to have the subject continually pressed upon her by the mother and sister of the lost husband whose memory she cherished with unabated devotionthis was painful indeed philippa was less to blame in the matter than her mother being herself of less delicate mould than her sisterinlaw she really did not see half the pain she inflicted and her energetic nature would have led her to endeavour to forget sorrow rather than to nurse it at any time in her belief frances thought and mourned too much she wanted rousing she ought to make an effort to shake off all her ills physical and mental philippa had honestly mourned for her dead brother as well as for his child but now it was over and done with they were gone and could not be recalled and life must go on not be spent in moping and moaning this was philippas view of matters and under its influence she gave more distress to the sister whom she dearly loved than to do her justice she had the faintest idea that she was giving when lady frances had unburdened herself by pouring her troubles into her friends sympathising ear philippa in her turn took isoult aside and bespoke her sympathy frances is but foolish and fantastical she said or she should wed with jacks old friend mr monke that would fain have her my lady my mother desireth the same much it should ease her vastly as matter of money this very winter doth she sell two parcels of the frithelstoke lands for to raise money and at after there is but frithelstoke itself and crowe after the which sold we may go abegging an you so do mrs philippa said isoult with a smile metrusteth you shall come the first to bradmond after the which you shall need to go no further last came lady lisles secrets her complaint was short and decided like most things she said frank is a born fool to set her against mr monke he would make her a jointure of eighty pounds by the year and he spendeth two hundred by the year and more and is a gentleman born and hath a fair house and ne father ne mother to gainsay her in whatsoever she would doth the jade look for a duke or a prince trow methinks she may await long ere she find them isoult thought but she did not say that in all probability what frances wished was only to be let alone the result of these repeated confidences was that isoult began to want a confidante also and as dr thorpe had asked her to find out what was distressing lady frances she laid the whole matter before him when he was put in possession of as much as isoult knew he said thoughtfully tis my lady lisle then that doth chiefly urge her i think so much she replied methinks mrs philippa doth but follow my lady her mother and should trouble her but little an she did cease she will cease ere long he answered sadly you think so dr thorpe said isoult mistaking his meaning i shall verily be of good cheer when she doth so you do misconceive me mrs avery said he i do not signify that she shall leave it of her good will nay nor perchance ere death take her but that will be ere long dr thorpe cried isoult you would say i would say answered he that my lady lisles life is scantly worth twelve months purchase methought it better to let you know so much mrs avery for i would not give you but scarborough warning note woe worth the day said isoult the lady frances is but ill off touching her health replied he but with her tis rather the soul than the body that doth suffer rest from sorrow and vexations might yet avail for her but neither rest nor physic nor aught save a miracle from god can avail as methinks for the lady lisle when isoult came down into the little parlour the day after she was surprised to find there a stranger in close conversation with lady lisle and philippa she hesitated a moment whether to enter but lady lisle desired her to come in so she sat down and began to work little of the conversation reached her for it was conducted almost in whispers until the door opened and lady frances came slowly into the room a quick colour rose to her cheek and she slightly compressed her lips but she came forward the stranger a dark goodlooking man kissing her hand before she sat down is there aught new mr monke asked philippa changing the conversation i have heard but one thing said he yet is that somewhat strange my lords grace of canterbury is become a gospeller wherefore gramercy inquired lady lisle scornfully wherefore not i can say said philippa twill scarce serve to curry favelle note very little as i think answered mr monke as to the wherefore madam mecounteth my lord archbishop is gone according unto his conscience tis his wont as men do know humph was all lady lisle said mens consciences do lead them by mighty diverse ways now o days observed philippa i little wis wherefore all men cannot be of one fashion of belief as they were aforetime thirty years gone all was peace in religion the dead are at peace ever sister said frances softly the living it is that differ living quotha exclaimed lady lisle thy fashion of talk is aside of me frankbut what think you mr monke hath every man the born right to do that which is good in his eyes or should he bow and submit his conscience and will unto holy church and the kings highness pleasure lady lisle spoke scornfully but frances turned and looked earnestly at mr monke isoult did the same and she wondered to see his face change and his eyes kindle madam said he maybe your ladyship doth but set a trap for to hear what i shall say touching this matter but verily if i must tell mine opinion in matters so near to a mans heart and conscience as are his soul and her affinity with god methinks neither the kings highness pleasure neither the teaching of the church hath much ado i would say that a man should submit his will to gods will and his conscience to gods word and no otherwise lady frances eyes were radiant and a quick flush was kindled on her cheeks her mother rose from her chair are you a gospeller she said yet in a tone from which no one could have guessed whether she were one herself or not i am so madam answered mr monke his colour deepening but his voice as firm as ever then get you gone out of mine house cried she in a rage and come hither no more atempting of my daughter mr monke rose and endeavoured to kiss her ladyships hand but she drew it from him as if he had been a snake he came over to where isoult sat and held out his hand farewell mrs avery he said in a low voice which trembled a little i have made an end of all mine hopes in this quarter yet how could i have done other forgive me mr monke i pray you she said glancing at frances face whence the light and the colour had not yet died away i think rather you have but now made a beginning isoult avery returned home in anything but a happy frame of mind lady lisle had turned completely against mr monke and now taunted frances with caring nought for him save for his gospelling while philippa took part first with one side and then with the other in all this turmoil isoult could see but one bright spot which was the hope of an approaching visit from sir henry and lady ashley lady ashley nee katherine basset was lady lisles second daughter and there was some reason to expect from the gentleness of her disposition that her influence would be exerted on the side of peace a letter was waiting for isoult avery at bradmond from an old friend and mistress whom she had not seen since her marriage it ran thus my good isoultbut shall i call you so now you be mistress avery choose you if you will not have it so for until you deny it i shall call you so annis fareth right well and is a maid of most sweet conditions now i see your brow to wrinkle and that you shall say how cometh my lady of suffolk to wit any thing of annis if all riddles were as readily solute as this it were scantly worth the trouble to make them but have here mine explication of the mystery three months gone certain of my kin writ unto me from spain to desire me to search and find a discreet maiden of good degree that should be apt at the tongues and that she should be reader of english unto the queens grace of spain the emperor charles his mother truly i slept not on the matter but endeavoured myself to serve them with all the haste in my power but though maids be many discreet maids be few and discreet maids of good degree be fewer yet hereon writ i unto mistress anne basset the discreetest maid i know to ask at her if she were ware of an other as discreet maid as herself that would of her good will learn the spanish tongue and dwell in spain and what doth mrs anne but write me word in answer that there is in all this world no maid to compare for discretion with annis holland which hath learned the french from her and the latin from mr hungerford of the kings house and can chatter like a pie in both the one and the other wherefore i being aweary of searching for discreet maids did lay hands with all quickness and pleasure on this maid and she is now in mine house alearning of the spanish from father alonso and don jeronymo and me and so being weary i commend you and mr avery to god from grimsthorpe this wednesday at six of the clock in the morning and like a sluggard note in my bed your assured loving friend k suffolk the reader will need more explanation of this lively epistle than did isoult anne basset the third of lady lisles four daughters had been successively maid of honour to the four latter queens of henry the eighth during much of which period with an interval for her calais experience isoult barry had been her bowerwoman when isoult quitted annes service for that of the duchess of suffolk she begged that her old friend annis holland might be promoted to the vacant placea request readily granted by anne since isoult barry became isoult avery she had seen little of either anne or annis and the transference of the latter to the duchesss service was no little wonder to her meanwhile public news poured in on all sides mr tremayne who had occasion to journey to exeter came back armed at all points with fresh tidings of what was doing in the world and as such live newspapers supplied all that was to be had every body in bodmin immediately asked him to dinner mr tremayne declined the majority of the invitations but he accepted that from bradmond which included his family also so he in a brown velvet suit and custance in the gravest drab and arbel with some bright blue ribbons neutralising her sober sadcoloured dress and robin whose cap bore a white feather stuck in it in a style not suggestive of quakerism walked up to bradmond one thursday afternoon to fourhours it is scarcely needful to explain that fourhours was a meal taken at four pm and in style and custom corresponding to the afternoon tea now in vogue it may be more desirable to indicate of what it consisted seeing that tea and coffee were yet mysteries of the future there were cakes of all varieties there was clotted cream and of course there was junket there were apple puffs and syllabubs and halfadozen different kinds of preserves in the place which is now occupied by the teapot was a gallon of sack flanked by a flagon of gascon wine beside which stood large jugs of new milk and homebrewed ale one thing at least was evident there was no fear of starvation when the ladies had finished a little private conference and all the party were gathered round the table mr tremayne was requested to open his budget of news it was glad news for the gospellers for the grand item which in their eyes overwhelmed every other was that bishop gardiner had left court not exactly in disgrace yet with a tacit understanding that his stay was no longer welcomeand that the kings uncle the earl of hertford now created duke of somerset was placed at the head of public affairs somerset was a lutheran but just emerging from the twilight of lutheranism into the full gospel day after the great subject came the smaller ones the knighting of the young king by his uncle somerset the creation of a large batch of peerssomerset himself and his brother the brother of queen katherine made marquis of northampton the halfbrother of lady frances basset created earl of warwick and wriothesley the persecutor who was made earl of southampton these were only a

years and tears he said we live a little then life leaves us dead and the long grass grows greenly overhead while the party were still conversing the post came inalways an important event at that dayand brought two letters for isoult the first was from beatrice dynham fictitious persons who had been her fellow bowerwoman with the duchess of suffolk and requested her old friend to remember her in the first week in may when she was to marry mr vivian a fictitious person a gentleman of the late kings household she also informed her that the young duke of suffolk a boy of eleven years had been placed about the person of the young sovereign under the care of the duke of somerset the second letter was from crowe lady ashley had arrived and had tried hard to effect a truce between the contending parties she hoped not entirely without good results lady lisle had been obliged to sell two pieces of land from the frithelstoke estate called choldysoke and meryfield and philippa basset sent isoult word that it was well meryfield was sold seeing that all mirth had departed from them long ago when shall my mistress your friend be wed mrs avery very gravely inquired jennifer trevor isoults bowerwoman the first week in may repeated isoult referring to the letter ay methought you read so much responded jennifer looking still more solemn come out with your thought mrs trevor said tremayne for i do see plainly that you have one why mr tremayne replied she tis but that i would not be wed in may for all the gold in cornwall but how if your servant suitor were a sailor mrs jennifer and should set forth the last day of may queried avery then she said i would either be wed in april or he should wait till he came back but tis true mrs avery a may babe never liveth no more than a may chick thriveth nor is a may kit ever a mouser tis the unluckiest month in all the year i never brake in all my life a steel glass lookingglass saving once and that was in may and sure enough afore the same day next may died one on that farm one of the household asked avery well nay answered jennifer twas but the old black cow that had been sick a month or more ah was the grave answer her dying was a marvel but there was a death mr avery urged jennifer an there had not been said he i count you should have drowned the cat to make one but mrs jennifer in sober sadness think you that god keepeth record of the breaking of steel glasses and the ticking of deathwatches eh those deathwatches cried she i were out of my wit if i heard one then i trust you shall not hear one answered he for i desire that you should keep in your wit well mr avery said jennifer i could tell you somewhat an i listed pray give us to hear it replied he what is it and whom threatens it the red cow or the tabby cat poor puss and he stooped down and stroked her as she lay on the hearth there shall come a stranger hither pursued jennifer solemnly i saw him yestereven in the bars of the grate what favoured he asked avery twas a fair man with a full purse she replied then he is welcome an he come to give us the purse was the answer it shall be an other post i cast little doubt for he shall be a stranger and maybe shall have full saddlebags you shall see mr avery said jennifer pursing her lips so i shall mrs jennifer responded he but in how long time shall he be here that i cannot tell said she then the first fair man that cometh whom you know not shall serve answered he tis mighty easy witchery that i could fall to prophesying mine own self at that rate it shall rain mrs jennifer and thunder likewise yea and we shall have snow and great men shall die and there shall be changes in this kingdom and some mighty ill statutes shall be passed and you and i shall grow old mrs jennifer if we die not aforetime and we shall suffer pain and likewise shall enjoy pleasure see you not what a wizard i am tremayne laughed merrily as he rose to depart i shall look to hear if mrs trevor be right in her prophecy said he we will give you to know that in a months time answered john avery rather drily in less than a month the news had to be sent for a stranger arrived it was mr monke jennifer was delighted except for one item she had announced that the stranger would be fair and mr monke was dark in this emergency she took refuge as human nature is apt to do in exaggerating the point in respect to which she had proved right and overlooking or slighting that whereon she had proved wrong i might readily blunder in his fairness she observed in a selfjustifying tone seeing it did but lie in the brightness of the flame not a doubt thereof responded john avery in a tone which did not tranquillise jennifer when there happened to be no one in the hall but himself and isoult mr monke came and stood by her as she sat at work wish me happiness mrs avery he said in a low but very satisfied voice isoult avery was a poor guesser of riddles she looked up with an air of perplexed simplicity why mr monke i do that most heartily at all times she answered but what mean you that god hath given me the richest jewel he had for me he said in the same tone as before then isoult knew what he meant is it frances she asked speaking as softly as he had done it is that fair and shining diamond he pursued known among men as the lady frances basset for a moment isoult was silent and if mr monke could have read the thoughts hidden behind that quiet face perhaps he would not have felt flattered for isoult was wondering in her own mind whether she ought to be glad or sorry but the next moment her delicate instinct had told her what to answer mr monke she said looking up again i do most heartily wish happiness to both you and her and mr monke never guessed from any thing in the quiet face what the previous thought had been the next day brought a letter to isoult from lady frances herself and the last relic of jennifers uneasiness was appeased by the fair hair and beard of the messenger she only said now that there might have been two strangers in the fire she ought to have looked more carefully all was smooth water now at crowe lady lisle had given way but not until frances plainly told her that she had urged this very match earnestly before and now that she was reluctantly endeavouring to conform to her wishes had turned round to the opposing side philippa was more readily won over lady frances had told mr monke honestly that a great part of her heart lay in the grave of john basset but that she thoroughly esteemed himself and such love as she could give him he should have i trust she wrote to isoult that we may help not hinder the one the other on the way to heaven we look to be wed in june next after the new fashion in the english tongue pray meanwhile for me dear heart that i may abide in him when isoult came downstairs from the careful perusal of her letter she heard dr thorpes voice in the hall and soon perceived that her husband and he were deep in religious conversation softly jack dr thorpe was saying as she entered methinks thou art somewhat too sweeping we must have priests man though they need not be ill and crafty men nor see i aught so mighty wrong in calling the lords table an altar truly myself i had liefer say table yet would i not by my good will condemn such as do love that word altar half the mischief that hath arisen in all these battles of religion now raging hath come of quarrelling over words and tis never well to make a martyr or an hero of thine adversary i have no mind to make a martyr of you my dear old friend answered avery in whatsoever signification i see well what you would be at though i see not with you and i would put you in mind by your leave that while true charity cometh of god there is a false charity which hath another source but this is to split straws jack said the doctor i pray you pardon me replied he but i think not so i know doctor you do incline more toward the lutheran than i and therefore tis like that such matters may seem smaller unto you than to me but when i incline toward the truth broke in dr thorpe bluntly we will both strive our best so to do friend gently answered avery but as i was about to say when you come to look to the ground of this matter you shall see it if i blunder not greatly to be far more than quarrelling over words or splitting of straws the calling of men by that name of priest toucheth the eternal priesthood of the lord christ as how queried the old man resting his hands on his staff and looking avery in the face as thus said he cast back your eyes i pray you to the times of the old jewish laws and tell me wherefore they lacked so many priests as all the sons of aaron should needs be i mean of course so many at one time why man one at once should have been crushed under the work answered dr thorpe if one man had been to slay solomon his twentytwo thousand sacrifices he should not have made an end by that day month good then the lesser priests were needed because of the insufficiency of the high priest for all that lacked doing that i allow said dr thorpe after some meditation see you what you allow friend avery answered softly if then the lesser priests be yet needed it must be by reason that the high priest is yet insufficient and the sacrifice which he offered is yet incomplete nay nay jack nay cried the old man much moved and shaking his head it must be so dear friend to what good were those common and ordinary priests save to aid the high priest in that which being but a man he might not perform alone could the high priest have sufficed alone what need were there of other but our high priest sufficeth and hath trodden the winepress alone his sacrifice is perfect is full is eternal there needeth no repeatingnay there can be no repeating thereof what do we then with priests now where is their sacrifice and a priest that sacrificeth not is a gainsaying of words friend whoso calleth him a priest now by that word denieth the sufficiency of the lord jesus and whoso calleth the table an altar began dr thorpe is guilty of the same sin pursued he the same affront unto the majesty of him that will not give his glory to an other they mean it not so i verily believe responded dr thorpe a little uneasily they mean assuredly to do him honour and he can see the difference said avery tenderly betwixt the denial of peter that loved him and the betrayal of judas that hated him our eyes are rarely fine enough for that more than once or twice had the judgment lain with us we had i think condemned peter and quitted judas i would all this variance betwixt lutherans and gospellers might cease resumed dr thorpe rather bitterly when we should be pointing our spears all against the enemy we are bent on pricking of each other a vain wish friend answered he so far as i can see that hath been ever since the world began and will last unto the worlds end i am not so fond as to look for christs kingdom until i see the king the fair angel of peace flieth in his train but methinks never out of it it seemeth said dr thorpe as though the less space there were betwixt my doctrine and thine the more bitterly must thou and i wrangle commonly it is so replied avery and while these real battles be fighting pursueth he betwixt christs followers and christs foeswhat a sight is it to see the followers dividing them on such matters aswhether childre shall be baptised with the cross or no whether a certain garment shall be worn or no whether certain days shall be kept with public service or no tush it sickeneth a man with the whole campaign both rose but after his farewell dr thorpe broke out again as though he could not let the matter drop do the fools think asked the old man that afore the angels will open the gate of heaven unto a man they fall aquestioning himto wit whether salt were used at his baptism whether his body were buried looking toward the east or the west whether when he carried his bible he held it in his right hand or his left dolts idiots patches fools it should do me a relief to duck every man of them in the tamar and cause them to swallow a dose of physic at afterward laughed avery it were hemlock then said dr thorpe grimly nay friend not so bad as that methinks but shall i give you one dose of a better physic than any of yours by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one toward another how are they to know it now said dr thorpe despairingly how are they to know it well i know not maybe thou art not so faroff jack but for all other i know and away he went shaking his grey head lady frances and mr monke were married when the summer came john avery and isoult were invited to the wedding and philippa sent a special message requesting that their little kate might be included for said she arthur shall be a peck of trouble and an he had one that he might play withal he should be the less list thee sweet heart thou art bidden to a wedding said jennifer to kate what is a wedding inquired fouryearold kate in her gravest manner is it a syllabub ay sweet heart tis a great syllabub full of sugar answered jennifer laughing that is as it may be mrs jennifer observed dr thorpe who was present i have known that syllabub full of vinegar that is methinks a true proverbif christ be not asked at the match he will never make one at the marriagefeast and tis a sorry feast where he sitteth not at the table i think he shall not be absent from this said isoult softly so kate went to crowe with her parents but her baby brother walter a year old was left behind in charge of jennifer the evening after their arrival the bride took isoult apart and rather to her surprise asked her if she thought that the dead knew what was passing in this world to such a question there was but one answer isoult could not tell isoult she said her eyes filling with tears i would not have him know of this if it be so and can that be right and good which i would not he should know isoult needed not to ask her who he was nay sweet heart said she thinkest thou he would any thing save thy comfort and gladness he is passed into the land where saith david all things are forgottento wit i take it all things earthly and carnal all things save god and when ye shall meet again in the body it shall be in that resurrection where they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are equal unto the angels all things forgotten she faltered hath he forgot me they must sleep then that is a kind of forgetting but if i were awake and witful i never could forget him it were not i that did so let us leave that with god beloved answered isoult o isoult she murmured her tears beginning to drop fast i would do gods will and leave all to him but is this gods will thou little knowest how i am tortured and swayed to and fro with doubt it was easier for thee that hadst but a contract to fulfil isoult remembered the time before she had ever seen her husband when it did not look very easy she scarcely knew what she ought to answer she only said dear heart if thou do truly desire to do only gods will methinks he will pardon thee if thou lose thy way it looketh unto me at times she said as if it scarce could be right seeing it should lift me above want and set me at ease this was a new thought to isoult and she was puzzled what to say but in the evening she told john and asked his advice much to her astonishment he usually gentle pulled to the casement with a bang is that thine answer jack said isoult laughing somewhat like it answered he drily tis no marvel that ill men should lose the good way when the true ones love so much to walk in byepaths thou riddlest jack said isoult tell me dear heart he answered doth god or satan rule the world god ruleth the world without doubt said she but if satan spake sooth unto our lord he hath the power of the glory of it did satan ever speak sooth thinkest he replied smiling somewhat bitterly howbeit to leave that pointdoth god or doth satan mete out the lives of gods people and give them what is best for them god doth assuredly said she well said answered he then according unto this doctrine when god giveth his child a draught of bitter physic he may with safety take and drink it but when he holdeth forth a cup of sugared succades sweetmeats that must needs be refused is it so jack wonderingly cried isoult there be that think so he made answer but i had scarce accounted my lady frances one ere now set the thing afore her in that light this is the self spring whence cometh all the monasteries and nunneries and anchorites cells in all the world is god the author of darkness and not of light doth he create evil and not good tell her when the lord holdeth forth an honeycomb he would have her eat it as assuredly as when he giveth a cup of gall into her hand he meaneth she should drink it and methinks it can scarce be more joyful to him to watch her drink the gall than eat the honeycomb the last words were uttered very tenderly when isoult told frances what john had said the tears rose to her eyes o isoult have i been wronging my god and father she said in a quivering voice i never meant to do that tell him so sweet heart answered isoult isoult thought her husband was right when on the following day she came across the text the lord that hath pleasure in the prosperity of his people but in her innocent way she showed it to john and asked him if he thought it meant that it was a pleasure to the lord himself to bestow happiness on his people john smiled at her as he often did sweet heart he answered doth it please or offend thee when thou dost kiss kate and comfort her for some little trouble and she stayeth her crying and smileth up at thee why jack tis one of my greatest pleasures answered isoult very gravely and tenderly he answeredas one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you on the th of june isoult avery wrote in her diary the churchbells are making music in mine ears as i sit to write an hour gone frances and mr monke went forth no longer twain but one god go with her and bless her this dear sister of mine heart and comfort her for all she hath lostay as one whom his mother comforteth the ink was scarcely dry from this entry when philippa basset marched in with unrecognised step for her shoes were new why mrs philippa your new shoes wrought that i knew not your step said isoult with a smile new shoes said she yea in good sooth i flung both mine old ones after frank and had i had an hundred pairs in my cupboard i had sent them all flying the thought of a hundred pairs of shoes falling about was too much for isoults gravity one of them smote the nag on his tail continued philippa i warrant you it gave him a smart for i sent it with all my might tis a good omen thatsaving only that it might cause the beast to be restive believe you in omens mrs philippa answered isoult not one half so much as i do believe in mine own good sense said she yet i have known some strange things in my time well what thinkest thou of this match of franks i trust with all mine heart she may find it an happy and a comfortable was the reply ay maybe a scrap of happiness shall not hurt her overmuch said philippa in her dry way as to mr monke i will wish him none for methought from his face he were as full as he could hold and an he had some trouble he demeriteth it for having away frank and so away she went both laughing news that stirred every gospellers heart reached bradmond ere the christmas of the bloody statute was repealed and in every parish church by royal order a bible and a copy of the paraphrases of erasmus were set open for all the people to read but the repeal of the bloody statute ardently as she desired it was not without sad memories to isoult avery the act now abrogated had brought death four years before to one very dear to her heart and it was not in human nature for her to hear of its destruction without a sigh given to the memory of grace rayleigh in the churchyard at bodmin were two nameless gravesof a husband and wife whom that bloody statute had parted and who had only met at last in its despite and to die and when grace had closed the eyes of her beloved she lay down to her own long rest her work was finished in this world and very welcome was the summons to hercome up higher from her long heartwithering early gone she hath livedshe hath lovedher task is done yet how was it possible to wish her back back to pain and sorrow and fear and mournful memory of the faroff husband and the dead child back from the lighted halls of the fathers home to the bleak cold weary wilderness of earth surely with christ it was far better when isoult came in comforted after her visit to graces grave barbara her parlourmaid met her at the door mistress a letter came for you in all haste shortly after you went forth said she i had come unto you withal had i known whither you were gone isoult took the letter from barbaras hand on the outside was writtenthe energetic ancient form of our mild direction to be delivered immediatelya rather startling address to the postman haste haste for thy life haste with forebodings travelling in more than one direction isoult cut the ribbon which fastened the letter and broke the seal there were not a dozen lines written within but her heart sank like lead ere she had read half of them the letter was from crowe and was signed by mr george basset the eldest surviving son of lady lisle he desired john avery and his wife to hasten with all speed to crowe for lady lisle had been taken ill suddenly and dangerously and they feared for her life there was also an entreaty to bring dr thorpe if he could possibly come for at crowe there was only an apothecary doctors regularly qualified were scarce in those days all the scattered members of the family within reasonable distance had been summoned in as short a time as it was possible to be ready john and isoult set forth with dr thorpe who said he could accompany them without more than temporary inconvenience to any of his patients it was two days journey to crowe and isoults heart sank lower and lower as they approached the house but when they reached the end of the long lane which led to it they suddenly encountered at a turn in the road the writer of the letter which had summoned them it was an instant relief to see mr george basset smile and hold out his hand in welcome better news thank god he said at once my mother hath rested well these two nights past and is fairly amended this morrow i am glad with all mine heart this bout is well over it hath feared us no little as i can tell you with lighter hearts they rode to the door where isoult had no sooner alighted than she found herself drawn from behind into the arms of lady frances monke who had arrived the day before isoult followed her into the little parlour where in a large carved chair she saw a very stiff and rich silk dress and on looking a little higher she found that chair and silk were tenanted by mrs wollacombe lady lisles youngest daughter ah isoult art thou come inquired that young lady playing with her chatelaine i hope thou hast left thy childre behind these childre be such plagues hand me thine for a silver groat interrupted philippa coming in thou art welcome an thou choose to take them replied her sister they do but rumple my ruffs and soil my gowns they be for ever in some manner of mischievousness i cannot keep them out thereof for all i have two nursemaids and jack to boot thou art little like mall an thou add not thyself to the bargain answered philippa in her old mocking way isoult but for the pleasure of seeing thee i could be sorry i sent after thee my lady my mother is so sweetly amending thank all the saints for it that i am little pleased to have put thee to such charges and labour i pray you say no word of that mrs philippa said isoult for in very sooth it giveth me right hearty pleasure to see you dr thorpe continued philippa turning to him i am right glad to welcome you and i thank you with all mine heart that you are come will you grant us the favour of your skill though it be less needed than we feared and take the pain to come up with me to see my lady dr thorpe assenting she took him upstairs and the next minute mr monke coming in greeted his friends cordially then came lady ashley sweet and gentle as ever and afterwards sir henry ashley and mr wollacombe mrs philippa said isoult when she returned we will not be a charge on her ladyship jack and i will lie at the inn for assuredly she cannot lodge all us in this her house i thank thee truly dear heart responded philippa affectionately in good sooth there is not room for all howsoever we should squeeze us together wherefore we must need disparkle scatter us verily an we had here but james and nan there were not one of us lacking how fareth mr james returned isoult is he yet a priest he is now in london with my lord of winchester bishop gardiner answered philippa nay so far from priesthood that he is now on the eve of his wedding unto one mrs mary roper daughter of the wellknown margaret roper granddaughter of sir thomas more it was late in the evening before isoult could contrive to speak with dr thorpe in private and then she asked him to tell her frankly how he thought lady lisle better this time said he significantly think you as you did then she asked ay mrs avery said he sadly i think as i did after this isoult saw lady lisle herself but only for a moment when she struck her as looking very ill but philippa assured her that there could be no comparison with what she had been two days before the next morning isoult with lady frances lady ashley and philippa sat for an hour in the invalids chamber the conversation turned upon public affairs and at last they began to talk of the pulling down of the roods which philippa opposed while both frances and isoult pronounced them idols fight it out an ye will said the sick lady laughing feebly only outside of my chamber go thou down kate and fetch up mr monke first responded philippa for i am well assured my first blow should kill frank an she had not his help thus playfully they chatted for a while but isoult fancied that lady lisle was scarcely so angrily earnest in her opposition to the doctrines of the gospel as was generally her wont presently up came the untidy deb in all her untidiness to say that dinner was served and was parenthetically told by philippa that she was a shame to the family which of us would you with you mother asked frances why none of you she replied go down all children i lack nought i am going to sleep and she laid back her head on the pillow of her chair shall i not abide madam suggested lady ashley no child she answered when you come above ye shall find me asleep if all go well so seeing she preferred to be left alone they all went to dinner when they returned lady frances lady ashley and isoult went towards lady lisles chamber lady ashley opened the door softly and put her head in doth she sleep kate whispered frances softly said lady ashley withdrawing her head let us not disturb hershe is so sweetly sleeping sleeping ay a sleep that should have no waking from that sleep not the roaring of the winds not the thunder of the tempest not even the anguished voices of her children should ever arouse her again she had no priest after all said frances under her breath to isoult the same evening lady ashley added very softly she said we should find her asleep if all went well we found her asleep is it an omen that all did go well isoult could make no answer where honor plantagenet was buried no record remains to tell us unless it be some early entry in a parish register of cornwall or devon it might be in the family buryingplace of her own kindred the grenvilles of stow or it might be with her first husband sir john basset at umberleigh only it may be asserted without fear of contradiction that it was not with the royal lord whom she had so bitterly lamented and whose coffin lay with many another as illustrious as his own in the old norman chapel of the tower no stranger admixture can there be on earth than among those coffins crowding that norman chapelfrom traitors of the blackest dye up to saints and martyrs the first news which the averys heard after their return home was not encouraging to that religious party to which they belonged bishop gardiner had been set free and had gone back to his palace at farnham mr james basset accompanying him this was an evil augury for wherever gardiner was there was mischief but it soon appeared that somerset kept his eye upon the wolf and on his first renewed attempt upon the fold he was quietly placed again in durance meanwhile the leaven of reformation was working slowly and surely on candlemas day there were no candles in the chapel royal no ashes on ash wednesday no palms on palm sunday at pauls cross after eight years silence the earnest voice of hugh latimer was heard ringing and to its sound flocked such a concourse that the space round the cross could not hold them and a pulpit was set up in the kings garden at westminster palace where four times the number of those at the cross might assemble for eight years there had been a famine of the word of the lord in england and now men and women came hungering and ready to be fed perhaps if we had borne eight years famine we should not quite so readily cry out that the provisions are too abundant an outcry for short sermons has always hitherto marked the spiritual decadence of a nation behold what a weariness is it there is another inscription on the reverse side of the seal i have no pleasure in you saith the lord of hosts the english service began with the following easter confessionnot yet abolished yet so far relaxed as to be required of none who preferred to omit itwas made in english and the lords supper was also celebrated in english at the kings chapel isoult avery began to think that she was to spend the year in visiting she had not been long back from crowe when a letter reached her from her own home at wynscote inviting her to the wedding of her brother hugh with mrs alice wikes which was to take place on the fourteenth of may jennifer trevor shook her head in her most ominous style at the date but hugh though a sailor was nevertheless not at all superstitious so far as concerned the point in question and he had already sturdily declined to change the date selected by alice though half the gossips round wynscote prophesied all manner of consequent evil for a maiden of the sixteenth century alice also was remarkably free from the believing in omens and the observing of times so hugh and she were married on the fourteenth of may and isoult avery was never able to discover that any harm had come of it on arrival at wynscote they found the house full and running over not only the family who ordinarily occupied it were therenamely mrs barry the widowed mother henry barry the head of the house who was by calling a gentleman farmer and by inclination the gentleman without the farmer his wife margaret who would have made a better farmer than himself and his three exceedingly noisy and mischievous boys by name michael william and henry but these as i have said were not by any means all there was the bridegroom hugh who grumbled goodhumouredly at being banished to farmer northcotes for the night for there was no room for him except in the daytime there was bessy dennis the eldest sister and john dennis her husband and william nicholas anne and ellen their children no wonder that isoult told her husband in confidence that she did not expect to lose her headache till she reached home will barry was the incarnation of mischief and will dennis his cousin and namesake followed him like his shadow the discipline which ensued was of doubtful character for bessys two notions on the subject of rearing children were embodied in cakes or slaps as they were respectively deserved or rather as she thought they were while mr barrys ideas of education lay in very oracular exhortations stuffed with words of as many syllables as he had the good fortune to discover his wifes views were hardly better her interference consisted only in the invariable repetition of a formulacome now be good lads do which certainly did not err on the side of severity but the grandmother if possible made matters worse she had brought up her own children in abject terror and unanswering submission and nature as usual revenged herself by causing her never to cross the wills of her grandchildren on any consideration accordingly when will set fire to the barn let the pony into the beanfield and the cows into farmer northcotes meadow grandmother only observed quietly that boys will be boysan assertion which certainly could not be contradictedand went on spinning as before the amazement of isoult averywho had not previously visited home for some timewas intense her childhood had been a scene of obedience both active and passive a birchrod had hung behind the front door and nobody had ever known anne barry hesitate to whip a child if there were the slightest chance that he or she deserved it the benefit of the doubt being commonly given on the side of the birchrod and now to see these boyswild men of the woods as they wererush unreproached up to the inaccessible side of grandmother lay violent hands upon her inviolable hood kiss her as if they were thinking of eating her and never meet with any worse penalty than a figcake the devonshire name for a plumcakethis was the source of endless astonishment and reflection to isoult on the whole she congratulated herself that she had left kate and walter at bradmond the bride was a stranger to isoult she talked to bessy about her and found that lady rather looked down upon her she was all very well but ah these unended buts what mischief they make in this world of ours then isoult talked to hugh and found that if his description were to be trusted alice wikes would be no woman at all but an angel from heaven bessy offered to take her sister to visit the bride and isoult accepted the offer meanwhile she sketched a mental portrait of alice she would be short and roundfaced and merry the colour of her hair and eyes isoult discreetly left blank so three days before the wedding her future sistersinlaw called upon the bride they found alices mother mrs wikes busy with her embroidery and as soon as she saw who her guests were she desired mrs alice to be summoned after a little chat with mrs wikes upon things in general the door opened to admit a girl the exact opposite of isoults imaginary picture alice proved tall ovalfaced and grave the wedding was three days later and on sunday blue was the colour of the brides costume and favelcoloura bright yellowishbrownthat of the bridesmaids after the ceremony there was a banquet at wynscote and dancing and a maypole and a soaped pig and barleybreakan old athletic sport to some extent resembling prisoners base then came supper and the evening closed with hot cockles and blindhoodmanthe latter being blindmans buff and among all the company to none but john and isoult avery did it ever occur that in these occupations there was the least incongruity with the sabbath day for they only were gospellers and at that time the gospellers alone remembered to keep it holy rome strikes her pen through the third and fourth commandments if less notoriously yet quite as really as through the second the averys returned home about the th of may they had left all well and they found all well and neither they nor any one else saw on the horizon a little cloud like a mans hand which was ere long to break in a deluge of hail and fire upon devonshire and cornwall one evening in the beginning of june when john avery sat at the table making professional notes from a legal folio before him and isoult at work beside him was beginning to wonder why barbara had not brought the rearsupper a knock came at the door then the latch was lifted and mr anthony tremayne walked in heard you the news in bodmin was the question which followed close upon his greeting no answered john i have not been in bodmin for nigh a week nor hath any thence been here one master boddy the kings commissioner for chantries saith he came hither o friday and the folk be all up at bodmin saying they will not have the chantries put down and tis thought father giles is ahead of them i much fear a riot for the people are greatly aggrieved i pray god avert the same if his will is exclaimed isoult this was the beginning of the first riots in cornwall and devon there were tumults elsewhere but the religious riots were worst in these parts they began about the chantries the people disliking the visitation and from that they went to clamouring for the reenactment of the bloody statute on the th of june there were riots at bodmin and truro and father giles then priest at bodmin and a stout papist helped them to the best of his ability but on the th came the kings troops to bodmin and took father giles and others of the rioters whom they sent to london to be tried and about the th they reached truro where mr boddy the kings commissioner for the chantries had been cruelly murdered five days before for a little while after this all was quiet in bodmin but the end was not come yet father giles the priest of bodmin was hanged at london on the th of july for his share in the riots and government fondly imagined that the difficulty was at an end how fond that imagination was the events of the following year revealed anthony monke the eldest child of mr monke and lady frances was born in the summer of date unknown in june of that year a civil message from the protector reached bishop gardiner at farnham requesting him to preach at court on the th saint peters day following this message perturbed gardiner exceedingly james basset found him walking up and down his chamber his hands clasped behind him uttering incoherent words indicative of apprehension and this continued for some hours on the th the bishop reached london on the th he preached before the king and on the th he was in the tower probably the wily prelates conscience never very clear had already whispered the cause before he quitted farnham on the th of september at sudeley castle gloucestershire died the lutheran queen katherine parr she had taken a false step and had lived to mourn it neglecting the command not to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers she had married sir thomas seymour very shortly after king henrys death it can be no lack of charity to call a man an unbeliever a practical atheist at least whose daily habit it was to swear and walk out of the house when the summons was issued for family prayers poor katherine had all the piety on her own side but she had not to bear the penalty she had brought on herself long she left behind her a baby daughter mary seymour who was sent to the care of the duchess of suffolk for very soon after the queens death seymour was arrested and committed to the tower he died on tower hill on the th of march following that seymour was a bad man there can be no question whether he really were a traitor is much more doubtful the lutheran party accused his brother the protector of having brought about his death it might be so yet any evidence beyond probability and declamation is lacking it was somersets interest to get rid of his brother therefore he is responsible for his death this may be assertion but it surely is not argument meanwhile in high places there was a leaven quietly working unperceived as yet which was ere long to pervade the whole mass the government of edward the sixth had come into power under the colours of the gospel the protector himself was an uncompromising gospeller and though many lords of the council were lutherans they followed at first in his wake there was one member of the council who never did so nearly fifty years before that day henry the seventh whose kingcraft was at least equal to that of james the first had compelled the young heiress of lisle elizabeth grey to bestow her hand upon his unworthy favourite edmund dudley it is doubtful whether she was not even then affianced to sir arthur plantagenet afterwards lord lisle whose first wife she eventually became but henry tudor would have violated all the traditions of his house had he hesitated to degrade the estate or grieve the heart of a son of the house of york this illmatched pairthe covetous edmund and the gentle elizabeth were the parents of four children the first being john dudley who was born in it is of him i am about to speak his countenance from a physiognomists point of view might be held to announce his character the thick obstinate lips the cruel cold blue eyes intimated with sufficient accuracy the disposition of the man like all men who succeed dudley set before him one single aim in his case it was to dethrone somerset and step into his place he held too in practice if not in theory the diabolical idea that the end sanctifies the means and to hold that view is to say in another form i will be like the most high such was john dudley and such the goal at which he aimed and he just touched it his hand was already stretched forth to grasp the glittering thing which was in his eyes the crown imperial of his world and then gods hand fell on him out of heaven and he was brought down to hell to the sides of the pit we shall see how this man prospered as the tale advances how he said in his heart there is no god but to isoult avery it was a standing marvel how john dudley could be the brother of frances monke and the distance between them was as wide as from hell to heaven for it was the distance between a soul sold to the devil and a temple of the holy ghost the first introduction of kate avery to the grave and decorous behaviour required in church was made on the third of february suffice it to say that isoult was satisfied with the result of the experiment the new priests name was edmund prideaux and he was a lutheran coming home from church john and isoult fell in with the tremaynes and were told by mr tremayne that all was now settled and there was no fear of any further riots some weeks later robin and arbel tremayne again rode over to bradmond for fourhours arbels favourite was walter but robin was fonder of kate who on her part was greatly attached to him while they were there dr thorpe came in when robin and arbel were gone home the old man remarked in confidence to john avery that he did not by any means share mr tremaynes opinion that all was settled at bodmin he thought rather that the present tranquillity was like the crust of a volcano through which the fiery force might at any moment burst with little warning that which finally broke the crust seemed at first a very little matter a proclamation came from the king permitting landowners to enclose the waste lands around within certain limitations and the old socialist spirit which is inherent in man rose up in arms at this favour granted to the bloated aristocratsthis outrage upon the rights of the people for the three famous tailors of tooley street who began their memorial we the people of england had many an ancestor and many a successor mr tremayne enclosed a piece of common behind his garden john avery enclosed nothing the storm that fell swept away not only the guilty but as is generally the case the innocent suffered with them chapter three going forth o day of endless brightness dawn oer these darkened skies o land of changeless beauty break on these weary eyes o home whence no outgoing shall blind us with our tears o rest and peace o life and love o summer of all years the night of the fourth of july came hot and sultry without a breath of wind isoult avery had sunk to sleep after a weary day the very warmth brought languor and walter had been naughty and peevish needing all her patience and mr tremayne had had a large party to supper of which she had been one and a multitude of little worries had pressed upon herthose worries which seem too insignificant to repeat or care about yet form in the mass a large portion of our troubles hardly knowing it herself her last thought before she slept had been a prayer for rest but it was not rest that she really needed and therefore it was not rest she was to have our father giveth us often what we ask but always what we need from a troubled dream isoult was now aroused by a sound which at first wove itself into her dream and made her imagine herself in the great hall of the palace of westminster where carpenters were busy pulling down the throne knock knock knock isoult hardly roused herself enough to recognise what the reality was which answered to her imaginary carpenters and john avery slept calmly the knocking was repeated more loudly jack said isoult at lastmuch too faintly to arouse any but a very light sleeper again came the knocking and this time a voice with it mr avery isoult thoroughly awake at last sat up and succeeded after a minute in bringing john to consciousness the knocking went on john sprang up and threw open the window who are you and what do you lack he called to the unseen visitant below let me in and in haste for gods sake cried a voice in answer which both the listeners immediately recognised as robin tremaynes there is somewhat gone wrong said john and hurrying down he unbarred the door and let in robin isoult followed as quickly as she could why robin lad what is the matter she cried in dismay what can ail thee is somewhat amiss at tremayne for robins face was white with terror and he trembled from head to foot and his clothes were soiled and torn all that can ail me in this world murmured the poor lad dropping upon the settle there is no tremayne the enclosure men came thither yestereven and burned every brick of it to the ground the rascals exclaimed avery and what came of thy father and mother and sister poor robin the lad looked up with tearless eyes i am all of us isoult was silent this was a sorrow beyond human comforting it had been mockery to bid him be of good cheer then my father had enclosed as you know resumed robin in a low voice and these rioters would no enclosures would to god he had let it alone murmured avery under his breath god would not mr avery quietly answered robin or he had let it alone and dropping his head upon his hands the poor boy rocked himself to and fro silently he seemed very faint and weary yet isoult doubted if he could eat but she fetched a jug of milk and set it before him bidding him drink if he could it would choke me mrs avery he answered but you are exceeding good unto me poor child said avery pityingly thou wilt be safe here at the least i have not enclosed i thank god i thought you would take me in for a few days said the lad until i may see my way afore me and win some little heart to pursue it thy way shall be my way robin replied avery tenderly twenty years and more gone when i was a stripling about thy years thy father helped me unto my calling with a gift of twenty pounds which he never would give me leave to pay him under thy leave i will pay it thee you are exceeding good he said again not lifting his head and how didst thou get away poor robin asked isoult i dropped from the window said he my chamber window was low built and when i heard the horrid shouts and yells at the front of the house i jumped out at the back and hid me in the bushes beyond and there not daring to creep away till they were gone lest they should discover me i heard and saw all then the bushes took not fire suggested avery nay said he the fishpond lieth atween them and the house mind you he was silent a little while then he said softly under his breathmr avery when i saw the fiends lay hold upon mother and arbel i thought god must surely strike from heaven for us but when ten minutes later i saw the flames shooting up to the welkin i thanked him in mine heart that he had taken them to his rest ere that but robin lad didst thou not strike for them cried avery who could not bear anything that seemed like cowardice should i think you he made answer in that low hopeless tone that goes to the heart there were seventy or more of the enclosure men i could but have died with them maybe i ought to have done that i think it had cost less forgive me robin said john laying his hand on the lads shoulder poor heart i meant not to reproach thee i spake hastily therefore unadvisedly let me have thee abed poor robin said isoult tis but one of the clock canst thou sleep thinkest sometime i count i shall again he answered but an i were to judge by my feeling i should think i never could any more time healeth whispered avery rather to his wife than robin but the lad heard him god doth mr avery he said and they are with god art thou less robin asked avery tenderly god is with me that is the difference he replied robin tremayne had always been a quiet thoughtful boy and even when the first gush of his agony was over there remained upon him a gentle grave pensiveness which it appeared as if he would never lose the next day proved as uneventful as other days at bradmond no rioters came near them in the evening dr thorpe appeared when the old man saw robin he cast up his hands and thanked god lad said he i thought thou wert dead i count god hath somewhat for me to do answered robin but if he hath not i would i were hush thee robin dear said isoult uneasily what wouldst thou be robin inquired kate her eyes wide open dead and buried answered he then may i be dead and buried too she asked nay kate not so cried isoult in dismay it will not do robin said dr thorpe smiling and his face growing grave he pursued lad god setteth never too hard a lesson nor layeth on us more than we are able to bear too hard for what answered robin there have been that have had lessons set that they might not learn and live is that not too hard nay child dr thorpe answered if it be not too hard to learn and keep hold on eternal life the lesser life of this little world is of no matter nor the happiness of it i suppose said robin gloomily the plant god careth to grow now in us is holiness he answered that other fair flower happiness he keepeth for us in his own garden above where it is safer than in our keeping tis but stray fragments and single leaves thereof that find their way down hither i think so said robin bitterly lad lad kick not against the pricks exclaimed dr thorpe more sternly gods will is the best for us his way is the safe way and the only way easy to say so answered robin slowly and it was easy to think soyesterday morning dr thorpe looked on him and did not reply o robin cried kate running to him from the door the sun is shining again it was raining so fast all the morn and now the sun is come and all the little drops are so pretty in the sunshine come and see they are so pretty shining on the roses robin rose to follow her with the first smile though a mournful one that isoult had seen flit across his face kate is the better comforter dr thorpe and hath learned the sweeter lesson he said at least she hath learned it me you would have me count the chastening joyous even at this present gods word pointeth to the joyousness to come blessed are they that mournfor they shall be comforted and he went after kate for a few days more after robins coming all was quiet no one came to inquire for him and they began to hope the worst was over but late on the sunday evening which was the seventh of july suddenly there came a rapping on the door and there to the surprise of all stood dr thorpe welcome good friend said avery but your occasion should be great to have you forth this even so it is said he is it not bedtime mrs avery in very deed doctor she answered we were going above but now leave the lad and the maids go then said he and you and jack bide a space so the maids and robin departed what is it doctor asked avery when they were gone what it is jack said dr thorpe who sat in the corner with his hands upon his knees is a great burning mountain that is at this moment quiet what it may be is a great rushing and overflowing of the fiery matter that shall deal death all around and what it will bethe lord god knoweth and he only you speak in parables doctor replied avery the safest matter to speak at this time answered he you look for a new riot an i take you rightly hardly for a riot the other answered is the door fast i bolted it after you said avery doctor thorpe drew his chair closer and spoke in a low earnest voice not a riot he said say an uprisinga civil wara mighty rebellion of all that be under against all that be above men that will know no ruler and bear no curblittle afraid to speak evil of dignities or to do evil against them we are and there is none beside us yea we are the people and wisdom shall die with us there be such spirits alway answered avery but i thank god rarely so many come together as shall do a mischief there shall be mischief enough done in cornwall and devon within the next month or twain said dr thorpe gloomily i see more than you and i am come to tell you of somewhat that nearly toucheth both you and me a year gone or thereabout i was ariding from bodmin on the truro way when i was aware of a little ragged lad that sat by the roadside the tears arolling down his not over clean face i drew bridle and asked the lad what ailed him he told me his mother did lie at deaths door not far thence hath she any doctor or apothecary quoth i nay saith he neither the priest nor the apothecary would come without money and father hath not a penny well i light from mine horse and throwing his bridle athwart mine arm i bade the lad lead me to his mother for i was a physician and could maybe do her some good i found her under an hedge with nought save a ragged rug to cover her twain other children beside clamouring for bread and her husband a rugged sullenfaced man weaving of rushes for baskets all they were darkfaced folk and were i take it of that egyptian gipsy crew that doth overrun all countries at times i saw in a moment that though beyond their skill her disorder was not with gods blessing beyond mine yet it did require speedy remedy to serve her the physic that i fetched for her quickly gave her ease and i was something astonied at the blessings which the husband did heap upon me when i departed from them methought though he were rugged of face yet he must be a man that had some power of affection well the woman amended and all they left that part i heard no more of them sithence until late last night as i was ariding home very nigh the same place all suddenly an hand was laid upon my bridle an highwayman thought i and i remembered that i had little money upon me but in the stead of easing me of my purse mine highwayman put unto me a strange questionwhat is your name and where dwell youverily said i i might ask the same of you but sithence i am in no wise ashamed neither of my name nor my dwellingplace know you that the one is stephen thorpe and the other is bodmin what more would youyour callinga physicianenough quoth my strange questioner i pray you to alight from your horse and have no fear of me i will do you no harm i would not hurt you for a thousand pieces in good red gold i want neither your money howsoever much it be nor your valuables that may be on you only i pray you let us two whisper together a seasonin good sooth said i i have nought to whisper unto youbut i have to you saith he and what i say must not be spoken aloud you would trust me if you knew what i would havewell friend quoth i for a friend metrusteth you be i will do as you bid me all the money i have upon me is but some few shillings and to them if you lack you are welcome for valuable matter i carry none and i myself am an old man no longer of much service unto any if you desire me to ply my trade of healing i am content but i warn you that by murdering of me you should gain little beside an evil conscienceso with that i lighted downthrow the bridle on your arm saith he and follow meso linking his arm in mine he drew me for it was pitch dark and how he found his way i know not aside from the road unto a small forsaken and ruinated hut that stood on the commonstand where you be a moment quoth he and striking the tinder he lit a rush candle now know you me saith he not a whit better than afore quoth ihe blew out the candleyou have forgot my face he saith mind you a year gone ministering unto a dying woman as was thought in this place under an hedge whereby you did recover her of her maladyi know you now said i you are that womans husband then you are aware answereth he that i would do you no hurtsay on quoth isuffer me saith he to ask you certain questionsso be it said ithen heis your house in bodmin your ownit is so answered i marvelling if he were about to ask me for mine housesell it quoth he and quicklywherefore answered ii passed no word touching your questions quoth he grimlyin good sooth said i this is a strange matter for a man to be bidden to sell his house and not told whereforeyou shall see stranger things than that he answered ere your head be hoarier by twain sennight from nowwell say on quoth ihave you pursueth he any money lent unto any friend or set out at usury you were best to call it in if you would see it at allfriend said i my money floweth not in so fast that my back lacketh it not so soon as it entereth my pursethe better quo hegood lack said i i alway thought it the worsethe worse afore the better now he answered but once morehave you any friend you would save from periland iwhy i would save any from peril that i saw like to fall thereinthen quoth he give them privily the counsel that i now give you if the sun find you at bodminyea any whither in cornwall or devontwain sennights hence he shall not set on you alive speak not another word mount your horse and goi strave however to say another word unto him but not one more would he hearken go he crieth again so resolute and determinedly that i did go now i fear greatly that this man did tell me but truth and that some fearful rising of the commons is abrewing i shall surely take his counsel and go hence what say you jack shall we go together there was dead silence for a minute isoults head was in a whirl at last her husband said slowly what sayest thou isoult jack she replied whither thou art will i be and that shall bewhither asked dr thorpe it must be no whither within cornwall or devon but we have not enclosed objected avery answering rather his thoughts than his words i doubt he answered whether they shall wait to ask that for me avery resumed i have friends in london and isoult likewise and if i thought it should be long ere we may turn again thither should i look to go rather than otherwhere but an it be for a few weeks it should be unworth so long a journey weeks cried dr thorpe say months jack or years for my part i look not to see bodmin again but there be thirty years betwixt thee and me in that case said he and methinks you have the righti say london if isoult agree therewith there should be room in that great city i account for both you and me to ply our several callings whither thou wilt be it jack said his wife softly but mother and hugh and bessy and frances at potheridge and mrs philippa at crowewhat is to come of them and who shall warn them dr thorpe shook his head little time for all that mrs avery answered he send an you will to the two placespotheridge and crowe but leave potheridge to warn wynscote and wynscote to warn matcott and bindon let robin take the brown horse suggested avery and ride post with a letter from thee to mrs philippa and tom the white nag and i will send him likewise to mr monke i might have gone myself to one of the twain but nay jack bide thou with me entreated isoult fearfully well said answered dr thorpe well avery replied there seemeth little time to choose or bowne prepare us but as the italians have it che sara sara what will be will be when set we forth doctor now if we could answered dr thorpe significantly preparations for the journey were made in haste and without waiting for daylight robin and tom were sent on horseback to crowe and potheridge starting with the earliest gleam of dawn isoult summoned jennifer barbara and ursula the cook and asked whether they would cast in their lot with hers or remain in cornwall jennifer answered that she feared the journey more than the commons and the fourth of july was a very unlucky day on which to commence any undertaking she would stay where she was ursula and barbara both of whom had been with their mistress ever since her marriage replied that they would go with her now nor have i any of mine own that i may well go unto ursula added mine only brother dwelleth in somerset and he is but an husbandman with little wages and a great sort of childre and beside him i have no kin my mother is wed again barbara explained and my father that now is should grudge to be troubled with me and my sister that is newly wedded hath but one chamber in a poor mans house i will hie after you mistress an you will have me this question being settled another arose who should be left at bradmond tom was too necessary for the journey besides which he was ignorant of the arts of reading and writing and would not be able to send word how matters went on after their departure in this emergency while isoult and john were talking over the subject barbara presented herself with a deprecatory courtesy or rather lout mistress said she if you and our master bethink not yourselves readily of any that should serve for to dwell here in your absence i would you would think on marian my sister and her husband fictitious persons they should i do know be right willing to be set in charge and simon pendexter that is my brother can right well read and write for he hath been a schoolmaster and is though i say it a sad and sober honest man such as i do know you should be willing to use in this matter this information settled the question barbara was despatched to ask simon and marian if they would be willing to come and she returned with a reply that they were not only willing but thankful for the offer and had no fear of the rioters in such arrangements time passed on until the friday evening when robin reached home from crowe bringing philippa basset with him she expressed her gratitude for the warning sent and said that she was ready to go to london as for crowe she said tis arthur his house not mine and to me all places be nigh alike i set some seeds that i looked to see come up this next spring but that is all i have to lose save an old gown or twain and the like and added she turning away her head they will not harm what alone i care formy dead on the sunday morning came dickon dr thorpes man with a message from his master desiring that all should be ready to set out by five oclock on the following morning bodmin said he was plainly ill at ease men gathered together in knots in the streets and the like with all manner of rumours and whisperings about and if they were to go go they must but tom is not yet back said isoult it was settled however that it would not do to wait for him but to their relief two or three hours before the time fixed for starting tom came he brought letters from mr monke to john and from lady frances to isoult but he arrived alone mr monke thanked them heartily for their loving care and would readily undertake to warn wynscote and combe but he declined to join them potheridge was well fortified with walls and moat and he had seven ablebodied menservants and double the number of tenants who could be called within at a few minutes notice the house was well provisioned and his armoury equipped and he ended his letter by sayingmy trust is in god you do well to go yet methinks i do as well to abide metrusteth all shall be well said isoult with a sigh yet if i might have known how it should be with them i had gone with an heart the lighter a wilful man responded philippa let him be lady frances said in her letter dear heart god is not gone from devon fear not for us only pray and wheresoever we be and howsoever let us abide in him at last the preparations were completed simon and marian pendexter had been installed in office with orders to write in a month three sumpter mules were laden with the family luggage and the last farewells were taken the party mounted their horses first rode john avery on bayard with his wife behind him on the pillion then on blanche a white mare came ursula with kate strapped before her on the black farm mare which had no particular name rode tom with barbara behind and walter before him and lastly on a wiry white nag came robin with philippa on the pillion so they moved slowly away from the home which for aught they knew they might never see again it was a trial which cost isoult avery many tears barbara too wept but no one else only when philippa spoke it was in that short constrained manner with which some people hide sorrow little kate was in high glee until she saw her mother weep and then she looked grave and thoughtfulfor about ten minutes when they reached the end of the lane which led into the high road from bradmond they found dr thorpe seated on his bay horse awaiting them behind on a brown nag was dickon with a bundle strapped at his back come friends mine cried dr thorpe if you urge on your horses no faster we shall sleep on the common tonight then as bayard came up with him he added in a lower tone it was too true jack fourteen houses were sacked in bodmin last night of them that had enclosed mostly but not all he answered they opened the cellars and set the conduits aflowing with wine then having well drunken marched to the church where they cast the new servicebook into a bonfire note and at after surrounded father prideaux a fictitious person his house shouting and singing in uproarious wise calling upon him to come forth and set himself at their head a fair body to be head of by gods providence he was not within but it was full two hours ere they would depart for all the handmaids telling of them that her master was from home at long last they did go thence and down the streets shrieking and yelling like fiends and is it over think you suggested avery is it begun answered dr thorpe tidings came yestreen of riots in somerset and jack the commons have taken exeter taken exeter cried john and isoult in a breath taken exeter repeated he what think you now lord have mercy upon us said isoult under her breath a letter is come from the king pursued dr thorpe exhorting the commons to obedience and patience and they shall receive redress of their griefs philippa and robin now came ambling alongside for here they could ride three abreast but what profess the commons to be their griefs said isoult for i did never yet rightly understand firstly said dr thorpe they do allege the young age of the king and the having a protector over them what foolishness exclaimed avery would they have the king grow unto manhood in a day or think they that he abideth a child of set purpose then pursueth dr thorpe their second matter is the stablishing of lutheranism within the realm they would fain see the mass set up again and have the six articles back the bloody statute cried isoult god forgive them and the third matter is the enclosures added he methinks men are not over weighted with religion that be so ready to pull it down remarked philippa that hangeth on whether it be truth or error replied he nay said she you draw lines too fine for me what i learnt in my youth is truth enough for me so do many think said avery but there is yet an other question mrs basset which they shall some day have to front though they will not now and that is whether it be truth enough for god but to that she made no answer the fugitives journeyed as quietly as possible yet as quickly as was safe until the saturday and then about four oclock as they gained the ridge of a hill dr thorpe who rode first suddenly drew bridle back all of you cried he hide you behind the rocks yonder an immense crowd of men is in the valley advancing this way if these be the commons god be our help for we can have none other we can sell our lives dearly at least said avery looking to his matchlock we that be men were best to light off our horses pursued dr thorpe and leave the women thereon that they may fly the faster if need be set them and the childre behind and thou jack with me and tom and dickon stand out afore they shall fly cruel slow on yon old black jade said tom grinning master inquired dickon who was a somerset man if they catch i what shall they do to i hold your idle tongues answered dr thorpe sternly and see that your arms are in good order robin shall we count thee a man or as one of the childre you shall not count me to be guarded but to guard said robin stoutly well said replied dr thorpe truly good doctor on my word interposed philippa but you shall not count me as a sely woman i have handled a matchlock afore now and i can knock down a man an i have hold of a poker i stand to the front an it like you well said brave heart answered he so do so set they awaited the death that might be at hand and prayed to god to guard them all were brave enough but dickon and he shivered like an aspen leaf thou whitelivered our ancestors believed literally that cowards had white livers dolt cried dr thorpe sharply and took the matchlock out of his hands go behind for a child as thou art and give me his matchlock said philippa take it he answered you are ten times over the man that he is slowly they heard the tramp of feet advancing nearer and nearer all were silent now the feet gained the ridge of the hillthey crossed itthey came forward on the road all at once avery who was next that side threw down his matchlock with a shout forward friends cried he triumphantly these are no rebelsthese are the kings majestys troops see you not the royal lions flying at the van god be with the armies of england the revulsion was great from such terror to comfort joy and thankfulness all came forward the leader of the army looked at the group stayed his horse and lifted his visor a cry of joy broke from philippa and isoult for they saw beneath his helm a face that they had known well in the old calais days mrs philippa basset exclaimed he in amazement at the least if mine eyes bewray me not and mrs barry god keep you both how come you here and do you lack aid your eyes be true men my lord grey de wilton note said philippa and right glad are mine to light on no unfriendlier face truly at the first we took you for rebels and had it not been for your coats and your standard i had picked you off with my matchlock ere i wist who it were lord grey laughed merrily nay said he we are marching against the rebels by the kings gracious commission what may i do for you my mistresses whither go you we be on our way to london answered philippa if it like the saints to have us there it may like the troops maybe the better said lord grey well i will then send with you certain picked soldiers good men and true to see you safe on your way if god permit we thank you heartily and will accept of your goodness with a very good will she replied and what news now very ill news answered he the rebels be up all through somerset and kent and essex and lincoln and norfolk and suffolk thanks be to our lady cried she none of those lie in our way to london laud be to god therefor answered lord grey gravely yet be wary how soon may dorset and wilts be up likewise my lord of northampton layeth siege to norwich and ere this i trust is my lord russell and his troops around exeter but our work is not yet done by many a days labour i pray you noble sir asked dr thorpe if i may aventure myself to speak unto your lordship what think you of this rebellion shall it be a thing easily crushed or a more graver matter i know not said lord grey turning his head to the speaker it should seem a very grave matteranother jack cades rebellion yet it may be subdued readily i know not this only i knowthat unless the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain lord grey turning called to him one of his officers and spoke quietly with him a moment then turning again to philippa he said look you here mrs basset ant like you i will send with you twelve picked men that shall be a guard unto you and shall not leave you until by gods allowing they have you safe in london and there come pursued he to the captain of the men report yourself unto sir francis jobson and await his order staytake with you a token lord grey drew a ring from his finger and gave it to that officer who seemed to be in authority as captain over the twelve men forming the guard then bowing low he bade god keep them and the troops marched forward at his giving the word the little group journeyed on towards dorset their guard marching before with their halberds in their hands the captain a fictitious person had some talk with dr thorpe and avery he told them he was a london man and that his mothera widowdwelt in the minories and both were gospellers so in due time they reached dorchester and thence salisbury both which they found quiet and at windsor they heard a rumour that norwich had yielded which on coming to london they found true they heard further that exeter was taken by lord russell and that lord grey de wilton had reached cornwall the captain of their guard took them to his mother mistress brent fictitious persons whom they found a pleasant and pious woman the next day they began looking for a house and being inclined to settle in the minories note mrs brent told them of a comfortable house which was empty next door to her own john and isoult went to see it liked it and took it philippa went to her sister lady elizabeth jobson in the tower and dr thorpe agreed to remain with the averys until he should make up his mind what to do perhaps it was difficult to make up for without any regular agreement on the subject yet to everybodys satisfaction they formed one family thereafter meantime there was sad work at exeter the lord privy seal john russell afterwards first earl of bedford who was sent there with his troops finding his own forces fewer than the rebels stayed at honiton while the rebels besieged exeter and right valiantly the men of exeter kept their town king edward from whose diary these details are taken spells these names honington and outrie the rebels burnt the gates but those within kept them off by hot fire till they had made a rampart and when they were undermined they drowned the mine and the powder with water the lord privy seal hearing of their bravery endeavoured to go round a byeway to reinforce them but the rebels having spies discovered his movements and cut down all the trees between saint mary ottery and exeter lord russell then burnt the town intending to return home but the rebels held a bridge against him forcing him with his small band to fall upon them when he gained a great victory killing some hundreds of them and retreating homeward without any loss of his own men then lord grey came to his help and together they raised the siege of exeter at bodmin sir anthony kingston who was sent there hanged the mayor a fervent papist and father prideaux would have fared ill at his hands had not all the lutherans and gospellers in the town risen in his favour and testified that he had not joined with other priests in the rising for the priests urged and fomented all these risings but was a good protestant and faithful subject the fugitives were at first too busy to have much time for lamentation but when the pressure of constant occupation was relaxed and the furnishing and arranging of matters ended they began to feel a little like shipwrecked men thrown upon a strange coast isoult avery was astonished to find what a stranger she felt in london where she had lived some years with anne basset and the duchess of suffolk one afternoon in september she was peculiarly oppressed by this sense of solitude in a crowdthe most painful solitude of anybut was trying to bear up bravely she sat at her work with kate at her hornbook beside her when the door was unlatched and isoult heard her husbands wellknown voice saycome inyou shall see her now isoult rose to receive her unknown visitor he was a man of some fifty years or upwards neither stout nor spare but tall and of an especially stately and majestic carriage his face was bronzed as if with exposure to a southern sun his hair and eyes were dark and he had a long dark beard grave and deliberate in all his actions his smile was exquisitely sweet and his expression thoughtfully gentle isoult said her husband this is mr rose an ancient friend of mine and now parson of west ham nigh unto richmond he would be acquaint with thee and so would his wife and daughter isoult rose and louted to the visitor and gave him her hand and to her surprise kate who was commonly very shy with strangers went up at once to mr rose and suffered him to lift her upon his knee and kiss her i knew not you were a man so much to childres liking said avery methinks i never saw my little maid so friendly unto a stranger afore i love them dearly answered mr rose and i pray you mrs avery if it will please you to take the pain to visit my wife that you bring this little maid withal this was isoults first introduction to one of the most remarkable men of the sixteenth century not so perhaps as the world sees eminence but as god and his angels see it thomas rose was a devonshire man and had begun to preach about the same time as latimer he was one of the earliest converts of the reformation and was constantly and consistently persecuted by the papal party much of his life had been spent abroad to escape their machinations the entire history of this man was full of marvellous providences and hairbreadth escapes and it was to be fuller yet weary of dealing in this manner rome had at length tried upon him those poisoned shafts which she launched at many a gospellersuborning false witnesses to accuse him of uncommitted crimes mr rose stood the trial and came unscathed out of it isoult readily promised to visit mrs rose though she was slightly dismayed on afterwards hearing from john that mr rose had married a foreigner a protestant i trust she asked doubtfully for she knew little of foreigners and with the exception of a handful of lutherans and huguenots thought they were all papistswith a margin of course for jews turks heretics and infidels john laughed as if the question amused him exceedingly were it possible he responded that thomas roses wife should be any thing else the train of visitors was only just beginning when isoult came in from the market feeling very tired and overworked on the following morning she found philippa basset in her large chair looking very much at home while kate on her knee was chattering away to her with the utmost freedom well isoult was philippas greeting thou dost well to go acheapening of carrots and leave thy friends that come to visit thee to find none in the house that they know save this pointing to kate how dost thou dear heart the better to see you mrs philippa said she i will not ask how you do for you look rarely well verily i left more in the house than kate or i had taken her withal isoult dost thou mean to call me mistress all the days of thy life she asked in answer i mean to call you what it list you said isoult but truly you never gave me leave to do other and truly you never asked for it replied she howbeit take it now prithee for ever henceforward isoult thanked her and asked her if any news were abroad any news quotha she answered but a yard or twain hast heard that my lord protector is not in very good case nay cried isoult my lord protector what mean you mrs philippa this mrs avery answered she my lord protector being no lutheran but a gospeller is not over well liked of some that be lutherans and no gospellers and as for us poor catholics we never you know held him for a saint so this being the case this in thine ear isoulttis under benedicite under the seal of confession certain if not all of the kings council be resolved to be rid of my high and mighty lord and ere thou be ten days older i count thou shalt hear somewhat thereof i have so much from a good hand that can be trusted the name i utter not then said isoult be the catholics and lutherans conspiring together for this truth answered she they that be least christians of both you say well mrs philippa replied isoult do i so mrs avery she answered i cry you mercy said isoult philippa then if you will have it so ay i will have it so said she laughing but answered isoult what saith the kings highness thereto the king exclaimed she the king marketh but his twelfth birthday this month dear heart what can he know or an he spake who would heed him but said isoult we hear for ever of his highness sageness and wisdom such as tis said never had prince afore him did we not so of his father asked she with a short laugh there be alway that will sing loud hymns to the rising or risen sun sageness and wisdom forsooth of a lad of twelve years he may be as sage as he will but he will not match dr stephen gardiner yet awhile a shudder ran through isoult avery at the name of the deviser of the bloody statute but the danger of the protector was too serious a question to every gospeller not to be recurred to and prayed against it doth seem to me jack said isoult that evening when the story had been told as though the cause of the gospel should stand or fall with my lord protector what thinkest thou sweet wife he answered if my lord protector were the only prop of the gospel it had fallen long ago the prop of the gospel is not my lord or thy lord but the lord of the whole earth his strength is enough to bear it up i know that jack she said yet god worketh by means and my lord protector gone who else is there nay child answered dr thorpe is god so lately become unable of these stones to raise up children unto abraham shall he by whose word a nation shall be born in a day be too weak to strengthen the king in despite of his tender years or to raise up another man that shall follow in the wake of my lord protector i know god can do miracles said isoult somewhat despondingly for all but meis that thy thought sweeting asked avery smiling but where is there a man cried isoult how know i said dr thorpe some whither in the indies it may be but the lord shall surely fetch him thence when the time cometh prithee jack bid thy friend the hot gospeller to dinner and leave us see if he that i gather from thy talk to be mighty busy in public matters can find us a man for the time avery smiled and said he would ask mr underhill to dinner but isoult shook her head averring that neither dr thorpe nor even the hot gospeller could find a man for the time for some days at her husbands desire isoult had been on the lookout for a bowerwoman to replace jennifer she inquired from mrs brent and other neighbours but could nowhere hear of a satisfactory person on the sunday evening following philippas visit as they were coming home from saint botolphs the church which stood at the top of the minories isoult heard her name softly called from the crowd of dispersing worshippers she looked up into a pair of black pensive eyes which she knew to belong to an old frienda converted jewess who had been one of her bridesmaids but whom she had never met since that time the friends halted and clasped hands i knew not you were in this vicinage said esther in her grave manner but methought that face could belong to none other we dwell at this present in the minories said isoult and are but now come hither by reason of certain riots in the western parts and where dwell you i am now abiding she replied with a friend one mistress little until i may find conveniency to meet with a service for i have left the one and am not yet fallen in with the other and i am but now looking for a bowerwoman said isoult have you covenanted with any asked she quickly nay was the answer i have not yet fallen in with any with whom to covenant mrs avery will you take me she said earnestly nay answered isoult but will you come to me i had thought you should look for a much better service than mine i could not have a better methinks she responded with a rather sorrowful smile i would right fain come to you if that might be then it may be dear heart said isoult much moved by her urgency i would fainer have you than any which i do know unless it were annis holland that i have known from the cradle but should it like you to follow me into devon for we do look to return thither when the troubles are past i will follow you any whither answered she i care nothing where i am only thisthat i would liefer be out of london than in it so esther came and took up her quarters at the sign of the lamb every house in london had then its sign which served the purpose of a number meanwhile the clouds gathered more darkly over the only man in power excepting the boyking himself who really cared more for the welfare of england than for his own personal aggrandisement and it was not england which forsook and destroyed somerset it was the socalled lutheran faction to the majority of whom lutheranism was only the cloak which hid their selfish political intrigues there had been a time when somerset was one of them and had sought his own advancement as they now did theirs and the deserted regiment never pardons the deserter the faction complained that somerset was proud and selfwilled he worked alone he acted on his own responsibility he did not consult his friends this of course meant in the case of each member of the faction as such complaints usually do he did not consult me somerset might truthfully have pleaded in reply that he had not a friend to consult the court held no friend to him and worst of all his own home held none he had unquestionably a number of acquaintances of that class which has been well and wittily defined as consisting of intimate enemies and he had a wife who loved dearly the high title he had given her and the splendid fortune with which she kept it up but neither she nor any one else loved himexcept one who was sitting above the waterfloods watching his tried childs life and ready when his extremity should have come to whisper to that weary and sorrowful heart come and rest with me but that time was not yet the battle must be fought before the rest could come on friday the th of october a private gathering of nineteen of the council was held at lord warwicks house in holbornthat lord warwick of whom i have already spoken as john dudley the halfbrother of lady frances monke no man on earth hated somerset more heartily than warwick and perhaps only one other man hated him quite as much while they were yet debating how to ruin somerset a letter came in the kings name from secretary petre inquiring for what cause they thus gathered together if they wished to speak with the protector they must come peaceably this letter sealed the fate of the conferenceand of somerset the victim it was evident was awake and watching ruin might have served the original purpose now only one end would serve itdeath but warwick was one of the few who know how to wait in this emergencyfor he manifestly feared for his lifesomerset appealed to the only friends he had the people of england and england responded to the appeal hour after hour thickened the crowd which watched round hampton court where the king and protector were and in the middle of sunday night when he thought it safe somerset hastened to take refuge with his royal nephew in the stronghold of windsor note the crowd acting as guards and journeying with them it was a false move the populace were with somerset but the army was with warwick the crowd melted away the lords held london and on every gate of the city a list of the charges against the protector was posted up the bird struggling vainly in the toils of the serpent was only exhausting its own life these were the charges in substance which isoult avery found dr thorpe carefully reading when she came home from the market on monday morning the old man was making comments as he proceeded not very complimentary to my lord of warwick and his colleagues one that he hath made inward divisions two that he hath lost his majestys pieces beyond the sea three that he did enrich himself in the war and left the kings poor soldiers unpaid of their wages four that he hath laboured to make himself strong in all countries five that he hath subverted all law justice and good order whereby he hath fearfully shaken the chair of the kings seat six that he hath little esteemed the grave advice of the kings good and faithful councillors seven that he hath little regarded the order appointed by king henry for the government of his son eight that he hath laboured to sow dissension in the kingdom among the nobles gentlemen and commoners nine that the king and kingdom hath suffered great loss by his wilful negligence shaken the chair of the kings seat cried he if the men be not rebels that writ this paper i have little wit to know what a rebel is how dare they speak or think of shaking the kings seat which is in the hands of god and is accountable unto none save himlittle esteemed the advice of the kings faithful councillorsto wit the runagates that writ this paper laboured to sow dissension betwixt the gentry and the commoners tis the enclosures they point at i reckon what was he the only man that allowed them and who could have thought the commons had been such dolts now let us see the names of these wise good and faithful councillors r rich w saint john w northampton j warwick note and he paused a minute isoult said he again methinks that earl of warwick is a knave i never thought him otherwise dr thorpe said isoult quietly sir anthony wingfield was sent by the lords of the council to windsor on the following friday he parted the lord protector from the king and set a strong guard to watch him until the coming of the lords on the saturday the lord chancellor and the council rode to windsor and that night the protector was set in ward in the beauchamp tower of windsor castle and on the monday afternoon was the duke of somerset no longer lord protector brought to the tower of london riding between the earls of southampton and huntingdon accompanied by many gentlemen and three hundred horse at his own desire he came into london by way of saint giles in the fields and opposite soper lane were knights sitting on horseback and all the officers with halberds and so they led him from holborn bridge to cheapside where with a loud voice he cried to the bystanders good people i am as true a man to the king as any here in all the streets were aldermen or their deputies on horseback and the householders each man at his door all standing with bills in their hands as he passed and so he was conducted to the tower where he remained as true a man to the king poor little edward bewildered and deceived he did not know there was none other half so true note the enclosure riots had a more religious aspect in the west than in the east or the midland counties note william lord grey de wilton was an eminent general and a staunch gospeller he had been a member of the council at calais during the persecution and his close friendship with lord and lady lisle is shown by the fact that of his three children two bore their names lord grey died at cheston near waltham december note the minories was then to all intents in the country a single street whitechapel bars lay between it and the spital field on the north in front west was the city wall with its gardens on the east lay goodmans fields and an open space to the south bounded by the tower enclosure and the thames it must have been a very pleasant suburb note most historians say that the removal was against edwards will the account given by himself shows no trace of any such feeling note at this era peers did not use their titles only in signature but added at least the initial of the christian name chapter four beneath blue sky ere suns and moons could wax and wane ere stars were thundergirt or piled the heavens god thought on me his child ordained a life for me arrayed its circumstances every one to the minutest ay god said this head this hand should rest upon thus ere he fashioned star or sun robert browning the th of october brought the expected letter from simon pendexter to the master of bradmond and another from marian to the mistress simons epistle was read first but it proved to require both an english dictionary and a latin lexicon simon wrote of circumstances then a new and affected word of the culpable dexterity of the rebels who had visited bradmond of their inflammatory promulgation of the celerity of his own actions in reply and of his debarring from dilation the aforesaid ignis he left them in a cloud of words of which dr thorpe understood about half and isoult much less john being a little wiser was called upon for a translation hang me if i know what the fellow is awriting about testily cried dr thorpe jack do thou put this foolery into decent english the enclosure men burnt your house old friend said john have there the english plain enough at last by my troth cried he a little more progress was made with mr pendexters missive when isoult interrupted it by exclaiming do tell me what he meaneth jack they set our house afire dear heart but he soon put it out translated john it was likely afeard of his big ruffling words said dr thorpe the letter concluded thuswith the which considerations i do commit your honour to the tuition of god inscribed at bodmin die veneris the fourth in the month of october by the hand of your honours most undemeritous and obeisant paedagogus simon pendexter this companion is clean out of his wits exclaimed dr thorpe isoult read thy little letter said john metrusteth it shall be more clear than simons and at all charges tis shorter unto mistress avery at the minories in london mistressthis shall be to advertise you my lowly duties first remembered that the fourteenth of july come unto bradmond the ill men you wot of and after casting mine husband and me forth of the house with little gentleness did spread themselves thereabout drinking up the wine in the cellar and otherwise making great bruit and disorder and in the end they set fire thereto and departed god helping us we shortly had the fire under for it began to rain but the whole house is ruinated and a deal of mischief done mistress all the hangings be burned or torn and the furniture is but splinters and the very walls so knocked about and the garden all trampled and desolated that i am well assured were you this minute on the ground you should not find conveniency to enter and abide for many a long day yet and in good sooth twill lack a mint of money spent thereon ere the house be meet for any let be a gentleman and gentlewoman of your honourableness mistress they tare away all the shutters and tare up the planks of some of the floors and they left not a latch nor an andiron whole in all the house mine husband hath writ to mr avery from bodmin this fourth day of october mistress i do beseech you of your gentleness to give my poor sister to know that i do fare well and trust so doth she likewise by the rude hand of her that is your servant marian pendexter rude hand said john commend me to marian pendexter for the writing of a letter tis onehalf so long as simons and tells us twice so much as he and her round letters be as clear as print while his be all quips and flourishes well i account we shall needs abide hither for some time isoult but methinks i must ride home and see how matters stand and if the garden be truly desolated as for roses and the like well the ground may as well be set with carrots and cabbages that can be sold and on my return hither i must set me as fast as i may unto the making of pecunia as simon hath it in my calling metrusteth the house shall not need to be pulled down and built up again for that should take methinks some years to raise howbeit tis no good looking forward too far dr thorpe said when he had sat for a time in silence ah well the will of the lord be done i trow they shall scantly burn mine other house in that city which hath foundations mr edward underhill the hot gospeller isoult avery looked up and rose when john made this announcement to the evident amusement of the person introduced the hot gospellers age was thirtyseven of his personal appearance we have no trustworthy account it may safely be asserted that his feelings were strong his affections warm his partisanship fervent and his organ of humour decidedly developed i picture him lithe and quick with ready tongue and brilliant eyes but perhaps i am as much mistaken as isoult was concerning alice wikes if the mania de faire son portrait which was so much the fashion in france in the reign of louis the fourteenth had pervaded england in the sixteenth century we might have obtained much curious information which is now lost to us when all the members of our little group were gathered round the dinnertablewhich was not until eleven am for the averys dined unusually late that daydr thorpe laid the subject which had been discussed before mr underhill and requested his opinion on the matter could he find a man for the time isoult shook her head dubiously with whom take you part said dr thorpe with both of you answered mr underhill i lean to mistress averys thought that there is no man for the time but i do partly share your opinion in that methinks there may be a woman a woman mr underhill cried isoult in amazement what woman said dr thorpe my lady duchess of suffolk i ween nay master she is good enough as may be but her moneybags are a sight scantier than when my lord duke was in life my lady of suffolk not she forsooth replied he nay good doctor mine hopes are anchored under god on none other than the kings sweet sister temperancemy young lady elizabeths grace the lady elizabeth repeated dr thorpe in a voice which intimated his meaning a child at her book and needle master underhill she will not alway be so answered he nor shall she be such long and afore her standeth another continued the doctor afore her standeth another repeated mr underhill nor shall any man alive ever see me to do evil that good may come but i scantly signified all you would make me to say i did but point to my lady elizabeths power with the king not to her being one to stand in her own power which god long defend dr thorpe shook his head in turn but did not further explain himself you have friends at court said john to mr underhill which of these ladies is commonly thought to stand best with the king her brother the lady elizabeth by many a mile answered he and to go by what i hear from her tutor mr ascham a fair and ready wit enough she hath the lady frances note her daughters likewise be great with the king and are young damsels of right sweet nature and good learning so far as their young age may show the same what say men of the kings wedding quoth dr thorpe is it yet the queen of scots the friends of my lord protector say tis a princess of france and his foes will have it that had he not fallen too soon it should have been the lady jane seymour what my lord protector his daughter inquired isoult she said mr underhill that hath an ill look an it were so remarked john thoughtfully less like than pauls steeple to a dagger sheath quoted dr thorpe who was rather fond of proverbs go to jack we are all for ourselves in this world responded mr underhill philosophically as to like it may be no more like than chalk to cheese and yet be in every mans mouth from aldgate to the barbican my lord protector is neither better nor worse than other men if you or i were in his shoes we should do the like i trust not friend said john smiling a rush for your trust laughed mr underhill i would not trust either of us but i would so said isoult warmly mr underhill you surely think not that if jack were lord protector he should strive and plot for the king to espouse our kate of course he would said underhill coolly and so would you never she cried well i am sure i should think you i would not by my good will see my nan a queen answered he with a reasonable chance of tower hill suggested avery you and i have seen queens come to that ned underhill well there is better air at the lime hurst replied underhill sententiously a long conference was held concerning the repairs at bradmond the resolution finally adopted was that john should ride home and ascertain what the state of affairs really was hitherto the family had been living on their rents with little need for professional work on johns part unless it pleased him slight repairs however would entail saving and serious ones might keep them in london for years until he had laid up sufficient money to defray them tis all in the days work he said lightly to cheer his wife i must have a factor to see unto the place and for that simon pendexter shall serve if he affright not the poor tenants with his long words and i myself must needs set to work hard twill do me good dear heart for he saw isoult look sad i have hitherto been lazy and only have played at working so john left london on the first of november along with a convoy of travellers bound for exeter charging isoult to make acquaintance in his absence with mrs rose and mrs underhill with the object of giving her something to do and think not sweet wife said he that we be all going abegging because of what i said touching money i cast no doubt to make more than enough thereof in my calling to keep all us and that comfortably only if there lack much outlay at bodmin it shall need time to gather wherewith to pay it above all i would not with my good will have any stint in mine hospitality specially unto them that be of the household of faith leave us not turn christ our master out at the doors at the least unless we need go there ourselves with him a week after johns departure isoult put his advice into action rather because he had given it than with any real hope of dispelling the intense loneliness she felt robin went with her and kate all riding upon bayard to west ham where they were directed to a small house near the church as the residence of the parson for in those days parson had not lost its original honourable meaning whereby the clergyman was spoken of as par excellence the person in the parish the trio alighted and isoult rapped at the door a girl of fifteen answered the knock she was tall for her age but slenderly built her hair was of the fairest shade of goldenthe pale gold of our old poetsand her eyes were brown not a bright shining brown this brown was deep and misty and its light was the light given back from a lake not the light of a star in her face there was no rose at all it was pure and pale as a snowdrop and her look isoult thought was like the look of an angel her smile was embodied sweetness her voice soft and low clear as a silver bell there are few such voices out of england but the combination of fair hair with dark eyes is the venetian style of beauty rare in any land yet there are occasional instances in each for such in italy was dantes beatrice such in germany was louise of stolberg the wife of the last stuart and such with ourselves was englands elizabeth doth mistress rose here dwell and may one have speech of her inquired isoult of the vision before her will it please you to take the pain to come within answered the sweet voice i am thekla rose wondering at a name which she had never heard before isoult suffered thekla to lead her into a small pleasant parlour where mrs rose sat spinning she was a comely comfortablelooking woman of middle height roundfaced and rosy with fair hair like her daughters but grey eyes isoult had forgotten her foreign origin till she heard her speak her english however was fluent and pleasant enough and she told her visitors that she came from a town in flanders close to the german border where pursued mrs rose people are bred up in their common life to speak four tongues which shall say flemishthat is the language of flanders and spanishthe spaniards do rule over us and low dutch germanbecause we have much to do with the low dutch and the better bred women also french and i teach my thekla all these tongues saving the flemish for they speak not flemish only in flanders it should do her not much good but in all these four tongues have i kinsfolk for my father was a trueborn fleming and to him i alway spake flemish and my mother was a spanish woman and i spake spanish with her and my fathers brother was wedded unto a dame of low dutchland for whom my daughter is named thekla which is a low dutch name and his sister did marry a frenchman so you shall see i am akin to all this world mistress rose entreated her guests to stay for fourhours when she hoped mr rose would be at home but isoult was somewhat afraid of losing her way in the dark and declined so she called her maid and bade her bring cakes and ale and take bayard to the shed where their nag was stabled and give him a mess of oats begging them at least to stay an hour or two then robin came in and talked to thekla and kate while isoult was occupied with mrs rose mr rose they did not see his wife said he was in his parish visiting the people so at two oclock they departed and reached home just as the dusk fell the next day isoult rode to the lime hurst to see mrs underhill she found her a pleasant motherly woman full of kindness and cordiality as they sat and talked mr underhill came in and joined the conversation telling isoult among other matters how he had once saved lord russell from drowning the heir of the house of bedford the boy had been thrown into the thames opposite his house in a bitterly cold winter and underhill springing in after him rescued him carried him to his own house and nursed him back to life since that time the earl of bedford had been the attached friend of his childs preserver underhills narrative harl ms folio b when isoult returned home she found a letter from annis holland awaiting her it contained an urgent invitation from the duchess of suffolk to visit her at her little villa at kingstononthames isoult hesitated to accept the invitation but dr thorpe who thought she looked pale and tired overruled her chiefly by saying that he was sure john would prefer her going so she wrote to accept the offer and started with robin on the following monday skirting the city wall they passed through smithfield and holborn and turned away from saint giles into the reading road the precursor of piccadilly the roads were good for the time of year and they reached kingston before dark the next morning robin returned home with strict charges to fetch isoult in a week and sooner should either of the children fall ill after robins departure isoult waited on the duchess whom she found sitting in a cedar chamber the casement looking on the river and the terrace above it as the friends sat and talked in came a small white dog wagging its tail but with very dirty paws get out doctor gardiner cried her grace rising hastily as the soiled paws endeavoured to jump upon her velvet dress i cannot abide such unclean paws go get you washed ere you come into my chamber bertie mr bertie came in from the antechamber at her graces call and smiling when he saw what she wanted he lifted the dog and set it outside have dr gardiner washed prithee said the duchess i love a clean dog but i cannot abide a foul one isoult could not help laughing when she heard her grace call her dog by bishop gardiners name he is easier cleansed than his namesake she resumed shaking her head if my lord of winchester win again into power i count i shall come ill off as thou wist isoult i have a wit that doth at times outrun my discretion and when i was last in london passing by the tower i did see master doctor gardiner alooking from a little window and good morrow my lord quoth i in more haste than wisdom tis merry with the lambs now the wolves be kept close i count he will not forgive me therefor in sharp haste mr bertie smiled and shook his head now bertie leave thine head still said her grace i know what thou wouldst say as well as if i had it set in print i am all indiscreetness and thou all prudence he that should bray our souls together in a mortar should make an excellent wit of both your grace is too flattering methinks said mr bertie still smiling am i so verily answered she isoult what thinkest thou twas not i that gave the dog his name it was bertie here who should be shamed of his deed and is not so at all and i did but take up the name after him and this last summer what thinkest yon silly maid lucrece did one of the duchesss waitingwomen a fictitious person why she set to work and made a rochet in little and set it on the dogs back heardst thou ever the like and there was he arunning about the house with his rochet on him and all trailing in the mire i know not whether annis were wholly free of some knowledge thereofnor bertie neither he said he knew not i marvel whether he spake truth that did i ant like your grace replied mr bertie laughing i saw not the rochet neither knew of it afore yourself well i count i must een crede thee said she it struck isoult that the duchess and her gentleman usher were uncommonly good friends rather more so than was usual at that time she set it down to their mutual lutheranism but she might have found for it another and a more personal reason which they had not yet thought proper to declare openly the duchess and bertie were privately engaged but they told no one till their marriage astonished the world isoult reached home on the sixteenth of december and on twelfth day john returned from cornwall he brought word that the repairs needed were more extensive than any one had supposed from the pendexter epistles part of the house required rebuilding and he was determined not to begin before he could finish the result was that they would have to remain in london probably for five or six years more shortly after johns return a gentleman called to see him his name was roger holland and he was a merchant tailor in the city but of gentle birth and related to the earl of derby isoult wished to know if he could be any connection of her friend annis john thought not but thereby hung a tale this gentleman said john avery was in his young years bound apprentice unto one master kempton of the blade boy in watling street and in this time he being young and unwary did fall into evil company which caused him to game with them and he all unskilfully lost unto them not only his own money but every groat thirty pounds which his master had entrusted unto him to receive for him of them that ought it owed it moreover at this time was he a stubborn papist in which way he had been bred so he coming unto his masters house all despairing thought to make up his bundle and escape away out of his masters house which was a stern man and take refuge over seas in france or flanders but afore he did this indiscreet thing he was avised he made up his mind to tell all unto a certain ancient and discreet maid that was servant in this his masters family by name elizabeth lake which had aforetime showed him kindness so he gat up betimes of the morrow and having called unto her he saithelizabeth i would i had followed thy gentle persuadings and friendly rebukes which if i had done i had never come to this shame and misery which i am now fallen into for this night have i lost thirty pounds of my masters money which to pay him and to make up mine accounts i am not able but this much i pray you desire my mistress that she would entreat my master to take this bill of my hand that i am this much indebted unto him and if i be ever able i will see him paid desiring him that the matter may pass with silence and that none of my kindred nor friends may ever understand this my lewd part for if it should come unto my fathers ears it would bring his grey hairs oversoon unto his grave and so would he have departed like unto sir richard at the lea in the fair old ballad fare wel frende and have good daye it may noo better be from a litel geste of robyn hode but elizabeth was as good unto him as ever robin hood unto the knight of lancashire yea and better as shall be seen stay saith she and away went she forth of the chamber and afore he was well over his surprise thereat back cometh she and poured out of a purse before him on the table thirty pound in good red gold this money she had by the death of a kinsman of hers but then newly come unto her quoth she roger here is thus much money i will let thee have it and i will keep this bill but since i do thus much for thee to help thee and to save thy honesty thou shalt promise me to refuse all wild company all swearing and unseemly talk and if ever i know thee to play one twelvepence at either dice or cards then will i show this thy bill unto my master and furthermore thou shalt promise me to resort every day to the lecture at all hallows and the sermon at poules every sunday and to cast away all thy books of papistry and vain ballads and get thee the testament and book of service and read the scriptures with reverence and fear calling unto god still for his grace to direct thee in his truth and pray unto god fervently desiring him to pardon thy former offences and not to remember the sins of thy youth and ever be afraid to break his laws or offend his majesty then shall god keep thee and send thee thy hearts desire so mr holland took her money and kept his obligations unto her and in the space of one halfyear so mightily wrought gods spirit with him that of a great papist he became as fervent a gospeller and going into lancashire unto his father he took with him divers good books and there bestowed them so that his father and others began to taste of the gospel and to leave their idolatry and superstition and at last his father seeing the good reformation wrought in this his son gave him fifty pounds to begin the world withal and sent him again to london where he now driveth a fair trade and hath he met again with mistress lake said isoult and restored unto her her thirty pounds that i cannot tell returned john a letter came before long from mr barry written at christmas and informing his sister that matters were now settled and peaceable indeed at wynscote they had heard nothing of the rioters but potheridge had been surrounded and in answer to the rebels summons to surrender mr monke had sent them a dauntless message of defiance upon which they had replied with threats of terrible vengeance but had retired discomfited at the first trial of strength and never came near the place more darker grew the clouds meanwhile over the prisoner in the tower his enemies drew up twentynine articles against him and going to him in his captivity read them to him and informed the world that he had humbly confessed them well said john avery some of these be but matter for laughter to wit that the duke did command multiplication coining and alcumistry whereby the kings coin was abated as though my lord of somerset should take upon him to abate the kings coin nay better men than he have dealt with alcumistry answered dr thorpe the former charge moveth my laughter ratherthat my said lord hath done things too much by himself to wit without the knowledge and sage avisement of these my lords of the kings council is there so much as one of them that would not do the same an he had the chance why said avery he had the chance and therein lieth his offence they had not and therein lieth their virtue from two poor innocent lambs cruelly pent up by the protector now that he was himself in durance there came a great outcry for relief these were the imprisoned prelates bonner and gardiner the latter said that he had been in prison one year and a quarter and a month and he lacked air to relieve his body and books to relieve his mind and good company the only solace of this world and lastly a just cause why he should have come thither at all how well can the wolf counterfeit the lamb had none of his prisoners lacked air and books and had my lord bishop of winchester been so careful to see to a just cause in the case of every man he sent to tower or fleet on the th of january the leaders of the devon riots were hanged at tyburn the chief of whom was humphrey arundel and on the th of february the duke of somerset was delivered from the tower and suffered to go home but four days before a change had been made in the council the earls of arundel and southampton being dismissed and ordered to keep their houses in london during the kings pleasure mrs rose and thekla came several times to visit isoult and she returned the compliment and one day in february came philippa basset who was about to go into cheshire to visit her sister lady bridget carden with whom she passed nearly a year before isoult saw her again lady bridget really was not her sister at all she being lord lisles daughter and philippa lady lisles but they had been educated as sisters and as sisters they loved not long afterwards sir francis jobson resigned his office at the tower and went home to his own estate of monkwich in essex his wife was the lady elizabeth sister of lady bridget and with her philippa had lived ever since she came to london when she came back therefore she was forced to look out for another home for she did not wish to follow them into essex and she went to her own youngest brother mr james basset who had a house in london all this while the reformation was quietly progressing on the th of april bishop ridley came to saint pauls cathedral in communiontime and received the sacrament together with dr may the dean and dr barne both the dean and the bishop took the consecrated bread in their hands instead of holding out the tongue for the priest to put the wafer upon it and before the bishop would come into the choir he commanded all the lights that were on the lords table to be put out the dean who was a lutheran was well pleased at all this but not so other men who were more kindly disposed towards popery and there was much murmuring and disputing at this time the princess mary was hanging between life and death at kenninghall we know now how all things had been changed had she died but god could not spare her who was to be however unwittingly or unwillingly the purifier of his church to show which was the dross and which the gold some turmoil was also made concerning joan boucher an anabaptist girl who had been condemned for heresy and was burned in smithfield on the nd of may the papal party ever ready to throw stones at the protestants cried that the old burning days were come again and that archbishop cranmer was just as much a persecutor as bishop gardiner they saw no difference between a solitary victim of the one if joan boucher can be called so and the others piles of martyrs isoult rather puzzled about the question referred it to her husbandthe manner in which she usually ended her perplexities dear heart said he there be so few that can keep the mean when men take gods sword in hand is it any wonder that they handle it ill but wouldst thou leave such ill fawtors unchastened jack exclaimed dr thorpe rather indignantly that were scantly the mean i take it quietly returned he mr underhill was just then busied in presenting before the archbishop of canterbury his parish priest mr albutt vicar of stepney for his unseemly behaviour to the lutheran clergy who came by order of the king and the archbishop to preach in his church for he disturbed the preachers in his church writes underhill causing bells to be rung when they were at the sermon and sometimes began to sing in the choir before the sermon were half done and sometimes would challenge publicly dispute his doctrines the preacher in the pulpit for he was a strong stout popish prelate but the archbishop was too full of lenity a little he rebuked him and bade him do no more so my lord said mr underhill i think you are too gentle unto so stout a papist well said he we have no law to punish them by no law my lord cried mr underhill if i had your authority i would be so bold as to unvicar him or minister some sharp punishment unto him and such other if ever it come to their turn they will show you no such favour well said the archbishop in his gentle manner if god so provide we must all bide it surely answered mr underhill in his manner which was blunt and fearless god shall never con you thanks owe you thanks for this but rather take the sword from such as will not use it upon his enemies note mr and mrs rose thekla and mr underhill dined at the sign of the lamb one day in june unfortunately their conversation turned upon the succession and owing to the warmth of the weather or of mr edward underhill it became rather exciting mr rose was unexpectedly found to hold what that gentleman considered heretical political views namely that if the king should die childless it would be competent to the gospellers to endeavour to hinder the succession of the princess mary in favour of the princess elizabeth this underhill hotly protested would be doing evil that good might come and said he if it come to that pass i myself though i would a thousand times rather have my lady elizabeth to reign yet would i gird on my sword over my buff jerkin and fight for the lady mary mr rose shook his head but did not speak right is right thomas rose cried underhill somewhat hotly truth friend answered he and wrong is wrong but which were the right and which were the wrong of these two afore god perchance you and i might differ differ forsooth cried underhill again be two and two come to make five or is there no variance in your eyes betwixt watchet pale blue and brasil red the matter is as plain to be seen as westminster abbey if a man shut not his eyes i have known men do such things said mr rose with his quiet smile i thank you my master responded underhill so have i now ned underhill leave wrangling said avery we be none of us neither prophets nor apostles brethren be ye all of one mind repeated dr thorpe i am ready enough to be of one mind with rose said underhill an he will listen to reason that is answered john smiling an he will come over to you and look through your spectacles man o life we cant be both right cried underhill striking his hand heavily on the table you may be both wrong ned gently suggested john come rose said underhill cooling as suddenly as he had heated and holding out his hand we are but a pair of fools to quarrel i forgive you i knew not that i quarrelled with you friend said mr rose with his quiet smile and i have nothing to forgive but he put his hand in underhills readily enough you are a better christian than i methinks muttered underhill somewhat ashamed but you know what a hot fellow i am we will both essay to be as good christians as we can quietly answered mr rose and that is as like christ as we can methinks he scantly gave hot words to peter whether the emperor tiberius caesar should have reigned or no ah said john gravely he that should think first how christ should answer should rarely indeed be found in hot words and in evil never well replied mr underhill i am of complexion somewhat like peter i could strike off the ear of malchus an i caught him laying hands on my master yea i know not if i should stay at the ear and it had been much had i kept that sword off the high priest himself ay though i had been hanged the hour after the cause seemeth to lack such men at times said john thoughtfully and then the lord raiseth them up but we should not forget ned that they which take the sword shall perish with the sword well cried underhill i care not if i do perish with the sword if i may first mow down a score or twain of the enemies of the gospel such men commonly do so said mr rose aside to isoult by whom he sat do what broke in underhill who heard it do perish with the sword answered he firmly looking him full in the face amen cried the other i am abundantly readyonly pray you let me have a good tilt with the old mumpsimuses first note i would i were a little more like you underhill said mr rose i could suffer as methinks and perchance fly an i had the opportunity but resist or defend me that could i not call me to resist and defend you answered underhill it were right in my fashion you may not be within call said mr rose somewhat gloomily but god will be so mr rose said isoult look you for a further persecution that you speak thus theklas eyes filled with tears as jack saith mrs avery he answered i am neither prophet nor apostle but methinks none of us is out of his place upon the watchtower there be black clouds in the skyvery black thunderclouds how know i whether they shall break or pass over only god knoweth and he shall carry us all safe through them that have trusted ourselves to him that is a word full of significationsome of you shall they cause to be put to death yet shall not an hair of your heads perish our master may leave any of his servants to die or suffer he will never allow so much as one of them to perish o brethren only let the thunder find us watching praying always and whether we escape or no we are assured that we shall be counted worthy to stand before the son of man i would not like to be ashamed before him at his coming no one answered all were too full of thought for words note the lady frances was the eldest daughter of charles duke of suffolk by his fourth wife the princess mary and was therefore in the line of succession to the throne her daughters were the ladies jane katherine and mary grey note harl ms folio underhill gives no date for this incident beyond saying in king edwards time note in the reign of henry the eighth an old priest was found who for forty years had read the word sumpsimus in his breviary as mumpsimus on being remonstrated with he retorted that he would not leave his old mumpsimus for their new sumpsimus this story was long popular with the gospellers who dubbed the popish priests mumpsimuses chapter five gathering clouds god lays his burden on each back but who what is within the pack may know half of the reign of josiah as his people loved to call him was run out in the summer of the breathingtime of hope was nearly over a june morning in that summer found isoult avery seated by the window at work and robin tremayne holding a book which he was not reading his eyes were intently watching the light feathery clouds which floated across the blue space beyond and his thoughts were equally intent on some subject not yet apparent except walter who was busy in the corner manufacturing paper boats there was no one else in the room robin broke the silence and rather suddenly motherhe had come to call her sowhat think you of mr rose what think i of him robin repeated isoult looking up while a faint expression of surprise crossed her gentle countenance why he liketh me very well and what think you of mrs rose mother the surprise increased in isoults look and it was accompanied now by perplexity but she only answered she liketh me only less than her husband i would she had been englishborn but that cannot she well help and i have none other fault to find with her and what think you mother of mrs thekla robin said this in a very low voice dr thorpe was coming in as he spoke and the old man turned and faced round on the lad o ho cried the doctor blows the wind from that quarter apparently it did so for robin coloured scarlet come come lad said he thou art but now out of thy swaddlingclothes and what dost thou with such gear put it away and go whip thy top like a good lad dr thorpe said robin in an aggrieved voice and drawing himself to his utmost height i was nineteen years of age last saint agnes january thou art as many years of discretion as there be crowns o the sun note in a halfpenny said he nineteen quotha why thou idle hilding youth i have years sixtynine and i never thought of marrying yet isoult laughed but robin was grave as a bishop and plainly deemed himself affronted that is your affair dr thorpe said he demurely and this is mine ant like you a pretty plain hint to mind mine own business whether it like me or no replied the old man with a little merry laugh well robin hie after are ye agreed and is the weddingday fixed shall it be midsummer day give me a jolly piece of the cake as what else thou dost and isoult mind thou set it mighty thick with plums dr thorpe said robin his patience woefully tried i wish you would let me be i was talking with my mother say on answered he i will strive hard to set mine old legs adancing at thy wedding though i promise not a galliardo a dance wherein high leaps were taken requiring great agility my word ont it shall be a jovial sight hast seen the tailor touching thine attire purple satin or cramoisie crimson velvet robins forbearance was plainly worn out he rose and walked toward the door nay lad come called the old man i meant not in deed to grieve thee come back robin and i will cease flouting thee if it trouble thee come back thou silly child robin turned back after a moments thought and sat down on the settle he had left i take your word for it dr thorpe he said soberly but think you it not too grave a matter for jesting grave cried dr thorpe what wouldst thou have it spoken of like an execution i cry you mercy doctor said isoult now joining in but in this matter i do take part with robin it alway seemeth me that men ay and women too do speak with too much jesting and lightness touching this matter which should be right serious a mans choice of a wife is a choice for life and is hardly to be talked of meseemeth in the same fashion with his choice of a partlet neck ruff i pray you pardon me if in so speaking i fail aught in the reverence due unto your years why dear child saith he thou wist more of the matter than i which was never married so talk away and i will hold my peace and trouble my master the bridegroom no further say on mr robert tremayne methinks enough is said answered robin staidly i await my mothers answer which may scarce be given in a moment robin said isoult nor without talk with mine husband thereupon moreover mr rose shall have a word to say touching the matter john was hardly allowed to speak on his return from the law courts before he had heard isoults story he received the news at first as something irresistibly comic but the next minute he grew grave and evidently began to consider the matter seriously i would fain hear thy thought hereon jack said his wife for methinks i do see in robin his manner that this is no lads fantasy only as dr thorpe did suppose but a set purpose that must be fairly faced and said yea or nay to we must not forget dear heart was johns answer that though we are unto him in place of elders parents robin is truly his own master even afore he be of full age he is not our ward in law neither in articles nor apprenticeship and he hath but himself to please and even were we to let hinder him now when i doubt not his natural kindly and obedient feeling for us should cause him to assent thereto yet bethink thee that in a year and an half when he cometh to his mature age he shall be at liberty in every way there be many husbands in the realm younger than he and truly i see no way but leaving him to his will so soon only as we can be satisfied that it is no mere passing fantasy that swayeth him but that his heart and mind are verily set and engaged therein remember we have no right over him and think yet again that his choice so far as i am able to judge is a thorough good one i see not what else may be done but he did refer him unto our judgment by asking me thereon said isoult truth he answered wherein he showed his own judgment and wisdom and himself to be a good and gentle lad as he is alway the more reason sweet heart that our judgment should be gracious and should lean unto his wishes so far as we may in right dealing and love unto himself consent thereto and in good sooth i see no cause for dissent then said isoult somewhat surprised though she scarcely knew why she should have expected any other decision thou wilt speak unto mr rose certainly said he if robin desire it and we really shall have a wedding said isoult i said not that dear heart answered john smiling mr rose may refuse consent or were he to give it methinks i should allgates at all events move wherein i would look for rose to agree with me that it should not be by and bye immediately but to wait until robin be fairly settled in his calling the calling which robin had chosen was holy orders he was studying divinity and bishop ridley had already promised to ordain him when he should arrive at the proper age if he were satisfied as to his fitness on examination mr rose directed his readinga fact which had caused him to be thrown rather more into theklas society than he might otherwise have been in his frequent visits to west ham and occasional waiting required when the vicar happened to be absent but jack cried isoult with a sudden pang of fear supposing that the king were to die issueless as god defend and the lady mary to come in and set up again the mass and and the bloody statute he answered reading her thought then we should have a second walter mallet and thekla to be grace murmured isoult her voice faltering o jack that were dreadful could we do nought to let it yes he said in a constrained tone we might do two things to let it either to hinder their marriage or to let robin from receiving orders but thinkest thou we ought so i think sweet wife answered he tenderly that we ought to follow gods leading he can let either and if he see it best whether for robin or for thekla that will he but for myself i do confess i am afeard of handling his rod i dare not walk unless i see him going afore and here beloved i see not myself that he goeth afore except to bid us leave things take their course dost thou i see nothing she answered i feel blind and in a maze touching it all then said he let us tarry the lords leisure it was finally settled between john and isoult that the former should see mr rose after the evening service on the following sunday when he was to preach at bow church and speak to him on the subject of robin and thekla so after the service they all returned home but john and though no one told robin why he stayed behind isoult fancied from the lads face that he guessed the cause it was a long time before johns return isoult dismissed esther to bed determining to wait herself and with some indistinct observation about young folk that could turn night into day dr thorpe took up his candle and trudged upstairs also robin sat on and isoult had not the heart to say anything to him for she saw that his thoughts were at bow church not occupied with the copy of latimers sermon on the plough which lay open before him at last john came with a slow even step from which his wife augured ill before he entered the room he smiled when he saw robin still there ill news father said robin you need not to tell me thou art a sely prophet lad answered john kindly at this time i have no news at all for thee neither good nor ill only that mr rose giveth no absolute nay and doth but undertake to think upon the matter and discourse with mrs rose is that such ill news trow thank you answered robin in a low voice you did your best i know goodnight and he lifted his candle and departed but isoult thought the lad looked sad and disappointed and she was sorry for him well jack how spedst thou said she when robin was gone ah grandmother eva replied jack smiling wouldst know all now jack said she flout me not for my womanly curiosity but tell me i am but a woman pure truth dear heart answered he yet smiling well i had to await a short space for i found thekla with her father and i could not open the matter afore her so at last i prayed her of leave asked her to go seeing no other way to be rid of her for i would speak with mr rose privily then went she presently away and i brake robins matter and what said he he looked more amazed than thou and trust me that was no little but what said he repeated isoult he said he had never thought touching the marriage of thekla for he looked thereon until now as a thing afar off like as we of robin but quoth he he did suppose in all likelihood she should leave him sometime if god willed it thus but it should be sore when it came and the water stood in his eyes looked he thereon kindly or no thinkest i am somewhat doubtful and john dropped his voice though i would not say so much to robin whether or no he looketh kindly on her marrying at all thou wist sweet heart for thou heardst him to say so muchthat he hath some thought that there shall yet be great persecution in this land and that gospellers shall in a worldly and temporal sense come but ill off and to have thekla wife unto a priesti might see it liked him very evil for her sake yet he dimitted it not lightly but passed word to talk it over with his wife but he said he would never urge thekla to wed any contrariwise unto her own fantasy the monday morning brought mrs rose isoult felt glad when she saw her that john had taken robin with him to westminster the two ladies had a long private conference in isoults closet or boudoir mrs rose evidently was not going to stand in the way she rather liked the proposed match she had strongly urged her husband to tell thekla which against his own judgment he had at last consented to do for theklas mother regarded her as a marvel of wisdom and discretion while her father being himself a little wiser thought less of her wonderful powers though he admitted that she was very sensiblefor her years she is a good childthekla said mrs rose in her foreign manner a good childbut she dreameth too much she is not for the life rather a dreamer she would read a great book each day sooner than to spin but she doth the right she knoweth that she must to spin and she spin but she carrieth her thoughts up a great way off into strange gear whither i cannot follow see you mistress avery how i would say i i am a plain woman i make the puddings i work the spinningand i love the work thekla she only work the spinning and make the puddings because she must to do it she will do the right alway but she will not love the work isoult quite understood her and so she told her she do not come after me in her liking pursued she rather it is her father and it is very good very good to read the great books and look at the stars and to talk always of what the great people do and of what mean the prophet by this and the saint by that but for me it is too much i do not know what the great people should do i make my puddings the great people must go their own way they not want my pudding and i not want their great things but thekla and mr rose are both so good only when they talk together they sit both of them on the top of my head i am down beneath doing my spinning nothing more was heard until wednesday then before isoult was down in the morning having apparently risen at some unearthly hour mr rose presented himself and asked for john the two went out of doors together to robins deep concern and not much less to isoults for she had her full share of womanly curiosity in an innocent way at last she saw them come up the street in earnest conversation and as john turned in at the door for mr rose would not follow she heard him say almost mournfully alack then there is no likelihood thereof good morrow not the least mr rose replied and then away he went down the street an augury of evil murmured robin under his breath what dost thou with evil this morrow robin asked john cheerily coming into the room be of good cheer dear lad the lord sitteth above all auguries and hath granted thee the desire of thine heart robin rose and the light sprang to his eyes thekla rose pursued john seeth no good cause why she should not change her name to tremayne but bide a minute robin man thou art not to be wed tomorrow morning mr rose addeth a condition which i doubt not shall stick in thy throat what said robin turning round for he was on his way to leave the room but this said john lightly that will soon be over ye are not to wed for three years robins face fell with a look as blank as though it had been thirty years how now asked dr thorpe coming in from the barber sir tristram looketh as woebegone as may lightly be i am afeard the princess isoude hath been sore cruel john told him the reason and both be such ancient folk resumed he they are afeard to be dead and buried ere then how now robin take heart of grace man and make a virtue of necessity thou art neither seventy nor eighty nor is mistress thekla within a month or twain of ninety good lack a bit of a younker of nineteen quotha to be afretting and afuming to be let from wedding a smatchet of a lass of seventeen or so until either have picked up from some whither a scrap of discretion on their green shoulders thekla hath but sixteen years said john and rose thinketh her too young to be wed yet so should any man with common sense replied dr thorpe why lad what can a maid of such tender years do to rule an house i warrant thee she should serve thy chicken at table with all the feathers on and amend thy stockings wrong side afore nay said isoult laughing her mother shall have learned her something better than that get thee to thine accidence said dr thorpe to robin hic haec hoc is a deal meeter for the like o thee than prinking of wedding doublets dr thorpe answered robin aggrievedly you alway treat me as though i were a babe so thou art so thou art said the old man but now out of thy cradle and not yet fit to run alone for do but see what folly thou hadst run into if jack and mr rose had not been wiser than thou robins lip trembled and he walked slowly away isoult was sorry for the lads disappointment for she saw that it was sore yet she felt that john and mr rose were right and even dr thorpe rose saith resumed john that he thinketh not his daughter to be as yet of ripe judgment enough to say more than shall serve for the time and he will therefore have no troth plighted for this present in good sooth had not her mother much urged the consulting of her methinks he should rather have said nought unto her of the matter but quoth he let three years pass in the which time robin shall have years twentytwo and thekla nineteen and if then both be of like mind why i will say no further word against it bits o scraps o childre said dr thorpe under his voice in a tone of scorn and yet pity which would sorely have grieved robin had he not gone already be not too hard on the lad old friend urged john gently many younger than he be wed daily and i take it he hath had a disappointment in hearing my news i thought best not to make too much thereof in the telling but scorn not the lads trouble i want not to scorn neither the lad nor the trouble answered the doctor i did but tell him it was folly and so it is after this for a while there were fewer visits exchanged between the minories and west ham and robin found himself quietly set to the study of larger books which took longer to get up than heretofore so that his appearances at the vicarage were fewer also when the families did meet it was as cordially as ever manifestly mr roses feelings were not a whit less kindly than before but he thought it better for robin that his affections should not be fed too freely jack said isoult suddenly what discoursedst thou with mr rose o wednesday morn whereof i heard thee to say there was no likelihood was it touching this matter of robin john had to search his memory before he could recall the incident dear heart no he said when he had done so it touched my lord of somerset on the last day of july esther going to the market came in with news which stirred isoults heart no little thomas wriothesley earl of southampton had died on the previous day at his house in london to which he had been confined by order of the king an ill man and an unkindly wrote isoult in the diary she always kept specially unto them which loved the gospel but how those tidings taketh me back to the days that be over and gone for the last time that ever i saw this man was that black third of march the year of our lord when the king that then was sent him to bear his diamond and message unto my dear master lord lisle in the tower can i ever forget that even of this thomas wriothesley i dare say nothing i would think rather of him whose voice i did hear last after his in the commending of his blessed and gentle spirit into the hands of god how many times sithence that day have i thanked god for him ay lord we thank thee for thy saints and for thy care and guidance of them for the longer i do live the surer am i that thy way home is not only the right way but for each of thine the only way i take it we shall not think of the thorns that tare us nor shall we be ready for tears over the sharp stones that wounded us in that day when i and my dearloved lord may sing to thee togetherthou hast redeemed us o lord god of truth mrs underhill walked into the lamb one warm afternoon in the beginning of august and remained to fourhours and of course the conversation turned before long upon the protestant controversy with rome in the hot gospellers family it rarely kept off that subject for many minutes together mother said kate when she was gone what meaneth mistress underhill by confession she said it was bad but it is not bad is it for me to tell you and father when i have done wrong no sweeting neither to tell god answered isoult mrs underhill meant not that but spake only of confession unto a priest thou must know kate explained robin that some men will tell their sins unto any priest in the stead of seeking forgiveness of god in their own chamber but what toucheth it the priest asked the child why never a whit he answered if the man have stole from the priest resumed she it were right he should tell him like as i tell father and mother if i have done any wrong because it is wrong to them but if i had disobeyed mother what good were it that i should ask mr rose to forgive me i should not have wronged him she hath a brave wit methinks our kate observed isoult to robin when the child had left the room robin assented with a smile but dr thorpe was so rude as to say all mothers geese be swans the smile on robins lips developed into laughter isoult answered with as much indignant emphasis as her gentle nature could indulge in were you no swan to yours dr thorpe dr thorpes reply disarmed all the enemys forces ah child i never knew her the old man said sadly maybe i had been a better man had i known a mother it was not in isoult avery at least to respond angrily to such a speech as that before midwinter was reached the swans were increased by one in the house in the minories on the th of november a baby daughter was born to john and isoult avery and on the th of december the child was christened at saint botolphs mr rose officiating the name given her was frances the sponsors were the duchess of suffolk for whom mrs rose stood proxy and lady frances monke whose deputy was mrs underhill and last and greatest the young king by sir humphrey ratcliffe captain of the gentlemen pensioners and a gospeller the mania for asking persons of distinction to stand as sponsors was at its height during the reigns of the tudor sovereigns every one of them was godfather or godmother to countless multitudes of his or her subjects though they rarely if ever acted in person we shall find on a later page that even the nine days queen lady jane grey was not without this distinction during her momentary reign during the illness of isoultfor she was so ill that for some days dr thorpe considered her life in dangerthe breach if it may be called so with west ham was made up both mr and mrs rose were in constant attendance at the minories and thekla came with them several times her charge being the children so that esther might be entirely free to wait on her sick mistress the subject was not discussed again but from this date on both sides it appeared to be quietly taken for granted that robin and thekla henceforward belonged to each other the underhills too were very kind mrs underhill undertaking to sit up with her invalid friend for several nights on the th of february dr gardiner was fully deprived of his bishopric the gospellers hoped it was for ever but it will shortly be seen how deceived they were and at easter the holy table in saint pauls cathedral was carried down below the veil that had been hung up to hide from the noncommunicants the consecration of the elements and set north and south for as yet the customary place of the table was east and west strange tales were told this lent of fearful and marvellous visions and sights seen by many persons beside merton abbey and in other places men in armour were seen in the air who came down to the earth and faded and in sussex were three suns shining at once john avery made himself merry over these rumours in which he had no faith the three suns said he were but some matter of optical philosophy which could readily be expounded of such as were learned in it and for the men in armour when he saw them he would believe them dr thorpe considered the wonderful sights omens of coming ill but from esther they won very scant respect in may the party from the lamb dined with mr holland at whose house they met mr rose and mr and mrs underhill the lastnamed gentleman could talk of nothing but the expected marriage of the young king with a princess of france this princess was the hapless elizabeth afterwards affianced to don carlos and eventually married to his father the wretched philip the second at this time she was just five years old but said isoult she shall be a papist trow she shall be a papist of mighty few years old said mr underhill laughing and we will quickly make a protestant of her i hear she is a mighty pretty child her hair dark and shining her eyes wondrous bright and her smile exceeding sweet sweeter than thekla roses asked mrs underhill herself smiling scantly methinks answered mr underhill how like to a mans fantasy of an angel doth that maid look robin looked very unlike an angel for he appeared extremely uncomfortable but he said nothing from the kings marriage they came to that of the princess mary and mr underhillwho being a gentleman pensioner with friends at court was allowed to speak with authoritygave the name of her projected bridegroom as the lord lewis of portugal wherein pursued he father rose and i may amend our differences seeing that she should first be called to renounce the succession mr rose smiled and said a happy ending of a troublous matter if it were so but as the reader well knows the troublous matter was not doomed to have so happy an end the next topic was the new act to allow the marriage of priests all the party being gospellers were of course unanimous upon this subject but mr underhill who was not in the family secrets unfortunately took it into his head to clap robin rather smartly on the back and congratulate him that he might now be a priest without being necessarily a bachelor poor robin looked unhappy again but still wisely remained silent not relishing the opening of the subject in mr roses presence but mr rose only smiled and quietly suggested that it would be well for mr underhill to satisfy himself that he was not making his friends sorrier instead of merrier by coming down upon them with such personal assaults john by way of corollary intimated in an aside to isoult that the gentleman in question had a sore heavy hand when he was in right earnest the night after this day was one not soon forgotten in london in the still darkness came an earthquakethat most terrible of phenomena held in gods hand whereby he saith to poor puny arrogant man be still and know that i am god isoult awoke to hear sounds on all sides of herthe bed creaking and below the dishes and pans dancing with a noisy clatter in the next chamber she heard walter crying and kate asking if the end of all the world were come but john would not permit her to rise and go to them and she also heard esther talking with them and comforting them in a low voice so she was comparatively satisfied the baby frances slept peacefully through all the next morning kate saidmother were you affrighted last night with the great rocking and noise a little afeard lest some of us should be hurt sweet heart if any thing should chance to fall down or the like but that was all i thought said she that the end of the world was come what should have come unto us then mother why then replied isoult we should have seen the lord jesus christ coming in the clouds with all the angels well answered kate thoughtfully i would not have been afeard of him for he took up the little babes in his arms and would not have them sent away if it had been some of them that desired for to have them away i might have been afeard ay said dr thorpe looking up from his book the servants are worse to deal withal than the master we be a sight harder upon one the other than he is with any of us the averys were visited a day or two after the earthquake by an old acquaintance of isoult the companionservant he was called at that timeof bishop latimer augustine bernher was by nation a germanswiss probably from basle or its vicinity and unless we are to take an expression in one of bradfords letters as figurative he married the sister of john bradford like every one else just then bernhers mind was running chiefly on the earthquake he brought news that it had been felt at croydon reigate and nearly all over kent and the question on all lips waswhat will come of it for that it was a prognostic of some fearful calamity no one thought of doubting whether the earthquake were its forerunner or not a fearful calamity did certainly follow on the th of july the sweating sickness broke out in london this terrible malady was almost peculiar to the sixteenth century it was unknown before the battle of bosworth field in when it broke out in the ranks of the victorious army and it has never been seen again since this its last and most fatal epidemic in it is said to have been of the character of rheumatic fever but its virulence and rapidity were scarcely precedented in some cases death ensued two hours only after the attack and few fatal instances were prolonged to two days on the tenth of july the king was hurried away to hampton court for one of his grooms and a gentleman of the chamber were already dead the fury of the plague for a veritable plague it was began to abate in london on the th and between the th and th died in the city alone about nine hundred persons note nor was the disease confined to london it broke out at cambridgein term timedecimating the university the duchess of suffolk who was residing there to be near her sons both of whom were then at saint johns hastily sent away her boys to bugden the bishop of lincolns palace but the destroying angel followed the young duke and his brother reached bugden on the afternoon of july and at noon on the following day the duchess was childless the suspense was dreadful to those who lived in and near london every day isoult watched to see her children sickenfor children were the chief victims of the malady and on the th when walter complained of his head and shivered even in the july sun she felt certain that the sword of the angel had reached to her the revulsion of feeling when dr thorpe pronounced the childs complaint to be only measles was intense the baby frances also suffered lightly but kate declined to be ill of any thing to the great relief of her mother so the fearful danger passed over no name in the avery family was inscribed on the tablet of death given to the angel john avery was very indignant at the cant names given by the populace to the sweating sickness the new acquaintancestopgallantstoop knave and know thy masterso men termed it jesting on the very brink of the grave truly said he tis enough to provoke a heavier visitation at gods hand when his holy ears do hear the light and unseemly manner wherein men have received this one nor is the one of them true replied dr thorpe this disorder is no new acquaintance for we had it nigh all over one half of england in king henrys days i know i had in bodmin eight sick therewith at one time when this terror was passing away an event happened which rejoiced the papists and sorely grieved the gospellers on the th of april previous after the deprivation of gardiner dr poynet had been appointed bishop of winchester and marks in land assigned for his maintenance the new bishop was married and soon after his elevation it transpired that his wife had a previous husband yet living whether the bishop knew this at the time of his marriage does not appear but we may in charity hope that he was ignorant he was publicly divorced in saint pauls cathedral on the th of july to the extreme delight of the papists in whose eyes a blot on the character of a protestant bishop was an oasis of supreme pleasure the gospellers were downcast and distressed isoult avery coming in from the market recounted with pain and indignation the remarks which she had heard on all sides but john only smiled when she told him of them it is but like said he the sin of one member tainteth the whole body specially in their eyes that be not of the body rest thee dear heart the judge of all the earth shall not blunder because they do neither in bishop poynets case nor in our own but said isoult we had no hand in marrying bishop poynet little enough he answered he shall bear his own sin how much or little it be to his own master if he knew not that the woman was not free it is lesser his sin than hers and trust me god shall not doom him for sin he did not and if he knew who are we that we should cast stones at him or say any thing unto him confessing and amending beyond go and sin no more nay she said it is not we that flout him but these papistical knaves which do flout us for his sake not for his sake replied john solemnly for an others sake we know that the world hated him before it hated us bishop poynet is not the man they aim at he is but a commodious handle a pipe through which their venom may conveniently run he whom they flout thus is an other man whom one day they as well as we shall see coming in the clouds of heaven coming to judge the earth the question asked of paul was not why persecutest thou these men and women at damascus it is not methinks only inasmuch as ye did this good but likewise inasmuch as ye did this evil unto one of the least of these my brethren ye did it unto me the next thing which aggrieved the people was an order for the abatement of the coinage henceforward the ninepenny piece was to pass for sixpence the groat or fourpenny piece for twopence the twopenny piece for a penny the penny for a halfpenny and the halfpenny for a farthing yet notwithstanding this or perhaps in consequence of it the price of provisions rose instead of falling why said dr thorpe this is plainly putting an hand in a mans pocket and robbing him of half his money softly good friend interposed john you would not call the kings grace a robber the kings grace is the kings grace and may do as it liketh him said dr thorpe a little testily tis yonder rascally council whereof i speak and in especial that cheating knave of warwick i would we had my lord of somerset back for all he is not a lutheran but a gospeller he never thrust his hand into my pocket o this fashion ah replied john laughing touch a mans pocket and how he crieth apace a child newly burnt dreadeth the fire jack answered the old man this is not the first time we have had the kings coin pulled down i am as true a man to the king as any here but i have taken no oath to that dotipole blockhead of warwick and if he play this game once too oft he may find he hath fished and caught a frog i count suggested john soberly that my lord of warwicks testers shall not pass for any more than ours what matters that to him lad cried dr thorpe when he can put his hand into the kings treasury and draw it out full of rose nobles the scurvy rogue i would he were hanged john laid his hand very gently and lovingly on the old mans shoulder would you truly that friend said he softly a man meaneth not alway every thing he saith replied dr thorpe somewhat ashamed bring me not to bar prithee for every word when i am heated dear old friend john answered softly we shall stand at one bar for every word then i shall look an old fool as i do now said he sit thee down lad and hold that soft tongue o thine i can stand a fair flyting scolding still a northern provincialism or a fustigation beating but i never can one of those soft tongues like thine john sat down a little smile playing round his lips and said no more one day in october mr underhill dined at the lamb he brought news that at hampton court that day the earl of warwick was to be made duke of northumberland the marquis dorset henry grey husband of the late dukes elder daughter duke of suffolk the lord treasurer william paulet lord saint john marquis of winchester and mr william herbert earl of pembroke duke of northumberland cried dr thorpe fairly roused at this news duke of blunderhead had the king made him duke of cumberland i had little marvelled wherefore did his grace saving the reverence due not likewise make me duke of truro or marquis of bodmin i have been a truer man unto his highness than ever my lord of warwick and have done the kingdom a sight less harm less harm quotha laughed mr underhill why friend if all were made dukes and marquises that have done no harm to the kingdom we should have the minories chokefull of noble houses we should have mighty few of the lords keeping their titles said dr thorpe grimly a few days later dr thorpe having gone to the barbers near aldgate returned with a budget of news as was usual when he came from that quarter what will you give me for my news cried he as he came in rare news glorious newsfor all knaves dolts and runagates john entered likewise just after him i will give you nought doctor at that rate said isoult laughing i know it friend replied john so sadly that her mirth vanished in a moment it is a woeful blow to the gospel isoult the duke of somerset and my lord grey de wilton are committed to the tower the duke of somerset again she cried but my lord grey de wilton what hath he done served the king well in cornwall answered john i know of nothing worse tis that idiot knave dolt and dizard fool of a northumberland cried dr thorpe in great indignation i would the whole dudley race had never been born knavery runs in their bloodtwill not out of them there are a few honest men in englandbut a few said john mournfully and two of the foremost shall lie this night in the tower of london and for what is it because my lord grey hath many times shed his blood for england the royal blood of england herself which runneth in his veins note that now england herself shall shed it on tower hill is it because my lord of somerset hath given her the best laws she had for many a day that now she will needs strain her laws to condemn him shame upon england if it be so she shall not be held guiltless for it either before god or men and yestereven continued dr thorpe was my lady of somerset sent also to the tower for the great crime i take it of being wife unto her husband and with her a fair throng of gentlemenwhat they have done i wis not maybe one of them sent the duke a peacock and another doffed his bonnet to the lord grey the duchess too exclaimed john turning to him i heard not of her committal what can they lay to her charge marry she must have trade on the tail train of my lady of northumberland last garter day scornfully answered dr thorpe were not this a crime well deserving of death surely said isoult my lady of warwick note will plead for her own father and mother with her father of northumberland plead with the clouds that they rain not said he or with a falling rock that it crush you not their bosoms were easier to move than john dudleys heart of stone and what saith the king to it all mewondereth said isoult poor child answered jack i am sorry for him either he pleadeth in vain or else they have poured poison into his ears persuading him that his uncle is his dire foe and they his only friends the last was the truth god have pity on his gentle childly heart howsoever it be more news isoult said dr thorpe coming home on the following thursday tis my lord paget this time that hath had the great misfortune to turn his back upon king northumberland while the knave was looking his way we shall have all the nobles of the realm accommodated in the tower afore long ah me said isoult with a shiver are those dreadful headings to begin again most likely so answered he sitting down and the kings grace hath given his manor of ashridge unto his most dear sister the lady elizabeth i marvel by the way which of those royal ladies shall ride the first unto tower hill we are getting on child how the devil must be arubbing his hands just now in the midst of these troubles came the queen dowager of scotland marie of guise to visit the king upon which rumours instantly arose that the king should even yet marry the young queen of scots but mary stuart was never to be the wife of edward tudor and there came days when looking back on this day isoult avery marvelled that she could ever have thought such events troubles at all the clouds were returning after the rain in came dr thorpe from evensong on the sunday night one bit more of tidings isoult said he in his caustic style tis only my lord of arundelnothing but an earllet him be who shall be the next trow mean you said she that my lord of arundel is had to the tower to the tower replied he ay the general meetingplace now o days i wonder how it is with my lady of arundel said isoult why answered he if she would get in likewise after her lord she hath but to tell my lord of northumberland to his face that he may well be shamed of himself a truer word was never spoke and she shall find her there under an hour during the following month came an invitation to dine at west ham there beside the party from the lamb were mr and mrs underhill and mr holland the conversation turned on politics it was the usual topic of that eventful decade of years mr rose saidi know one master ascham now tutor unto my lady elizabeths grace which hath also learned the lady jane grey and hath told me how learned and studious a damsel is she and can speak and read with all readiness not only french and spanish and italian but also latin and greek and yet is she only of the age of fourteen years and so gentle and lovely a maid to boot as is scantly to be found in the three kingdoms of the kings majesty how had she served for the king inquired john right well i would say answered mr rose but men say she is destined otherwhere whither i pray you said mr holland unto a son of my lord of northumberland as tis thought he answered whereupon hearing the name of his enemy as though touched by a match dr thorpe exploded a son of my lord of northumberland forsooth cried he doth earth bear no men but such as be sons of my lord of northumberland would the rascal gather all the coronets of england on his head and those of his sons and daughters tis my lord of northumberland here and there and everywhere upstairs and downstairs and in my ladys chamber sang mr underhill in a fine bass voice for even in that musical age he was renowned for his proficiency in the art in the kings chamber certes said dr thorpe i would with all mine heart he could be thence profligated driven out methinks i can see one in the far distance that may do that said mr rose in his grave manner at the furthest my lord of northumberland will not live for ever but how many sons hath he groaned dr thorpe such appletree such fruit if the leopard leave ten or a dozen cubs we be little better for shooting him my lord henry allgates is no leopard cub said mr underhill i know the boy and a brave gallant lad he is go on said dr thorpe the rest my lord of warwick pursued he is scarce the equal of his brother yet is he undeserving of the name of a leopard cub and my lord ambrose as meseemeth shall make a worthy honourable man for what toucheth my lord guilford i think he is not unkindly but he hath not wit equal to his father and as for robin the famous earl of leicesterwell you shall call him a leopard cub an you will he hath all his fathers wit and craft and more than his fathers grace and favour and he looketh to serve as a courtier he shall carry on then in his fathers place said dr thorpe with a groan methinks he shall either make a right good man or a right bad one answered mr underhill he hath wit for aught and who said dr thorpe ever heard of a dudley a good man is that the very gentleman asked mrs rose that did marry with the great heir mistress robsart aymrs amie answered mr underhill and a gentle one she is a deal too good for robin dudley must we then look to my lord robert as the cerberus of the future said mr rose smiling the devil is not like to run short of servants answered dr thorpe grimly if it be not he it will be an other the clouds returned after the rain but they gathered softly unheralded by any suspicion on the part of england as to the fate which it bore came that fatal first of december which was the beginning of the end edward seymour duke of somerset was arraigned that day in westminster hall and round the doors england pressed yet in more hope than fear a mere farce she thought he must be acquitted of course she prepared to welcome him home in triumph with such feelings in her heartfor was she not a part of england isoult avery stood at her door about six oclock that evening waiting for johns return from the trial which was the one occurrence of the day robin had gone with him but dr thorpe remained at home for a time there was nothing but silence the usual hum of the city was stilled everybody was at westminster from goodmans fields the cows came lowing home now and then a single person intent on business with which nothing might interfere passed quickly up the minories the soft chime of the bells of saint katherine floated past the tower wall for the ringers were practising after evensong and one great gun rang out sharply from the tower to inform the world that it was six oclock five minutes afterwards a low sound like the roll of distant thunder came from the city side of aldgate it grew louder every moment it became first a noise then a roar at last the sound was articulate and distinguishable a somerset a somerset note but what had happened were they voices of papists or of gospellers all at once they came pouring out of aldgate in front colours were flying and fifes screaming and behind ran the crowd their voices drowning the fifes isoult began to think of retreating and closing her door when she caught sight of gillian brent a fictitious person her neighbours daughter who was struggling frantically to reach her mothers house being nearly carried off her feet by the press of people gillian with much difficulty fought her way through and reached isoult who had beckoned her to take refuge with her she came in almost breathless and sank upon the settle completely worn out before she had strength to speak when she was a little recovered gillian said my lord protector is quit acquitted of all ill mistress and therefore the folk be thus glad in very deed said isoult and therefore am i right glad but gillian are you certain thereof nay said she i do know no more than that all the folk say so much two hours more passed before john came home well jack said dr thorpe so soon as he heard his foot on the threshold so my lord of somerset is quit of all charges who told you so much inquired john all the folk say so answered isoult all the folk mistake then answered he sadly he is quit of high treason but that only and is cast for death note of felony and remitted again unto the tower cast for death cried dr thorpe and isoult together avery sat down with a weary air i have been all this day in westminster hall said he for i saw there mr bertie of my lady of suffolks house and he gat space for me so soon as he saw me and we stood together all the day to listen my lord of somerset pleaded his own cause like a gentleman and a christian as he is verily i never heard man speak better well said isoult then wherefore thinkest fared he ill ah dear heart replied he afore a jury of wolves a lamb should be convicted of the death of a lion who tried him asked dr thorpe my lord of northumberland himself hath been on the bench said john and it is of the act of compassing and procuring his death that my lord of somerset is held guilty knave scoundrel murderer cried dr thorpe in no softened tone jack if i were that mans physician i were sore tempted to give him a dose that should end his days and this realms troubles good friend said john smiling sadly methinks his days shall be over before the troubles of this realm but is there an other such troubler in it asked he methinks i could name two said john the devil and dr stephen gardiner dr gardiner is safe shut up he answered he may be out tomorrow said john and if not so the devil is not yet shut up nor shall be till the angel be sent with the great chain to bind him nay jack the wise doctors say that was done under constantine the emperor and we have enjoyed the same ever sithence answered he do they so replied john somewhat drily we be enjoying it now trowbut the thousand years be over and he is let out again and if he were ever shut up methinks all the little devils were left free scope nay dear friend before the kingdom the king the holy jerusalem must first come down from heaven and then there shall be no more pain neither sorrow nor crying when the two were alone john said to his wifeisoult who thinkest thou is the chief witness against my lord of somerset and he that showed this his supposed plot to the king and council tell me jack said she i cannot guess he said sir thomas palmer sometime of calais god forgive that man cried isoult growing paler he did my dear master lord lisle to deathwill he do my lord of somerset also ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake they that are so shall have their names written in heaven avery spoke solemnly and said no more note crowns were coined with either a rose or a sun on the obverse and were distinguished accordingly note machyns diary page news letter harl ms folio note the line of grey de wilton is the youngest branch of the royal house of york note john earl of warwick eldest son of northumberland had married anne eldest daughter of somerset note this ancient english shout is always spelt thus but there is reason to think that the first word was sounded ah note convicted the duke was acquitted on the first count of high treason and the people hearing the announcement not guilty supposed that the trial was ended and the duke completely acquitted chapter six a crime which was a blunder we pass the path that each man trod is dim or shall be dim with weeds what fame is left for human deeds in endless age it rests with god tennyson no ill befel lord grey de wilton there was but little laid to his chargeonly a journey to the north preceding the duke of somerset to discover who were his friends perhaps the council was ashamed to shed the blood of the man who had but lately put down the rising in cornwall and joined in raising the siege of exeter whatever the cause were he was quietly acquitted on the th of december and suffered to go home in came dr thorpe shortly before christmas carrying in his hand a new shilling see thee said he isoult look well hereon seest it well what of it doctor said she i have seen many afore dost mark it inquired he ay she answered marvelling what he meant well pursued he thou art not to speak evil of it i am not like said she innocently for these new shillings be lesser and neater than the broad shilling and they like me the rather well responded he take thou heed forewarned is forearmed but what mean you dr thorpe asked the puzzled isoult nay nay now answered the old man this dolt my lord of northumberlandthey must have missed rocking of him in his cradle this patch look thou hath taken offence at the canting name men have given to these new shillings why said she what name gave they them forsooth replied he ragged staffs and thou wist what that meaneth what a quip on my lord of northumberlands arms answered isoult yea justly said he and this sweet companion loveth not to have his arms spoke about so here is a proclamationcome out of the court of fools as i livethat no man henceforward shall speak evil of the new coin upon penalty didst ever hear such a piece of folly ay interposed john who sat reading in the chimneycorner and heard you how master latimer hath offended some time agone preaching before the king he chanced to repeat the device of the new shilling that coming pat i take it to his matter to wit timor domini fons vitae and here quoth he we have now a pretty little shilling in deed a very pretty one i have but one i think in my purse and the last day i had put it away almost for an old groat and so plucked it out of his purse and read the device to the people with the signification thereof now would you crede it there was murmuring against mr latimer of my lord of northumberlands following that he had reviled the new shilling and contemned it for no better than an old groat i do protest cried dr thorpe the world is gone mad saving you and me said john gravely i scantly know jack answered he shaking his white head methinks i shall not save you nor me long one of the strangest things in this strange world is the contrasts perpetually to be found in it while somerset lay thus under sentence of death the lord of misrule passed through london he was george ferris an old friend of the hot gospeller and a warm protestant himself yet it would be a tolerably safe guess to assert that ferris was a lutheran scarcely would a gospeller have filled that position on that day perhaps the relics of dr thorpes lutheranism were to blame for his persistent determination to have twelfth day kept with all the honours he insisted on cake and snapdragon and was rewarded for his urgency by drawing the king while kate was found to be his queen their mimic majesties were seated in two large chairs at one end of the parlour the whitehaired king laughing like a child while the little queen was as grave as a judge the snapdragon followed for which a summary abdication took place and greatly amused was the old man to find walter in abject fear of burning his fingers while kate plunged her hand into the blue flaming dish with sufficient courage for any knight in christendom the evening closed with hot cockles after which esther took possession of the children declaring with more earnestness than was her wont that they must and should not stay up another minute verily said the old doctor when they were gone if the childre must be had away then should i follow for i do feel in myself as though i were a little child tonight so you have been methinks responded isoult smiling on him for assuredly they had enjoyed far less mirth without you and now the dark cloud closed over england which was to be the one blot on the reign of our josiah poor young king he was but fourteen how could he tell the depth of iniquity that was hidden in those cold blue eyes of the man who was hunting the hapless duke of somerset to death probably there was only one man who fully fathomed it and that was the victim himself and his voice was sterling in england no more words fail in the attempt to describe what the dukes execution was to the gospellers there was not one of them from the tyne to the lands end who for the countrys sake would not joyfully have given his life for the life of somerset he was only a man and a sinful man too yet such as he was speaking after the manner of men he was the hope of the gospel cause to every gospeller it was as the last plague of egypt and to judge by the lamentations to be heard in all their houses it might have been supposed that there was not an house where there was not one dead it is not often that a whole land mourns like this among her sons england has not many darlings but those that she has she holds very dear the morning of the nd of january came know you mrs avery asked esther if the duke of somerset is like to be had afore the council again and when it shall be i would like much to see that noble gentleman if i might get a glimpse of him isoult referred the question to john but he said he had heard nothing he was going to fleet street and would see if he could find out but before he set out there came a rapping on the door and when ursula opened it there stood mr rose welcome said john to him come in and give us your news there shall be better welcome for me than them he said in his sad grave manner know you that even this day doth my lord of somerset suffer is there no help for it said dr thorpe sternly mr rose answered sadlythere is alway help from god but his help is not alway to be seen of men from men in this matter there is none help whatever remembering that he who should give it is my lord of northumberland you may ask the lion to have mercy on his newcaught prey but not john dudley upon edward seymour there is but this one barrier betwixt him and mr rose did not finish in words but a slight motion of his hands over his head note showed well enough what he meant but you count not that he would aim began dr thorpe another motion of mr rose checked his further utterance he that hath the thing in deed doth sometimes all the better without the name thereof he said quietly where dieth he saith john in a low voice upon tower hill mr rose replied i would like he answered to see him once more and hear what he will say you cannot said mr rose there hath been commandment issued that all householders except specially summoned shall keep their houses upon sore pain betwixt six and eight of the clock this morrow until all be over list there goeth six of the clock now i thought to have gone somewhat further on my way but now i must needs abide with you these two hours so they sat down and talked mournfully enough until the clock struck seven and then mr rose rising from his chair said brethren let us pray john drew the bolts and the curtains over the windows and all knelt down this morning englands heart was throbbing with pain tomorrow she would be mourning for her dead son the only man whom england trusted was dying on tower hill and this groupatoms of england and parts of englands heartwithout such guards as these they dared not pray for him thus mr rose prayed o lord glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders whose way is in the sea and whose path in the great waters and whose footsteps are not known we kneel before thee this dread morrow to beseech thee on behalf of edward seymour by thy grace and providence duke of somerset for causes unknown to us but known to thine unfathomable wisdom thou hast given leave to his enemies to triumph over him and in thy wise and good and just allowing and ordering of mens ways he is as this day cast for death we know o lord that thy judgments are right and that thou in faithfulness dost afflict and chasten man whether for sin or for correction and instruction in righteousness therefore we would not beseech thee to remove thine hand from himas even at the last moment thou wert able to dobut rather so to order this thy very awful providence that he may be strengthened for death and enabled to put his whole trust in thy mercy and in the alone merits of the bitter cross and passion of thy son our lord suffer him not to depart from thy fear nor to lose his full and entire confidence in thy mercy let not the malice of the devil neither the traitorousness and perfidiousness of his own evil heart cause him to fall short of thy heavenly calling o lord god most holy o lord god most mighty o holy and merciful saviour suffer him not in his last hour for any pains of death to fall from thee he paused a moment and all respondedamen yet he rose not but while they knelt from within the wall of the tower enclosure came a sudden tumult rushings to and fro and shouts and cries of jesu save us after a few minutes all was quiet and when all was quiet mr rose went on lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and see reveal unto this dying man the glory of thy kingdom the beauty of thyself that so he may count all things but loss that he may win christ open unto him the gates of pearl which the righteous shall enter intomake him to shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of thee o father grant him to endure this his cross for thy love and in thy strength and after to reign with thee in glory evermore he made another pausea longer one and again all responded amen during his silence came another roar from tower hill but all was again silent note the minutes passed slowly to the kneeling group it seemed a long time ere he spoke again o lord shed thy peace over the last moments of this our brother in the gospel of christin thy kingdom and patience let thy servant depart in peace suffer not satan to harass and annoy him nor the thought of his own sins to grieve and shake him fix his mind firmly upon thee and on thy christ o holy and merciful saviour suffer him not at his last hour for any pains of death to fall from thee as mr rose uttered the last word the tower guns rang out clear and sharp on the frosty morning air few sounds ever thrilled so straight to the gospellers hearts as that none uttered another word while they knelt even the amen was silent now they might pray no more for edward duke of somerset slowly one after another all rose all still in silent mourning they waited till the great clock of saint botolphs rang out eight times the next minute every door in the street was opened and men were pouring out in a mass toward aldgate then mr rose with a heavy sigh rose and held out his hand that action unloosed the tongues of the party ah god be his rest said dr thorpe meditatively he did not alway the right but do you answered mr rose pointedly enough with a quick flash in his eyes as said poor king harry kingdoms are but cares said john note he hath found a better now he hath found a better i am assured answered mr rose and is now singing the new song before the throne methinks he doth not wish himself back now i marvel suggested dr thorpe half sorrowfully yet a little scornfully how he and the queen katherine shall get along the one with the other in heaven i count old friend answered john that the lutheran queen and the gospelling duke will each be taken up too much with the mercy that hath forgiven his sins to have any leisure for counting up those of the other well they will lack something of the sort replied the old man how can there be disagreement where each seeth clear said mr rose or how any disliking in the presence of the mediator dr thorpe made no answer but he shook mr roses offered hand warmly and when he was gone he said that is a good man i would i were a better amen responded avery for us all about the middle of march came annis holland to pay her farewell visit to isoult she was a quiet gentlelooking woman rather short and inclining to embonpoint her hair black and her eyes dark grey she was to start for spain on the nd of the same month under the escort of don jeronymo a spanish gentleman in the household of the duchess of suffolk the city to which she was bound was tordesillas and there where the queen resided she was to await the orders of the marquis of denia who was her majestys comptroller annis promised to write to her friend twice every year while she remained abroad a few days after anniss departure there was a dinnerparty at the lamb the guests were mr and mrs underhill mr and mrs rose thekla and mr holland mr underhill brought bad news the king had fallen ill of smallpox and parliament was likely to be prorogued since he could no longer be present at the debates the idea that the royal presence might overawe the members and the consequent absence of the sovereign from the house excepting for state ceremonies are no older than the restoration the plantagenet and tudor kings sat in their parliaments as a matter of course after dinner mr holland who was fond of children set kate on his knee and won her heart by permitting her to chatter as freely as she pleased robin and thekla crept into a quiet corner by themselves mrs underhill made esther her especial companion and the rest sat round the fire what think you said dr thorpe to mr underhill should now hap if which god of his mercy defend this sickness of the king were to prove mortal how mean you mr underhill answered that the king should or should not provide his successor why replied dr thorpe will he shut out his sisters there are that would right gladly have him to do so whom aim you at there my lord of northumberland and other said he dr thorpe exploded as was usual with him at northumberlands name what the duke of blunderhead cried he ay i reckon he would like well to be john the second metrusteth the day that setteth the fair crown of england on that worthless head of his shall see me safe in heaven or it should go hard with me but i would pluck it thence i never can make out answered mr underhill laughing how you can be a lutheran and yet such an enemy to my lord of northumberland that is commonly counted head of the lutheran party at the least in the sense of public matters nay my word ont exclaimed he but if i thought the devil by that his proxy to be head of the lutheran party in any sense or signification whatsoever i would turn gospeller tomorrow mr underhill roared with laughter john said aside to mr rosehe is not far from it now come you are over hard on jack dudley said mr underhill he is an old friend of mine then i wish you joy of your friends replied dr thorpe in a disgusted tone adding after a minute i yet look for your answer to my question i am no prophet answered he neither a prophets son but it needeth not much power of prophecy to see that a civil war or something very like it should follow in either case suggested avery in the case of the king making no appointment he said very likely in the case of his so doing almost certain eh my masters continued dr thorpe very sadly when i was born seventyone years gone the wars of the roses were scantly over i have heard my father tell what they were trust me rather than go through such a time again i would be on my knees to god to spare it unto us ay night and day but in case no devise of the succession were made said john the lady marys grace should follow without gainsaying i take it not without gainsaying answered mr rose my lord of northumberland knoweth full well that he could not reign under her as he hath done under king edward remember she is no child but a woman ay and a woman taught by suffering also and every lutheran in the kingdom would gather round him added mr underhill round john dudley cried dr thorpe hang me if i would saving your mastership said mr underhill laughing and making him a low bow and every papist would go with the lady mary said john it were an hard choice for us how think you which way should the gospellers go which way cried mr underhill flaring up why the right way with the right heir of england and none other i asked not you ned underhill answered john smiling i know your horse and how hard you ride him i wished to question rose and holland mr rose did not answer immediately mr holland said it were an hard case yet methinks mr underhill hath the right nothing can make right wrong i take it neither wrong to be right truth yet that is scarce the question responded avery rather is it if the king made another devise of the crown who should then be the right heir ah now you are out of my depth answered mr holland this little maid and i understand each other better do we not so kate well rose inquired john prithee get mr underhill out of the house first interposed dr thorpe laughing or we shall have a pitched battle i would like nothing better said mr underhill rubbing his hands and laughing in his turn brother said mr rose turning to him the wisdom that cometh from above is peaceable but first pure answered mr underhill quickly there were little of the one if it should lack the other responded he come give us your thought cried mr underhill i will endeavour myself to keep mine hands off you and allgates if i grow very warlike avery and holland can let me from bloodshedding when i find myself in the difficulty i will replied mr rose with his quiet smile and no more could mr underhill obtain from him but he said that he would demand an answer if the occasion arose the king had no sooner recovered from the smallpox than he took the measles and the parliament seeing no hope of his speedy amendment broke up on the th of april mr rose stepped into the lamb that evening there is a point of our last weeks matter that i would like your thought upon said avery to him granted that the gospellers should make a self party and not join them with lutherans ne with papists touching public matters where think you look we for a leader mr rose shook his head we have none said he not my lord archbishop assuredly not he is by far too gentle and timid we lack a man that could stand firmnot that should give up all short of gods throne for the sake of peace nor my lord of london dr ridley is a bolder man than his superior a fine brave follow in every way yet methinks he hath in him scantly all the gear we lack and had we a command for him i misdoubt greatly if he should take it he is a man of most keen feeling and delicate judgment my lord of sussex gramercy no nature never cut him out for a general mr latimer quondam of worcester as fiery as ned underhill answered mr rose smiling indeed somewhat too lacking in caution but an old man with too little strength or endurance of bodyenough of soul nay then i see but one more continued avery and if you say nay to him also i have done what think you of my lords grace of suffolk unstable as water thou shalt not excel he answered a man weak as any child and as easily led astray if he be your head avery i would say it were scarce worth to turn out for the cause you would have an halter round your neck in a week well responded john i cannot see any other i cannot see any was mr roses answer then we have no leader said dr thorpe despondently dr thorpe was beginning to say we when he meant the gospellers we have no leader said mr rose we had onean heavenborn onethe only man to whose standard saving a faction all england should have mustered the only man whose trumpet should have reached every heart and but three months gone his blood reddened the surfeited earth upon tower hill friends men may come to look upon that loss as upon a loss never to be amended trust me we have not seen the worst yet if it should be as you guessand that may well bethere shall yet be a bitterer wail of mourning yet a cry of agony ringing to the heaven for the lack of edward seymour ay i am afeard the black clouds be not done opening themselves yet sadly replied john i think they have scantly done gathering answered he the breaking the tempest cometh on apace but it is not yet come when shall it come think you said dr thorpe shortly he answered a word in your ear the king is more grievous sick than men wot of he may tide over this his malady very like he will but he hath no power within him to do battle with such disorders his strength is worn out he is scarce like to outlive an other nay my master worn out at fourteen cried dr thorpe men reckon time by days god by endurance said mr rose mournfully and this boy hath borne these three years more than you or i wot of the sword is too sharp for the scabbard it may be we have hardly known how to rate his true worth or it may be that his work is over either way it shall not be long now ere he enter into gods rest and his ay i know it is a woeful saying yet again i say it king edward is worn out at fourteen we may not seek to keep him but this i am assured the angels call to him shall be the signal for a fearful contest in the realm he leaveth god defend the right and god strengthen and comfort us for i warn you we shall need it alack when shall all this end sighed isoult when christ cometh again answered mr rose no sooner she cried no sooner said he there may be gleams of light before then but there can be no full day ere the sun arise there may be long times of ease and exemption from persecution but there can be no stable settlement no lasting peace till he appear who is our peace he that is born after the flesh must persecute him that is born after the spirit if ye were of the world the world would love his own it is because we are not of the world that the world hateth us sister let us comfort ourselves and one another with these words christ will not fail us see we that we fail not him we may yet be called to go with him both into prison and to death it may be that the lord hath need of us after this manner if it be so let us march bravely in his martyr train we must never allow his banner to fall unto the dust nor tremble to give our worthless lives for him that bought us with his own if we can keep our eyes steady on the glory that shall follow the black river will be easier to cross the chariot of fire less hard to mount and remember he can carry us over in his arms that the cold waters touch not so much as our feet when mr rose was gone john said his voice a little brokenwill he be a martyr god avert it cried isoult child said dr thorpe solemnly tis of such stuff as his that martyrs be made but the kings work was not yet quite finished he recovered from his double illness the londoners were terrified in the beginning of june by what they regarded as a fearful sign from heavena shower of what is commonly known as red rain in their eyes it was blood and a presage of dreadful slaughter the slaughter followed whatever the shower might mean the last year of rest was at hand what say you to my lord of northampton suddenly inquired john avery of mr rose one morning when they met in the strand it was an odd and abrupt beginning of conversation but mr rose understood its meaning only too well the thoughts of the gospellers were running chiefly now on the dark future and their own disorganised condition what had nehemiah said in the like accident to sanballat was his suggestive answer the papists who were not disorganised and had no reason to fear the future were busy catching dolphinsanother portentwhich made their appearance at london bridge in august the new servicebook as its contemporaries called itthe second prayer book of edward the sixth as we call itwas used for the first time in saint pauls cathedral on all saints day november bishop ridleys voice was the first that read it and he took the whole duty himself and preached in the choir habited only in his rochet in the afternoon he preached at the crosswhat was then called a long sermonabout three hours my lord mayor who ought to have been present was conspicuous by his absence when remonstrated with that dignitary observed that bishop ridleys sermons were alway so long that he would be at no more for he was aweary of so long standing wherein my lord mayor anticipated the nineteenth century though it sits out the sermon on cushions and rarely is called upon to lend its ears for onethird of the time which he was expected to do dr thorpe was not far wrong in the conclusion at which he arrivedthat my lord mayors heart passed his legs for stiffness the early winter of brought the first letter from annis holland to the hands of my right worthy mistress and most singular dear friend mistress avery dwelling at the sign of the lamb in the minories without aldgate by london give these my right dearly beloved isoultafter my most loving commendations remembered this shall be to advertise thee of my safe landing in the city of santander in spain and my coming unto the queens highness court at tordesillas so much as to set down the names of all the towns i have passed betwixt the two will i not essay it hath been a wearyful journey and a long yet should have been a pleasant one but for the lack of victual the strangest land ever i did see or think to see is this the poor men hereaway dwell in good houses and lack meat the rich dwell in yet fairer and eat very trumpery i saw not in all my life in england so much olive oil as in one week sithence i came into spain what i am for to live upon here i do marvel cheese they have and onions by the cartload but they eat not but little meat and that all strings a tender piece thereof have i not yet seen and for ale they drink red wine such messes as they do make in their cooking like me very ill but i trow i shall be seasoned thereto in due time the first night we came to this city which is sixteen days gone master jeronymo that hath showed me much courtesy and had a very great care of me brought me into the house of a gentleman his kinsman whose name is don diego de mendoza fictitious person which is to say master james mendoza this don diego is a rare courtier all bows smiles and courtesies and madam isabel his wife fictitious person cometh not far behind and which i cannot away with she is not called dona isabel de mendoza after the name of her husband but cleaveth to her own as though she were yet a maid and is called of all men dona isabel de alameda methought this marvellous strange but this master jeronymo telleth me is the custom of his country and our fashion of names is to the full as strange to them so when we came into the house which is builded with pillars around the court and a fountain in the midst right fair to see master jeronymo leadeth me forward and courtesieth wellnigh down to the ground quoth he to don diegosenor and my cousin i beseech the high favour of kissing your hand and to dona isabelsenora and my cousin i entreat you to bestow upon me the soles of your feet note verily i marvelled at such words but dona isabel in return louteth down to the earth withsenor i am your entirely undeserving scullion i beg of you the unspeakable honour to present me to the serenity of the most highlyborn lady beside you marry thought i how shall i ever dwell in a land where they talk thus but i was not yet at the end of mine amaze master jeronymo answerssenora this english damsel which hath the great happiness to kiss your feet is the most excellent senora dona ines note de olanda marry i never thought to see my name cut up after such a fashion that shall have the weight of honour to be writer of the english tongue unto our most serene lady the queen dona juana then madam isabel louteth down again to the floor sayingsenora i have the delightsomeness to be your most humble and lowly servingmaid this your house is wholly at your disposalmaster jeronymo quoth i in english i pray you tell me what i must saysay answereth he that you are the senoras highly favoured slave and are not worthy to stand at the threshold of her door eh isoult dear heart what a land is this master jeronymo said unto me afterward that this his cousin would be very good unto me in her meaning for the spaniards say not that of their house being yours without they mean much grace and kindness unto you well after this madam isabel took me away with her into an other chamber where she gave me a cup of red wine and some cakes that were not ill to take and in this chamber were great cushions spread all about the floor like unto the mattress of a bed the cushions of velvet and verder a species of tapestry and the floor of marble upon these she desired me to repose me for a season and saith she at seven of the clock mine excellent cousin don jeronymo and my lord don diego and i your servant shall take you up to the castle into the most ineffable presence of the most glorious lord marquis of denia o rare thought i if the queens comptroller be so glorious and of so ineffable a presence what shall his mistress be so when even came my senora madam isabel having meantime reposed and slumbered on the cushions i shifted me into my best and richest apparel for to enter this ineffable presence and went up unto the castle don diego leading me by the hand and madam isabel coming after with master jeronymo this was but across the court for no sooner had i reached the door than what should i see but two mules richlycaparisoned there standing i was somewhat surprised for the castle is but a stones throw from the house but master jeronymo seeing my look whispereth unto me that in spain ladies of any sort ladies of rank do ride when they go of a journey be it but ten yards methought it scarce worth the trouble to mount the mule for to light off him again so soon howbeit i did as i was bid madam isabel suffered her lord to lift her upon the other and away hied we for the castle our cavaliers awalking behind when we light and the portcullis was drawn up master jeronymo prayeth the porter to send word unto the ineffable lord comptroller that the english damsel sent hither by the most noble lady dona catalina so they call my lady of suffolks grace doth entreat for leave to kiss the dust under his feet this is their country mode but i do ensure thee i had been little gladded for leave to kiss the dust and it doth yet tickle mine ears whensoever i hear it so up the stairs went we through a fair court bordered with orangetrees into a brave chamber hung about with silk and all over the floor a carpet of verder spread here we awaited a season at the end whereof come in three or four gentlemen in brave array before the foremost whereof all we bowed down to the ground this was mine ineffable lord marquis a tall personable gentleman he is something stiff and stately senora saith he inclining him unto us you are welcome as the light and raising him up he called in a loud voice for the senora gomez come forth from the chamber beyond a middleaged dame apparelled in black take this lady to her chamber saith he dona ines is her name and remember what i told you so i took my leave of master jeronymo and of don diego and dona isabel with many protestations and loutings and again making low reverence unto my lord marquis away hied i with madam gomez she led me on by so many lobbies one after the other that methought we should never make an end and come to a chamber but once when i would have spoken she checked me with a finger on the lip at last she turned into a fair large chamber well hung and garnished she shut to the door and then her lips unclosed here senora is your chamber saith she two small alcoves for sleeping be on the right for yourself and your bowerwoman you have been looked for of long time and she awaiteth you i will send her to you when i depart i thank you quoth i may i pray you of her name her name she answered is maria porcina the which should in english be mary littlepig methought it an unfair name it will please you she went on to speak but lowly seeing your chamber is nigh unto those of our lady i thought that should please me but little senora quoth i shall i have the honour to see the queens grace at supper think you the senora gomez looked at me then she went to the door and drew the bolt and let back the curtain that was over the door this done she came back and sat in the window senora she saith in a voice little above a whisper to the world outside we do not tell secrets but unto a damsel so wise and discreet as your serenity i will not fear to speak freely much methought she knew of my discretion you desire to know if you shall see our lady this even no you will never see her but said i i am come hither to read and write english for her highness you are come to read and write for the lord marquis she answered not for her certes said i that was not told me it is never told to any she replied but what is the secret i pray your excellency i asked is the queens highness sick that she is never seen she is mad answered she god have mercy on her cried i y la santisima and the most holy virgin saith she that is what is said to the world be you ware dona ines that you gainsay it not mean you that it is not true cried i i mean quoth she that my lord marquis of denia is master here and is an ill one to offend say as he saiththat is our rule then said i there is somewhat behind which men may not know behind she saith with a low crafty laugh that it liked me not to hear ay there is don carlos the emperor son of our lady behind the lord marquis have a care what you do and say con el rey y la inquisicion chiton which is a spanish saw proverb meaning be silent touching the king and the inquisition and if you speak unadvisedly of the one you may find you within the walls of the other i speak in kindness senora and of what i know this palace is not all bowers and gardens there be dungeons beneath those bowers deep and dark santa maria defend us you tread on mineshold your peace i thank you senora for your warning answered i go with god and rest with him she answered vaya or quede usted con dios in this fashion do the spaniards take their leave then she left me isoult dear heart i am well assured herefrom that this is an evil place and my lord of denia an ill man but there is yet more to tell thee when i went down to supper i there found my lord and lady of denia fray juan de avila confessor to her highness and her graces bowerwomen whose names be dona ximena de lara fictitious a young damsel i hear of very high degree that is stately and silent dona catalina de la moraleja fictitious a middleaged dame grave and sedate dona leonor gomez of whom i have spoken and dona rosada de las penas fictitious a young maid of gentle and kindly look and if thou wouldst have their names in englishximena i cannot interpret therein for it is a name particular unto these parts but the others should be katherine note and eleanor and rose dona leonor gomez i do find will be saddest of any when my lords or the confessors eyes be upon her but will talk away like very water let out when she hath one alone it was some days ere i was called to any work the tuesday thereafter my lord marquis sent for me to read a letter come to him from england twas but filled with compliments and fair wordsscarce worth the sending methought very grave is this lord marquis yet extreme courteous withal as i stood areading come in fray juan how fareth her highness asks my lord she requires you answered the friar i go his lordship made answer is it the premia the friar shrugged up his shoulders but said nought and my lord so soon as i had made an end of reading sent me away quickly note now i marvelled much what they meant seeing that premia signifieth a reward or kindness done unto one and wherefore that should be i knew not when i was in my chamber i asked maria what premia meant this is a good kindly simple lass i have senora said she it signifieth a reward and she plainly knew of no other signification but in the night i was waked from my sleep by the dreadfullest sound ever i heard surely i was deceived but it did seem to me like shrieks of some poor wretch in mortal pain maria awaked also and sitting up in her bed she cries under her breath all the saints preserve us what can it be said i senora quoth she may it please your serenity i know not i have heard it once afore some time gone but none would tell me the cause thereof methinks the castle is haunted by goblins and she fell to crossing her and saying ave marys by the score the screaming ceased not for some time and then by degrees but i slept not again the morrow after came dona leonor into my chamber and after some talk on things indifferent she saith did aught disturb you this night dona leonor what was it said i what heard you dona ines quoth she why said i horrible screaming like unto the shrieks of a soul in purgatory we hear them sometimes she answered but what is it i repeated dona ines said she there are things not to be spoken about but do not you fancy that the castle is haunted by goblins and not an other word might i have from her but i am assured there is some terrible matter afoot in this palace and i would i were safe thereout i must close my letter somewhat shortly for dona isabel de alameda that promised me to send it with one of hers that goeth to cales cadiz hath sent her brothers son don juan de alameda fictitious to request the same and i must not keep him awaiting be not thou disturbed dear heart god is as near to tordesillas as to london and he is stronger than all evil men and devils unto his keeping i commend thee from tordesillas this monday thine own to her little power annis holland i pray thee make my commendations unto mr avery and all thine when christmas day came the averys did what half london was doing they walked down to westminster to the great pulpit set up in the kings garden into the pulpit came a rather tall spare old man with a wrinkled face a large roman nose shaggy eyebrows and radiant shining eyes and before the sermon was over the eyes had kindled with a live coal from the altar of the lord and the firm voice was ringing clearly to every corner of that vast gathering the preacher was hugh latimer he was about to leave london the next morning for grimsthorpe where he had undertaken at the request of the duchess of suffolk to deliver to her and her household a series of lectures on the lords prayer after the sermon those quick bright eyes speedily found out edward underhill and the old man came down from the pulpit and shook hands with him then he turned to isoult avery who stood near he remembered meeting her at ampthill and guildford some ten years before and he blessed her and asked what family she had and when she told him three he said god bless them and make them his childre then he laid his hand upon little kates head and blessed her and then away walking with a quick firm step like a man whose work was but half done with augustine bernher behind him carrying the old mans bible this year saint nicholas went not about the ceremony had previously taken place on his eve december when the priests carried his image round from house to house and gave small presents to the children as from the saint the modern american custom of santa claus is a relic of the old procession of saint nicholas though the dutch form of the name shows it to have been derived not from the english but the dutch settlers kates protestantism was not yet sufficiently intelligent to prevent her from regretting saint nicholas but dr thorpe coaxed esther to make a handful of sugarplums whereon he regaled his disappointed pet the close of the year brought treats for both parents and children at saint pauls bishop ridley preached for five evenings together and at cheapside with the new year came the lord of misruleagain george ferrismaking his proclamations and dining in state with the lord mayor and at shene my lord of northumberland founded the first hothouse and presented a nosegay of living flowers to the king on new years day so in flowers and laughter came in the awful year most awful year of all the century one morning in january as isoult stood waiting for john to go with him to latimers sermon who should walk in but philippa basset whose stay in cheshire had been much longer than she anticipated she brought many a scrap of northern news and lady bridgets loving commendations to isoult and whither away asked she truly said isoult to the kings garden to hear mr latimer preach marry said she i did never yet hear that mighty gospeller have i will go with you an you will take me with a very good will said isoult so she went with them and listened to latimers sermon wherein there were some things which isoult felt would vex her for the subject was praying to saints and he said invocation declareth an omnipotency but not a word could isoult get from her when they came home for she stayed and dined with them which showed how she liked it only she would say the man speaketh well he hath good choice of words and similar phrases but on all points concerning his doctrine she kept silence as isoult sat at her sewing the next morning with walter at his hornbook and kate at her arithmetic beside her a rap on the door brought ursula to open it isoult fancied she knew the voice which asked if mistress avery there dwelt but she could not think all at once whose it was yet the minute she came into the chamber she well knew her old friend and colleague beatrice vivian beatrice was fair and rosy and looked well and happy as she said she was so when the ladies had sat and talked a little and beatrice had kissed the children and told isoult that she had two whose names were muriel and alice and that mr vivian was well and other details she said isoult i have news for thee which by thy leave i will have thee to guess is it good or bad said isoult why good i hope said beatrice tis a wedding and both bride and bridegroom we know dear heart sighed isoult i am an ill guesser as thou wist of old is it mr dynham fictitious person what my brother leonard said she nay sweet heart he hath been wed these six years is it over or to come over this new year or should be answered beatrice dost thou lack help what thinkest of my lady of suffolk her own self the date is fictitious it was probably about christmas beatrice dear heart cried isoult thou meanest not that ay but i do said she laughing and now whom hath her grace wedded i would guess said isoult some gentleman of great riches and very high degree well as to riches she answered i fancy he hath hitherto earned every penny he hath spent and in respect of degree hath been used to the holding of his mistress stirrup canst thou guess now mr bertie cried isoult in amazement surely no surely so answered beatrice again laughing her grace of suffolk and mr bertie be now man and wife and for my poor opinion methinks she hath chosen well for her own comfort i am rarely glad to hear it isoult answered so think i likewise but for all that she was exceedingly surprised there was some murmuring in may the duke of northumberland in the kings name had ordered all

amazed him afterward to see it in his neighbours but now when the project reached open burglary his anger found vent in hotter words lo you now this cutpurse hath got his hand into an other mans

trumpets there were flashings of jewels set where jewels should flash no more white bridal robes soon to be drenched in blood ghostly crowns glimmering for an instant over heads that should be laid upon the block ere one poor year were over man proposed and god disposed the incorruptible crown was the fairer and brighter the last brilliant day which england was to know before that tempest broke dawned on the morning of the st of may early on that day all london was astir three noble marriages were to be celebrated at durham house in the kings presence and to durham house london was crowding to see the sight among the crowd were john avery dr thorpe and robin isoult had declined to run the risk of having the clothes torn off her back or herself squeezed into a mummy and it was agreed on all sides that there would be danger in taking the children but nothing could keep dr thorpe at homenot even a sharp attack of rheumatism from which he had been suffering more or less all the spring mr underhill of course would be there in his place as gentleman pensioner and after a good deal of pressing from more than one of his friends a dubious consent to go if he could find time had been wrung from mr rose the bridegrooms and brides were apportioned in the following order the lady jane grey to lord guilford dudley the lady katherine grey to lord herbert of pembroke the lady katherine dudley to lord hastings note it was six oclock before any of the birds flew home and the first to come was john avery who said he had left robin in charge of dr thorpeor dr thorpe in charge of robin as it may please thee to take it i know not when they will be back in all my life did i never see a man so unweary and unwearyable as that our old friend and what hast thou seen jack said isoult three very fine ladies and three very fine gentlemen answered he with a great many more ladies and gentlemen not quite so fine what ware they asked kate was the king there isoult inquired what ware they moppet said john taking up kate why many a yard of cloth of gold and satin and velvet and i cannot tell thee what else they were as fine as ever the tailor could make themay dear heart the king was there but his voice changed so that isoult could read in it a whole volume of bad news is he sick then as we heard she asked hardly he answered in a low voice say rather dying o jack cried she o isoult if thou hadst seen him said he his voice quivering the fierce unnatural radiance in those soft meek grey eyes as though there were a fire consuming him within the sickly deadwhite colour of his face with burning red spots on the cheeks the languor and disease of his manner ever leaning his head upon his hand as though he could scarce bear it up and when he smiledi might scantly endure to look on him and above all this the hollow cough that ever brake the silence and seemed wellnigh to tear his delicate frame in twainit was enough to make a strong man weep but tell me all about it cried kate laying her little hand upon her fathers face to make him turn round to her i want to know all about it how old are these great ladies and what are they like to and what ware they was it blue or red or green john turned to her with a smile and his manner changed again what a little queen art thou said he well i must needs strive to content thy majesty how old are the ladies that were married well the lady jane is the eldest and she is i take it sixteen or seventeen years of age she looketh something elder than her years yet rather in her grave quiet manner than in her face then her sister the lady katherine is nigh fourteen and the years of my lady katherine dudley i know not item what are they like unto that was the next question methinks ay replied kate which is the nicest which thou shouldst think the nicest i cannot tell said john but in so far as mine opinion lieth the lady janes face liked me the best maybe my lady kate dudley should have stricken thy fancy the rather for she ware a mighty brave blue satin gown and her face was all smiles and mirth and what ware the other the lady jane and her sister were both donned in white velvet and what colour were their hoods my lady katherine dudleys ambercolour set with sapphires the other ruby velvet and their jewels rubies and who married them jack asked isoult bishop ridley body o me who ever looked at bishop ridley i would like to know cried dr thorpe coming halting in as though he had hurt himself isoult if thou canst ever get my left shoe off i will give thee a gold angelet halfangel in other words a gold crown yonder dolt of a shoemaker hath pinched me like a pasty but o the brave doings tis enough to make a man set off to church and be married himself and the old man sat down in a great chair i will strive to earn it doctor said isoult laughing as she sat down on the hearth before him and took his lame foot in her lap art thou weary robin not much said robin smiling the shoemaker did not pinch me beshrew him for an owl that he did not answered dr thorpe testily thou hadst stood it the better eh child if thou hadst seen the mind thy ways isoultthe brave gear and the jewels and the gold chains and the estate note and the plumes anodding right down oh his shoe hurt him in coming off and he sat rubbing his foot was mr rose there said isoult when they had finished laughing no said robin and mr underhill ay that was he in the bravest and marvellousest velvet gown ever thou sawest in all thy days and a doublet and slop very wide breeches introduced from holland of satin and a gold chain thick enough to tie up a dog with and there sweet heart was my most gracious lord of northumberlandin a claret velvet gown sewed with gold braidand for as many inches as could be found of the plain velvet in that gown i will give any man so many nobles there was not one and the bonnet in s handwith a great ruby for a buttonand all set with seedpearland the jewels in the hilt ofs swordand great rubies in face of his shoes the dolt and patch that he is i do believe dr thorpe had beheaded my lord of northumberland said john laughing if that sword had been in his belt in lieu of the other i never saw him afore replied he and i never do desire to see him again he looketh the rogue then a stronger word than now that he is and now as a physician what think you of the king asked john sadly i will give him three months to die in was dr thorpes short and woeful answer by the second of july england knew that the king was dying no longer could there be any question of the sorrowful truth he was at greenwich palace archbishop cranmer and bishop ridley in frequent waiting on him and summons was sent to his sisters to come quickly on the rd of july which was sunday dr ridley preached at the cross where he dimly foreshadowed the disposition of the crown that was coming all who heard him were much astonished for not a word had crept out before it was plain from what he said that the kings sisters were to be passed over to the no little surprise of all who knew his love for the princess elizabeth but it was not plain who was to come instead and the rumour ran that it would be the lady frances duchess of suffolk the niece of king henry and mother of the lady jane grey on the evening of the th of july came a comforting rumour that the king was better and a hope sprang up that he would yet recover those who knew the duke of northumberland might have guessed at treachery in truth the king died that day but the duke kept it secret until he thought his plans secure for the lady janes succession on the morning of the th of july came dr thorpe in great haste from the barbers isoult cried he tie thine hood and bring the childre what is now to do said she to herself but she tied on her hood and brought down the children with her where be jack and robin asked the old man they went forth to westminster together half an hour gone said isoult they must shift for themselves then said he come away but whither doctor she wished to know down to the river side by saint katherines with all the haste that may be answered he isoult the king is dead and the lady jane dudley proclaimed queen of england and she cometh apace from shene to the tower we may chance to see her land if we lose no time the king dead isoult said no more but away they ran down the street till they reached saint katherine by the tower a crowd of people were already there they took up their places by the church whence they could see the river and they had not been there two minutes ere they heard a sound of cheering from the watermen below and presently the royal barge of england glided into sight at the bow played the standard of the realm and about the cloth of estate were several ladies and gentlemen all clad in mourning surrounding a lady who sat under the canopy this was all that could be seen till the barge stopped at the towerstairs then from it a blue cloth being first laid to the gate came the duke of northumberland robed in a long black gown trimmed with fox leading a fair slender girl also in mourning and frances duchess of suffolk note bore her train after them came the duke of suffolk the earl of arundel a slim comely youth unknown to the crowd and lord grey de wilton and the minute after from the crowd thronging the postern mr ive the high constable mr underhills friend and neighbour at the lime hurst made his way to our little group ah how do you said he you are in fair time to see our new queen i pray you mr ive said isoult is yonder damsel her highness that my lords grace of northumberland hath by the hand even so replied he and yonder young gentleman that followeth is her husband the lord guilford dudley very earnestly they looked then on the face of their new sovereign a soft gentle face fair and clear complexion brown hair and meek thoughtful brown eyes and eyes that had shed tears but very lately but northumberland bore himself proudly as though he felt himself a king already and very few voices said god save queen jane isoult did hear a few but few they were in the evening throughout the city and without the gates was the new queen proclaimed it was now known that the king had died on the thursday previous and that northumberland had kept the matter secret until he thought janes succession ensured and by letters patent dated the st of june king edward had bequeathed the realm to the heirsmale of his cousin the lady frances duchess of suffolk and should she have no heirsmale before his death the reversion was to pass to her eldest daughter the lady jane dudley now queen and for lack of her issue to her cousin lady margaret clifford the sisters of jane were passed over and also the princesses mary and elizabeth sisters of the late king all the queens officers and her council were sworn to serve her on the th of july and troops were sent to take the lady mary who had already been proclaimed queen at kenninghall in norfolk every body was glad to see mr rose come in that evening well said he we are well into a new reign thank god for a protestant prince there underhill shall run a tilt with you said john smiling my friend had the lady mary not been exempted of the king her brother i had bowed to her sceptre said mr rose but she is lawfully put forth and queen jane as lawfully proclaimed who talks treason here cried mr underhills voice behind which all dreaded to hear what say yougod save queen jane i say god save queen mary i serve not my lord of northumberland for all the papists nick give me the nickname me his spy i have not proclaimed king johnwhereof as all men do know queen jane is but the feminine i am a servant of the queens majesty that reigneth by right and that queen is mary god defend the right as assuredly he will mr rose looked quietly on him you may live to forethink regret the setting of her up if it were so was all he said i may live to be sorry she was ever born answered mr underhill i know that father rose but right is right and wrong is wrong and i say this is a wrong and i stand forth for the right gods will is the right gently answered mr rose let us not fight against god and be you ware you do not cried mr underhill in his ringing voice how look you to know what his will is herein we shall all know that ere it be long said mr rose sadly on the th of july exact date unrecorded was born guilford underhill mr underhills eldest son he had already five daughters the th was appointed for christening the child and the sponsors were the queen that is to say lady jane her father the duke of suffolk and the earl of pembroke john avery was greatly amused that mr underhill should believe the lady jane had no right to be queen and yet because she was queen would have her his childs sponsor it was an instance of the consistent inconsistency inherent in human nature the th of july was a day of contrary rumours and great trouble and running to and fro in the streets of the city from all sides news poured in that the lady mary was proclaimed queenat kenninghall and framlingham and norwich and in all the eastern parts the council would have sent the duke of suffolk against her but lady jane his daughter entreated with tears that he might remain with her and they then sent the duke of northumberland he and lord grey de wilton who went unwillingly being of mr underhills way of thinking set forth on the th with six hundred men that evening came news that mary was proclaimed in buckinghamshire on the th at seven oclock at night the gates of the tower were suddenly locked and the keys carried to lady jane this was to secure the lord treasurer the marquis of winchester who was considered of doubtful faith and proved to be as he was considered as the party reached saint katherines on their way to the christening the lords of the council were just riding out of the western gate of the tower these were the earls of pembroke shrewsbury and arundel the lord warden of the cinque ports the lord mayor and sundry knights the duke of suffolk was left behind the truth was that he would have been in the way the council said that it was going to give audience to the french ambassador but it was really bound on a very different errand lady throgmorton was the queens deputy at the christening and named the child guilford named for a dudley whispered the irrepressible dr thorpe to isoult he will not thrive take my word for itunless he turn out a rascal before the ceremony was ended a great noise was heard in the city shouting singing and roaring all together the baptism over lady throgmorton returned into the tower and the rest of the party went on to the lamb where they were all going to pass the afternoon mistress helen ive a fictitious person the high constables daughter carried the baby and accompanied isoult but mr ive said he would go up to aldgate and see what all the tumult had been so away he went while the others rested and talked and ate alebrew ale and bread sometimes called aleberry and spiced cake and kate was wonderfully pleased with the baby all at once as they sat thus mr ive returned his face showing that he brought strange tidings they have proclaimed queen mary he cried breathlessly who have asked mr underhill turning round the lords of the council answered he robin hoods tales cried mr underhill tis truth responded mr ive the council of queen jane to proclaim queen mary said mr underhill scornfully ive you are mad as a march hare bate me an ace quoth bolton said dr thorpe shrugging his shoulders bate your aces and catch your march hares answered mr ive who took all this banter very pleasantly but this is truth that i do tell you an hour gone we being in the church when we heard that mighty bruit from the city was queen mary proclaimed in cheapside by the council their audience to the french kings ambassador was but a feint to get well and all together out of the tower and when they came to the chepe they called an halt and my lord of arundel stepping forwards did there in the hearing of all the people proclaimmary by the grace of god of england france and ireland queenand so forth and no sooner said than every man in the street flung up his cap and the people cheered as they had gone mad for joy the earl of pembroke threw down in the street his cap full of angelets my word ont but i would walter had been there to run about and gather them up said dr thorpe we might have gleaned that comfort thence at least and at the windows of many houses in the city continued mr ive money was thrown out and bonfires all along the chepe and poultry be alighting and at all the gates and in cornhill and fleet street and aldersgate street and i know not where else and say they such shouting crying and singing of the people ringing of bells playing of organs tables of meal and drink setting forth in every street and such racket and bruit as a man might scantly hear his own voice and after the proclamation in cheapside all the council rade to poules and there was te deum to be sung at evensong but who be they cried mr underhill who told you all this jolly tale the keeper of aldgate and your friend mr newman and george ferris and divers other i gat not all from one man newman and ferris then it is true murmured mr underhill very gravely it was true before night they knew all concerning this deed of treachery andlast and worst of allno sooner did the duke of suffolk within the tower hear that the council had proclaimed queen mary without than out he came upon the hill and saying he was but one man and would not withstand all the council proclaimed queen mary on tower hill to the ruin of his own daughter and then went into london leaving poor lady jane almost alone in the towerfor only lord guilford and the duchess of northumberland and lady throgmorton and her husband sir nicholas and sir john bridges were left with her and when lady throgmorton returned from saint katherines to the tower she found the cloth of estate already taken down and all changed and when she would have quitted the tower again she was not permitted to do so that evening there was a gathering at the lamb mr underhill stayed to rejoice mr rose came to mourn philippa basset came to rail and mr holland came to pacify them and no very soft nor sweet words were bestowed on lord sussex by mr holland whose words were not all peace nor on lord arundel by mr rose nor on lord grey by mr underhill nor on the duke of suffolk by any body nor on any body by philippa only to one no hard words were given by any and that was the lady jane whom all united to excuse and pity but all agreed in calling lord arundel a traitor and suffolk a man too weak and pitiful to be blamed all hope of the lady janes success was now gone the duke of northumberland himself proclaimed queen mary when he discovered it but notwithstanding this feeble attempt to curry favour on the nd he was apprehended at cambridge lord grey de wilton and others who submitted themselves early were pardoned lady jane lord guilford and those with them were kept prisoners in the tower towards the end of july isoult and esther were coming along the riverside by the tower when they saw a great crowd shouting and running towards them neither john nor robin being with them isoult was rather frightened and turned aside into the porch of saint katherines for safety but when they came nearer she saw that here were the prisoners borne under guard to the tower first rode the traitor earl of arundel who had them in his guard and had he received his deserts he would have been among them and after him riding upon horses their bridles tied to those of the guards came the duke of northumberland his sons the earl of warwick lord ambrose and lord henry dudley lord huntingdon lord hastings sir john gates and his brother sir henry sir andrew dudley brother to the duke and dr sands chancellor of cambridge but when isoult saw the face of the last prisoner she was unspeakably startled esther asked if she were ill for said she you look ever so white and faint it was no wonder when she looked up into the unforgotten face of sir thomas palmer thirteen years had passed since she saw him but isoult knew him in a moment all the old calais memories came flashing back on her like an overwhelming flood drowning the newer evil he had done as she saw this man who had persecuted the saints of god who had done the duke of somerset to death who had been one of the four destroyers of her beloved masterled to his prison and to his suffering in turn sir thomas looked at isoult as he passed seeing her eyes fixed on him but it was the look of a stranger to a stranger the storm broke now few days passed unmarked by fresh arrests the phrase the queen had almost insensibly passed from jane to mary but for a little while yet the crisis was political not religious when the danger was over and before mary reached her metropolis the scene was shifted and the first protestant arrest took place and so sudden and unexpected was the blow that it fell upon the gospellers like a thunderbolt thirty hours had barely elapsed since her meeting with sir thomas palmer when isoult coming down into the parlour heard her husbands voice say sorrowfullyay this is the beginning of sorrows is there any more news cried isoult fearfully for fresh news then meant bad news the worst we have had yet he said the bishop of london is committed to the tower and that all suddenly with scantly a minutes warning added dr thorpe woe worth the day she wailed ay thou mayest say so answered he god grant this be not the first step of a longer and dreader persecution than we have yet known on friday the duke of suffolk was brought to the tower where his hapless daughter remained a prisoner but on the monday following suffolk was released to ease the tower dungeons which must now be chokefull suggested dr thorpe or it may be the queen thought him a sely harmless simple fellow not worth the turning of an axe edge the queens grand entry into london took place on the rd of august there was no need for any in the minories to go far to see her for she came to them riding down shoreditch and in at aldgate she was preceded by a guard of seven hundred and forty velvet coats then rode that honourable man my lord of arundel bearing in his hand the sword of state then after reaching aldgate the lord mayor then the queen royally arrayed riding by herself on a richlycaparisoned barb sir anthony browne bearing up her train what were the thoughts of that longpersecuted woman now in her turn to become a persecutor then followed her sister the lady elizabeth what too were her thoughts after the royal sisters rode elizabeth stafford wife of the imprisoned duke of norfolk and gertrude marchioness of exeter mother of the imprisoned edward courtenay ladies and gentlemen followed to the number of a hundred and eighty lastly came the guard with a crowd of men from northampton buckingham and oxford shires all in armour and the peers servants the number of horsemen we are assured was about ten thousand and when the queen came to the tower there beside the gate kneeling upon the tower green were the old prisoners of her father and brother the old duke of norfolk and dr stephen gardiner and the duchess of somerset and the young lord courtenay who had scarcely ever been out of the tower in his life they kneeling there saluted her and no sooner had the queen alighted than she went to them and kissed them and said these are my prisoners the timeserving earl of pembroke had been ordered to wait upon the queen but was too terrified to obey he felt himself too deeply compromised for pardon one point however he was careful not to neglect his son lord herbert was divorced in all haste and fear from lady katherine grey the hapless sister of the nine days queen on saturday night mr underhill walked into the lamb and tacitly asked himself to supper he was in feverish delight the good cause hath triumphed and queen mary being known to be of merciful complexion i cast no doubt all shall be spared that can be deluded man but he was quickly to be undeceived in a very personal manner but meantime responded john avery some are being spared that should not beall them that have troubled the realm in king edwards time or yet sooner bishop day is delivered and bishop bonner not only delivered but restored to his see and shall henceforth be bishop of london in the stead of dr ridley and what shall become of that our good bishop no man knoweth moreover bishop tunstal is delivered out of prison and dr gardiner woe worth the day was this morrow sworn of the council howso merciful be the queen the council shall be little that way inclined if they have him amongst them it was not yet dinnertime on the following morning when barbara came upstairs to tell her mistress that mrs helen ive wished to see her her first words were ominous mrs avery i come from the lime hurst with rare ill tidings alack said isoult is mistress underhill worser or the little babe sick neither said she but mr underhill is in newgate mr underhill cried isoult for what cause god knoweth and they that have him said she for the rest i wis not whether he know himself but he was taken in the midst of the night being ten of the clock and after long trial by the council is now sent unto newgate the sheriff of middlesex come unto my fathers house thus late and brake the matter to my father whom he desired to go with him as being mr underhills very friend and my father did entreat him to leave him go and fetch his prisoner for frightening of mrs underhill in her weakness so my father followed of the sheriff and his men bearing bills and glaives knocked on the door and there came one to the door unto whom he desired that he should ask mr underhill to come out but upon this he heard mr underhills voice calling to him to go within so he went within and found mr underhill in his bed who demanding of him in his merry fashion what he did breaking into a mans house at that hour of the night my father answered him that the sheriff and with him a great company were come to fetch him upon which mr underhill rose and made him ready and willing not that mistress underhill should know anything of the matter he would not go into her chamber for any other gear but cast about him such as he had there which was a brave satin gown that he had worn the even afore ay said isoult a tawny satin nightgown evening costume laced with green he had it here at supper well pursued helen so out came he to the sheriff and demanded what he would sir said he i have commandment from the council to apprehend you and forthwith to bring you unto themwhy answers mr underhill it is now ten of the clock in the night you cannot now carry me unto themno sir said he ye shall go with me to my house to london where ye shall have a bed and tomorrow i shall bring you unto them at the towerin the name of god note quoth mr underhill and so went with the sheriff know you the cause saith he also who the sheriff answered that he knew of none then said mr underhill this needed not any one messenger might have fetched me unto them so away went they and my father turned home and this morning went my father early unto the tower where the council were sitting and took his place at the gate where was a great throng of people that he might hear what should befall it was a mighty long time ere mr underhill came forth but at long last out came he led betwixt two of the guard and my father with a great throng followed to mr garrets house the sheriff in the stock market there they took mr underhill in and after a while to my fathers great easement came forth without him then after some time came forth mr underhill again with two of the sheriffs men but they had no bills with them nor they led him not but followed a pretty way behind so he coming into the street my father seeing him have such liberty and such distance between him and the officers he stepped before them and so went talking with him through cheapside and mr underhill told him that my lord of sussex would have ordered him to the fleet and sir richard southwell cried out to have him to the marshalsea but neither should content sir john gage nor secretary bourne and they made great ado that he were sent to newgate and prevailed arrived thither mr underhill was delivered of the officers to alisaunder the keeper note who unlocked a door and bade him go upstairs into the hall my father would not yet leave him but went up with him and there they sat down and had some talk one with the other and mr underhill did require my father not to let mrs underhill know that he was sent to newgate but to the counter until such time as she were near her churching and better to abide ill news and that she should send him his nightgown his bible and his lute so my father took his leave and meeting me at aldgate on his way home desired me to turn aside hither and tell you thereof and to ask you that you would come and visit mrs underhill in her trouble if it might stand with your conveniency that will i assuredly said isoult and it shall be the very first thing i do on the morrow isoult fulfilled her promise she rode to the lime hurst with tom as escort and found mrs underhill lying on the daybed the predecessor of the sofa with helen ive sitting by her while anne her eldest girl was nursing her baby brother and looked very much gratified to be trusted with him mrs underhill burst into tears the moment her visitor approached taking the seat which helen vacated for her isoult endeavoured to cheer her invalid friend when she was able to speak mrs underhill was found very resolute so soon as ever my strength shall serve she said i will hie me to the lords of the council to entreat them for neds deliverance and methinks my lord of bedford at the least shall hear me for the good hap that we had to recover his son and i will moreover get help of jack throgmorton master of the quest that is neds countryman and kinsman but dear heart cried isoult you are not strong enough to bear so weary a burden i will be strong enough she answered determinately and to that end i do mean to be churched this next sunday but to tell you the very truth mrs avery i do fear this shall not be all men do say mr rose shall be deprived ere many days and it may be set in ward likewise ah welladay i we have need to take heed to our ways my way lieth toward the counter if i might be there with ned i would not much lay to heart for what cause methinks when they take a man they should seize both halves of him isoult smiled but made no reply and tis whispered about she pursued that my lord archbishop should forsake the gospel and be again a lutheran if not a papist and that the mass shall be again set up and that proclamation shall be made to put forth from their cures all married priests mrs avery have a care of your robin that he either receive not orders or wed not when looked you for his being a priest why said isoult he had been ordained of bishop ridley this next rogationtide but now i know not what shall fall for no popish bishop will admit him nor would we ask it if he would so do may be if mr rose would speak with him robin being cornwallborn bishop coverdale should grant him an he knew the case bishop coverdale and mr rose to boot said she shall shortly have enough to do to see to themselves mrs rose is sorely distressed touching the forbiddance of wedded priests which tis thought shall shortly be had and twill be no gain to be mr rose his son when the storm come an i were you and mr avery i would put him off both his orders and his wedding we have no right over him mrs underhill said isoult no right answered she doth not every man that knoweth you and him know that you have but to whisper and he shall run at your bidding mrs avery if you asked that lad for his head i do very nigh believe he should cut it off for you i must talk with jack of this matter responded isoult thoughtfully so when she left the lime hurst she came home to dinner and after dinner rode on to west ham in the parlour there she found thekla at her spinning but mrs rose a most unwonted thing for her sat by the casement idle with her hands lying before her hear you mr underhill is in prison were her first words ay said isoult and that you dear friend are sore disquieted for the which cause i come disquieted she answered the tears springing to her eyes is it like i shall be quiet how know i who shall be in prison tomorrow they may burn mine husband and banish me before a month and what is to come of thekla dear mother said thekla gently they will not put god in prison they may put there every servant that he hath said she bitterly i think you know dear heart replied isoult that so long as we have any shelter to offer unto her thekla shall not be without one but how long may be that she answered and burying her face in her handkerchief she began sobbing isoult hardly knew what to say but she heard mr roses step and awaited his coming he greeted her kindly and then turning at once to his wife said sweet heart why weepest thou mrs rose feareth we may all be prisoned or execute afore a month be over said isoult for mrs rose was sobbing too heartily to speak truth he answered what then what then she cried through her tears why tom art thou mad what then to such matter as the breaking of our hearts and the burning of our bodies what then then said he gently thou art not ready as paul was not only to be bound but also to die for the lord jesus is it so my marguerite i know not what i were ready to do myself she said but i am not ready to see thee nor thekla to do so well sweet heart said he methinks i am ready readyto be confessed before the angels of god and the father which is in heaven readyto wear a martyr crown before all the world readyto reign with christ a thousand years is that matter to be wept for marguerite there is something else to come first she said shaking her head there is so replied he to confess christ ere he confess us to be envied of angels that have no such means of showing forth his glory to give a very little thing for the redeemer who gave all he is and all he hath for us is that also matter for tears ah tom said she smiling through her tears thou turnest it all to the contrary but thou knowest what i mean the brighter and better way he answered but i do know thy meaning dear heart and in truth it is hard and the flesh is weak but remember our lord knoweth that as well as we he hath not forgotten the days of his flesh when he offered up prayer with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death though there were one thing and that the worst thing in his sorrow that there can never be in ours the way may be rough and stonybut mind thou it is only very short when it may last for all the life tom hard prison and scant fare and loneliness and bitter mourning methinks the death were better than that very short still repeated he to the endless days of eternity the days of the journey be few indeed compared with the number of those to be spent in the fathers house and sweet heart even should we be forced to go that journey apart we will strive to look forward to the glad meeting in the home apart she echoed drearily and her tears came streaming back o tom tom i meant not to make thee weep again he said tenderly and yet there is no good in shutting our eyes on a sorrow that must come though there be little use in grieving over such as may never come it is not yet come and when it so doth it is only a little while only a little while my marguerite in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world thekla ceased her spinning and coming forward to her mother she passed her arm round her and kissed her brow mother she said sweetly it may be god will let us go to him together need we mourn for the night ere it be dark it will be so sweet to go to him will it not help us to bear almost any thing to know that presently thereafter we shall see christ and be with him for ever mrs rose was crying more quietly now and isoult rose to depart mr rose said he would help her to mount and she fancied that he wished to speak with her in private and so she found it for no sooner had he shut the door than he said mrs avery what do you touching robins orders isoult replied as she had done to mrs underhill and added that she meant to talk the matter over with john when she could do so quietly but mr rose she said your three years be already gone friend he answered his lip quivering had i made it three hundred years maybe it had been the better i pray you say not that you will not give her unto him cried isoult for she guessed what that would be to robin and perchance to thekla i will say no such thing he answered it should seem that robins orders can now scarce be had and if it were so i tell you the truth mine heart were the lighter thekla must choose for herself she is now of ripe age to know what is for and against the same and if she would have rather robin and what may hap than to leave both i will not gainsay her choice but if she seeketh mine avisement you will say her nay asked isoult fearfully as he hesitated can i say any thing else answered mr rose in a low voice were it worse for thekla to be let from wedding him or to be roughly parted from him ere they had been wed a yearperchance a month if robin should choose not to endeavour himself for the priesthood then of force is there no such difficulty but can i look forward to the parting that must ere long come between my marguerite and me and lightly choose the same doom for our child mr roses voice fell and his face changed so painfully that the listener could scarcely bear to see it think you that must come she said in a voice hardly above a whisper it must come if the queen continue as she hath begun answered he in a low voice it may not be for long if the lord only try us to humble us and to prove us whether we will keep his commandments or no it may be for all this life beyond this life it cannot be the keys of heaven and earth are in the hands of jesus christ not in those of mary tudor no more was said for that time the friends clasped hands and parted but when isoult and john had their quiet talk together she found that he had already been thinking on the subject and had conversed with robin i did somewhat marvel she admitted seeing the three years for the which mr rose did covenant were run out in june that robin made no motion thereunto but verily i did think he should speak the first he hath spoken dear heart said john and i did entreat him to await a season the upshot of this matter till we should see who should succeed the king and what manner of government we were like to fall under and i pressed him with much of the same reasoning that as i hear mr rose hath given thee and what saith he touching his priesthood i think he hardly knew what to say when all else had gone to bed john and isoult took robin aside and john told him what mr rose had said robins eyes filled with tears then said he it comes to this i must either give up mine orders or give up he uttered not nor did they need the name of thekla rose but one other point robin leave not out of thine account said john it may be thou canst not receive orders why then replied he if i cannot i cannot but when shall i know that i cannot when all the protestant bishops are in prison i take it said john smiling were it not better robin suggested isoult to fix thee a time not unreasonable distant whereat if thou mayest not hap to receive orders afore thou shalt resign that expectation and be free to wed good and wise counsel cried john thou hast hit the nail on the head thinkest not so robin robin sat silent for a moment then he saidayif mr rose agree thereto we will ask him that answered john so soon as we may on the th of august to borrow the expression of the gospellers the abominable thing was once more set up in england for the first time for six years an old priest sang the latin mass in saint bartholomews church to the awakening of such burning indignation on the part of his hearers that he was compelled to escape for his life by a side door the application to mr rose was made on the sunday evening following when john and isoult with robin rode over to the evening service at west ham mr roses sermon was a very solemn one on the text i am now ready to be offered ready to be offered how many of the gospellers needed to be so in that autumn of after the sermon they waited for mr rose and he walked with them for one or two miles on their way home robin led the horses a short distance behind them mr rose was quite satisfied with isoults proposal to fix a time beyond which robin should resign the hope of entering the ministry and indeed seemed relieved by the suggestion at his request robin was waited for and when he came up with them mr rose asked him what was the reason of his unwillingness to resign the hope of receiving holy orders robin answered that having offered himself and his service unto god he counted it not right to withdraw the same unless it should be plain that this was not the way wherein god would have him to serve and mr roses reply wasthen robin wouldst thou give up rather thekla than thine orders it were wellnigh giving up my life yet i would do as god will have me said robin softly mr rose grasped his hand and called him a brave lad adding that if god so would he would be right glad of such a son this speech made the tears no further from robins eyes but he smiled and thanked him and he continuedmr rose i would have you to know that i do desire only to know and do what is gods will for me if he will make me his minister i will be thankful for so great an honour for i do account the service of god higher than the dominion over men yet if i can serve him better as a doorporter or a scullion i would have him do his will with me ah robin god bless thee answered mr rose earnestly thou hast learned a lesson which many a scholar of threescore and ten can yet hardly spell note the two ladies first named were second cousins of the king and stood in the line of the succession the details here given are almost entirely fictitious except such as concern edward himself for little is really known beyond the time the place and the kings presence note the canopy over the throne was called the cloth of estate often abbreviated into the estate note the duchess frances appears to have played a quiescent part in this drama so soon to turn into tragedy otherwise she from whom alone the title was derived would scarcely have borne so meekly the train of her own daughter note this must not be mistaken for swearing it was an expression used in the most reverential manner and equivalent to gods will be done note a man infamous for his cruelty especially to the protestant prisoners chapter eight the tempest that followed o yet in scorn of mean relief let sorrow bear her heavenly fruit better the wildest hour of grief than the low pastime of the brute better to weep for he wept too than laugh as every fool can do hon robert lytton heard you the news friends asked mr holland coming into the lamb on the evening of the th of august news cried dr thorpe i am aweary of the news there is news every day my lord a to the tower and my lord b delivered thence and my lord c to the marshalsea and my lord d to the fleet and my lord e that yesterday carried the sword afore the queen today hath his head struck off and my lord f that was condemned to die yestereven shall bear the queens sword this morrow pshaw i am tired of it tis a game of tables backgammon with players that have no skill and care for nought saving to rattle the dice mr holland laughed a moment but immediately grew grave but heard you my news said he do you know father rose is deprived all cried out together they had looked for this indeed but not now six months thence when the protestant bishops were all sequestered and the prebendaries in the marshalsea bishop gardiner might stoop to lesser game but that one of the very first blows should be struck at mr rose this they had not expected it showed how formidable an enemy he was considered deprived cried all the voices together ay tis too true said mr holland as a preacher we shall hear his voice no more the lambs are like to fare ill growled dr thorpe when all the great wolves be let forth in a pack ah mine old friend answered john not many weeks gone you said of my lord of northumberland will none put this companion in the tower methinks so many henceforward will scarce be over ere you may say the like with tears of stephen gardiner the fox is in the tower but the wolf is out you speak but truth said mr holland and now my masters after mine ill news i fear you will scarcely take it well of me to bid you to a wedding yet for that came i hither is this a time for marrying and giving in marriage groaned dr thorpe i think it is answered mr holland stoutly the more disease discomfort a man hath abroad the more comfort he lacketh at home but who is to be married asked john i am answered mr holland have you aught against it you cried avery in a voice of astonishment which mr holland understood to imply the reverse of flattery upon my word you are no losenger flatterer saith he have i two heads or four legs that you think no maid should have me or is my temper so hot that you count i shall lead her a dogs life or what see you in me body or soul to make you cry out in that fashion nay man replied john laughing thou art a proper man enough and as tall of thy hands as any in aldersgate and for thy temper a dove were crabbed in comparison i did but think thou wert wedded to thy cloths and thy napery you thought i took counsel of velvet and solaced myself with broidery laughed mr holland nay friend when i take a wife i will not wed a piece of lincoln green and who pray you is the bride why avery i had thought you should have guessed that without asking who should it be but mine old and true friend bessy lake then i give you joy said john for you have chosen well mr hollands wedding took place at the church of saint giles cripplegate in august it was in the first year of queen mary exact date unknown bessy lake the bride proved a very gentle amiablelooking woman not pretty but not unpleasing and by at least ten years the senior of her bridegroom after the ceremony the wedding party repaired to mr hollands house mr rose was present with his wife and thekla and mr ferris and mr ive and helen who brought mrs underhills three elder little girls anne christian and eleanor augustine bernher did not appear until after dinner mrs rose and isoult had a little quiet conversation the former was still looking forward to further troubles and plainly thought mr holland was courting sorrow but thank god he is not a priest she said and the tears rose to her eyes meanwhile john and mr rose were engaged in their private discourse it was settled between them that the same day two years lateraugust th should be the date fixed before which if robin should not have been ordained he should give up the expectation of it and marry thekla mr holland being taken into confidence not only expressed his sense of the wisdom of this arrangement but at once offered if robin wished it to receive him without premium this part of the subject however was left for future decision helen ive brought word from mrs underhill that mr throgmorton had readily promised to intercede for his cousin as soon as he found a satisfactory opportunity which meant when certain members of the council adverse to underhill should be absent the persecution had begun in good earnest now the imprisonment of bishop ridley and mr underhill and the deprivation of mr rose were only the beginning of sorrows on the th of august mr john bradford of manchester was sent to the tower and mr prebendary rogers confined to his own house nor allowed to speak with any person out of it and on friday and saturday the th and th were condemned to death in the high court at westminster the great duke of northumberland who so many years had been all but a king in england and the marquis of northampton and the earl of warwick son of the duke and sir andrew dudley the dukes brother and sir thomas palmer the judges were the lord treasurer and the old duke of norfolk the last only just released from the tower where he had been a prisoner seven years gods mill grindeth slowly but it grindeth small he sitteth at the disposing of the lotsthere is no blind chance for him and it was the lord who had these sinners in derision who sat above the waterfloods and stilled the raging of the people and if gods earthly judgments that come now and then be so terrific what shall be that last judgment of his great white throne when every man shall receive the things done in the body the great traitorsnorthumberland and palmerthe lesser traitor northamptonand the innocent warwick were tried and sentenced to death on the following morning mass was sung in the tower and the duke the marquis of northampton sir andrew dudley sir harry gates and sir thomas palmer received the sacrament in one kind only then the duke turning to those present who were many said he had been seduced these sixteen years by the false and erroneous doctrine of the new preachers namely the gospel but he was now assured and did believe that the sacrament there present was our saviour and redeemer jesus christ then he knelt down and asked of all men forgiveness and said he forgave all men the duke of somersets sons were standing by who had something to forgive that miserable sinner and the lady jane saw the duke pass by to the chapel from her window lo you now said john this was the chosen head of the lutheran party he was never mine replied dr thorpe how long is it sithence you were a lutheran answered he go thy ways jack was all dr thorpe would say in the evening mr ive came in who said he had been to newgate to visit his friend mr underhill and poor underhill said he is fallen sick of a burning ague in that loathsome gaol he doth account the cause to be the evil savours and the unquietness of the lodging as may be also the drinking of a strong draught wherein his fellowprisoner would needs have him to pledge him he can take no rest desiring to change his lodging and so hath he done from one to an other but none can he abide having so much noise of the prisoners and naughty savours now his wife hath leave to come unto him for to tend him in his sickness but he is constrained to pay eightpence every meal and as much for her and how is he treated of alisaunder said john not over well i warrant you nay there you are out said mr ive for as underhill told me the very first night that he went in one of the prisoners took acquaintance of him whose name was bristo and would have him to have a bed in his chamber he had been with sir richard cromwell in his journey to landrecies that underhill also was in and could play well on a rebeck and was a protestant which yet he kept secret or saith he to underhill i had never found such favour as i do at the keepers hand and his wifes for to such as love the gospel they be very cruelwell saith underhill i have sent for my bible and by gods grace therein shall be my daily exercise i will not hide it from themsir answered he i am poor but they will bear with you for that they see your estate is to pay well and i will show you the nature and manner of them for i have been here a good while they both do love music very well wherefore you with your lute and i with my rebeck will please them greatly he loveth to be merry and to drink wine and she also and if you will bestow upon them every dinner and supper a quart of wine and some music you shall be their white son favourite and have all their favour that they can show you and so as underhill told me he found it come to pass and where is the babe said isoult pityingly my nell hath little guilford answered mr ive and maketh as much ado of him as she were his own mother concern you not for him with gods blessing the child shall fare well on tower hill whither they had sent so many better than themselves on the nd of august sir john dudley duke of northumberland and sir thomas palmer ended their wretched and evil lives with them died sir john gates the duke rehearsed his confession as he had made it in the chapel avowing himself to be of the old learning and a christian now for these sixteen years i have been none which last was the truth and he said he would every man not to be covetous for that had been a great part of his destruction and so he tied the handkerchief over his own eyes and lay down on the block and his head was struck off so ended this miserable man for whom it had been a thousand times better that he had never been born than to have destroyed himself and england together and to have offended so bitterly christs little ones after him came sir john gates who said little and would have no handkerchief over his eyes and his head fell at the third blow last came sir thomas palmer nothing in whose life became him like the leaving it for when the people bade him good morrow he saidi do not doubt but that i have a good morrow and that i shall have a better good even and then he went on to tell them that he had been lawfully condemned and that he did therein thank god for his mercy for that sithence his coming into the tower he had seen himself how utterly and verily vile his soul wasyea he did not think any sin to be that he had not plunged even into the midst of it note i and he had moreover seen how infinite were gods mercies and how jesus sitteth a redeemer at the right hand of god by whose means his people shall live eternally for i have learned said he more in one little dark corner in yonder tower than ever i learned by any travail in so many places as i have been and he desired the people to pray for him for he did in no wise fear death so taking the executioner by the hand he said he forgave him heartily but entreated him not to strike till he had said a few prayers and then he should have good leave and so he knelt down and laid his head on the block and prayed then lifting his head again once more asked all present to pray for him and so again laid down his head which was stricken from him at one stroke and that night isoult avery wrote in her diaryverily i do know that the mercies of god are infinite and i bless him heartily therefor but had i been to say any that i knew which was little like to come unto them i had named this man god be lauded if he hath shown him what is sin and what is christ in his last hours and hath so received him up to that his infinite mercy i marvel what sort shall be the meeting betwixt my lord and george bucker and the duke of somerset and him at length mr throgmorton found his expected opportunity and offered his petition for mr underhills release this petition set forth his extreme sickness and small cause to be committed unto so loathsome a gaol and besought that he might therefore be released offering sureties to be forthcoming when called upon these were to be himself and his brotherinlaw john speryn a merchant of london and a man very zealous in the lord poor underhill was still very seriously ill i was cast he tells us into an extreme burning ague that i could take no rest desiring to change my lodging and so did from one to an other but none i could abide there was so much noise of prisoners and evil savours the keeper and his wife offered me his own parlour where he lay himself which was furthest from noise but it was near the kitchen the savour whereof i could not abide then did she lodge me in a chamber wherein she said never no prisoner lay which was her storechamber where she said all the plate and money lay which was much harl ms folio a mr ive reported that mr underhill could be no weaker than he was and live his friend dr record had been to see him in the prison whom he describes as doctor of physic singularly seen very skilful in all the seven sciences grammar rhetoric logic arithmetic geometry music and astronomy and a great devyne mr rose took his deprivation very quietly some of his friends thought he might be all the safer for it if the persecutors had done all they cared about doing to him he had hired three rooms for the present in a house in leadenhall street tidings of further persecution came now daily robins orders do seem going further off than ever lamented isoult for bishops hooper of gloucester and coverdale of exeter were cited before the council and the archbishop and the dean of saint pauls and mass was now celebrated in many churches of london a rumour went abroad of the lapsing of the archbishop and that he had sung mass before the queen but it proved false again the altar was set up in saint pauls cathedral and when bishop bonner came from the marshalsea great rejoicing was made many by the way bade him welcome home and as many of the women as might kissed him no gospeller would have kissed him for a kings ransom on the th of september came mr ive with news of mr underhill at once good and bad he was released from newgate but was so weak and ill that they were obliged to carry him home in a horselitter and the gaolers servant bore him down the stairs to the litter in his arms like a child and for all this those who accompanied him mrs underhill mr speryn mr ive and others were afraid lest he should not live till he came home they were compelled to go very gently and frequently to halt so that two hours were required to pass through the city from newgate to aldgate and night fell before he could get to his house where he now remained in the same weak and deplorable state and all the gospellers were asked to pray for him to the great relief of all protestants the archbishop published a letter in which he utterly denied that he had ever said or promised to say mass to gain favour with the queen i could have told you so much said john my lord archbishop is not the man to curry favelle now i had thought he rather were said dr thorpe one of your lutheran fantasies answered john which rather annoyed the old man who did not like to be reminded that he was or had been a lutheran and such reminders he occasionally received from mr john avery have you the news said mr rose on the evening of the th of september which news asked john we know all methinks touching my lord archbishop and the bishops of gloucester and exeter and that mr dean is cited what more and that mr latimer is had to the tower alack no cried isoult is it assuredly so i shake hands with him on his way and saw him go in answered mr rose sorrowfully with what cheer as bright and merry as ever i did see him the warder at the gate was will rutter whom he knew of old and quoth he to him what my old friend how do you i am now come to be your neighbour again and so went in smiling and is lodged in the garden in sir thomas palmers lodging he is a marvellous man replied john my lord of canterbury pursued mr rose likewise came into the tower yesterday he is lodged in the gate against the watergate where my lord of northumberland lay to the same end i count for both said dr thorpe bitterly the lord knoweth answered mr rose and the lord reigneth and will they put down the servicebook think you said he they will put down everything save god said mr rose solemnly and him also could they but get at him before september was over john and isoult rode to the limehurst to visit mr underhill they found him in very good spirits for an invalid in a very weak condition and he said he was improving every day and had a long tale to tell them when his strength would permit mrs underhill had been compelled to present herself before the council in order to procure his release and had there to endure a severe scolding from lord winchester for the relationship in which little guilford had been placed to lady jane grey she bore it quietly and got for her reward a letter to the keeper of newgate signed by winchester sussex bedford rochester and sir edward waldegrave ordering the release of mr underhill who was to be bound before a magistrate in conjunction with her brother mr speryn to appear when summoned the progress of the retrogressionfor such it may be fairly termedwas swifter than that of the reformation had been facilis descensus avernithis is the usual course high mass was restored in saint pauls cathedral and in very few london churches were gospel sermons yet preached with bitter irony liberty was granted to bishop ridley to hear mass in the tower chapel liberty to commit idolatry was not likely to be used by nicholas ridley the french protestants were driven out except a few named by the ambassador cranmer latimer hooper coverdale were cited before the council and on the th of september the queen came to the tower in readiness for her coronation at one oclock on the th the royal procession set forth fitly preceded by a crowd of knights doctors bishops and peers after them rode the council and then the new knights of the bath to create whom it had been the custom the day previous to the coronation the seal and mace were carried next between the lord chancellor bishop gardiner and the lord treasurer william paulet marquis of winchester the old duke of norfolk followed with lord arundel on his right and lord oxford on his left bearing the swords of state sir edward hastings on foot led the queens horse she sat in a chariot of tissue trapped with red velvet and drawn by six horses mary was dressed in blue velvet bordered with ermine and on her head she carried not only a caul of tinsel set with gold and stones but also a garland of goldsmiths work so massive that she was observed to bear up her head with her hands she was subject to violent headaches and in all probability was suffering from one now a canopy was borne over her chariot in the second chariot which was all white and six horses trapped with the same sat the heiress presumptive of england the princess elizabeth with her face forward and the lady anne of cleve with her back forward both ladies were attired in crimson velvet then came four ladies of estate riding upon horsesthe eccentric old duchess of norfolk the marchioness of winchester gertrude the longtried marchioness of exeter and mary countess of arundel niece of lady lisle both riders and horses were apparelled in crimson velvet the third chariot covered with cloth of gold and the horses similarly caparisoned while the peeresses within were clad in crimson velvettwo ladies on horseback in crimson velvetthe fourth and fifth chariots and more ladies on horseback to the total number of fortysix and all in crimson velvetthese followed one another in due course last came the queens women riding upon horses trapped in crimson satin and attired in the same material among them the third of the eight maids of honour looked out the sweet face of anne basset gentlest of her highness women note and so closed this crimson pageant meet inauguration of englands bloodiest reign of other pageants there was no lack but i pass them by as also the airy gyrations of peter the dutchman on the weathercock of saint pauls on the west side of the cathedral was a sight which more amazed the party of sightseers from the lamb than any other with which they had met that day this was the hot gospeller who had literally risen from his bed to see the pageant mr edward underhill sat upon a horsebut he shall describe his own appearance for it must have been remarkable scant able to sit girded in a long nightgown with double kerchiefs about my head a great hat upon them my beard dubed hard too my face so leane and pale that i was the very image of death wondered at of all that did behold me unknown to any my wife and neighbours were toto tootoo an archaism for very sorry that i would needs go forth thinking i would not return alive then went i forth having of either side of me a man to stay me when the queen passed by many of my fellows the pensioners and divers of the council beheld me and none of them all knew me note why ned cried john are you able to sit thus on an horse and mix in crowds no said he then he answered what brought you hither marry mine own obstinate resolvedness said mr underhill laughing feebly that neither my jane nor jack speryn nor ive could combat john rode with his friend to the limehurst and saw him safe home to the great relief of mrs underhill who declared that she had not had a minutes rest since he set out expecting every hour to receive some terrible news concerning him sunday the st of october was fixed for the coronation that ceremony was almost invariably on the lords day there was no service in the cathedral for none but unmarried bishops or priests would the queen permit to officiate before her and there were very few of the first order was also issued that no married priest should minister again in any of the churches the gospellers were reduced to stratagem since the churches were closed to them they opened their own houses by arrangement with mr rose service was held in the lamb on the evening of the coronation day safety being secured by a preconcerted signaltap about forty persons gathered exclusive of the families of the host and the minister a small congregation but a congregation of live souls who were ready to yield life sooner than faith the majority of congregations are hardly made of that material now if all the real christians were gathered out of this church once said william romaine to his flock there would not be enough to fill the vestry how frightfully uncharitable cries the nineteenth centuryand i dare say the flock at saint annes thought so too but there is a charity towards mens souls and there is a charity towards mens feelings if one of the two must be dispensed with we shall wish in the great day of account that it had been the latter the two keepingrooms of the lambwhich they called the great and little chambers but which we their degenerate descendants might term the diningroom and drawingroomwere filled with this living congregation and mr rose read prayers from the now prohibited servicebook and preached the prohibited doctrines before all had dispersed mr george ferris made his appearance and supped at the lamb as did mr rose and mr holland with their respective families after supper mr ferris leaning back in his chair suddenly saidif you list to know the order of her highness crowning i am he that can tell you for all this day have i been in westminster abbey and hall he was universally encouraged to proceed the queen said he came first by water to the old palace and there tarried she till about eleven of the clock and thence went she afoot to the abbey upon blue cloth railed in on every side and she ware the same array as she came in through london afore her went the bishops to wit all the unwedded their mitres on their heads and their crosiers borne afore them she was led betwixt old tunstal of durham and an other bishop and right behind her came the devil in the likeness of stephen gardiner acensing her and casting holy water upon her all the way which must needs have spoiled her brave blue velvet gown ere she set foot in the abbey in the abbey was the throne covered with baudekyn but i pray you demand not of me a regular account of all that was done for it was so many and sundry ceremonies that my weak head will not hold them i know only there was kneeling and courtesying and bowing and censing and holy water and a deal more of the like trumpery wherewith i am no wise compatient the lost adjective of compassion and going up unto the altar and coming down from it and five several times was she led thereto once to offer there her pall of baudekyn and twenty shillings and once leaving her crimson velvet mantle behind the travers she was laid down on a cushion afore the altar while four knights held the pall over her and anointed with tedious and endless ceremonies and crowned with three crowns saint edwards the imperial and one made for her apurpose by the aforesaid stephen gardiner and a ring of gold set on her finger and a bracelet of precious stones and gold set upon her arm by the master of the jewel house and the sceptre given her of my lord of arundel the old timeserver and the ball of the lord treasurer and the regal of gold of the bishop of winchester and the staff of saint edward of my lord of bath and the spurs of my lord of pembroke come pray you now let me take breathwell after all this the bishops and nobles did homage to her highness but the time would not serve for all seeing the homage to the altar had taken so much away so they knelt in groups and had a spokesman to perform for them my right reverend lord bishop of winchester was for himself and all other bishops old norfolk stood alone as a duke for all the other dukes were in the tower either alive or dead the lord marquis of winchester was for his order my lord of arundel for the earls my lord of hereford for the viscounts and my lord of burgavenny for the barons all these kissed her highness left cheek and all this time stood my lord of shrewsbury by her aiding her to hold up the sceptre well then believe it who will my masters but after all this came the mass and no sooner begun than the bishop of lincoln and the bishop of hereford marched straight out of the church mitres and all it was nigh four of the clock ere her grace came from the abbey and she came in a gown of purple velvet with the crown upon her head and every noble and noble lady following in cramoisie and on their heads crownets the old form of the word coronet of gold three swords were borne afore her and a canopy over her carried of the wardens of the cinque ports and in one hand she held a sceptre of gold and in the other a ball of gold which she twirled and turned in her hand as she came and no sooner had she set foot in the hall than the people fell ascrambling for the cloth and rails yea they were not content with the waste meat cast out of the kitchen to them but they pulled down and carried off the kitchen also come ferris be reasonable in your romaunts said mr holland who did ever hear any man to be reasonable in a romaunt asked he but this is not romance tis truth why the kitchen was but cast up of boards outside the palace for the time and occasion and they made it a waste indeed it was candlelight ere her grace took barge but was there no pardon proclaimed said john lo you now i forgat that ay afore the anointing my gracious lord chancellor proclaimeth her majestys goodly pardon unto all prisoners whatsoever and wheresoeversave and except an handful only to wit such as were in the marshalsea and the fleet and the tower and such as had order to keep their houses and sixtytwo more why that were to except them all cried mr holland nay they excepted not them in newgate nor the counter a goodly procession of pardoned men said john well said dr thorpe after a short pause the queens reign is now fairly established what shall the end be ask not me replied mr ferris we know what it shall be answered mr rose thoughtfully i will overturn overturn overturn until he come whose right it is and i will give it him let as pray for his coming and in the mean time have we a care that our loins be girded about and our lamps burning that when he cometh and knocketh we may open unto him immediately we shall be unready to open immediately if our hands be overfull of worldly matters it were not well to have to say to him lord let me lay down this high post and that public work and these velvet robes and this sweet cup and this bitter oneand then i will open unto thee i had rather mine hand were on the latch of the door looking out for him but father rose men must see to public matters and wear velvet robes and carry weights of all fashionswhy the world would stand still else must men do these things master ferris yet be there two ways of doing them believe me there is one other thing they must dothey must meet christ a jovial merry gallant gentleman was george ferris and a protestant of some sort but he outlived the persecution it was not of such stuff as his that martyrs were made the gorgeous pageants were over and the bitter suffering came back parliament was opened on the th of november with a solemn mass of the holy ghost the queen herself being present in her robes but as soon as the mass began the archbishop of york and the bishops of lincoln and hereford rose and attempted to walk out of the house hands were laid on the bishop of lincoln and his parliament robe taken from him and upon confession of his faith which he made boldly he was cited before the council the archbishop and the bishop of hereford were suffered to depart for that time but rumour ran that hereford would soon be deprived being a married priest perhaps he was not made of metal that would bear the furnace for god took his child home before the day of suffering came the rough wind was stayed again in the day of the east wind but on the th of november came a more woeful sight for the prisoners in the tower were led on foot to the guild hall the axe carried before them there to be judged first walked the archbishop of canterbury his face cast down between two others then followed the lord guilford dudley also between two after him came his wife the lady jane apparelled in black a black velvet book hanging at her girdle and another open in her hand after her followed her two gentlewomen and lords ambrose and henry dudley the archbishop was attainted for treason although he had utterly refused to subscribe the kings letters patent for the disinheriting of his sisters late in the evening mr ive looked in to say that he hath spent all the day at the guild hall and brought the sad news that the gentle lady jane and all the lords dudley were condemned to death it was expected however that the queen would not suffer the sentence to be executed on her own cousin lady jane the archbishop mr ive told them came back to the tower looking as joyful as he had before been cast down he was entirely acquitted of treason and remanded to be tried for heresy for which he blessed god in the hearing of the court one step more said mr rose to avery whom he met in cheapside the old servicebook of king henry must now be used and the new of king edward put away and in every church in london shall the mass be next sunday or monday and saint katherines eve shall be processions and saint nicholas shall go about as aforetime so slowly and darkly closed the black year married priests forbidden to ministerthe english servicebook prohibitedorders issued for every parish church to provide cross censer vestments and similar decorations of the house of baalmass for the soul of king edward in all the churches of london it was not six months since the boy had died with that last touching prayer on his lipslord god preserve this realm from papistry was that prayer lost in the blue space it had to traverse between that soul and the altar of incense in heaven we know now that it was not but it seemed utterly lost then o lord we know not what thou doest now give us grace to wait patiently to be content with thy promise that we shall know hereafter there was one bright spot visible to the teardimmed eyes of the gospellers and only one the parliament had been prorogued and the bloody statute was not yet reenacted all statutes of premunire were repealed and all laws of king edward in favour of reformation in the church but that first and worst of all the penalties remained as yet in the oblivion to which he had consigned it but in recompense for this there was a very black cloud darkening the horizon of the queen had announced to her parliament her intended marriage with prince philip of spain all the old insular prejudices against foreigners rose up to strengthen the protestant horror of a spanish and popish king the very children in the streets were heard to cry down with the pope and the spaniards elizabeth would have known how to deal with such an emergency but mary was blind and deaf disregarding this outbreak of popular feeling she went on in the way which led to her ruin and englands it was only one of the two which was irremediable the one was followed by a summer day of glory the other closed only in the night of death the first news which reached the lamb in was the startling informationif any information can be called startling in that age of sudden and shocking eventsthat the night before mr ive had been hastily apprehended and committed to the marshalsea he was soon released unhurt but this occurrence quickened mr underhills tardy movements he had already made up his mind to remove from the limehurst where his abode was too wellknown to the enemy the arrest of his friend and neighbour determined him to go at once he took a little house in a secret corner at the nether end of wood street cheapside about epiphany was born susan bertie the only daughter of the duchess of suffolk shortly before this the emperors ambassadors came over to treat concerning the queens marriage and were pelted with snowballs by children in the streets of the city the vacant sees were filled up by popish divines cardinal pole was invited to return to england from which he had been so many years exiled in the capacity of legate the queen dissolved the court of first fruits and commanded that the title of head of the church in earth should be omitted from the enumeration of her titles in all future documents permission granted to lady jane to walk in the queens garden and on tower hill revived for a moment the hopes of the protestants so far as concerned her no harm would come to her they sanguinely repeated if the queen were left to herself possibly they were fight but what likelihood was there that gardiner would so leave her anda question yet more ominouswhat might philip of spain require in this matter men not yet sixty years of age could remember the time when previous to the marriage of katherine of aragon the earl of warwick last surviving male of the house of york had been beheaded on tower hill once before the royal blood of england had been shed at the demand of spain might the precedent not be repeated now the only difference being that the victim then was a tercel gentle and now it would be a white dove in the middle of january before his removal from the limehurst and when he was sufficiently recovered to walk to london an easy pace mr underhill made his appearance one afternoon in the minories he came with the evident intention of telling his own story and would you said he hear the tale of my examination and imprisonment that would we and with a right good will answered dr thorpe speaking for all we do know even what mr ive could tell us but nothing further then what ive could not tell you resumed he take from me these incidents in underhills life are given almost entirely in his own words i guessed and rightly so what was the cause of mine arrest to wit a certain ballad that i had put forth against the papists and for that i was a sacramentary well when i came into the tower where the council sat they were already busied with dr coxe and the lord ferrers wherefore i was to wait so i and my two men went to an alehouse to dinner in the tower and after that repaired to the council chamber door to be the first taken for i desired to know my lot then came secretary bourne to the door looking as the wolf doth for a lamb unto whom my two keepers delivered me and he took me in greedily the earl of bedford was chief judge next the earl of sussex and sir richard southwell and on the side next me sat the earl of arundel and lord paget by them stood sir john gage the constable the earl of bath and mr mason at the boards end stood sergeant morgan and secretary bourne and the lord wentworth stood in the bay window then my lord of bedford who was my very friend owing unto the chance that i had to recover his son as i told you aforetime yet would not now seem to be familiar with me nor called me not by my name saiddid not you set a ballad of late in printi kneeled down saying yes truly my lord is that the cause i am called before your honoursmarry said secretary bourne you have one of them about you i am surenay truly have i not said ithen took he one out of his bosom and read it over distinctly the council giving diligent ear when he had endedi trust my lord said i i have not offended the queens majesty in the ballad nor spoken against her title but maintained ityou have sir said morgan yes i can divide your ballad and make a distinction in it and so prove at the least sedition in ityea i said you men of law will make of a matter what ye listlo said sir richard southwell how he can give a taunt you maintain the queens title with the help of an arrant heretic tyndaleyou speak of papists there sir said mr mason i pray you how define you a papistwhy said i it is not long since you could define a papist better than i with that some of them secretly smiled as the lord of bedford arundel sussex and paget in great haste sir john gage took the matter in hand thou callest men papists there said he who be they thou judgest to be papistssir said i i do name no man nor i am not hither to accuse any nor none i will accuse but your honours do know that in this controversy that hath been some be called papists and some protestantsbut we will know whom thou judgest to be papists and that we command thee upon thine allegiance to declaresir said i i think if you look among the priests in poules ye shall find some old mumpsimuses theremumpsimuses knave saith he mumpsimuses thou art an heretic knave and sware a great oathsays the earl of bath i warrant him an heretic knave indeedi beseech your honours said i speaking to the lords that sat at the table for these other that stood by be not now of the council be my good lords i have offended no laws and i have served the queens majestys father and her brother long time and in their service have spent and consumed part of my living never having as yet any preferment or recompense and the rest of my fellows likewise to our utter undoing unless the queens highness be good unto us and for my part i went not forth against her majesty notwithstanding i was commanded nor liked those doingsno but with your writings you will set us together by the ears saith the earl of arundelhe hath spent his living wantonly saith bourne and now saith he hath spent it in the kings service which i am sorry for he is come of a worshipful house in worcestershire note it is untruly said of you said i that i have spent my living wantonly i never consumed no part thereof until i came into the kings service which i do not repent nor doubted of recompense if either of my two masters had lived i perceive you are bournes son of worcester who was beholden unto my uncle wynter and therefore you have no cause to be my enemy nor you never knew me nor i you before now which is too sooni have heard enough of you said heso have i of you said i how that mr sheldone drave you out of worcestershire for your behaviourwith that came sir edward hastings from the queen in great haste saying my lords you must set all things apart and come forthwith to the queenthen said the earl of sussex have this gentleman unto the fleet until we may talk further with him although i was knave before of master gageto the fleet saith master southwell have him to the marshalseahave the heretic knave to newgate saith master gage againcall a couple of the guard here saith bourne and there shall be a letter sent to the keeper how he shall use him for we have other manner of matters with him than theseso had ye need said i or else i care not for youdeliver him to mr garret the sheriff said he and bid him send him to newgatemy lord said i unto my lord of arundel for that he was next me as they were rising i trust you will not see me thus used to be sent to newgate i am neither thief nor traitorye are a naughty fellow said he ye were alway tuting in the duke of northumberlands ear that ye werei would he had given better ear unto me said i it had not been with him then as it is nowmr hastings pushing by me mine old adversary with whom i had been aforetime wont to reason touching the sacrament i thought good to prove him although he threatened before nowsir said i i pray you speak for me that i be not sent unto newgate but rather unto the fleet which was first named i have not offended i am a gentleman as you know and one of your fellows when you were of this band of the pensionersvery quietly he said unto me i was not at the table mr underhill and therefore i can say nothing to it but i think he was not content with the place i was appointed to well i count ive told you all he saw touching my progress to master sheriff and thence to newgate but while i waited in the sheriffs house my lord russell heard my voice and showed very sorry for me and sent me on the morrow twenty shillings and every week as much while i was in newgate i count ive told you moreover of my sickness ay and of the ill savours and noise that you could not abide said dr thorpe and of your changing of your lodging and how dr record did visit you and divers other things then he told you all said mr underhill and now for tis past nine of the clock this great knave rogue and heretic must be on his way home mr underhill left behind him a new ballad which he had lately published since it probably does not exist in print now it shall be subjoined and in the orthography of its author love god above all thyngs and thy neyghboure as thy selffe thatt this is crists doctryne no mane cane it denye wyche litle is regarded in ynglands common wealthe wherefore greate plags

only to be remembered as a lost luxury have you the news inquired mr underhill suddenly opening averys door and coming in hastily i have heard you put that question fiveandtwenty times responded dr thorpe well he answered you may hear it yet again so many there is like to be some trouble then that is good news said the doctor sarcastically for during some time there hath been trouble not there hath been like to be what is it then ned inquired john why answered he the lord cobham and tom wyatt be up in kent and my lord warden of dover and many another to resist the queens marriage and to remove certain councillors from her which as i take it is another way of spelling stephen gardiners name and my lord of suffolk and his two brothers john and thomas grey are fled from shene on pretence of going to the court no man knows whither and rochester bridge is taken of one set of rebels and exeter of them in devon alack the day cried isoult her devon blood stirring and five hundred harnessed men are called to take the field against wyatt we pensioners go down to white hall to guard the queen and mr underhill shut the door and they saw no more of him there was some trouble on the th of january the old duke of norfolk and others marched against sir thomas wyatt but the same night they came back in disorder flying over london bridge with only a fourth part of their company mr brent the lambs next neighbour who was one of the little army came home with his coat turned and all ruinated and not a string to his bow they brought news that wyatt was coming fast on southwark on the st of february came the queen herself to guild hall her sceptre in her hand which was a token of peace and bishop gardiner attending her which was a token of blood she made an oration to the people which she had learned without book and when it was doneo how happy are we cried bishop gardiner to whom god hath given such a wise and learned queen which outcry dr thorpe said was as good as proof that the bishop himself writ the oration wyatt and his company entered southwark on the eve of quinquagesima sunday by four oclock and before five he had made a bulwark at the bridgefoot and fortified himself but the queens men still held the bridge against him the next morning mr rose with mrs rose and thekla came to the lamb read the service out of the prayer book and preached but they were afraid to sing at nine oclock on tuesday morning wyatt drew off his men seeing that he could not take the bridge and turned towards kingston in the evening came in mr underhill in armour with his poleaxe in his hand which he set down in a corner and sat down and talked for an hour so wyatt is gone said dr thorpe gone about to strengthen himself answered mr underhill he is coming back take my word for it he said unto his soldiers that he would pay them the next time in cheapside and unto the men that held the bridge quoth hetwice have i knocked and not been suffered to enter if i knock the third time i will come in by gods grace what did you at the court said dr thorpe is good watch kept mr underhill laughed marry i did nothing said he for i was not suffered i put on mine harness and went up into the queens chamber of presence where were all her women weeping and wringing their hands like foolish fluttering birds and crying they should all be destroyed that night and then mr norris the queens chief usher which was appointed to call the watch read over the names from the book which moore the clerk of our check gave him but no sooner came he to my name than quoth hewhat what doth he heresir saith the clerk he is here ready to serve as the rest benay saith he and sware a great oath that heretic shall not watch here give me a pen and so strake my name off the book so moore cometh to me and mr underhill saith he you are not to watch you may depart to your lodgingmay i said i i would be glad of thatthinking i had been favoured because i was not recovered of my sickness but i did not well trust him because he was also a papist marry i depart indeed said i will you be my dischargei tell you true said he mr norris hath stricken you out of the book saying these wordsthat heretic shall not watch here i tell you true what he saidmarry i thank him said i and you also you could not do me a greater pleasurenay burden not me withal said he it is not my doing so away went i with my men and a link and when i come to the court gate i fell in with mr clement throgmorton that was come post from coventry to the queen with tidings of the taking of the duke of suffolk and george ferrisboth my friends and good protestants so away went we three to ludgate which was fast locked for it was past eleven of the clock and the watch set within but none without and lo you for all our calling and declaring of our names and the like would they not open the gate mr throgmorton cried to them that he would go to his lodging within and mr ferris said he was sent with weighty affairs to my lord will howard within but they did nought but laugh and at long last said they had not the keys what shall i do said mr throgmorton i am weary and faint and i wax now cold i am not acquainted hereabout nor no man dare open his doors in this dangerous time nor i am not able to go back again to the court i shall perish this nightwell said i let us go to newgate i think i shall get in theretush said he it is but in vain we shall be answered there as we are herewell said i and the worst fall i can lodge ye in newgate you know what acquaintance i have there and the keepers door is without the gatethat were a bad shift said he i had almost as lief die in the streets yet i will rather wander again to the court howbeit i did persuade them to try at newgate and there found we my friend newman to be constable of the watch which saith mr underhill what news that you walk so late so he let us through the gate with a good will and at long last we reached each man to his lodging at four oclock on the morning of ash wednesday london was awoke by drums beating all through the streets of the city john and robin rose hastily and went out to ascertain the cause they came in shortly saying that the drums beat for all soldiers to arm and repair to charing cross for that wyatt was seeking to come in by westminster and had reached as far as brentford about one or two oclock wyatt came and marched past charing cross without hindrance except that as he passed saint jamess the earl of pembroke fell upon his rear and so marched along the strand and up fleet street until he came before ludgate there they knocked to come in falsely saying that the queen had granted their request and pardoned them but lord william howard was not to be thus deceived as others had been on the way his answer was a stern cry of avaunt traitor thou shalt not come in here for a little while wyatt rested upon a seat at the belle sauvage gate but at last being weary of this pastime he turned back on charing cross when he reached temple bar the queens horsemen met him and the battle began when he saw the fight going against him wyatt yielded and so sir maurice berkeley and others brought him and his chief captains to court and at five oclock they were taken to the tower by water and as they passed in sir john bridges the lieutenant ungenerously upbraided the prisoner saying that if it were not that the law must justly pass upon him he would strike him with his dagger to whom wyatt answered with a grim and grievous lookit were no mastery now and so they passed on thus was wyatts rebellion quashed the stars in their courses fought against him note in addition to his cruel persecution of the gospellers he had been a notorious libertine note cott ms appendix twentyeight

from the tower guns ere england knew what was the vengeance to be taken once more royal blood was shed upon tower hill once more england stooped to commit murder at the dictation of a foreign power the white dove was sacrificed about ten oclock on the morning of the th of february lord guilford dudley was beheaded on tower hill it is plain that he died a protestant seeing that no priest was present at his death and like the fiends they were his executioners brought him both going to the scaffold and his dead body in returning past the windows of partridges house where his poor young wife had her lodging they let herthat tender bird of seventeen short summersfrom her chamber lattice see all the horror she could see and feel all the agony she could feel and then they brought her forth to die also calmly and quietly as though she had been going to her forfeited throne she came forth to her death and she was going to her throne for she was one of christs martyrs and sat upon his throne with him she spoke very little on the scaffold only saying that though she had consented unto the setting up of herself against the queens highness yet was she innocent of all procurement or desire thereof and that she died a true christian woman looking for eternal life unto the passion of jesus christ only and to none other and she thanked god that had given her space to repent for when she was younger and did know the word of god she had neglected the same and had loved her own self and the world and then she said to dr feckenham shall i say this psalm feckenhama man of the jesuitical type renowned for the softness and sweetness of his mannersbowed assent then the victim prayed through the fiftyfirst psalm and prepared herself for the sacrifice the hangman knelt down and asked her forgiveness she replied most willingly and i pray you despatch me quickly will you take it off before i lay me down poor child the executioner was the one who dealt with her most gently and respectfully he said no madam so she handed her gloves to one of her women and her book to sir john bridges and tied the handkerchief over her eyes feeling about with her hands for the block she saidwhat shall i do where is it where is it one of the bystanders guided her hand to it then she laid down her head and saying lord into thy hands i commend my spirit her head fell with one stroke she was out of philips way now and the angels of god for whose company she exchanged a society somewhat less angelic were not so likely to account her in their way a fearful day was that from dawn to dusk half an hour after the execution of lady jane lord courtenay but a few days before made earl of devon was brought into the tower he would not declare the cause of his coming there saying he could not tell but added he let the world judge all the evening the noise of hammers was going in the city for the gallows were set up everywhere there was one at every gate of the city and at the bridgefoot one four in southwark one at leadenhall two in cheapside six or eight in fleet street and charing crossnor were these all throughout london all the prisons were so full that the less important prisoners were kept in the churches by eighty in a group dr thorpe said if they hang all the queens subjects there will be small fear of a new rebellion men greeted each other fearfully scarcely knowing if they should ever meet again but the worst fears of all were awakened for the archbishop bishop ridley and mr latimer within the tower and for mr rose outside it on the th of february isoult avery wrote in her diary in southwark all this day were the gallows at work till i am sick at heart for every sound i hear the gallows at aldgate i thank god cannot be seen from our windows being hid by the gate if it could i scantly know what should come of us i dare not go forth of the door lest i meet some awful sight that i may not forget to my dying day god himself showeth his displeasure by fearful sights from heaven two suns should this morrow be seen in the sky and this even was a rainbow over london turned the diverse way the arch on the ground and the points on high i dare not think what shall come next either on earth or in heaven unless christ himself that scarce ever was more wanted would rend the heavens and come down to save us yea amen lord jesus come thou quickly but no sign of the son of man flashed on that weary land not yet was accomplished the number of the elect and until the last sheep was gathered into the fold there could be no hastening of the kingdom the execution of lady janes father quickly followed her own he died as men of his stamp often do better than he had lived the subjection to bondage from fear of death in which he had spent his trembling life vanished before death came to him boldly and bravely this timid shrinking soul stood forth at the last telling all the world that he died in the faith of christ trusting to be saved by his blood only and by no other trumpery strange words from one of the weakest men that ever livedyet it is the special characteristic of christs strength that it is made perfect in weakness it may be chiefly when his children come to die that they understand the full meaning of that passage he hath abolished death for our faith as it has been said is a religion of paradoxes strength whose perfection lies in weaknesslife which is founded upon a deathglory which springs out of shame and suffering when the twelve heard that to draw all men unto him the master should be lifted up from the earth it probably never dawned upon their minds that the scene of that exaltation was to be the cross news that made men tremble came before the end of february the lady elizabeth had been summoned to courtwas it for life or deathand bishop bonner had issued a commission of inquiry concerning all in his diocese with orders to present all persons who had failed to frequent auricular confession and the mass

which had been delayed reached isoult avery in the beginning of march unto my right entirely beloved friend mistress avery that dwelleth at the sign of the lamb in the minories next without aldgate beside london be these delivered my very well beloved isoultmy most hearty and loving commendations remembered unto thee sithence my last writing have i made a most woeful discovery the which i would almost i had not done but thou shalt know the same an even of late i was alone in my chamber sewing having sent maria forth to buy certain gear i lacked and being so alone i began to sing lowly that hymn of saint bernardhic breve vivitur hic breve plangitur note when of a sudden i was aroused from my singing by a sound like a groaning and that very near i hearkened and heard it again one was surely moaning in the next chamber thinking that one of the bowerwomen might be evil at ease and lack one to help her i crept forth from my chamber and listening at the door of the next heard plainly the moaning again i laid mine hand on the latch and entered it was a large chamber airy but not light all the windows were high up in the wall there was a bed divers chairs and a table and by the table sat a woman apparelled in black her arms laid thereon and her head upon them her face showed much pain she lifted her head slowly as i came towards her and then i saw that she had the face of a stranger who is it she said in a whispered voice my name senora is ines de olanda said i meseemeth you lack ease could i in any wise bring it unto you ay i lack ease muchacha which is to say maiden quoth she i lack rest but that lieth inthe grave she spake slowly and uncertainly whence comest thou she said again thy tone is not of these partssenora said i i am a stranger from englandand how camest thou hither quoth she as reader of english unto the queens highness said i how much hast thou read unto the queen she asked and smiled her smile lighted up her face marvellously it was not a fair face i misdoubt if it were ever such her hair is near white now but though her complexion were good and her eyes shining and dark grey her features must have been alway something harsh and strong nothing at all senora then said i for it is now three months sithence my coming and yet had i never the honour to see her highnesstraitors quoth she angrily and her features grew harsher than ever i stood in silence thou art not a lutheran she said suddenly methinks it should fare ill senora with any that were so here i made answer desiring to be discreet is that any answer to my question she said knitting her brows senora said i trembling greatly i cannot tell a lie even though you may betray me i am a lutherani betray thee she said pitifully poor child whoso doth that it will not be i i am under the same bansenora i cried much astonied you are a lutheran here in the queens palacedoth that amaze thee she answered with another smile then a second thing i can tell thee will do so yet morei am the queen i set myself upon my knees afore her highness so soon as my astonishment would give me leave they do not burn me she said in the slow uncertain way wherein she had spoken at first i think they scarce liked to do that but i had suffered less for then it had been over long ago they say i am mad and it doth seem sometimes as if somewhat in my head were lost she saith pressing her hands wearily upon her brow it was dona isabel my mother she used to give me the cuerdasenora i answered craving your highness pardon i being a maid from strange parts know not that word cuerdahave they the thing in your land answered the queen heavily did they try that on my poor sister your princess of wales katherine of aragon ay de mii know not said i under the gracious pleasure of your highness what the thing islook she said pointing with her thin trembling hand i looked whither she pointed and in the further corner of the chamber i saw a frame of pulleys set in the ceiling but it came not presently to my mind wherefore they were there they set those short sticks under my arms the queen said speaking heavily as it were with sleep then they jerk up the pulleys and i have to go up with them it hurts very much i think i scream sometimes and then he beats me for disturbing people they alway do it at night they say i need it and i am mad i marvel if they cure mad people so in england and i think if they did it sometimes in the day it would not disturb people so much you see i understand it notat least they say so but i fancy i understood better before the cuerda i was silent from very horror as the fearful truth dawned slowly upon me ay de mi sighed the queen again leaving her head fall back upon her arms my father never used to do so they say tis by his command i marvel if they tell me the truthwho dareth to do thus unto your highness i said at last denia she said in the same dreamy fashion and them he bringeth with him they want me to confess and to hear mass i think they make me go sometimes when that thing in mine head is lost but if i know it i resist them again she lifted her head and her voice grew more resolute muchacha i have been here twentysix years all that time in this chamber they left me two of my children at the first then they took the infant don fernando from me and all my heart twined round my little maidmy lastborn my catalina so they took her i never knew why i never did know wherefore they began at all save for listening to some french friars that came to see me and they told me very good things god was good they said and loved me and jesus our lord had taken away all my sins and it was good to think so so then they beat me and set me in the cuerda and they called me an heretic and a lutheran and all the bad words they knew i do not think the holy angels at the gates of paradise will turn me away nor call me an heretic because i thought jesus had taken away my sins if this be lutheranism then i am a lutheranthen i will be a lutheran for ever and those were good friars that came from paris they say the observants are the ones i should believe the queen dona isabel set observants about me but the observants beat me and put me in the cuerda and the good men note the french friarssaid jesus our lord loved me and had taken away all my sins that was the better evangel of the two that thing in my head goes wrong when they give me the cuerda but when i can sit quiet like this and they will let me alone a little while i love to think of jesus our lord and of his taking away all my sins i know not wherefore i should be beaten for that it is my head thou seest poor poor lady i felt great tears running down my face and dropping on my gown as i knelt ay senora mia i said so well as i could falter it jesus our dear lord hath taken away all our sins that do believe in him he loveth your highness and if you will cling to him he will have you to dwell with himself at the end of this life i felt i must use words easy to be received for her understanding seemed gone and like unto that of a little child ay doncella mia she sighed i shall be glad when the end of this life is come and she laid down her poor head so wearily when the lord seeth good i answered sometimes she said dreamily again i want so sorely to go forth i long so much to breathe the sweet cool airto see the corktrees and the olives they never bring me so much as an orange flower then my head goes wrong thou seest when this longing cometh on me and then and sometimes i feel sick and cannot eat then they make me eat with the cuerda i wish jesus would make haste and help me i used to understand it all better before i had the cuerda but i had my husband then and my children around me not one of them ever comes now and there are six note my husband is deadi think he is they say so note i think they might have let one of them come if only just to say mother to me i cannot understand it now and it seems so longso long ay de mi if jesus would come i could not utter another word ere rosada brake in ines she cried in a loud whisper what do you here know you not amiga that the lord marquis will wellnigh kill you if he find you in this chamber none of her highness women are ever allowed to enter at will back back as fast as you can go then kneeling a moment she said hastily criada umilisima de su alteza the most humble servant of her highness and arising pushed me forth of the chamber and into mine own almost before i knew what she had said or done five minutes later my lord of denia his steps sounded in the corridor thank the holy virgin and all the saints cried rosada under her breath amiga you know not that man he would not hesitate one minute to stab you if he found you there and fancied any cause of suspicion against you tis forbidden groundmaria sin pecado without sin how came you in such peril i knew her never before left alone even a momenti did but hear her highness moaning i said bewilderedly and was moved to go to herthe devil must have moved you she saith breathlessly i think rather i answered saving your presence rosada and not intending you it was the devil pushed me forth hitheryou mean my lord marquis quoth she taking me rightly the saints pardon her highness you know she is quite out of her mind she saith all manner of evil of him i thought it better perchance to make no answer but into my mind came a remembrance touching a way wherein the fools should not err and i thought she should maybe come in at the gates of heaven afore either rosada or i o isoult i would i were forth of this horrible country it is peopled with devils leonor is not one methinks nor assuredly is rosada neither this my poor sely maiden maria but i should find it hard to write a fourth within this palace i may not make my letter much longer prithee tell me some news of england if any be and shouldst thou hear ought of my gracious mistress the duchess of suffolk i would like much to know it i do wellnigh wish i had not gone into that chamber and yet if i have in any wise comforted her it is well it hath maybe done her some little good to pour forth her sorrows to me for a minute but now i never awake of a night but i listen for those fearful screams i thank god i have not heard them again as yet methinks her gossips did blunder in naming her juana they should have called her dolores sorrows i pray thee make mine hearty commendations to mr avery and all other that i know and kiss thy little kate for me and so i commend thee to the tuition of god from tordesillas this fourteenth of augustthine own assuredly annis holland when we look back over the way which the lord has led us these forty years in the wilderness we sometimes find in retrospect the marahs no sadder than the elims nay there are times when the elims are the sadder a sorrows crown of sorrow is remembering happier things there was much sorrow of that class for the gospellers at this time ease and liberty had gone already they were followed by the cruel agony of parting within fourteen days of the th of february every married priest in the diocese of london was commanded to be deprived and divorced the first would have been a sufficiently bitter draught without the added desolation of the second on the table before isoult avery lay a sheet of paper containing a few lines of uneven writing they were blotted with tears and were signed marguerite rose their purport was to ask for shelter at the lamb for a few weeks until she could see her way more clearly thekla herself brought her mothers letter there were no tears from her only her face was white and worn and weary and you have not wept thekla said isoult there are tears enough elsewhere she said and shook her head i cannot weep it would ease me perhaps if i could these fiends of men cried dr thorpe who was not renowned for weighing his words carefully when he was indignant is it because they cannot drive nor persuade us into the sin and unbelief of hell that they be determined we shall lose none of the torment of it so far as lieth in their hand to give us shall god see all this and not move have they banished him out of the realm with other strangers bitter words dr thorpe answered robin softly shall god cast away his people whom he foreknew from them that are lights in the world shall he who is the light of the world depart nay when we pass through the waters he will be with us they are dark waters for some of us whispered thekla under her voice but not fathomless dear thekla replied robin there are footsteps before us though we may not see them and at the dreariest there is god above us i hope so responded dr thorpe i am afeard robin thou shalt say i am an unbeliever and a fool but it doth look mainly as if he had fallen asleep and the devil had stole the reins of the world out of his hands not an unbeliever said robin in his gentle manner only a believer in the dark lord carest thou not that we perish they were not unbelievers that said that but you well know the answerhow is it that ye have no faith tis main hard to get hold of it lad said dr thorpe more quietly but with some choking in his voice tis harder to do without it answered robin dr thorpe never twitted robin with his youth now on the contrary he seemed to respect him as one who with few years had amassed much wisdom there was only one unpleasant element in the grant of a refuge to mrs rose it would lock the doors of the lamb on the beloved pastor where she was he must come no more the chief element of comfort was thekla she could have free access to both her parents so long as they remained at liberty and mr rose might yet be heard to preach in the houses of other gospellers isoult said dr thorpe coming in a few days after this woeful letter had been received and answered for all the late headings there be fools left in the realm troth said she laughing i never cast doubt else why pursued he if they hang up all the wise men what else shall be left but list the marvellous news yesterday a parcel of lads did gather in a field by saint james for to have a game of childres play is that such news said john hold thy peace till i have made an end said dr thorpe these childre in their playing as childre will did elect to follow their fathers in their late diversion and one half of them should be the queens men and the other half wyatts men and so rough was their play that the lad which stood for the prince of spain was caught of wyatts side and half strangled of them but in the midst thereof ere he were full hanged come the watch and took all the young rebels into custody as well the one side as the other i take it they boxed their ears and let them go said john do you so answered dr thorpe not by no manner of means worthy sir but this day are the great and mighty rebels on their trial afore the queens council and the statesmen of this realm do sit in sad debate what shall be done with them i had counted that the lad which was half hanged should have been enough punished for his state crimes but maybe they think not so but shall hang him out but saw you a copy of the queens majestys ordinances nay replied john what be they it were well to know them he answered these be they first all the statutes of king henry touching religion shall be put in force no sacramentary shall be admitted to any benefice all married priests shall be deprived but more lenity shall be shown to them whose wives be dead to wit i take it they shall not be divorced from their dead wives if they shall part by consent and shall promise to commit the crime of matrimony no further they may be admitted again at discretion of the bishop but in no case to the same benefice no religious man shall be suffered to wed processions latin service holy days fasts and all laudable and honest ceremonies shall be observed homilies shall be set forth men shall go to their parish church only suspected schoolmasters shall be put forth and catholic men put instead and lastly touching such persons as were heretofore promoted to any orders after the new fashion hark to this robin considering they were not ordained in very deed the bishop of the diocese finding otherwise sufficiency and ability in these men may supply that thing which wanted in them before and thus according to his discretion permit them to minister now here is a knot to untie how say you concerning the divorce of such men not again ordained of the bishops if they be not priests then they need not to be divorced or if they be divorced then are they priests friend said john there is no better man in this world than dr gardiner for getting round a corner and where he may not come round the corner he hath alisaunders sword to cut the knot with no more ado the blow fell at last and the home in leadenhall street was broken up mr rose himself brought his wife and daughter to the lamb on the evening of the th of march which was the last allowed for all married priests to separate from their wives doubtless the parting was very painful but it passed in private and the averys too much reverenced his sorrow to suffer him to depart otherwise than in silence only john walked with him to his desolate home and he told isoult that not a word was spoken by either but the clasp of mr roses hand at parting was not to be lightly forgotten the lads who had mimicked the rebellion were whipped and imprisoned for three days and then released by the queens own command on the th of march the archbishop dr ridley and mr latimer set out for oxford where they wereostensibly to maintain their theories in a public disputation really to be martyred dr hooper went part of the way with them he was going to gloucesterto the same end for a week thekla flitted backwards and forwards between her parents generally spending her mornings with her father and the evenings with her mother robin constituted himself her guard in all her journeyings sunday was the day after his bereavement and mr rose was silent but the following sunday he preached at mr hollands house where the gospellers gathered to hear him thekla remained with her mother she would not leave her alone with her sorrowful thoughts it was a rainy morning but in the days before umbrellas were invented rain was less thought of than it has been since john avery and his wife dr thorpe esther and robin set forth despite the rain before they had gone many yards they overtook a crowd of people all running riverwards and isoult looking towards the water fancied that she could see the standard of the royal barge whither away asked john of some of the crowd but no answer was vouchsafed except a cry of the tower till suddenly mr underhill hove in sight and was questioned at once what know you not what all london knoweth said he that the lady elizabeths grace is this morrow a prisoner of the tower tis very true i warrant you would it were less this moment is the queens barge at hand with her will you see have with you said dr thorpe who never missed a sight if he could possibly help it the rest went on mr rose looked older they thought and more worn than was his wont but his voice was as gentle and his smile as sweet as ever he came to them as soon as they came in and wanted to know all they could tell him of mrs rose and thekla though his eyes asked rather than his lips yet his first words were a query why thekla was not with them his sermon was on three words of david he shall live and first he showed that david spoke this of christ by prophecy and then divided his subject into three headshe hath lived he doth live he shall live and under the first head he pointed out how from all eternity christ had lived with the father and was his delight rejoicing alway before him and how then he had lived a little babe and a weary man upon this earth defiled with sin amidst a people who knew him not and would not receive him then coming to the next part he doth live he showed what he now does standing before the throne of god within the true veil and beside the better mercyseat presenting in himself every one of his people and pleading every moment for them and lastly he shall live he shall come again he shall reign over the earth he shall live for ever and because he liveth we shall live also if he could die again then might we but he dieth no more having died once for us and we that believe in him he having died in our stead can never die the second death he hath abolished death as well for his church as for himself he that is the living one for evermore holdeth the keys of hell and of death and for this cause even the natural death not one can suffer except by his permission mr rose bade his hearers not to fall into the blunder that evil men held their lives in their hands christ hath the keys not they if they be suffered to take our lives away it is because we have ended our work and he calleth us home to him and what child ever went home from school that went not gladly except indeed he had an ill home let us not bring up an evil report of that good land by unwillingness to go home coming back they found dr thorpe returned and talking with thekla she is the manliest woman ever i saw in all my life cried he thekla made no answer except a smile but it disappeared as soon as she saw her friends and coming forward she began to talk in a low tone with robin there is small praise for somebody said john who is itmy lady elizabeths grace even so replied dr thorpe well and how went the matter said he why he answered they took her in at the drawbridge by the traitors gate and the barge arrived there my lord treasurer sent my lord of sussex to desire her grace to land nay that will i not quo she nor could she in very deed unless she had gone into the water over her shoe my lord of sussex then went back from her to my lord treasurer and brought word that she would not come then said my lord treasurer roughly she shall not choose and all this while sat she in the rain so my lord treasurer stepped forward and did proffer his cloak for her to tread on then up rose my lady elizabeth and put back my lord treasurers cloak with her hand with a good dash and setting her foot upon the stair she saith stoutly here landeth the truest subject being a prisoner that ever landed at these stairs to whom my lord treasurerso much the better for you madam so in went she as manly as ever did man and sir john gage shut up the gates upon her she hath the stoutest stomach ever i saw if all the men were hanged through england there should be yet one left in her on good friday the marquis of northampton was released from the tower dr thorpe said the queen played at seesaw with my lord of northampton for he is in the tower this day and out the next and so over again in the afternoon of easter sunday esther and mrs rose went out together when they returned mrs rose went up quickly to her own chamber and esther drew her mistress aside why esther what is the matter said isoult methinks i had better tell you replied she i would i could have helped it yet the blessed saw not good as we came back through poules there was set up on a board a long list of all the priests in this diocese which have been divorced from their wives by decree of my lord of london and them that had parted by consent were set by themselves and in this list good lack cried isoult saw you mr roses name she saw it said esther in a low voice though i did essay to turn her away therefrom by bidding her to observe the fair carving on the other side the way but it was to no good she caught the two namesthomas rose and margaret van der velde and she brake forth when she saw them i thank the all merciful we two were alone in the cloister but what said she margaret van der velde she cried i am not margaret van der velde i am marguerite rose i have borne his name for two and twenty years and shall i cast it off now at the bishop of londons bidding no not if he were the pope and the whole college of cardinals then she fell into french and spanish mixed together and parted by consent quoth she ay dios que veuton dire what consent is there they thrust us asunder with halberds and then say we have parted by consent god art thou in heaven and dost thou see all this she cried poor soul and what saidst thou esther i said little only essayed to draw her away and to comfort her it is hard work to bear such things i know but i think we be too apt to seek to be our kings kingsto bring down the holy one that inhabiteth eternity to the measure of our poor knowledge tis not alway when we think israel at the lowest that othniel is raised up to judge us he will come at the right time and in time to save us but very often that is not the time we would choose poor mrs rose isoult could scarcely wonder at her words of indignation but she had not seen nor borne the worst yet isoult said dr thorpe coming in on the th of april there is a jolly sight in the chepe i take it a piece of some lutherans or gospellers work whose wit and zeal be on the thither side of his discretion on the gallows in cheapside is a cat hanged arrayed in vestments all proper her head shaven and her forefeet tied over her head with a round of paper betwixt them for a wafer what say you to that for a new thing poor cat said robin yet he laughed nay i know not that they killed the cat o purpose said dr thorpe they may have taken a dead one but what say the folk thereto asked isoult some laugh he answered and some rail and some look mighty solemn underhill was jolly pleased therewith it served his turn rightly i met him on my way home and he asked me first thing if i had seen sir cat i warrant you said john tis a piece of his work or else of george ferris mind you not how he told us the tale of his underhill stealing the copper pix from the altar at stratford on the bow i will be bound one of those merry twain hath done it little unlike said dr thorpe proclamation was made of a reward of twenty nobles increased afterward to twenty marks to find the irreverent hanger up of the cat but in vain it was never discovered who did it on cantate sundayapril mr rose preached at mr sheersons house in bow churchyard john and isoult were there with esther thekla and robin after service for they were late and it was beginning when they entered mr rose came to them and after a few minutes conversation asked if they had heard the news from oxford nay said john is there so the sorest we might well have he answered my lord archbishop dr ridley and mr latimer be all three cast for death such a cry broke from isoult that some turned to look at her and mrs holland came up and asked if she was ill or what was the matter are you assured thereof asked john with little question answered he seeing augustine bernher came unto me with the news and is lodged with me who was himself present at the sentencing and all the whole disputation if austin brought it it is true said john sorrowfully but they will never burn mr latimer cried isoult in anguish an aged man such as he is that must die in a few years at the furthest and my lord archbishop that is chiefest subject of the whole realm said john there is an other before him now answered mr rose the chiefest subject of the realm is cardinal pole that is looked for nigh every week austin bernher who had been talking with mr holland now came up and john begged him to tell them particulars of the trial it was a right morrisdance said he all the examination mr prolocutor weston disputed with the beerpot at his elbow and forgot not his devoirs thereto in the course thereof and whether the said pot were in fault i will not say but at opening he made a sorry blunder for he said that the court was called to dispute the detestable heresy of the verity of the body of christ in the sacrament there was much laughter in the court thereupon it was in the choir of saint mary the virgin they held court and my lord archbishop was first examined he denied all propositions advanced unto him and spake very modestly wittily cleverly and learnedly so at the end of the day he was sent back to bocardo where they held him confined then the next day they had in dr ridley who showed sharp witty and very earnest and denied that being bishop of rochester he had ever preached in favour of transubstantiation at one point the people hissing at an answer he had given dr ridley turned him around unto them ando my masters saith he i take this for no judgment i will stand to gods judgment the day thereafter called they up my master latimer who on his entering escaped no hissings nor scornful laughter he came in from the bailiffs house where he was lodged having a kerchief and three or four caps on his head for the fear of cold his staff in his hand and his spectacles hanging at his breast by a string note he earnestly desired to be allowed a seat and also to speak in english for quoth he i am out of use with the latin and almost as meet to dispute as to be a captain of calais moreover he said his memory was weakened and he very faint then they asked him if he would allow the verity of the body of christ to be in the sacrament quoth he i have read over the new testament seven times and yet could i never find the mass in it neither the marrowbones nor sinews of the same you know his merry fashion then they asked him how long he had been of that opinion and he said he had not been so long that time had been when he said mass devoutly for the which he craved gods mercy now and he had not been of this mind above seven years then they charged him that he was a lutheran nay said he i was a papist for i never could perceive how luther could defend his opinion without transubstantiation and they desired he should reason touching luthers opinion i do not take in hand to defend luthers sayings or doings quoth my master if he were here he would defend himself well enough and so went they forward my master answering readily but calmly yet he warmed up high enough once when one spake of the priest offering of christ quoth he with some of the ancient fire that was wont to be in him he is too precious a thing for us to offer he offereth himself well after his examination was over and they took two days to it master harpsfield disputed with my lord archbishop for his doctors gown and the day thereafter which was friday were they all three brought forth to be judged then were dr ridley and my master asked if they would turn but they both answered nay i will stand to that i have said so then sentence of burning was passed upon all of them for heresy then said my lord archbishopfrom your judgment and sentence i appeal to the just judgment of god almighty trusting to be present with him in heaven for whose presence in the altar i am thus condemned dr ridleys answer wasalthough i be not of your company yet doubt i not but my name is written in an other place whither this sentence shall send us sooner than we should by the course of nature have come and quoth my masteri thank god most heartily that he hath prolonged my life to this end that i may in this case glorify god by this kind of death so they carried them away each to his old lodging and yestermorn but an hour before i set out there was mass and procession down the high street to saint marys they caused my lord to behold it from bocardo and dr ridley from the sheriffs house but not going by the bailiffs house they fetched my master to see it who thought he was going to his burning and saith unto the catchpole my master i pray you make a quick fire but when he came to carfax lo there came the procession in sight dr weston carrying the host and four other doctors supporting the canopy over him and his breadgod which no sooner had my master seen than he gathered up his heels and away he ran as fast as ever his old bones could carry him into one spencers shop and would not so much as look toward it and incontinent after that came i thence so that i cannot tell any more from may to july there was a respite in some respects were they waiting for philip the princess elizabeth was released from the tower and sent to richmond mr bertie summoned before gardiner in lent took advantage of the temporary cessation of the persecution in the summer and escaped to germany the gallows set up for wyatts followers were taken down the cross in cheapside was regilded and bonfires bellringing and te deums were commanded throughout london as soon as the news of philips landing should be received i marvel observed mr rose one sunday if we should not do better to sing miserere mei deus philip came at lasttoo soon at any timelanding at hampton on the th of july he and the queen were married in the lady chapel of winchester cathedral on the th mr underhill being present and receiving a venison pasty as his share of the spoil and on the th of august london went forth to welcome its new king dr thorpe of course put on clean ruffles and trudged off to see the sight so did john and robin though they contented themselves with strolling down to the riverside to watch the barge pass isoult declined as she said to go see one of whom she feared so much john asked mrs rose and thekla if they wished to go what to see the prince of the asturias note cried mrs rose think you we have seen too little of him in flanders i would as soon to see satan thekla smiled and shook her head and that was her answer so when the three returned they were desired to say what like were the king not so high as kate nor any thing like so well favoured growled dr thorpe softly softly said john smiling call him a king said dr thorpe who appeared somewhat put out on my word i have seen many a mason and carpenter a deal fairer men and vastly taller fellows of their hands he should be shamed to be a king and so slender and pitiful a fellow isoult could not help laughing and so did thekla now give us thine opinion jack said his wife well replied he methinks his highness is somewhat taller than kate but truly he is under the common height of men his limbs be well made and lithe and his person of fair proportions his hair is somewhat too deep to call it yellow yet fair his eyes grey with a weak look thereabout as though he might not bear overmuch light his brow not illmade for wit yet drawing backward his lips large very red and thick like all of his house note he hath a fair beard and mustachio and his complexion is fair yet not clear but rather of a caincolour note ah the lip of the house of austriahow well i know it it maketh me to shudder to hear you said mrs rose yet if his complexion be caincolour he is changed from what he was in his young years was it very fair and clearas fair as walter he is mighty unlike walter now said dr thorpe and what is thy view robin i have not to add to what father hath said replied he saving that i thought there was a gloomy and careworn look upon the kings face he is stately and majestical of his carriage but his nether part of his face cometh forward in a fashion rather strong than seemly it struck me he should be a man not easily turned from his purpose mr underhill presented himself in the evening well said he saw you our goodly king philip nay said dr thorpe i saw a mighty illfavoured mr underhill laughed verily said he i would be bond that i could match him for beauty with any the first man i should meet withal in the city there were two swords carried afore him ay said dr thorpe to cut off all heads withal that be left yet unmown i fear so much answered mr underhill more gravely than was his wont were you forth this even no said john we have all sat at home sithence my homecoming in the streets tonight said he i count i have met four spaniards for every englishman if the king bring all spain over hither we shall be sweetly off as i was coming hither i protest unto you i heard more spanish talked than mine own tongue i trust some of you have that tongue or you shall find you in a foreign countryyea even in the heart of london i have it said john and so hath mrs rose but methinks we stand alone no mr avery you do not so quietly said esther note marry i never learned any tongue save mine own nor never repented thereof answered dr thorpe saving of course so much latin as a physician must needs pick up withal i count i could bray like a jackass an i tried and that were good enough for any strangeborn companion as ever cumbered the soil of merry england mr underhill laughed as did john and robin dr thorpe you are exceedingly courteous and i thank you heartily said mrs rose smiling almost for the first time body o me what is a man to do when he falleth into the ditch o this manner said he with a comical look mrs rose i am an ass by nature and shall find little hardship in braying i do beseech you of pardon for that i meant not to offend you and in very deed i scarce ever do remember that you are not my countrywoman you are good enough for an english woman and i would you werethere i am about to make yet again a fool of myself heed not i pray you an old man in his dotage my good friend say not one other word answered mrs rose kindly i do feel most delighted that you should say i am good enough for an english woman i can see that is very much from you spaniards were everywhere england had become a nation of spaniards in her streets as she was a province of spain in her government and englishmen knew that spain like rome whose true daughter she was never unloosed her hand from any thing she had once grasped isoult begged her husband to teach her spanish but kate desired to know why they were all come is there no meat ne drink in their country that they come to eat up ours she asked in her simplicity her mother told her they were come to wait on the king which was a gentleman of their nation but wherefore so said she could the queen not marry an englishman that could have talked english i am sure our robin is good enough for any queen that ever carried a crown on her head a view of the subject which so greatly tickled robin that he could not speak for laughing he was and always had been very fond of kate and she of him a fresh rumour now ran that five thousand more spaniards would shortly be brought over and some of them preferred to the vacated benefices and sees on the th of september gardiner preached at the cross the bishop of london bearing his crosier before him all the council were present who were then at court he spoke much of charity which is commonly lauded by false teachers and said that great heresy had heretofore been preachen at that place by preachers in king edwards time which did preach no thing but voluptuousness and blasphemous lies then he touched upon the pharisees who stood said he for such men as will reason and dispute in the stead of obeying and lastly he spoke of the king praised his dominion and riches and willed all so obediently to order them that he might still tarry with them well said dr thorpe i count i shall not need to order me for so long time as king philip is like to tarry with us but afore i do go on my marrowbones to beg him tarry i would fain know somewhat more of what he is like to do for us our friends at the lamb were fearfully employed on the th of october for during the previous fortnight there had been so severe a search for lutheran books and nearly sixty persons arrested who were found to possess them that john determined to hide all his in a secret place one that he said with gods grace these bloodhounds shall not lightly find yet easy of access unto them that do know the way so he buried all the books at which offence could be taken leaving only his own lawbooks and isoults romaunts that she had when a girl and dr thorpes game of the chess and robins song of the lady bessy and the little gest of robin hood and similar works in the evening came mr underhill whom they told what had been their occupation why said he but yesterday was i at the very same business i sent for old henry daunce the bricklayer of white chapel who used to preach the gospel in his garden every holiday where i have seen a thousand persons and got him to enclose my books in a brick wall by the chimney side in my chamber where they shall be preserved from moulding or mice mine old enemies the papistical spies john a vales and beard have been threatening me but i sent them a message by means of master luke the physician of coleman street to let them know that if they did attempt to take me except they had a warrant signed with four or five of the councils hands i would go further with them than peter did who strake off but the ear of malchus but i would surely strike off head and all after which message mr john vales and mr beard never meddled further with the hot gospeller doubtless knowing they might trust him to keep his word and having no desire to risk their necks on the rd of november see note in appendix was born mr underhills son edward at his house in wood street this being no time to search for sponsors of rank john avery stood for the child at the fathers request with mr ive and mrs elizabeth lydiatt mr underhills sister who was staying with him at that time and only a week later they were all at another christening of mr hollands child baptised by mr rose and the sponsors were lord strange his kinsman by deputy mr underhill and thekla the child was named after lord strange henry the sex and name of roger hollands child are not recorded the all however did not include mrs rose for she knew too well poor soul the dread penalty that would ensue if her husband were taken in her company the year ended better than the gospellers feared no harm had come to the archbishop and his brother prisoners mr underhill and mr rose were still at liberty cardinal pole had returned to the fatherland whence he had been banished for many years but from him they hardly looked for evil the princess elizabeth was restored to favour roger holland had left london for his own home in lancashire to prevent his child from being rebaptised after the roman fashion he meant to leave it with his father and return himself to london in the gospellers houses mr rose was still preaching he was to administer the sacrament on the night of new years day at mr sheersons house in bow churchyard and philip had been king five months surely the cloud had a silver lining surely they had feared more than there was need so argued the more sanguine of the party but it was only the dusk which hid the black clouds that had gathered only the roar of mens work which drowned the growl of the imminent storm they were enteringthough they knew it noton the darkest hour of the night note brief life is here our portion brief sorrow shortlived care the life that knows no ending the tearless life is there neales

darkest hour of the night i falter where i firmly trod and falling with my weight of cares upon the worlds great altarstairs that slope through darkness up to god i stretch lame hands of faith tennyson twentytwo hours of the year had passed away john avery robin and esther had gone to the service held in mr sheersons house the children had been put to bed before they went thekla was upstairs with her mother who had begged her to remain at home mrs rose could give no reason for her request except that she felt low and nervous and had a fancy or a foreboding which it might be that it would be better for thekla to absent herself dr thorpe and isoult sat alone in the little chamber of the lamb it was past ten oclockin the middle of the night to their apprehensionbut there could be no going to bed until they knew of the safety of the absent ones at last halfanhour at least after they had expected it john averys hand was heard on the latch he came in alone thou art very late jack said isoult when he entered where leftest robin and esther john who had turned his back as soon as he came in was very busy hanging up his cloak which isoult thought took longer than his wont at last john came forward to the fire and then his wife saw the look on his face and knew that some terrible thing had happened dear heart he said huskily the lord doth all things well a sure sign murmured dr thorpe that something hath gone ill when a man shall say that at his first homecoming what is it jack hath robin brake his leg in the frost suddenly the dread truth rushed on isoult o jack jack is mr rose taken she cried in terror john pointed above where were two who must not hear that awful news unprepared mr rose and all his hearers saving two the good lord have mercy upon them so dr thorpe but isoult was silent tears would not come yet who were the two jack is it robin or esther they have taken pursued dr thorpe with his brows knit both said he shortly it was strange but for the first moment isoult had not remembered either esther or robin two thoughts alone were present to her that mr rose was taken and that john was safe now the full sorrow broke on her o jack jack our robinand esther too beloved said he his voice trembling both are safe with him who having died for his own that are in the world loveth them unto the end there shall not an hair of their heads perish of them that thou gavest me have i lost none who was the other that scaped them a man whose name i knew not said john both we stood close to a great closet in the wall and slid therein noiselessly on the sheriffs entering and by the good providence of god it never came in their heads to open that door so when they all were gone and the street quiet we could go softly down the stairs and win thence and where were robin and esther esther was on the further side of the chamber by mistress sheerson and robin stood near rose at the other end thereof was the service over no rose was in the act of giving the bread of the lords supper dr thorpe asked all these questions and more isoult could ask only one how shall i tell them the troubles of that night were so many that she could scarcely feel each to the full she would have sorrowed more for esther had there not been robin and perchance even more for robin had mrs roses anguish and theklas weighed less upon her thank god thekla was not there said john the last word had not fallen from his lips when with no sound to herald her coming thekla herself stood before them the light died away from her eyes like the sun under a cloud and the colour left her lips yet her voice was calm then they have taken my father john bowed his head her sudden appearing choked his voice and he could find no words to answer her and robin he bowed his head again perchance had i been there mr avery i had thanked god rather as she said this one great sob escaped her and she turned round and went back up the stairs without another word no one made any motion to follow her voice would break the tidings best and this was an agony which none could spare her in dead silence they sat for nearly half an hour no sound came from the chamber above save the soft murmur of theklas voice which could just be heard when they listened for it her mothers voice they did not hear at all at last isoult rose lighted a candle and went gently upstairs she paused a moment at mrs roses door should she go in or not all she could hear was thekla reading or repeating a verse of scripture in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world thekla opened the door while isoult still stood there shall i come in thekla i think not mrs avery but i thank you she answered she hath not awoke to the full sorrow yet it is rather a shock a stun than an agony and who is dead to pain is alike dead to comfort she will feel it more tomorrow and then it may be an help unto her to talk with you and for thee thekla poor child said isoult sympathisingly for me said she the ghost of a smile flickering a moment about her lips it may be i have scarce awoke either but i dare not allow myself to think i have my mother to comfort and support if she can sleep at all then will be my time and who is to support thee poor thekla whispered isoult mrs avery she answered the light returning a moment to her eyes he that holdeth up heaven and earth can surely hold me up isoult said no more but to bid her goodnight she wondered at her but glided softly away the first thing in the morning when isoult rose and went into the nursery she saw a woman bending over walters crib with black shining hair that she knew could be on no head but esthers esther dear heart she cried gladly i never was more fain to see a face than thine this morrow she lifted her head and smiled ay certainly it was esther but how earnest thou safe asked isoult is any thing too hard for the lord she answered in her soft measured voice there were more prisoners than sheriffs men and not enough rope to tie us all together so they marched some of the women last and untied and while we went through a dark alley i took mine opportunity to slip aside into a doorway the door standing open and there lay i hidden for some hours and in the midst of the night ere dawn brake i crept thence and gat me to the house of my friend mistress little that i knew would be stirring by reason that her son was sick and i rapping on her door and calling to her she knew my voice and let me within so there i abode till the gate was opened and then coming home mrs thekla saw me from her window and opened to me not many minutes since i thank god that saved thee cried isoult now esther is there any likelihood of robin escaping likewise yes she said quietly if it shall be good in the eyes of the blessed to work a miracle to that end but no otherwise wailed isoult not i think with aught less answered she they tied him and mr rose together and marched them first the sheriff himself guarding them even in this agony there was cause for thankfulness mrs holland was not there nor mr underhill and his wife nor mr ive and helen nor mr ferris when the evening came isoult went up to mrs rose she found her as thekla said awake now and bemoaning herself bitterly yet the deepest part of her anguish seemed to be that she was left behind she flung her arms around her friends neck weeping aloud and spoke to her in french which or spanish she used when her heart was moved calling her isoude chere soeur and besought her to call her marguerite i am so alone now she sobbed it should make me to feel as though i had yet a sister there was no change in thekla nor any tears from her the next day the lord sent them comfort in the person of austin bernher who came straight from his good work and told them that he had seen all the prisoners mr rose they heard with heavy hearts was in the tower a sure omen that he was accounted a prisoner of importance and he was the less likely to be released robin was in the marshalsea both sent from the clink where they were detained at first austin spoke somewhat hopefully of robin the only charge against him being that brought against all the prisoners namely absence from mass and confession and presence at the service on new years night yet he did not hide his conviction that it would have been better for them all had that service been any other than the lords supper isoult asked austin if he had any hope of mr rose none whatever as touching this life was his terrible answer both sent a message by austin robins wastell my father and mother austin that i am it may be less troubled than they for i am ready to serve god in what way he will have me and if this be the way why i will walk therein with a light heart and glad that it hath pleased him to exalt me to this calling with all mine heart and soul friend i thank god i can go unto the stake as i would to my bridal and be assured of an happier and blesseder meeting therefor hereafter kiss the dear childre for me and tell them god hath given me some physic that i need after the which he promiseth me somewhat very sweet and none other message tremayne said austin when he paused ay resumed he one other ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you austin did not ask him to whom he should give this but he showed how well he knew by waiting till thekla was present before he gave it afterwards he told them mr roses words brethren the devil hath so great wrath that he must needs know he hath but a short time yet for the elects sake the days shall be shortened the trouble shall be very quickly over and the joy shall be eternal our way may be rough yet shall it not be painful for we go to god jesus christ hath wrought for us everlasting righteousness he now waiteth to see of the travail of his soul and to be satisfied he died for us with the fearful weight of the wrath of god upon him we die for him with the sweet and certain hope of eternal life so much was for all the gospellers but there were added a few special words for those at the lamb i ask not avery and his wife to have a care of my beloved ones said he for i well know they will say only from me to those beloved that the time is very short and the glory of god is very near there shall be no persecution no death no parting in the presence of the master whereunto i go bid them come to me i only pass on a few moments before them we shall meet at home god bless austin bernher he is a barnabas unto us allthe very son of consolation so wrote isoult in her diaryand well she might during the progress of the marian persecution no man was more blessed by the victims and mourners than austin austin came again four days later with yet further bad news bishop bonner had sent his sumner to lay hands upon mr hollands shop and goods and mrs holland had suffered some ill usage because she could not or would not tell where her husband was gone they had not however apprehended her and for mr holland who was expected to return to london that week austin was on the lookout isoult said her husband to her that night when this befell i was about to tell thee that methought i had now laid up a sufficiency of money for our returning to bradmond what sayest thou o jack how can we cried isoult could we leave robin in prison and could we either forsake mrs rose and thekla in their extremity or carry them with us into cornwall but what is thine own thought truly dear heart he answered my thought is that the lord hath spoken to us reasonable plain and hath said tarry where ye are until i bring you word again yes said she after a pause i think we must and take for thy comfort sweeting said he tenderly one word that hath been much laid upon mine heart of late i know where thou dwellest even where satans seat is gods letters be never wrong directed on the th of january austin came again and brought some notes of mr roses examination before gardiner it was plain that mr rose had stood forth boldly and braved the bishop to his face i wonder my lord said he that i should be troubled for that which by the word of god hath been established and by the laws of this realm hath been allowed and by your own writing so notably in your book de vera obedientia confirmed ah sirrah hast thou gotten that said the bishop who now could not bear to hear of his heretical work yea my lord calmly answered mr rose and do confess myself thereby confirmed but continued austin have you heard that my lady of suffolks grace is clean escaped o austin cried isoult tell us all you know touching her why said he it should seem to have been agreed betwixt her grace and mr bertie ere he left england but none was told save one master robert cranwell an ancient gentleman of mr berties acquaintance in whom he had great trust so last new year early in the morrow afore any were stirring her grace took her little daughter and seven of the meanest of her servants and at four of the clock departed from the barbican in silence the duchess that was donned like a mean merchants wife through much trouble came safe to lyons quay where the morning being misty the waterman was loth to launch out yet her grace persuaded him and so away rowed they toward gravesend i have yet heard with no certainty whither she hath reached but assuredly she is gone the lord keep her safe and grant her good landing whither he shall see meet to provide the same amen with all mine heart said isoult good austin if you hear any further i would earnestly pray you to do me to wit thereof that will i said he and with a very good will the th of january was a painful day to the prisoners every one of them from all the prisons was brought up before the bishop of winchester dr gardiner in his house at saint mary overy and asked if he would recant mr rose and robin of course were amongst them but all answered alike that they would stand to what they had believed and taught when he heard this the bishop raved and stormed and commanded them to be committed to straiter prison than before the same day in the general meeting of the bishops assembled at lambeth cardinal pole reproved some for too much harshness these doubtless being london and winchester of cardinal pole himself people spoke diversely some saying that he was the gentlest of all the popish bishops and had been known to visit bishop bonners burnings ere the fire was lighted and to free all of his own diocese while others maintained that under the appearance of softness he masked great severity old bishop tunstal was perhaps the best to deal with for he barked the more that he might bite the less if a protestant were brought before him he would bluster and threaten and end after all in fining the man a few nobles or locking him up for three days and similar slight penalties worst of all was bonner who scourged men ay and little children with his own hands and seemed to revel in the blood of the martyrs yet there came a time when even this monster cried out that he was weary of his work as bishop of london said he he was close under the eyes of the court and two there gave him no rest for those twoking philip and dr gardinerwere never weary drunk with the blood of the saints they yet cried ceaselessly for more they filled london and the whole land as manasseh did jerusalem with innocent blood which the lord would not pardon in the same month by command of bishop bonner mr prebendary rogers was removed from the marshalsea to newgate and there set among the common felons at this time the worst of all the prisons was newgate excepting the bishop of londons coalhole where archdeacon philpot and others were placed somewhat better was the marshalsea still better the fleet and easiest of all the counter where untried prisoners were commonly kept to await their trial alexander the keeper of newgate was wont to go to bishop bonner crying ease my prison i am too much pestered with these heretics and then an easement of the prison was made by the burning of the prisoners men grow not into monsters all at once it is a gradual proceeding though they generally run the faster as they near the end but the seeds of the very same sin lie in all human hearts and the very same thing by the withdrawal of gods spirit would take place in all gods restraining grace is no less marvellous than his renewing grace this world would be a den of wild beasts but for it on the same th of januarya black day in the protestant calendar bishop hooper was condemned to death and also mr prebendary rogers but with the latter the bishop said he would yet use charity ay observed mr rogers to austin bernher such charity as the fox useth with the chickens and such charity it proved dr rowland taylor of hadleigh and mr bradford of manchester were also adjudged to death both of whom by gods grace stood firm but mr cardmaker who was brought to trial with them and had been a very zealous preacher against romanism was overcome by the tempter recanted and was led back to prison yet for all this he did not save himself more than once during this persecution he who loved his life was seen to lose it and he that hated his life to keep iteven the lower life of this world during this season of trial augustine bernher was almost ubiquitous on the th of january he brought a letter of which he had been the bearer from bishop hooper to mr rose and the others who were taken with him mr rose having desired him to show the letter to his friends the good bishop wrote remember what lookerson you have god and his angels again now ye be even in the field and placed in the forefront of christs battle mr rose remained in the tower very strictly guarded yet austin was allowed to see him at will austin said isoult to him i marvel they never touch you in very deed mrs avery no more than i replied he but i do think god hath set me to this work seeing he thus guardeth me on january parliament broke up having repealed all laws against the pope enacted since and reenacted three old statutes against heresy the newest being of the reign of henry the fifth and all speaking against the king or queen or moving sedition was made treason for the first offence one ear was to be cut off or a hundred marks paid and for the second both ears or a fine of pounds the writer printer or cipherer of the same was to lose his right hand all evil prayers namely for the queens death were made treason the gospellers guessed readily that this shaft was aimed at mr rose who was wont to pray before his sermon lord turn the heart of queen mary from idolatry or if not so then shorten her days the council now released the three sons of the duke of northumberland who were yet in the tower lord ambrose now earl of warwick lord henry and lord robert dudley with several others who had been concerned in wyatts rebellion dr thorpe said bitterly that they lacked room for the gospellers the duchess of northumberland mother of these gentlemen died a few days before their deliverance her imprisoned sons came forth for her burial and before they broke up parliament received the cardinals blessing only one of eight hundred speaking against it this was sir ralph bagenall as mr underhill told his friends isoult asked him what sort of man he was and if he were a true gospeller gospeller no not he cried mr underhill verily i know not what religion he professeth but this know i that he beareth about in his heart and conversation never a spark of any he and i were well acquaint once in my blind days ere i fell to reading the scriptures and following the preachers i have sat many a night at the dice with him and miles partridge and busking palmer mr underhill exclaimed isoult knew you sir thomas palmer knew him said he yea on my word did i and have lost many a broad shilling to him and many a gold noble to boot ay he pursued for him very sadly there were a parcel of losels profligates of us that swallowed down iniquity like water in that old time and now partridge is dead and palmer is dead and bagenall is yet as he was then and wherefore god should have touched the heart of one of the worst of those sinners named edward underhilland he rose and lifted his cap from his head as he looked on highlord thou hast mercy on whom thou wilt have mercy isoult thought she had never heard mr underhill speak so solemnly before when dr thorpe came from the barbers on the th of february he looked very thoughtful and pensive what news abroad doctor inquired isoult the first drop of the thundershower child he answered this morrow mr prebendary rogers was burned in smithfield gramercy cried john i saw flame shoot up beyond the gate and i thought there was some fire near newgate i never thought of that fire in the evening came austin who had been last with the martyr isoult asked him if he suffered much i would say no replied he he died very quietly washing his hands in the flame as it rose his wife and his eleven childre one born sithence he was put in prison met him in his last journey god help them poor souls cried isoult when sheriff woodroofe said he was an heretic pursued he he said that shall be known at the day of judgment then said he i will never pray for thee but i will pray for you he answered he sang miserere by the way and refused the pardon which was offered him is it very fearful austin said isoult to see any burn only not so he answered his face changing when you think of the home whereto they are going and of the glorious welcome which christ the king shall give them and what think you said john shall there be yet more burnings or is this merely to strike terror and shall stand alone i think replied he nor am i alone in my thoughtthat it is the first drop of the thunderstorm isoult was struck by his use of the very words of dr thorpe ill times these remarked mr underhill entering the lamb ten days later ill in very sooth said dr thorpe it shall take us the rest of this month to get over the burning of mr rogers marry is that all you know said mr underhill standing and looking round you live a marvellous quiet life thank god for it what mean you cried mrs rose springing to her feet sit down mrs rose sit down said he gently i am sorry i frighted youthere was no need but is it possible you know not all that mr lawrence saunders of all hallows hath been burned at coventry and bishop hooper at gloucester bishop hooper cried all the voices together ay replied he or so was to be five days gone and this day is bishop ferrar departed toward saint davids where he also shall die they sat silent from very horror at last john said methinks there shall be some stir among the angels at such a time among the devils i should think answered mr underhill there be no particular tidings yet but when austin cometh to london we shall hear all they say moreover mr bradford shall die ere long and for all his turning mr cardmaker the fiends cried dr thorpe if they will rob a man of heaven they might leave him earth friend said john softly they can rob the most of us of earth but they must leave us heaven when the ladies retired isoult asked mrs rose why she was so pale and heavyeyed the tears sprang to her eyes o isoult cried she since the burning of mr rogers i have scarcely slept at all and when i do sleep she shuddered and turned away her head hermana mia my sister i see himand the fire she did not mean mr rogers the party gathered on ash wednesday at mr underhills house in wood street where austin bernher was come with news and mr underhill desiring to know all had asked his friends from the lamb to come and hear also yet he dared not ask more than those from one house lest the bloodhounds should get scent of it and mischief should ensue so austin told all the horrible story for a horrible story it was he was not at mr saunders burning but he had seen some one who told him particulars of it to the bishop of london who degraded him saunders said i thank god i am none of your church and when he came to the stake he embraced and kissed it saying welcome the cross of christ welcome everlasting life and so being fastened to the stake and fire put to him full sweetly he slept in the lord foxe acts and monuments pratts townshends edition six but austin himself was at gloucester where bishop hooper suffered his passion a passion indeed said he for i think never man was burned that had more pains of death afore he went into the fire the gentle bishop lift up his hands and said lord i am hell but thou art heaven and strengthen me of thy goodness that in the fire i break not the rules of patience or else assuage the terror of the pains as shall seem most to thy glory and god did strengthen him for he was patience herself though the wood laid to him was all green and the wind blew the fire away from him so that he was long dying and had an hard death it was a lowering cold morning and the fire first kindled went out having only touched his lower half you have seen him and know how high of stature he was but he said only in a mild voice o jesus son of david have mercy upon me and receive my soul then they fetched fresh faggots but that fire was spent also he did but say softly for gods love good people let me have more fire this was the worst his agony could wring from him the third fire kindled was more extreme and reached at last the barrels of gunpowder then when he saw the flame shoot up toward them he cried lord jesus have mercy upon me lord jesus receive my spirit and so bowing forward his head he died at last as quietly as a child in his bed note o austin how frightful cried isoult and though she said no more she wondered secretly if that would ever be the case with her on his way to the stake resumed austin they essayed to make him turn saith sir anthony kingston unto him life is sweet and death bitter truth friend quoth the bishop yet is the death to come more bitter and the life to come more sweet he hath found it so ere now said john softly but have you pursued austin heard of dr taylors burning not of the inwards thereof answered mr underhill only of the act well said austin when bishop bonner came to degrade him quoth the bishop i wish you would remember yourself and turn to your mother holy church then said dr taylor i wish you and your fellows would turn to christ as for me i will not turn to antichrist and at the first when he come afore my lord keeper bishop gardiner quoth heart thou come thou villain how darest thou look me in the face for shame knowest thou not who i am with a great and big voice then said dr taylor yes i know who you are ye are dr stephen gardiner bishop of winchester and lord chancellor and yet but a mortal man i trow but if i should be afraid of your lordly looks why fear you not god the lord of us all how dare ye for shame look any christian man in the face seeing ye have forsaken the truth denied our saviour christ and his word and done contrary to your own oath and writing with more to the same end my word ont saith dr thorpe but yonder is a jolly hearing i am right glad my lord chancellor got so well swinged suffered dr taylor much austin asked isoult i trow not answered he when he came nigh hadleigh the sheriff asked him how he did quoth he well god be praised good master sheriff never better for now i know i am almost at home i lack not past two stiles to go over and i am even at my fathers house he was a very tall and great man with long snowwhite beard and head and he stood in the fire with his hands folded and never moved nor spake till one struck him on the head with a halberd i know not whether it were in malice or in compassion and he fell down dead into the midst of the fire well said dr thorpe i will tell you a thing i would my gossips had named me any thing but stephen there was a stephen the first martyr suggested austin comfort you with that remembrance verily answered he yet i love not to be called the name which satan hath chose for himself on his incarnation one thing strange to human reason is worthy of note as showing the good hand of our god upon those who suffered for him in the case of the majority of these martyrs those who had the fear of physical suffering had not the suffering ridley and hooper bore themselves bravely and knew no terror and they endured awful anguish at the last but archbishop cranmer who at first held back for fear uttered no cry in the fire latimer who did not hold back yet trembled at what he had to pass through died to all appearance without pain most marvellous of all was the case of lawrence saunders the gentle rector of all hallows a man of delicate feeling who shrank from the bitter cup yet drank it off bravely for christs sake and christ failed him not but carried him in his own arms over the dark river for no sooner was he chained to the stake than a deep sleep from god fell upon him and he never woke to feel the fire at all but slept sweetly as a child while his body was consuming is any thing too hard for the lord when isoult and thekla came in from the market one morning in march dr thorpe who sat in the chimneycorner asked them to go up to mrs rose yon dolt carter hath been hither said he and sat with her half an hour and from what i heard since over mine head i am afeard he gave her to wit some ill news for she hath been sobbing ever since his departing go you and comfort her thekla was up the stairs in a moment and isoult followed mr carter a fictitious person was the clergyman who had stepped into mr roses place of minister to the gospellers gatherings when they dared to hold them a good man but very cold and harsh o thekla isoult cried mrs rose when they came in am i so very wicked as mr carter saith me to be poor soul she had been weeping bitterly mother cried thekla in amazement what meanest thou if you be very wicked dear marguerite said isoult you have hidden it from me hitherto but what saith mr carter he saith that i love my husband too much and it is idolatry which god will punish and ay de mi i ought not to grieve for him but rather rejoice that he is called unto the high honour of martyrdom mamie cest impossible and he saith that by such sinful and extravagant grieving i shall call down on me and on him also the great displeasure of god he saith god alway taketh away idols and will not suffer idolatry in his people it is an abominable sin which he hateth and we ought to pray to be kept from loving overmuch ca peutil etre ma soeur que digas nina what sayest thou child isoult looked at thekla in dismay for this was a new doctrine to her and a very unpleasant one theklas lip trembled and her eyes flashed but she did not speak so isoult answered herself for poor mrs roses wailings in french and spanish showed that she was sorely troubled well dear marguerite said she if it be thus i fear i am to the full as guilty as thou i never prayed in all my life to be kept from loving jack or my childre overmuch i thought in mine ignorance that i was bound to love them as much as ever i could doth not scripture tell us to love our neighbour as ourself ay answered mrs rose sobbing again and so i said to mr carter but he answered that i loved him more than myself because i did say i would rather to have died than he and that was wicked and idolatry thekla knelt down and passed her arm round her mother drawing her to herself till mrs roses head lay upon her bosom mother she said whatsoever mr carter or any other shall say i dare say that this is not gods gospel there is an whole book of scripture written to bid us love but i never yet fell in with any to bid us hate nay mother dear the wrong is not assuredly that we love each other too much but only that we love god too little thekla thou art gods best gift to me said mrs rose drying her eyes and kissing her it made me so miserable mi querida my darlingliterally my soughtfor one to think that god should be displeased with him because i loved him too much i wish mr carter would keep away answered thekla her eyes flashing anew if he hath no better gospel than this to preach to gods tried servants he might as well tarry at home but hija mia my daughter thou knowest gods word so welltell me an other if there be to say whether it is wrong to grieve and sorrow when one is troubled i do not think god meaneth to bid us do what we cannot do and i cannot help it methinks dear mother said thekla more quietly that mr carter readeth his bible upside down he seemeth to read saint paul to say that no chastening for the present is grievous but joyous an unmortified will is one thing an unfeeling heart an other god loveth us not to try to shake off his rod like a wayward and froward child but he forbiddeth us not to moan thereunder when the pain wringeth it from us and it may be the moan soundeth unto other at times that which it is not he knoweth he shall not put our tears into the wrong bottle nor set down the sum of our groans in the wrong column of his book hezekiah should scantly be told i have seen thy tears if he did very evil in shedding them nor moses twice over i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people and am come down to deliver them if they had sinned in being afflicted when god wipeth away all tears from our eyes shall he do it as some do with childreroughly shaking the child and bidding it have done despise not thou the chastening of the lord cometh before faint not when thou art rebuked of him of a truth i never could abide to see any so use a child said isoult innocently but thekla sweet heart it should as little serve to run unto the further extremity and give all that a babe should cry for were that love at all said thekla unless it were the mothers love for herself and her own ease isoult saw that mrs rose seemed comforted and thekla was well able to comfort so she gently withdrew but when she came downstairs john having now returned she asked him and dr thorpe to tell her their opinions my thought is replied dr thorpe that the fellow knoweth not his business he must have cold blood in his veins as a worm hath i might search the decalogue a great while ere i came to his two commandmentsthou shalt not sorrow and thou shalt not love thy neighbour any better than thyself i have little patience with such doctrines and scantly with such men said john they would make the heart of the righteous sad whom god hath not made sad they show our loving and merciful father as an harsh stern ruler an austere man meting out to his servants no more joy nor comfort than he can help for joy that is put on is not joy if it arise not of itself tis not worth having paul saith as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing but that joy showeth not alway in the face and father carter hath forgot the first half i do believe as i have said to thee dear heart ere now that god taketh more pleasure to see his people joyful than sorrowful but he never taketh pleasure sure am i to see them make up an hypocrites face and fall to dancing when their hearts are like to break why sweeting thou lovest rather to see frank happy than woeful but dost thou therefore desire her to smother her tears and force a smile rather than come and lodge her little troubles with thee nay rather do i believe that to do such were to insult god i could tell thee of that i have seen where i do verily believe that pride and naught elsethat abominable sin that god hatethkept his afflicted child up and smirking with a false smile over the breaking heart and no sooner was that selfrighteous pride subdued and the child brake forth into open sobbingcrying father thy rod doth hurt and i have been a foolno sooner i say was this confession made than god threw away his rod and took his humbled child to his heart dear heart when god taketh his rod in hand he meaneth us to feel it methinks a man that can speak to one in such trouble as mrs rose as father carter hath spoken hath not himself known neither much love neither much sorrow neither much of god bishop ferrar was burnt in wales on the th of march soon after this the queen declared her intention of restoring all the suppressed lands to the church nor was she content with that but plainly intimated that she desired her nobles to follow where she had paved the way the old earl of bedford had but lately diedhe who said that he held his sweet abbey of woburn worth more than all the fatherly counsels that could come from rome but comparatively few of the lords followed her majesty in this matter on the th of april the queen took her chamber at hampton court the papists made great rejoicing over the young master for whom they hoped but the gospellers were very sorrowful seeing that he would take precedence of the lady elizabeth in whom after god was all their hope and also that he would unquestionably be brought up a papist during the last evening in april came news that a prince was born and through all london there were ringing of bells and bonfires but the next day came contrary tidings god had written next upon the crown of england the name of queen elizabeth and no power less than his own could change that label early in may isoult went alone to market which was not her custom and coming back along cornhill she suddenly heard a voice sayis it not mrs barry wondering who could thus recognise her who was not also aware of her marriage she looked up into the face of a handsome courtly gentleman splendidly apparelled sir said she i pray you of your pardon i am isoult barry but i am not so fortunate as to know your name do you not so replied he and he smiled and when he smiled isoult thought she knew him is it mr james basset said she truly so answered he and i am very glad of thus meeting you i cry you mercy for wrongly naming you but in very deed i have forgot your present name dwell you hereabout isoult told him her name and that she lived near london yet not in the city but she did not give her exact address i trust we may be better acquainted said he and that i may find in you as i cast no doubt a woman faithful unto god and the queens grace the terrible peril in which she stood stared her all at once in the face james basset was a gentleman of the chamber and a stout papist sir said she i would be right sorry to be less of that i am well assured replied he saw you of late my sister isoult answered that she had not seen philippa lately and he bowing low bade our lady keep her and departed isoult came home trembling like an aspen leaf she knew well that did his faith come into question ties of friendship would have little weight with james basset the next morning brought philippa basset well said she isoult so thou fellest in with my brother james yesterday i did so answered isoult rather shortly he told me so much pursued she and said he had forgot to ask where thou dwelledst so i told him isoult drew her breath hard i know not whether to thank you for that mrs basset observed john philippa began to laugh do you take me for a fool both of you said she or for worsea traitor if i be a catholic yet am i a woman not a stone i told him you dwelt on the thither side of lambeth you have nought to fear from me if all the gospellers in the world were wrapped up in thy single person isoult none should ever lay hand on an hair of thine head by means of philippa basset yea though mine own life were the forfeittis not worth much to any now i thank thee dearly for thy love sweet philippa said isoult but i hardly know how to thank thee for lying twere a venial sin i am assured said she lightly why dear heart james would burn thee in smithfield as soon as eat his dinner about a fortnight passed uneventfullya rare occurrence in the year but as it was growing dusk on the st of may there was a quick rap at the door and mr underhill hastily entered coming from the light i may scantly see who is here said he but i wish to speak quickly with mrs rosemrs thekla i mean mrs rose and isoult were sitting in the little chamber the latter rose to call thekla what for thekla asked her mother earnestly can you not tell me mr underhill is there some evil news for me i knew not you were here till i heard you speak mrs rose he answered in the gentle manner in which he always spoke to her well i suppose you may as well know it first as last your husband is ordered to norwich for examination and shall set forth this even he shall pass the postern in half an hour and i came to tell mrs thekla if she desired to speak with him she should come at once with me thekla ran upstairs to fetch her hood to norwich cried poor mrs rose what for to norwich i know not said mr underhill is he norfolkborn he was born at exmouth she answered is exmouth in norfolk nay surely said isoult tis in devon as i well know then what for norwich she said again but mr underhill you take theklaand you take not me i cannot mrs rose said he your peril what care i for my peril she cried passionately doth he belong to them or doth he belong only to thekla let me go mr underhill he is mineminemine mi alma mi bien my soul my own i will go if it be the last sight of him who shall let me marry i would if i could said mr underhill under his voice mrs avery what am i to do and he looked helplessly at isoult leave me to speak to her mr underhill she answered dear sister marguerite remember mr rose is not yet condemned and there is the shadow of hope that he may not be so but if they can prove him to have been in your company that hope will perish will you go knowing that mrs rose had knelt down by the table and buried her head in her hands upon it she gave no answer save a low deep moan of unutterable anguish seigneur pour combien de temps regarderastu cela go mr underhill said isoult softly if i know her she will not follow mr underhill hurried thekla away it was an hour before they came back mrs rose had gone upstairs and isoult sat alone in the chimneycorner she heard the latch lifted and mr underhills voice bidding thekla goodnight he was not returning with her then her soft step came forward she paused as soon as she entered the chamber who is here she said under her breath it is i thekla answered isoult thy mother is above dear heart i am alone i am glad of that and she came forward to the hearth where suddenly she flung herself down on her knees and buried her face in isoults lap i cannot see her just now she said in a choked voice i must be over mine own agony ere i can bear hers o mrs avery he is so white and worn and aged i hardly knew him till he smiled on me and laying down her head again she broke forth into sobbingsuch a very passion of woe as isoult had never heard before from the lips of thekla rose then in a little whilefor she did not check her only smoothed down her hair lovinglythekla lifted her head again and her first gushing of pain seemed over the sheriff was good to me she whispered mr underhill said would it please you of your gentleness to stay your prisoner five minutes here is his daughter that would speak with him and he stayed and gave us leave to speakmore than five minutes she dried her eyes and smoothed back her hair now she said i can go to her god go with you my poor child answered isoult thekla paused a moment before she set her foot on the stairs i feel she said as if i wanted him very near tonight on thursday the th of may cardmaker and warne were burned in smithfield and on the th of june in the same place died john bradford saying he should have a merry supper with the lord that night four days afterwards came austin bernher how do you all asked he marry i shall do better when i know whence you come said poor mrs rose lifting her heavy eyes then i come from norwich saith he and i hope with good news mr rose hath been examined twice afore the bishop the last day of this last month and the seventh of this but is not yet sentenced he is kept in the green yard next the cathedral and the charge against him is that he hath held and defended in public that in the eucharist or sacrament of the altar the true natural and real body of christ and the true natural and real blood of christ under the espece of bread and wine be not in verity but that after consecration the substance of bread and wine remaineth and that whoso shall adore that substance shall commit idolatry and shall give divine honour unto a creature of god and then he was asked but one question whether you will be obedient to the laws of the catholic church whereof the church of england is a member this was in the indictment but the bishop talked with him no little and saith unto him you have preached quoth he that the presence of christ is not in the sacrament what say you to that verily i say mr rose answered that you are a bloody man and seek to quench your thirst in the blood of an innocent i have so preached saith he yea and i will so preach again gramercy cried isoult ay he was bold enough said austin well after examination afore i set forth come to me my old lord of sussex and that gentle knight sir william woodhouse who told me they meant to see mr rose and to do whatsoever they might in his behalf and a word in your ear the queen is very very grievous sick my lord of sussex and other likewise have told me that the bishops dare not sentence more heretics they think mr rose shall have a lighter sentence than deathimprisonment it may be but until they see how the queen shall fare they be sore afraid they were not afeard to burn mr bradford suggested isoult truth he answered but he you see was already sentenced mrs avery there is one thing i must needs tell you and i pray you let me get the same out ere mrs thekla come in i am sore diseased touching mr tremayne for robin she cried austin have they sentenced him i know not what they have done unto him saith he and that is the very truth he is no longer in the marshalsea they have carried him thence some whither and i which am alway rambling up and down the realm have not yet discovered whither trust me you shall know as soon as i early in the morning six days afterwards before all were down and isoult herself had but just descended the stairs there came a hasty rap and in ran austin where is mrs rose said he i have good news for her o austin is mr rose sentenced said isoult when she had called mrs rose ay he answered but to no worse than imprisonment in his lodging it is as i told youthe bishops dare not act and sir william woodhouse being present maketh offer under the bishops leave to keep mr rose in his house seeing he had no lodging in norwich whereto the bishop assents but that he should come up when called for sir william therefore taketh him away and at the very next day sendeth him thence i cannot tell you where sir william will tell none only this i know he is to be passed secretly from hand to hand until means be had to convey him over seas and now my lord of norwich is come to london and shall not be back for nigh a month in which time mr rose may win far enough ere he be biddenwhy mrs rose is it matter for weeping i think it is for weeping austin but not for sorrow said isoult one word augustine said mrs rose drying her eyes whither shall they take him over seas in your ear then said he to calais to mr stevens whence he shall be passed again through france until he reach geneva then i go thither answered she softly mrs rose said austin doubtfully you must not methinks stir out of the realm a great mischief might ensue they should guess presently that whither you went would he go but what can i do she said plaintively wait on the lord softly answered isoult july brought a little respite to the horrible slaughter in the beginning of august came austin and with him mr underhill there is somewhat merry news from norwich cried mr underhill my lord the bishop returned thither summons rose afore his saintly presence who is no whither to be found whereupon my lord sendeth for a wizard and in his holiness biddeth him consult with the infernal powers touching the whereabout of the prisoner who answereth that rose is gone over the water and is in keeping of a woman wherein he spake sooth though maybe he knew it not for rose at that very minute lay hidden in the mean cottage of a certain godly woman and had to ford more rivers than one to win thither so my lord the bishop when he gets his answer of the devil flieth at the conclusion that rose is gone over seas and is safe in germany and giveth up all looking for him wherefore for once in our lives we may thank the devil nay good ned said jack we will thank the living god this phrase was another symbolum hereticorum that did overrule both the bishop and the devil and what of robin said isoult mrs avery i am puzzled and bewildered as i never was before replied austin i cannot find him a week later when the dusk had fallen but john had not yet come home and dr thorpe and isoult sat alone in the chamber a quick footstep approached the door what he is the door locked cried mr underhills voice outside barbara ran and let him in where is mrs rose was his first question above said isoult is there news for her good said he without replying and mrs thekla above likewise let her stay there a moment but tell her whenas you can without her mothers ears that her father is in london again in the keeping of speryn my wifes brother and there she may see him tell her to come to my house and i or my wife shall go with her to the other but she must not tarry in coming for we hope to have him away to calais on tuesday night and away he went mrs rose was not told a word but thekla saw her father before he left england then he was passed secretly across the channel and on rysbank mr stevens met him and took him to his house the next day he was sent away to boulogne and so on to paris always in the keeping of huguenots and thence to lyons and so to switzerland on the th of august the king set out for spain the queen going with him as far as greenwich where she remained and the princess elizabeth with her the respite from the slaughter was short and it was only the enemys breathingtime for a more terrible onslaught the next entry in isoults diary ran thus by austin bernher woeful news is come my lord archbishop that stood so firm for gods truththat was already doomed for his faithfulness that all we have so loved and honoured and mournedthomas cranmer archbishop of canterbury is fallen away from christ and hath recanted and rejected the truth by which he stood so firm i knew never any thing that so cut me to the heart after this sort sithence sir will smiths recanting at calais surely surely christ will rescue this his sheep from the jaws of the wolf whereinto he is fallen of them whom the father hath given him can he lose this one mr underhill came in on the th of october strangely sad and pensive for him have you the news this even said he what news inquired john is it death or life it is martyrdom he answered solemnly is that death or life his manner fairly frightened isoult she was afraid lest he should have come to give them dreadful tidings of robin or it might be that mr rose had been recaptured on his journey through france o mr underhill she cried tremblingly pray you the name of the martyr it was neither mr roses nor robins but no name short of those two would have thrilled to her heart straighter than the other two he gave he said nicholas ridley and hugh latimer note if the reader think this narrative horrible let him know that all the worst details have been omitted they are written in gods book in letters of fire and shall not be forgotten in the day when he maketh up his jewels chapter eleven hope deferred ah would we but only leave all things to our father would we only cease to grieve wait his mercy rather meek resigning childish choice graceless thankless pressing listen for his gentle voice child receive this blessing faithless foolish hearts see you seeds earthhidden growing what our god for us will do he himself is knowing it was on the th of november that annis holland came home from spain queen juana was dead and she had no longer any tie to a country in which she had certainly not been happy please it you mistress said ursulas voice at the chamber door where isoult sat sewing well ursula replied her mistress mistress holland would have speech of you mistress said she of course isoult supposed her visitor to be roger hollands wife and thanked god in her heart that she was better off than bessy but she came down into the chambernot to see bessy on another face her eyes lighted and a cry of gladness broke from her what annis when the first welcomings were over and they sat down again isoult thought she saw a grave sad look on annis face that was not wont to be there i trusted to have seen thee home ere this dear annis she said for we heard that the queen thy mistress was dead and i thought thou wouldst not be like to tarry yonder ay she said sadly she is gone to god and laud be to him for it no isoult i had no mind to abide there she shuddered as with very horror so that isoult answeredmethinks sweet heart thy lord marquis of denia could be no worser than bishop gardiner there be eviller things in spain than even he is said she and shook her head and where wilt thou go annis asked isoult for my ladys grace of suffolk is out of this kingdom i would have loved dearly to have thee hither till thou mightest fit thyself with a service but verily all my chambers be full filled and i would not lodge thee in the nursery where be already esther and the childre except for a short space a little smile played about the lips of annis isoult she said after all i have said and writ touching spain and in good sooth may yet say and write i fear thou shalt think me a marvellous contrarious maid if i own to thee that i am about to wed a spanish gentleman well answered her friend that hangeth upon the spanish gentlemans particular truth replied she and if i did not verily believe the grace of god to be in his heart trust me isoult i would never have him but wilt thou then go back to dwell in spain god forbid cried she heartily i am afeard sweet heart suggested isoult thou shalt find this country little better there be nigh every week burnings some whither o isoult isoult cried she vehemently there may be any thing of horrible and evil but that all were not so much as worthy to be cast into the scale against the inquisition well said she i have not dwelt there as thou hast but i have dwelt here these last three years the which thou hast not but who prithee is thy servant suitor he is not in the kings house trow no nor like to be said annis it is don juan de alameda brothers son to dona isabel of whom i writ to thee thou wrotest marvellous little to me annis said isoult smilingly nay i writ twice in every year as i promised answered she then know thou said isoult that i never had those thy letters saving two which were as i judge the first thou didst write and one other two years gone or more writ on the th day of august i writ thee three beside them answered she i suppose they were lost at sea or maybe they lie in the coffers of the inquisition any way let them be now i thank god i am come safe out of that land where if any whither satan hath his throne then said dr thorpe who had come in while she was speaking he must have two for i am assured there is one set up at westminster nor is he oft away from it annis passed the rest of the day with isoult and don juan came in the evening to escort her to the inn where she was staying i must needs allow don juan a very proper gentleman and right fair in his ways but i would annis husband had been an englishman i feel not to trust any spaniard at all said isoult after annis was gone why said marguerite rose they are like us women some of the good ones may be very good but all the bad ones be very bad indeed austin bernher brought full news of the death of ridley and latimer isoult asked especially if they had great suffering and if they abode firm in the truth to the abiding firm said he yea firm as the mount zion that standeth fast for ever for the suffering it seemed me that my dear master suffered nothing at all but with dr ridley i sorrow to say it it was far otherwise but hearken and you shall wit all the night afore they suffered dr ridley was very pleasant at supper and bade them all that were at the table to his wedding for saith he i must be married tomorrow and though my breakfast be somewhat sharp and painful yet i am sure my supper shall be more pleasant and sweet then saith mr shipside his brother note i will bide with you this night nay answered he not so for i mean to go to bed and sleep as quietly as ever i did in my life the stake was made ready on the north side of the town in the townditch over against balliol college and my lord williams of thame had the ordering thereof as dr ridley passed bocardo he looked up thinking to have seen my lord archbishop at the glasswindow but they had provided against that by busying him in disputation with a spanish friar then dr ridley looking back espied my master coming after oh saith he be you thereyea saith my master have after as fast as i can follow so when they came to the stake dr ridley embraced him saying brother be of good heart for god will either assuage the fury of the flame or else strengthen us to abide it then they knelt and prayed and after talked a little to each other but what they said none heard dr smith robert smith a renegade from lutheranism preached the sermon from though i give my body to be burned and so forth but his discourse lasted but a few minutes and was nought save railing against heretics then dr ridley entreated of my lord williams leave of speech which he would have given but mr vicechancellor and the bailiffs would not suffer it only that they might speak if they would recant dr ridley cried then i will never deny my lord christ and arising from his knees he cried again with a loud voice well then i commit our cause to almighty god who shall indifferently judge all whereto my master added his old posy motto maxim well there is nothing hid but it shall be opened so that after they made them ready and were fastened to the stake and mr shipside brought two bags of gunpowder and tied around their necks then they brought a lighted faggot and laid it at dr ridleys feet then said my master be of good comfort master ridley and play the man we shall this day light such a candle by gods grace in england as i trust shall never be put out when dr ridley saw the fire flaming up towards him he cried with a wondrous loud voice into thy hands o lord i commend my spirit and oft afterwards lord lord receive my spirit my master on the other side did as vehemently cry o father of heaven receive my soul who latimer received the flame as it were embracing it and after he had stroked his face and bathed his hands a little in the fire soon died to the sight of all present having no pain dr ridleys suffering on the contrary side was fearful and only to compare with bishop hooper ask me not to say more touching it but at last the flame reached the gunpowder and after that he was seen to stir no more only to fall down at mr latimers feet i will but say more that hundreds of them which saw the sight shed tears thereover no one spoke when austin ended at last john said softly never to be put out lord grant this word of thy martyr and let that bright lamp lighted unto thee give light for ever three hundred years have run out since that dread october day when the candle was lighted at oxford which should never be put out and put out it has never been satan and all his angels may blow against it but god holds it in the hollow of his hand and there it is safe yet there is a word of warning as well as a word of hope to the church at ephesus saith our lord i know thy worksyea and thy labouryea and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars and hast borne and hast patience and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not fainted can more than this be said to our church nay can all this be said to her god grant it neverthelessneverthelessi have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love o lord how tenderly thou dealest not left thy love it was not so bad as that yet see how he notes the leaving of the first love a little colder a little deader a little less ready to put on the coat to defile the feet to rise and open to the beloved only a little but how that little grieves his heart who hath never left his first love and what is the end i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent o earth and o england hear the word of the lord art thou yet warm in thy first love has there been no looking back to sodom no longing for the fleshpots of egypt no eyes wandering toward the house of baal god grant that thou mayest not lose thy candle it was wrought of blood and in tears is it a light thing that thou shouldst let it be put out one night in november came in mr underhill and an hour after him mr ferris welcome george said mr underhill any news abroad have you heard none tonight said he not so much as would go by the eye of a needle he answered is there tidings the bishop of winchester is dead mr underhill sprang to his feet with a cry of exultation glory to god in the highest yea i might go furtheron earth peace jack let us sing the te deum not in my house said john quietly thou recreant faintheart what meanest i am ready enough to sing the te deum ned pursued john but not for so terrible a thing as the casting of that poor sinner with the blood of gods saints red upon his soul into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone how can you stay to think of it cried mr underhill in his ringing voice is that blood even now not crying unto god are rogers and bradford are ridley and latimer yet avenged shall not the saints wash their feet in the blood of the ungodly yea let them fall and never rise up again shall we be thus slack to praise god for freedom wait till we are free said john drily and moderate your voice ned underhill added mr ferris if you would be free long mr underhill laid his hands upon johns shoulders look me in the face john avery answered he and tell me what you mean think you this great palace of cruelty and injustice built up by him shall not crumble to dust along with stephen gardiner i doubt it very greatly he replied assuredly not said marguerite rose so long as the king philip is in this country and the bishop of london it might ask dr gardiner to build the palace but i think they shall be able to keep it standing but king philip is not in this country said mr underhill he is master of it said john alas for my te deum then sighed mr underhill shrugging his shoulders but i hope you may yet find you mistaken jack avery not more than i ned said john sadly john avery did not find himself mistaken but it was not long ere mr underhill did so he allowed that his te deum had been too soon when on the th of december archdeacon philpot was burned and the burnings in smithfield were then not half over on the th of january at mr underhills house in wood street by mr carter was christened little anne underhill born on epiphany eve see note in appendix her sponsors were mr ferris helen ive and isoult avery ere this a few days before christmas mr roses first letter had reached his wifes hands it brought the welcome tidings that he had arrived safely at geneva yet through such perils that he would not advise her to follow when isoult had read the letter she remarked i do see mr rose accounteth not himself to be lawfully divorced for he maketh account of her as his wife all through the letter and signeth himself at the end thereof her loving and faithful husband doth that astonish thee said john laughing well of a truth she answered i had thought the worse of him for any other dealing annis holland came again in march to spend a day at the lamb on this occasion she told the rest of her story or it may rather be called the story of queen juana for many months after that first accidental meeting she told them she never again saw her royal mistress but dona leonor gomez who was exceedingly loquacious when she had no fear of consequences and sometimes when she had told her that so long as she was in her right senses nothing would ever induce the queen to attend mass to persuade her to do any thing else they would tell her they acted under command of the king her father who had in reality been dead many years and she loving him dearly and not having sufficient acuteness left to guess the deceit practised upon her would assent readily to all they wished except that one thing even that influence failed to induce her to be present at mass and one day said annis about the christmastide two years gone i was sitting and sewing in my chamber maria being forth and i had been chanting to myself the hymn christe redemptor omnium when i had ended and was silent thinking me alone a voice from the further end of the chamber saith sing again dona ines i looked up in very terror for here was the queens highness herself i marvelled how she should have come forth of her chamber and what my lord of denia should say senora said i i kiss the soles of your feet but allow me to entreat your highness to return to your chamberi will not return till you have sung to me saith she and she sat right down on the floor and clasped her hands around her knees so i had no choice but to sing my hymn over again when i ended she saith what means it dona ines is it somewhat of our lorday senora i made answer it is all touching himi understood the church hymns once she said but that was before the cuerda sing some more then i sang victimae paschali miserere she repeated dreamily as if that word had woke some old echoes in her memory ay de mi child i lack the mercy very sorelyhe knoweth that senora said i gently and his time is the best time and she answered as she had aforetimei would he would come i knew scarce what to answer but i had no time to answer at all ere the door opened which the queen had closed behind her and my dread lord of denia stood before me what is this senora he said to her highness your highness here and turning to me dona ines quoth he explain it if you can i thought the wisest thing should be to speak very truth as well as the right and i told him even how matters stood with me i see he answered you have not been to blame except that you should have called immediately for help and have put her back into her chamber rise senora the queen clasped her hands closer around her knees i am at ease here she said and i want dona ines to sing the marquis took a step nearer her alteza he said i desire your highness to rise you should be ashamedyou a queen she looked up on him with a look i had not seen in her eyes aforetime am i a queen she said if so a queen captive in the enemys hands if i be your queen obey me depart from this chamber when you hear my yo la reyna note begone senor marques leave me in peace senora he answered unmoving i am surprised you are in your own palace where your father detains you and you call it captivity rise at once senora and return to your chamber he spoke sternly and determinedly the captive lioness heard the keepers voice and obeyed my fatheray don fernando she said only and holding out both her hands to him as a child should do he led her away after that i saw her no more for many weary months at times the terrible screams would arouse me from sleep and then i prayed for her that god would strengthen her and ease the torment to her but above all that god would take her i trust it were not sin in me isoult but if thou hadst seen her as i saw her well i saw her no more until this last april then there came a night when the shrieks awoke me more terrible than i had ever heard them yet when dona leonor came into my chamber on the morrow which was good friday i asked if she knew the cause she told me ay her highness lay dying and had refused to receive that is to receive the sacrament fray domingo de soto would not suffer her to depart without the host while she yet talked with me entered dona ximena de lara that had never been in my chamber afore and alway seemed to hold her much above me dona ines quoth she my lord of denia commands you to follow me quickly the queen is in a fearful frenzy and sith she hath alway much loved music and divers times hath desired you should be fetched to sing to her my lord marquis would have you try whether that will serve to abate her rage and they gave her the cuerda said i as i followed dona ximena ay for two hours and more saith she but alas to no end she refuseth yet to receive his majesty know thou isoult that these strange folk call the wafer his majestya title that they give at once to god and the king they gave her the premia early last night saith she but it was to no good wherefore it was found needful to repeat the same more severely near dawn her screams must have been heard all over the town a right woeful frenzy followed wherein she being ignorant of what she did they caused her to swallow his majesty whereupon in the space of some few minutes by the power of our lord she calmed but the frenzy is now returned and they think her very near her departing in her highness chamber a screen was drawn afore the bed that i could not see her but her struggles and her cries could too well be heard my lord of denia stood without the screen and i asked what it was his pleasure i should sing he answered what i would but that it should be soft and soothing and methought the hymn for the dead should be the best thing to sing for the dying rex tremendae majestatis qui salvandos salvas gratis salve me fons pietatis i had sung but one verse when her crying ceased and ere i had sung two she saith with a deep sigh ay jesus and lay quiet then when i paused she said is it dona inesspeak to her quoth my lord marquis senora i answered i am your highness servant ines that kisseth your feetcome hither to me the queen said child god hath looked on long in silence but he is come at last my lord of denia made me a sign to pass within the screen there lay she her snowwhite hair scattered over the pillow her ladies standing or kneeling around the bed it is over she said speaking slowly and with pauses i shall suffer no longer i shall go to godsenora quoth my lord marquis i entreat your highness to be silent you have received his majesty and cannot be allowed to soil your soul by evil words when christ is within youye forced me did ye she answered a quick flash of anger breaking the calm of her face ah well god knoweth i did it not god knoweth and god will receive me he witteth what i have been and what ye she lay silent a season and then slowly as if it pained her she drew her hands together and folded them as if she prayed fray domingo began a latin prayer silence saith the queen royally and for this oncethe last timeher gaolers obeyed her she fetched a long weary sigh and laid her hands one over the other on her breast then in low calm quiet tones her last words were spoken father into thine hands i commit my spirit jesus christ the crucified be with me i thank god that my life is over it was over only a few minutes later and i think he was with her through the valley of the shadow of death note isoult said annis as she ended her woeful story thinkest thou this were martyrdomthis daily dying for six and twenty years was it any less borne for our lords love than any of his martyrs they that are burned or beheaded they do but suffer once and then no more it must be easier methinks than to die piecemeal as she did and she knew so little isoult dost thou think christ will count her in the number of his martyrs it soundeth very like annis she answered i do not fancy said john that the lord is so ill off for martyrs crowns that he will have none to spare for her well responded dr thorpe it should be no great wonder if they were used up seeing how many must have been fetched within the last two years i could believe any thing of don carlos answered marguerite rose he that so ill used his aunt that had been a mother unto him the lady marguerite of savoy that was governess of flandershe should not have much love for his own mother and thekla saidi think the crown of the queen dona juana must have been a very bright one it is so hard to watch and wait my poor thekla murmured isoult thou hast had much thereof i she answered with a smile i have done nothing i have not been forsaken and ill dealt withal as she was of my best beloved throughout many years compare me not with her if i may sit down some whither in heaven where i can but see her on the heights that would be too good for me but art thou willing to see christ only on the heights thekla said john no she said again with her sweet smile i should want to be close to him no i could not be content to look on him afar off in that case said john there is no fear that he shall ask it of thee no there is no fear of his keeping us afar off it is we who follow afar off father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me with our dear master it is never go and do this hard thing go and suffer this heavy sorrow go and bear this weary waiting it is always come and do it or at least let us go and now there came another martyrdom the highest and in some sense the sorest of them all yet by many not the last there was room for many souls under the altar ay and on the throne on the nd of march with great pomp and splendour the lord raynald pole cardinal legate was consecrated archbishop of canterbury it was therefore apparent that dr cranmer had been degraded isoult said so to mr underhill whom she met at the service at mr ferris lodging and his answer troubled her no little nay mrs avery he replied tis a sign that my lord archbishop is dead for i do know by letter from bernher which is now at oxford that yesterday was appointed for his burning and they had never heard one word after his recantation dead without recanting it dead denying christ at his end after confessing him in his life this was worse than many martyrdoms for it was martyrdom of the soul was there no hope must this death be the second death they knew that in the last hour ay even in the last minute he might have repented unto life and have again caught hold of christ but should they who had prayed so fervently for the lost brother have no word to say sono this thy brother is alive again must they never know whether to look for him on the right or the left hand of the king till they should see him there in the last day i told you too true mrs avery my lord archbishop is dead these were the first words which isoult heard when she came down the stairs on the following morning but how died he mr underhill she cried anxiously gloriously like a martyr and a prince of gods church as he was publicly repenting the recantation whereto he had set his hand from fear and confessing christ nobly before men till at last they would not hear a word furtherthey haled and hurried him to the stake thank god her voice failed her she could say no more it was a foul and rainy day he went on so austin told me my lord archbishop was led from bocardo to saint mary church betwixt two friars that mumbled certain psalms and at the church door they began the nunc dimittis my lord was illfavouredly clad in a bare and ragged gown and an old square cap dr cole preached and more than twenty times during the sermon the archbishop was seen to have the water in his eyes then they did desire him to get up into the pulpit and openly to retract his preaching and show all the people that he was become a true catholic and did he that fair and softly go far in a day have a little patience i pray you well he spake a long season first against the world item unto obedience item to brotherly love item against moneylove and lastly he said over the creed and now quoth he i come to the great thing which so much troubleth my conscience he said his hand had offended against god in signing his recantation and when he should come to the fire it should be first burned and so he spake bravely renouncing the pope as antichrist and christs enemy and his and that he utterly abhorred all his false doctrine and touching the sacrament the doctrine which saith he i have taught in my book is true and will stand at the last day before the judgment of god when the papistical doctrine contrary thereto shall be ashamed to show her head well like paul they gave him audience unto this word and then cried out away with such a fellow from the earth they cried that he was false and dissembled ah my masters quoth our good archbishop do you take it so always since i lived hitherto i have been a hater of falsehood and a lover of simplicity and never before this time have i dissembled the water stood in his eyes and he would have spoken more against the pope and the mass but cole crieth out stop the heretics mouth take him away then the friars set upon him and pulled him down out of the pulpit and so hurried him away to the place where five months before him dr ridley had died then there he knelt and prayed and made him ready and stood on the stones robed in his long white shirt barefoot and his head whenas his cap were off without one hair thereon though his beard was long and thick then he giving the hand to such as he knew about the stake they bound the chain around him and lit the fire and until it was full burned he held forth his right hand in the fire crying ever and anon this unworthy right hand at last he saith lord jesus receive my spirit and so he yielded it up to him but afterward when his ashes were cold amid the charred faggots his heart was found entire so passed that great heart away from us that perchance we knew not fully how to prize beshrew my weak eyes i am but a fool yet tis hard to think that we shall see his reverend countenance no more and mr underhill dashed away the tears from his eyes much like philippa basset isoult never had seen him thus affected before but on their knees in their chambers the gospellers thanked god from their hearts that day for this pouring forth of his spirit upon the dry ground for his glory thus exalted in the awakening of that dear brother from sleep which seemed as though it might be death for his strength so gloriously shown forth in mortal weakness that warmed and quickened the last beatings of the noble heart of archbishop cranmer jack said isoult that night to her husband i would i had asked mr underhill if austin had yet heard anything of robin ah said he thou art not used to answer so short she replied hast thou heard any thing jack i have heardnothingcertain he answered hesitatingly jack what hast thou heard she cried in terror with any surety dear heart nothing whatever he said lovingly only that austin hath spoken to me touching him and therefore i could not say i had heard nothing and at most tis only a guess i cry thee mercy not to have told thee but seeing how unsure it were i thought it more kindlier not to trouble thee well sweeting what austin said was this he hath made all search in every prison he hath visited and spake unto divers prisoners but no word of the dear lad may he have and he is afeard isoultit is but a guess thou wistthat all is over already before he had half finished his meaning struck on her heart like a passing bell all over she knew what that meant o my god wilt thou not give us one word that we may know this watching and waiting is so hard to bear i desire to be to do to suffer thy will but father it is very weary work to wait if it be possible send us some word of our lost darling make no long tarrying o my god it was not to john and not aloud that this was spoken it is not only children who are afraid of the dark we all love to walk by sight we are rarely content to see only the next step we must take yet it is all we need see and often all that god will show us the darkness and the light are both alike to him and if only we would let him see for us we should act the part of wise children it is easy when the light comes to cry out at our past foolishness in being afraid of the dark we never think so while the darkness is upon us a few days later came philippa basset full of court news which she had from her brother james yesterday said she came a letter or messenger from king philip denying his present return hither whereupon the queen fell into so great a chafe that she commanded his picture borne out of the privy chamber thus far my brother but jack throgmorton saith that she fetched a knife and scored the picture twice or thrice all the way down and then kicked it out of the chamber throgmorton denied having said this when a judicial inquiry was held saint mary worshipped might she be said i to james is her grace a woman like to do that nay saith he not half so like as thou shouldst be in her place whereat philippa laughed merrily isoult was in a mood for any thing rather than laughter it was too near easter for mirth easter which should be the most blessed festival of the year was now turned into an occasion of offence and of mourning to the servants of god in the evening all from the lamb were at mr underhills farewell supper at his house in wood street whence he purposed to set out for coventry the next day as soon as the gates were opened he said he would not remain another easter in london the last day of june came a letter to john avery from mr underhill saying that they had all arrived safely at coventry and he had taken a house a mile out of the city in a wood side where he trusted to keep quiet until the tyranny were overpast the darkness was growing thicker in that month of june began the procession in every church at which the bishop commanded the attendance of every child in london bearing books or beads in hand and of one adult from each house to take charge of them ours are not like to go said isoult tenderly but tis harder work to set them in peril than to go therein ones self sir john gage died on the th of april an old man full of years it was he who had been on the commission to calais and had brought isoult to england after lord lisles arrest and he had also endeavoured to have mr underhill sent to newgate the search against lutheran books was now very strict and laughable enough in less sorrowful circumstances among these lutheran books the most strictly forbidden were my lord chancellors book de vera obedientia and one written by the queen herself when a girl under the auspices of katherine parra translation of a work of erasmus another letter came from mr rose in july bringing good news of his welfare and in august annis holland was married to don juan de alameda writing on the st of august in her diary isoult said not one word more touching robin there be times when i feel as though i could bear it no longer though what i could do to end it soothly i cannot tell i conceive well what david signified when he saith he did roar through the very disquietness of his heart i dare not tell this to marguerite for she is too nearly of the same complexion to give me any comfort and to say a word to esther is no good for she silenceth me at once with some passage of holy writ as shall not the judge of all the earth do right and what can i say to that but amen jack is always loving and tender but he can i well perceive see little comfort herein himself and to do so much as name the thing to thekla were wanton cruelty though i do fancy she should be the best comforter so i must wait on and cry unto god it may be that is the very thing he would have of me bad news came by austin early in the death of the earl of sussex note mr roses chief friend in high places poor marguerite was much downcast saying they had now lost their best friend no mother dear answered thekla not our best friend he is in an higher place and he dieth no more another easter came and passed and king philip returned to england every now and then austin visited the lamb but he brought no news of robin isoult thought she had never realised how dearly she loved the lad till now it was hard to thank god for such a blank in the home as this and yet deep in the inmost heart she knew as every christian knows that the father was doing all things well and that there was no must be without a needs be to wait on the lord is no easy task to flesh and blood but there is one thing yet harder and that is to rest in the lord while waiting and meanwhile thekla drooped and faded day by day she never spoke now of robin but it was easy to see that she had not forgotten him slower and more languid grew her step and her face whiter and graver with an expression of sorrowful patience which did not quit its hold upon the lips even when they smiled she is worn to a shadow said marguerite bitterly why cannot we go home to god what profit is it to him that we do suffer and isoult was silent but she remembered robins words about believers in the dark on the th of june which was whit monday there was a passion play at court isoult coming in from a call upon her neighbour mrs brent observed in a rather disgusted tone gillian brent must needs go to see this mystery for me i might as easily or as willingly go to see a martyrdom she saith tis right sweet and devotional and maketh her to feel so good she cannot tell how much tis a sort of goodness i covet not it were like murdering the son of god over again to see his blessed name taken upon himself of a sinful man and his bitter passion set forth to divert men gillian saith none will see the thing as i do but that cannot i help perchance he may when he looketh down upon it at her house at chelsea on the th of july died anna of cleve one of the two widows of henry the eighth she came to england a lutheran and died a papist king philip went to flanders on the th of july on the th of august came news of the great victory of saint quentin which the king had won there and the next day there were great thanksgivings and rejoicings over all the city and on the th of october died mary countess of arundel at arundel house she was cousin of philippa basset and when she was countess of sussex isoult had lived for some time in her house with anne basset a fortnight previous london was requested to rejoice again for peace was concluded with the pope verily said dr thorpe this is a marvellous thing to bid us rejoice and to give us cause for mourning marry responded mr ferris for me when the war brake forth i sang the te deum under my breath now will i clothe me in sackcloth under my raiment and so shall i have both sorrowed and rejoiced and none can grudge against me the year closed heavily the burnings went on but they were chiefly of poor men and women sometimes but not often of children or girls on the th of december a gospellers meeting was dispersed and many taken by the sheriff but no friends of the averys all this time mr holland with his wife and child were at his fathers house in lancashire and mr underhill with his household at coventry isoults last entry in her diary for this year ran as follows austin came yesterday to tell us my lady of suffolk and mr bertie did quit germany where they had refuged in april last and be now safe in poland at a town called crossen and the kings grace of poland hath set mr bertie over a province of his i am glad to hear this they had nathless many and great troubles in their journey but sith tis all over it is not worth grieving for ah faithless heart and foolish and will not all troubles be so when the last mile of the journey cometh yea may we not find we had most cause to thank god for the roughest parts of the way so saith my sense and judgment yet for all this will mine heart keep crying out and will not be silent o robin robin an other year the gospellers never entered on any year with heavier hearts than on the year the year of all the century the year that was to close so gloriouslyto go out with trumpets and bells and bonfires and te deums and all england in a wild ferment of delight and thanksgiving and how often do we enter on a year of mourning with our hearts singing anthems it is well that it should be so we have abundant cause to thank god that he has hidden the future from us it is enough for us to know that all things work together for good to them that love him to them that are the called according to his purpose but very very mournfully came this year in for it opened with the loss of calais isoult had dwelt there for two years with lady lisle and there were few places nearer to her heart perhaps we can hardly picture to ourselves how nearly that loss touched every english heart it was as if each man in the land had lost a piece of his estate calais belonged to every englishman well my friends in the monastery was the greeting of mr ferris that i promised underhill i would look to by times hath your secluded ear been yet pierced with the tidings this morrowthat be making every man all over london to swear and curse that loveth not his soul better than his anger what now said john nay the courts be not yet opened again so i have bidden at home and i am an old man burdened with an access a fit of the gout said dr thorpe come out with your news what platform note toucheth it every platform in the realm have it herecalais is lost calais they said no more but a vision rose before the eyes of isoultof george bucker in the pulpit of the lady church and lord and lady lisle in the nave below of the market place where his voice had rung out true and clear of the lantern gate whereon his head had been exposed of the gallows near saint pierre whereon he had died his voice came back to her and lord lislesboth which she had heard last in the tower but both which were to her for ever bound up with calais her eyes were swimming and she could not speak and before another word had been uttered by any one the latch was lifted by philippa basset there is not a man left in england she cried calais had never been lost had i been there to fire the culverins no madam said mr ferris who did not know that she was a papist they have all been burned or beheaded upon my word but i am coming to think so cried she shame upon every coward of them were there not enough to fill the first breach with a wall of mens bodies rather than lose the fairest jewel of the crown beshrew the recreants but i had never come away from that breach alive i would have died with calais i am sorry you were not there madam said he for the sake of calais for your own sake tis well i am sorry all over answered she the queen taketh it most heavily of all she said to her ladies that when she should be dead they should find calais graved upon her heart hitherto the storm of persecution had not come inside the little walled circle of friends dear to the hearts of the averys it had raged around them had broken fiercely upon men whom they reverenced and loved as afar off but now it was to come within one whose eyes had looked into theirs whose lips had smiled on them whose voice had bidden god bless themay upon whose knee the children had sat and chattered to him in childish wisewas summoned from the midst of them to go up in the chariot of fire into the presence of the lord austin and mr underhill came together both very pensive on the night of the th of may there is ill news with you i fear said john there is ill news and that right heavy answered mr underhill roger holland is taken where and how they asked with six other in a quiet close near saint johns wood where they were met to read gods word and pray together this last may day and carried afore my lord of london he had better have tarried at his fathers in lancashire whence he was but newly come and bessy said isoult compassionately roger left her and the child in lancashire said he where if she will take mine avisement she will remain mr holland was examined before bishop bonner lord strange being present with others of his lancashire kinsmen austin reported that he confessed christ right nobly and kept up the bishop in a corner by his wise and gentle learningsuch as i had not thought had been in him and at last after much discussion the bishop lost his patience a commodity of which he never carried much to market called mr holland a blasphemous heretic and sentenced him to be burned mr holland replied as the gaoler was about to remove himmy lord i beseech you suffer me to speak two words nay cried he i will not hear thee have him away lord strange interfered and begged that his cousin might be heard speak growled bonner what hast thou to say mr holland answered even now i told you that your authority was from god and by his sufferance and now i tell you god hath heard the prayer of his servants which hath been poured forth with tears for his afflicted saints whom you daily persecute as now you do us but this i dare be bold in god to say by whose spirit i am moved that god will shorten your hand of cruelty that for a time you shall not molest his church and this you shall in a short time well perceive my dear brethren to be most true for after this day in this place there shall not be any by him put to the trial of fire and faggot the bishop replied that he should yet live to burn yea and he would burn for all this prattling and so went his way and mr holland was taken back to newgate but the bishop like many another laid his plans without reference to him who sat above the waterfloods roger holland had an unction from the holy one and his prescience was true the commandment was gone forth from the presence of the kinghitherto shalt thou come and no further after that once by bonner and in smithfield there was never another trial of fire and faggot yet for that once the devil and edmund bonner had their way waiting for roger holland were the white robe and the martyrs palm and with his name the musterroll of soldiers slain in the great battle of england was closed in heaven it is not entirely unedifying to note why this man was martyred so long as he pursued the profligate course on which he had embarked in early youth rome had not a word to say to him sin does not come under her cognisance except to be muffled up in absolution and hidden from the eyes of the sinnerbut not from the eyes of god but the moment that hollands course was altered and he began to try so to walk as to please god that moment he came under the ban of her who dares to stand up in the face of the world and with unblushing effrontery to call herself the church of god very late on the th of june augustine bernher brought the news of the last martyrdom his face told before he spoke that he came to say something terrible the first thoughts of those at the lamb as usual flew to robin and mr rose but austin quickly turned them into a different channel i am come he said from roger hollands martyrdom eh austin is it over with mr holland cried isoult it is over with him and he shall suffer no more pains of death for ever he and the other six taken with him were burned today in smithfield and how went it with him when he was come to the stake answered austin he embraced it and looking up unto heaven he saithlord i most humbly thank thy majesty that thou hast called me from the state of death unto the light of thy heavenly word and now unto the fellowship of thy saints that i may sing and say holy holy holy lord god of hosts and lord into thy hands i commit my spirit lord bless these thy people and save them from idolatry and so looking up unto heaven and praising godgod stooped and took him alas poor bessy said isoult after a while i must write unto her said austin i trust she is yet safe in lancashire isoult did not forget her before god that night it was easy for the mass of the gospellers to think of mr holland as he now was at home in the safe rest of the fathers house and to praise god for him but his bessy was not likely to do so as yet when the night is very dark we cannot always lift our heads to see how fair the light shines on the further side of the jordan and to us who are in the thickness of the darkness it is at times no lighter for that knowledge and the night was very dark now and yet some tell usay some of us englishmen whose fathers passed through these dreadful scenes leaving to their sons such awful memoriesthey tell us it were better to leave those memories sleeping why rake up such disagreeable reminiscences they belong to past ages rome is different now just as society is different is this charity peace forbearance i reply it is charity and of the highest type when a man sees his friend in the grasp of a tiger he does not drop his levelled gun on the plea of charity to the tiger and rome is not different she only looks so because the wisdom of our fathers circumscribed her opportunities just as the tiger looks harmless in a cage in the zoological gardens shall we therefore open the cage door and we who are bent on pulling down as fast as we can those bars which our fathers forged in tears and bloodlet us be a little more consistent let us take away the locks from our doors because for ten years there has been no attempt at burglary in that street let us pull down the hurdles which surround our sheeppens because for some time no lamb has been lost from that particular flock we are not such fools as to do these things mens bodies and still more mens property are safely protected among us but how is it about mens souls how will it be when the rulers of england shall stand at the bar whence there is no appeal and hear from the great judge the awful requirementwhere is thy flock that was given thee thy beautiful flock shall we hear about want of powerwhich generally means want of willabout the voice of the nation and the spirit of the age and respect to the opinions of others and the numberless little fictions with which men wile their souls to sleep here and now will the bishop who swore before god to drive away all erroneous and strange doctrine contrary to his word offer to the judge then those convenient excuses with which he salves over his conscience now will the statesman who followed the multitude to do evil instead of leading them to do good urge in his presence who seeth in secret the platitudes about majorities and the national will which he finds satisfactory now there is a very solemn passage in gods neglected and despised word concerning him who knew his lords will and did it not another easter passed away and left them safe the summer was a season not so much of suffering as of fear and waiting they were tarrying the lords leisure a few months later isoult avery wrote in her diary my birthday and i am now fortyfive years of age it is not unmeet that i should tarry a while at the milestones and look back on the way by which the lord hath led me this last year hath been very woeful and weary what shall the next be o lord thou knowest all the way is of thine ordering all guided by wisdom that never erreth by love that never waxeth faint i will trust thy wisdom to devise and thy love to effect father in heaven let me not faint under thy correction neither let me despise thy chastening be merciful unto me o lord be merciful unto me and thou not i knowest best how and when i need thy mercy hear and if need be forgive the cry which echoes in mine heart for everif it be possible give us back our darling the great emperor charles the fifth died on the st of september in this year in the monastery of san yuste whither he went to make his salvation in his old age i trust said isoult when she heard it that he repented him among other sins of his illusing of his mother there shall doubtless be many masses for him here il faut beaucoup prier said marguerite rose drily the end was at hand now the eventful november of had set in philippa told isoult that the queen suffered fearfully she sat many days on the floor of her chamber her knees higher than her head the pain in her head was dreadful and people began to say that she who was originally accounted merciful had been merciful all through for that others had given orders for the burnings and she even in sceptring the acts had scarcely known what she did the last time that she went to the house of lords she was too ill to walk but was borne by her gentlemen in waiting to the throne james basset told his sister that he counted all burned or beheaded in the queens reign had not suffered so much body nor soul as she james basset who had been ailing for some time grew worse on the th when the queen and the cardinal were both so ill that it was thought doubtful which of them would die the sooner all matters of state and many of business were held as it were in the air waiting the queens death many of the council had already set forth for hatfield that should not like me said isoult were i either the dying sister or the living and she who lay in that palace of white hall must have known if she were not beyond knowing anything that round her grave would be no mournersthat she had done little to cause england to weep for her and much to cause rejoicing that she could harm england no more did she know that men without were naming the day hope wednesday because every hour they expected news of her end god save queen elizabeth long live the queen yea may the queen live for ever these were the first sounds which isoult heard when she was awoke from sleep on the friday morning indeed there was far too much tumult for sleep great crowds of men were pouring through aldgate and as she looked from the window she saw men kissing and embracing and weeping and laughing and shouting all at once and all together and but one was the burden of allthe queen is dead the lady elizabeth is queen god save queen elizabeth hurrah said mr ferris an hour later flinging up his cap to the ceiling as he came in hurrah now is come the golden age again we may breathe now long life to the queen of the gospellers i thought she were rather the queen of the lutherans suggested john all one answered he lutherans burn not gospellers nor clap them into prison neither what have gospellers to fear from queen annes daughter they may have something from king henrys answered john jack thou deservesti cannot stay to tell thee what and i have shouted and danced myself an hungered mrs avery have you to spare of that goodly round of beef pray you sit down with us mr ferris said she we shall not lack a shive for you ah but if i lack halfadozen shives how then said he sit down man responded john why george ferris you are in a fever pretty nigh answered he is there any man in london out of one this morrowexcept you i am too thankful to be merry he replied but how goes it with cardinal pole his death is hourly looked for said mr ferris that afternoon at the cross and other places was queen elizabeth proclaimed even by night men scarcely seemed to have cooled down so glad was england of her protestant queen so freely she breathed when the hand of the oppressor was withdrawn in the afternoon of friday died cardinal pole outliving his cousin queen mary only twentyfour hours john reported that the very faces he met in the streets looked freer and gladder as if every man were now at his ease and king of himself now he thought or at the farthest when the queen was crowned would the prisons be opened who would come out of themwas a very anxious question and yet more who would not come that day marguerite wrote to mr rose by austin who set out immediately to carry the news to the banished gospellers and they looked forward hopefully to seeing him ere long note might they look with any thing like hope to see another their judgment had given up hope long ago but the heart will hope even against all until it knows assuredly that there can be hope no longer isoult said her husband when he came home in the evening i have heard tidings that methinks shall make thee a little sorry what be they jack said she the death of mr james basset he answered yestereven isoult wrote a little loving note to philippa but she heard nothing from her again on the th was all london in a ferment of eager joy for the queen came to the tower in readiness for her coronation she came from the charter house sitting in a rich chariot arrayed in a ridingdress of purple velvet and a scarf tied over her shoulder all london wall was hung with tapestry and beside her rode lord robert dudley who had been made master of the horse lackadaisy said dr thorpe must we be ridden with dudleys yet again is the quotidian ague throughout england all this autumn not plague enough that my lord robin dudley must needs bear the bell a fig for all the dudleysnor are they worth that on the th of december the queen went through the city to somerset house some trouble was feared concerning her coronation the archbishop of york and all the popish bishops refused to crown her nor would they consecrate any not of their way of thinking thirteen bishops had died of the pestilence but not dr bonner to whom alone of all of them elizabeth refused her hand to kiss when they met her in progress how differently this year had closed from the last the gospellers looked back indeed with trembling yet with great thankfulness and there was no need to look forward but for one thing save with hope they must know soon now the fate of the missing one at least the waiting and fearing would be over the knowledge might leave their hearts sick yet even at the worst it would be no longer with hope deferred note an interesting notice of george shipside husband of alice ridley with an account of his bible annotated by himself will be found in the sunday at home page et seq note spanish sovereigns sign in a manner peculiar to themselves not by the christian name but i the king or i the queen note with the exception of a few minor details

old english word for party we have so utterly lost that we fancy it a new one recently introduced from america note it might have been expected that the banished or escaped protestants would wait to see the line which elizabeths policy would take before venturing to return but no such misgivings troubled their minds so perfect was their confidence in her that they flocked home like doves to their windows chapter twelve post tenebras lux so prayed we when our feet draw near the river dark with mortal fear and the night cometh chill with dew o father let thy light break through so let the hills of doubt divide so bridge with faith the sunless tide so let the eyes that fail on earth on thine eternal hills look forth and in thy beckoning angels know the dear ones whom we loved below whittier this eventful year closed with death not a martyr death gods martyr train was closed in england now for the last to join it had been roger holland another kind of death was this softly and tenderly as he called to samuel the lord came and stood and called herher who was loved so dearly whose going out made the world darker with a talitha cumia come up higherhe summoned the beloved to the home where his beloved dwell with him and what answer was left for her but lord here am i so she spread the angel wings which had been folded that they could not be seen and as she soared gladly up into the heavenly light the darkness of time and of earth thickened around those she left behind o lord our master thy voice is very sweet here below not only thy staff but even thy rod comforteth yea it is with thy rod that thou dost feed thy people how much sweeter when as one whom his mother comforteth so dost thou comfort us and sweetest of all it must be to arise and go to thee wherefore then are we so unwilling what mean we continually to talk of being sparedspared from that happy journey from that heavenly home they that are not journeying home are spared indeed but how faithless how loveless is it in us to bring up an evil report of the good land to show such fear and distance from the forgiving and welcoming father he that is washed needeth only to wash his feet but o our father the feet of thy children need a perpetual washing an hourly dipping in the blessed waters of the fountain which thou hast opened for sin and for uncleanness this was the last entry in isoult averys diary for the year the minories saint stephen god knoweth best when his corn is ripe i have been told this today and i need remember it this even otherwise methinks a shower of tears should blot out my writing i thought that sheaf could be no riper years ago the storms had beaten on it but had not hurt it and it was very fair and now it lacked but a season of sunshine and to that i looked forward in hope how little did i know that the sunshine was but making it ready for the harvest meet for heaven nearer god o my love my own darling frances shall i say it is hard to think of you in heaven shall i say it is hard that in the stead of your coming to me i must now go to you shall i grieve in the first hour of my hope and englands that god saw it best to take you gently to himself ere that hope could do more than to throw the beam of his rising on your dying pillow you have seen your beloved father my dear master and i do not think he told you that the lord dealt ungently with him four hours earlier as i was sewing in my chamber barbara came to me mistress said she below is mrs basset and with her two ladies in doole methought these might perhaps be the lady elizabeth jobson and mr james bassets widow whom she had brought with her and down went i to greet philippa but i found the two ladies were strangers at the least i knew not their faces i greeted philippa and sat down when i had louted to the others but to mine amaze one of the ladies saith mrs avery have you forgot kate ashley i rose in astonishment and begged my lady ashleys pardon for of a surety i had not known her so i took her by the hand and kissed her and was about to sit down again when with a smile that i could scarce fail to know the other stranger saith and hath isoult barry forgot anne basset my darling nan cried i that i should not have known thee nay saith she again with her own sweet smile tis no marvel dear heart seeing thou hast not seen me for sixteen years for i had missed seeing her in the procession at queen marys coronation then after we had embraced philippa said i scantly know isoult if thou wilt be glad to see us considering the ill news we bring why philippa what ill news asked i i heard of thy brothers deathmr jamesand writ to thee thereuponfor methought philippa had not received my letter ay i had thy letter and i thank thee for it answered she but hast heard aught further no said i fearfully what is it philippa kate she pursued hath brought us woeful news from potheridgethe death of frances twenty days ago frances i wellnigh startled at mine own cry an ill time addeth philippa close on jamess death we have hardly time to dry our eyes betwixt them the right time dear heart said my lady ashley gently god knoweth best when his corn is ripe was she ever other if thou mean ripe for heaven said she perhaps answered my lady ashley we could not see much difference but he might i begged her to tell me if she were present any particulars of the matter ay i was there she said i went straight to potheridge from wimborne on receiving of a letter from mr monke who told me that frank had brought him another daughter and he could not but fear was not faring over well i came to potheridge upon the th of december when i found her in her bed very weak and white still i feared no instant peril then on the th methought she seemed somewhat better in the morning but that even she grew worse and thence she sank quickly until she died at sunset on wednesday the th she remembered you mrs avery and bade me give you her most hearty and loving commendations and to say that she was but journeying home a little while afore you and that however long the time were to you it would be short to her ere you should meet again and only an hour ere her death she was in her sense to the last came a messenger to mr monke with news of the queens death and that the lady elizabeth was proclaimed queen he brake the tidings gently to her she smiled when she heard them as i should think an angel might smile in heaven and she saith softly lord thou hast seen thou hast seen the affliction of thy people i answered her ay god hath been very gracious to us she said he hath been very good to me quoth i thou dost not think he hath given thee too much thought anxiety and sorrow and as fervently as her weakness did allow she answered o no no i shall clasp them all to my heart tonight in another minute she repeated softly and so shall we ever be with the lord i do not think she spoke again did she die hardly i faltered amid my tears as softly as a child falling asleep in his mothers arms answered my lady ashley we could not tell the very moment her life went out like a star hidden behind a cloud we only knew that it was gone farewell sister of mine heart my fairsouled frances the world is darker now thou art thence but thou shalt never see evil any more the storms shall not rave above thine head nor the winds beat around thee and chill thee god hath removed thee his beautiful lily from this rude and barren moor to that great garden of his paradise where thou shall bloom for ever there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defilethbut they that are written in the lambs book of life so isoult avery wrote but she did not hear until afterwards that lady frances had not passed through the marian persecution without suffering her blood royal had not saved her only one child of her first marriage was left and on the th of march mennot godtook that dearlyprized darling from her the custody of the person and marriage of arthur basset was granted to james basset his popish uncle rot parl mary part this is sufficient to indicate that the roman proclivities of mr monke and lady frances were at least doubtful the double deathof the queen and james bassetfreed arthur and by dint of hard riding night and dayhe scarcely knew whyhe reached devon just in time to kneel and receive the last blessing of that beloved mother she died two hours after her hand had rested on his head if the queens object had been to make arthur basset a papist she scarcely succeeded in her aim this was the last sad entry in that volume of isoults diary god did help the gospellers when the morning appeared and the morning was dawning now there is a ringing of churchbells through all that was written in england throughout that happy year new years day was the gladdest sunday since the persecution began for at bow church mr carter ministered openly and throughout london the gospel and epistle were read in english after the evening service was over the averys received a visit from annis and her husband and before they had sat and talked for ten minutes who should follow them but mr underhill of whose return to london they had heard but had not yet seen him is it not glorious were the first words he spoke we shall have the english service next sunday and the servicebook restored ere february what a leaper art thou said john laughing none that know thee need ask wherefore men call thee the hot gospeller but can there be any other answered he why said john wert thou king of england by the name of edward the seventh i reckon we had had all ere november were fairly run out but the queen is a little more prudent and wary than thou and remember thou as i bade ferris but he did little that she is not a gospeller a truce to thy wariness and prudence cried mr underhill that shall be assuredly where thou art answered john i have no patience said he with such faintheartedness for i can call it by no better name who ever saw a lutheran burn a gospeller ned underhill said john sadly hast thou forgot so soon that we have seen a gospeller beheaded by lutherans whom point you at there the duke of somerset come go not back to the time afore the flood exclaimed he let bygones be bygones i have no objection said john if bygones will be bygones jack avery hold thy peace or we shall quarrel i will not have cold water flung over my fair bonfire of rejoicing it should take much to put it out methinks said dr thorpe what say you my master inquired mr underhill turning with one of his quick motions to don juan marry answered don juan smiling he spoke english fairly i say we shall all know more about it a year hence gramercy you are one of the wary ones grumbled mr underhill come let me see if i cannot find one of my way of thinking mrs avery are you only jack in a gown or have you a mind of your own verily mr underhill i know not how things shall go said she and therefore i were wisest to hold my peace alas answered he dr thorpe you are prudence herself and a lutheran to boot wherefore lutheran cried the old man hastily i am no more a lutheran than you they all laughed at dr thorpe thus brought to confession at last are you not so said mr underhill laughing and bowing in good sooth i am rejoiced to hear itwell mrs rose allow me to ask at you if you go with me or no assuredly mr underhill no said she if i had ever any belief in the goodness of the world it did fly away from me a long time ago and i do not look to see the peace or the right all over it as you seem to look it may be that i answer rather your thoughts than your words but it seemed me you had that thought but mrs rose said he if you take us all for ill and wicked you must find it hard work to love your neighbour as yourself we are leaving our subjectmatter but let that pass ah mr underhill she answered with a smile i am as bad as any one else and i do not think we wait for people to become angels before we love them we do waitfor them to become angels sometimes said annis softly before we know how well we love them they sat silent for a while after this even mr underhill seemed to be meditating neither did he pursue his inquiry any further marguerite rose and went upstairs where thekla was already but the rest kept their places and while they sat there came a very soft rapping at the door the party looked one on another in doubt for the rapping was in the form of the old signaltap which the gospellers were wont to use when they assembled for prayer in each others houses and there was no gathering at the lamb tonight barbara rose and went to the door the minute she opened it they heard her cry eh but no more the person outside spoke and barbara answered more than once but too low for those within to hear words or even whose voice it was then barbara stepped forward and opened the door of the chamber all felt some strange thing at hand and they held their breath and the next minute they were saluted by a voice which had been silent to them for four long weary years how do you all dear friends said mr rose all gathered round him with joyful greeting but isoult she never stayed to think but she found herself at the head of the stairs before she had time to consider thekla was just closing the door of the chamber to come down thekla cried isoult seizing her by the arm who is come asked she i heard something tell thy mother darling said isoultbut canst thou bear glad news thyself i see them in your eyes she answered they are too glad but for one of two things is it my father ah it was only one thekla prepared her mother in the gentle way she knew and then running below was clasped in her fathers arms she took him upstairs and no more was seen of any of them for anticipating that they would prefer to be alone isoult sent esther above with a dish from the suppertable it was four years to a day since mr rose was taken in his case god had been very gracious to them the four years were the same for robin but how should the end be anda thought at once joyous and yet terriblethe end could not be faroff now isoult saw that mr rose had aged in those four years when she had time to study his countenance if such a thing were possible she thought him even gentler and kinder than he used to be yet even more grave and quiet she asked him what he thought of thekla and was slightly comforted to hear him say that he found her better than he dared to hope she hath suffered much poor child said isoult poor child he echoed it was not in her nature to do other and what think you she asked of the chances touching robin mrs avery said he there are no chances in gods government and this is a matter wherein we cannot so much as guess what may have been his will yet if you would know what i think most likely in mere human reasoning i confess i have little hope of his life isoults heart sank like lead she felt now how much hope she had nursed though she thought it so little but her faith in mr roses forecast was great and lady ashleys words came back to hergod knoweth best when his corn is ripe ah how afraid she was that that sheaf was ripe and had been carried into the garner yet could she tell god that he had judged ill or that he should have left his fair sheaf to the spoiling for her pleasure when john came home one evening he told them that he had met with mr underhill who held by the hand his little guilford and coming through cornhill at the shopdoor of a bowyer were bows and quivers of shafts and guilford pulling his fathers hand cried father father do buy me a bow and arrowsbuy thee a bow and arrows quotha answered mr underhill a shred and snip like thee what wouldst thou do an thou hadst a bow and arrows guilford said john shoot all the papists replied the child thou bloodthirsty little ruffian cried mr underhill yet laughing nay said john to him blame not the child he doth but take mightily after a certain father of his that i know whereat said john mr underhill laughed till the tears ran from his eyes mr rose preached his first sermon since coming home in the pulpit of bow church on the th of january it was a glad day to the gospellers his text was when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them that dream he spoke highly of the queen saying that she had suffered for the gospel and should know how to be compatient sympathising with other that had suffered of himself he said little but of christ much and when he came out of the church dozens and dozens of hands were held forth to welcome him till the tears came into his eyes at such a greeting one old gospeller woman cried out lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace nay good joan answered mr rose the reason wherefore the lord hath kept us alive is that we have not yet done all our work at least so i take it tis somewhat too early to be singing the harvesthome afore all the corn be gathered in let us hasten to finish the reaping and then we may sing then came mr underhill with great strides and held out his hand john said aside to his wife i would ned underhill could learn without any telling him that a mans hand and yet more a womans is not made of millstones he hath given me some cruel gripes ere now tis a painful form of love welcome home the second time cried mr underhill cheerily mrs rose your servant but i say man do you not know you are divorced by process of law nay answered mr rose smiling i neither do nor will what an ungovernable piece of merchandise are you said mr underhill laughing but in good sooth i have not talked with one of our ministers that holdeth not the same view men parted us said marguerite her voice trembling a little but i think god never did at any rate he hath undone it now mr rose talked with the averys about his future and they entreated him to stay with them a little longer it was expected that the queen would present the deprived ministers to such benefices as would now be left vacant by the papists deprivations and at least they urged it would be well to do nothing rashly and though they said little to each other all were waiting to see what would happen on the coronation day this was fixed for the ensuing sunday the queen having consulted dr dee and heard from him that sunday would be a fortunate day all were now preparing for the coronation isoult had cloths ready to hang out and kate and frances were as busy as they could be sewing green leaves upon white linen to form the queens nameelizabeth frances said it was well her highness had so long a name for the work should not be by the half so handsome were she called jane or anne but theklas work was by far the most beautiful she was skilled at making waxflowers and had wreathed a garland of white roses which set upon a green ground was to encircle the name with which kate and frances were busied green and white were the queens colours it was intended to be a magnificent piece of work and the only grief was that the queen would never see it for she was going from the tower mr underhill had ordered a new velvet coat wherein said his wife he should be as fine as my lord high treasurer moreover dr thorpe would needs have a new doublet why dear child my sunday doublet hath a patch on it said he and if the queens highness gracious eyes should chance to alight on me thou wouldst not have them to light on a patch dr thorpe might have spared his concern for queen elizabeth was much too nearsighted to detect the patch maybe they should take little hurt said john but doctor if you have a new doublet i must needs have a new coat and then isoult shall want a new gown and we shall have walter clamouring for a gaberdine and kate for an hood certes but the coronation shall be as chargeable unto her highness lieges as to herself nay father i lack no new hood said kate laughing i want only to see the queens grace and i can do that as well in an old hood as a new ay sweet heart answered he but dr thorpe would have one thing more to wit that the queens grace should see him sir henry and lady ashley came on the th to bid their friends farewell for they were about to leave town early on the morning after the coronation and they expected to have little time at liberty they advised the averys not to take their stand in bow churchyard as they intended to do but to beg the loan of some friends window mr underhill had too many customers to help them but annis whose lodging was in saint pauls churchyard was very glad to be of service in the afternoon they went down early to the waterside to see the queen come to the tower from westminster palace her majesty came about two oclock royally arrayed in her state barge and landed at the privy stairs little frances was in the greatest glee because she said she was most unfeignedly certain that the queen looked on her and she walketh about the house said john a fair foot the higher in her own account that she hath been seen of the queens majesty the next day came mr underhill bringing news that the queen had dubbed many knights of the bath and had also created edward seymour eldest son of the late duke of somerset earl of hertford but which edward said john in his quiet way which replied mr underhill why my lord had but one son of his own name no had said john i thought he had two what mean you jack avery said mr underhill i know well what he meaneth answered mr rose it was the worst blot on my lord of somersets life i trust he did repent thereof ere god called him i was thinking said john in a low voice of one katherine folliott an humble violet plucked from her mossy bed and after flung withering away to reach a peony a blackthorn rather if you would picture her complexion suggested dr thorpe what the dukes first wife answered mr underhill why man the whole world hath forgot her so did himself responded john i see said mr underhill you think all that my lord did wickedly in divorcing of her in order to wed the great heir of the stanhopes well it may be so but my word for it he had leisure for repentance i would not lightly have been my lady duchess her lackey much less her lord well answered john i meant not to speak ill of the dead surely not of one whom i do hope and believe that god hath pardoned and taken to himself i did but signify the very thing i did askto wit which of the edwards had been create earl of herts the son of the lady anne stanhope of course said mr underhill it might have been more just and righteous pursued john had it been the son of katherine folliott it may be that his last thought in this world just ere the axe slid down was of that woeful wrong he never could right more alas for mens hearts in this wicked world and yet rather alas for mens consciences well god forgive us all at two oclock on the morning of the th forth sallied all and trudged amongst a moving crush of men and women to annis lodging where she and don juan willingly gave them standingroom with themselves at their two windows john lifted frances on his shoulder where said he she should have the best sight of all and walter was perched upon a high chair in the window kate stood below in front of her father her majesty sat in a rich chariot covered with crimson velvet splendidly attired and a canopy was borne over her head by knights many pageants and gifts were offered to her but one must not be left untold which is that a copy of the english bible was given to her at the little conduit in cheapside and she receiving it let down into her chariot by a silken string in both hands kissed it clasped it to her bosom and thanked the city for it the which said she i do esteem above all other and will diligently read therein mr george ferris and mr underhill were in the procession strange to say hardly any details are preserved of the procession and coronation of elizabeth the bishop of carlisle dr oglethorpe had at last been prevailed upon to crown the queen but that so lately that vestments were not ready for him and they had to be borrowed of bishop bonner he was the only bishop to meet her majesty at westminster abbey the day following was the coronation day of queen elizabeth first thing in the morning barbara and ursula hung out the garland and name that kate and thekla had made which had been taken in overnight after the queens procession then the party breakfasted and there being no service anywhere mr rose read the common prayer to the assembled household and gave them a short discourse on a passage from the psalmswith joy and gladness shall they be brought and shall enter into the kings palace he could hardly be said to preach for he only sat on a chair in the midst of the group he spoke of the coronation day bidding them not to forget that other fairer day of the more glorious coronation when christ shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied when all his people shall be gathered together a full and perfected church the lambs bride when he shall take unto him his great power and reign the afternoon was spent quietly no one looking in upon them and when the dark began to fall and the candles were lighted mr rose read the evening prayers and spoke again this time on a text in the revelationthey are without fault before the throne of god because said he betwixt them and that throne standeth christ to present represent them before god and while all faults be in them in him is no fault and he covereth them with the fair white robe of his own righteousness that gods justice cannot see them apart from it and him that gave and wrought it when evensong was over john and mr rose went out for a halfhours walk and there were left in the chamber dr thorpe esther isoult and the children and thekla isoult called to barbara for candles for those they had were burning low in the socket and while she was gone to fetch them came a low gentle tapping at the door may i open it mother said kate and leave being given away she ran nothing was audible at the door but kate coming back said mother tis a gentleman that would have speech of father will you speak with him isoult lifted her eyes and saw behind kate a gentleman it seemed to her of some thirty years or more tall and spare indeed very thin and worn hollowcheeked and sunkeneyed with long dark brown hair a long beard lying low upon his breast and a moustache curling round his upper lip a strangerat least she knew neither his face nor his name sir she said i am sorry mine husband is not within at this present but if it should please you to wait a little season i am assured that he shall not be long she was about to say but she never got any further her speech was cut in two by a sharp sudden cry from behind her that must have rung through every room in the house and that broke from the lips of thekla rose robin robin robin it seemed to isoult for a moment as though her very heart stood still was it thus that god had given her its desire was this white worn bearded man verily our robin who had passed away from them so very different she seemed neither to know nor to see any thing till she felt two arms clasped around her and a voice that no time nor prison could wholly alter called her to herself withmother i think you have not forgot me and then she awoke and her heart was loosed and her eyes with it she bowed her head down upon robins breast and wept passionately verily god had visited them god had heard their cry and had given them back their darling what followed was confusion theklas cry brought her mother down in haste kate and walter ran to the newcomer hailing him as dear brother robin while little frances hung back shyly and had to be coaxed to come dr thorpe said he would never have known him had he not been helped but robin answered that he was then the better off of the two for he knew him the minute he stepped within esther said she thought she could have guessed at him with a little time and consideration i am very glad to see you mrs esther said he for i did never look again to see any that were bound with me that night then thou lookest not answered isoult to see mr rose which i trust shall be in some few minutes i did not in good sooth said he only i dared not to ask while he spoke they heard johns hand upon the latch kate instantly rushed upon him crying father come and see come and see what sweeting said he come and see she answered pulling him after her into the room mr rose followed more quietly john come into the room stood gazing at robin as though he knew not what to make of it mr rose passed him and came forward robin tremayne said he i scarce dared to hope it so when all the glad greetings were over they sat down and drew their chairs round the fire barbara came in with the supperboard and stared when robin said good even barbara sir queried she looking at him in amazement nay sure tis never master robin come back well i be cruel glad and now robin said john we want thine history writ fair in a great book then father he answered and smiled you must tarry the writing but i count i take you mine history is not very long for there was but little change in it but robin said isoult where hast thou been dear lad austin bernher hath searched all the prisons for thee yea over and over for months past and asked at many prisoners yet could never bring us tidings i trow mother answered robin again smiling he searched every whither but the right and few prisoners should have known anything of me seeing i was kept alone did they count thee a prisoner of import said john in an astonished tone from what i heard them say answered robin looking at mr rose i may thank you for that taking me with you and standing close by you they counted me a very pestilent heretic and treated me as such ah see what it is to fall into bad company said mr rose smiling well robin said isoult thou shalt tell us all after supper an thou wilt but now all is ready ant please you so they gathered round the suppertable and mr rose had only just said grace when the latch was lifted and mr underhills cheery voice cried may an heretic come in come forward ned shouted john in return and forward he came i am weary as a dog said he and i see yonder some eggs and butter buttered eggs survive north of the trent that doth make my mouth water and a wardenpie the warden was a very late pear used chiefly for pies if mine eyes bewray me not mrs avery but here his eye catching robin he broke off short do you bid ghosts to supper if those be not robin tremaynes eyes they are the fairest copies ever mine saw robin tremaynes eyes are very glad to see you mr underhill said he laughingly and mr underhill wrung his hand till robins fingers must have tingled no little draw a chair and fall to man said john go to replied mr underhill and did so with much apparent gusto well so your work is over said john how passed all and where is the queen in her bed i hope answered mr underhill unless she be somewhat more than other women marry but she must be aweary tonight twas a splendrous matter and worth seeing but as cold as charity and when tis january other where tis not august in westminster abbey we heretics fared uncommon well george ferris and i got a red deer pie betwixt us and we made it look ashamed of himself ere we had done i warrant you ned underhill said john tis a standing marvel to me that austin bernher and thou should have come out of queen marys persecution alive tis a greater marvel to me that thou shouldst replied mr underhill a second time attacking the buttered eggs mrs avery i hope you have more eggs in the housewith all thy prudence and cautiousness and wariness sweet jack thou earnest not off a whit better than thy rash and foolish neighbour nay answered john i came off thus much better that i never yet saw the inside of newgate tush that was for a ballad i writ said he but thou canst not say i fared the worse saving that i cannot answered john and thereat i marvel no little o wise and sagacious jack didst ever pluck a nettle i have done such a thing replied he then thou wist that the gentler tis handled the more it stingeth now for my moral take queen mary as the nettle and thou seest my way of dealing your pardon friend underhill said mr rose but i can in no wise allow that either of you were saved by your way of dealing let him have all the glory unto whom it belongeth amen responded mr underhill jack may we sing the te deum in thine house tonight ant like thy squeamishness with a very good will ned answered john when supper was over mr underhill who for all his weariness seemed in no haste to be at home drew up his chair to the fire in the midst of the group and said now tremayneyour first sermon thus bidden robin began his story when mr rose and i were parted i was sent first to the marshalsea here i abode a full year during the which i several times saw austin bernher but afore i had been there a month i was had up afore my lord of london so soon as he saw me he put on a very big and ruffling air and quoth hecome hither thou wicked heretic what canst thou say for thyselfnothing my lord said i save that though i be sinful yet am i no hereticha sayest thou so quoth my lord i will soon see whether thou be an heretic or no tell me dost thou hold the very presence of christs body and blood to be in the sacrament of the altar to whom imy lord i do believe verily as christ hath said that where two or three be gathered together in his name there is he in the midst of themho thou crafty varlet quoth he wouldst turn the corner after that manner by saint mary her kirtle but it shall not serve thy turn tell me now thou pestilent companion when the priest layeth the bread and wine upon the altar afore the consecration what then is there then said ibread and wine my lordwell said quoth he and after the words of consecration be spoken what then is therebread and wine my lord i answered againha saith he i thought i could catch thee thou lither wicked abandoned heretic dost not then believe that after consecration done there in the body and blood of christ verily and alone nor any more the substance of bread and wine remainingmy lord said i my sense doth assure me that the wine is yet wine and the bread bread mine understanding doth assure me that the body of our lord is a true natural human body and cannot therefore be on an hundred altars at one and the same time and i am therein confirmed of saint paul which saith that so oft as we do eat this bread we do show forth the death of the lordha thou runagate he roareth out wilt thou quote from scripture in english hast thou no latin i have a whip that shall make thee speak latinmy lord said i i can quote from the scripture in latin if that like your lordship the better and likewise in greek the which being the tongue wherein they were written at the first should be all the surer but i being an englishman born for the which i thank god do more naturally read the scripture in englishi will not have thee to speak greek crieth he tis the devil that did invent greek of late years to beguile unwary men and i do thee to wit that the scripture was not writ in greek thou lying varlet but in the holy tongue latinit would ill become me to gainsay your lordship said ii will have thee back saith he to the first matter and i bid thee answer me without any cunning or evasion dost thou believe that our lords body was eaten of the blessed apostles or nomy lord i answered with all reverence unto your lordships chair and office seeing the lords body was crucified on the friday i do not believe nor cannot that it was eaten of the apostles the even afore then he arose up out of his seat and gnashed his teeth and railed on me with great abuse crying ha thou heretic thou lither knave and worser words than these i have thee i have outwitted thee thou art fairly beat and put down have the heretic knave away and keep him close and so i was carried back to the marshalsea marry said mr underhill but i think it was edmund bonner that was put down i never knew what a witty fellow thou wert robin said isoult it should have aggrieved me sorely to be so unjustly handled to hear him say that he had beat thee when it was thou that hadst beat him it should have gone mightily against the grain with me the old story answered mr rose is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away methinks that should rankle sore in hezekiahs mind and in the hearts of them that lovest him bishop bonner is somewhat coarser and less subtle yet tis the same thing in both cases well said robin with a smile to those who had spoken after that i was not called up again when at last i was brought out from the marshalsea i counted it would be surely either for an other examination or for burning but to my surprise they set me on an horse that was tied to the horse of one of the sheriffs men and i with some twelve other prisoners likewise bound was taken a long journey of many days i could see by the sun that we were going west but whither i wist not and the man to whom i was bound refused to tell me at the last we entered into a great city walled and moated here we were brought afore a priest that demanded of each of us what was the cause of our sentence to whom i answered sir i have not yet been sentenced but i believe the cause of my prison to be that i do put faith in saint pauls words that when we do show forth the lords death in the sacrament of his supper it is bread the which we do eat whereat he smiled somewhat but after scowled and bade an officer have me thence of whom i was taken down into a cell or little dungeon and there set by myself i asked of the officer where i was and he laughed and at first would not tell me but after he said well you are in exeter but say not unto any that i told it you in the prison at exeter where i was alone i lay methinks over two years ah pursued robin dropping his voice it was hard work lying there men had forgotten me i thought i began to marvel whether god had i saw none but my gaoler that brought me meat then the generic term for food morning and evening but scarce ever spake to me and i fell at times to talking with myself that i should not forget mine own tongue nor be affrighted at the sound of mine own voice at last just as the warm days of spring were coming i was brought out and again set on an horse we went north this time and one even after passing by certain monastical buildings we stayed at the door of a stately palace here i was bidden to light for that we should go no further they carried me away through many lobbies and down stairs and at length we came unto a chamber where was a gaoler sitting with his keys at his girdle he and my guide spake together and he then bare me unto a cell wherein i was locked i asked again where i was but to no end beyond being bidden to hold my peace and stricken on the head with his keys here i passed not many days ere one even the gaoler came unto me and bade me to follow him he led me down further stairs and at the very bottom opened a heavy door i could see nothing within go in said he gruffly and fall no further than you can help you were best to slide down i marvelled whither i were going but i took his avisement and grasping the doorsill with mine hands i slid down into the darkness at length my feet found firm ground though i were a little bruised in the descent but i lighted on no floor but a point onlyall the walls sloping away around me are you there growls the gaolerbut his voice sounded far above me i am some whither said i but i can find no floor he laughed a rough laugh and saith you can find as much as there is there is little ease yonder and he shut to the door and left me all at once it flashed on me where i was and so terrible was the knowledge that a cold sweat brake forth all over me i had heard of the horrible prison in the bishop of lincolns palace of woburn called little ease note which tapered down to a point wherein a man might neither stand nor sit nor lie somewhat like despair came over me were they about to leave me to lie here and die of hunger i shouted and my voice came back to me with a mocking echo i held my breath to listen and i heard no sound i was an outcast a dead man out of mind the earth with her bars was about me for ever i had borne all easily so to speak save this but now i covered my face with mine hands and wept like a child my poor robin said isoult tell me when this was it was at the beginning of the hot weather he answered i fancy it might be about june i thanked god heartily that it was not winter ay said she thou wouldst have more light light he said and smiled no light ever came into little ease i never knew day from night all the while i was there once in three days my gaoler unlocked the door and let down to me a rope at the end whereof was a loaf of bread and after a tin pitcher of water and i had to fasten thereto the empty pitcher such thirst was on me that i commonly drank the water off first thing but how didst thou go to bed asked walter robin smiled and told the child there was no bed to go to and did the gaoler never forget thee kate wished to know twice he did answered robin for a day but that would not kill me thou wist i became very weak ere i came forth but to continuei wept long and bitterly but it gave me no comfort i felt as if nothing ever would give me comfort again the devil was very near me it was all folly he whispered i had hoped a vision and had believed a lie god was dead if there ever were any god he never came into little ease none would ever know where and what i was become i should die here and if fifty years hence my whitened bones were found none would know whose they had been your dear faces rose around me and i could have wept again to think i should never see you any more but the fountain of my tears was dried now mine heart seemed to be freezing into rock than which the walls of little ease were no harder i sat or lay call it what you will thinking gloomily and drearily until at last nature could bear no more and i slept even there well robin said kate if thine heart were frozen methinks it thawed again afore thou earnest hither it did so sweet heart said he smiling on her even as i awoke a text of scripture darted into my memory wellnigh as though one had spoken it to me a strange text you will sayyet it was the one for me thenthen jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fishs belly well i was no worse off than jonah it seemed yet more unlike his coming forth of that fishs belly than did my coming forth of little ease methought i so near in jonahs case would try jonahs remedy to have knelt i could not no more i fancy could jonah but i could pray as well as he that was the first gleam of inward light and after that it grew aygrew till i was no more alone because god companied with me till i was no more an hungred because god fed me till i thirsted no more because god led me unto living fountains of waters till i wept no more because god wiped away all tears from mine eyes ere i came forth i would not have changed little ease for the fairest chamber of the queens palace if thereby i had left him behind it gained on me till my will grew into gods willtill i was absolutely content to die or live as he would to be burned in smithfield or to come home and clasp you all to mine heartas should be most to his glory the heats of summer i thought must be come but on the hottest summer day there was but cold and damp in little ease the summer methought must be passing and then it must be past i had left hoping for change i only thought how very fair and sweet the house of the father would be to me after this so the hours rolled away until one morrow out of the wonted order i heard the door unlocked are you there calls the gaoler in his gruff voice ay said i feel about for a rope quoth he and set the noose under your arms you are to come forth was this god calling to me i did not think of the pains of death i only remembered the afterjoy of seeing him i found the rope and the loop thereof which i set under mine arms cry out when you are ready saith he i cried and he slung me up can i tell you what pain it was the lightthe sweet summer light of heavenwas become torture and i could neither stand nor walk ha saith he when he saw this you have not grown stronger how liked you little easei like what god liketh for me i made answer he looked on me somewhat scornfully methinks you be but half rocked yet saith he maybe you shall come back matt at the shout an undergaoler came forth of a door take thou this fellow by the arm saith he we shall be like to bear him himself took mine other arm and so more borne than walking i reached the hall of the palace here they took me into a little light chamber suffered me to wash and gave me clean garments to my great ease then they sat me down at a table and set before me a mess of sodden meat with bread and drink and bade me to eat well i thought i was going afore the bishop for sentence but to my surprise they let me alone locked me into the chamber and there left me this chamber had a barred window looking out on the palace court in the midst whereof was a round of green grass i cannot set in words the exquisite delight that window gave me the green grass and the blue skyi could never tire of them here they fed me well three times in the day and at night i lay on a mattress which was softer to me then than i ever felt afore a bed of down when at last i was strong enough to ride i was set on an horse and his bridle tied to the horse of the sheriffs man so we rade away from woburn twenty or more in company this time i saw we went south at the last i will not essay to tell you with what feelings i knew we were nearing london i wonder where were you beloved that even that i rade in at aldgate i looked longingly down the minories but i could see no familiar face why robin dear what even was it said isoult how shall i tell thee sweet mother when i know not yet what even is this said he and smiled it was fifteen weeks from today saving three days there is a sum said mr underhill jack whether can thou or i do it fifteentwo thirtyones and a thirtysaving threethe th of october i make it i think so assented john october said robin still smiling i fancied it earlier it is january then now i thought we were not past christmas well through the city went we and into newgate where as afore i was lodged alone newgate cried mr underhill and how doth mine old friend alisaunder and my most gentlest mistress his wife i saw not her replied robin but to judge from his face i should say he doth rarely well here then in newgate i lay marvelling that i was never sentenced and burned but i knew nothing of the cause nor of what passed until this even all the doors were unlocked and we prisoners all were bidden to go forth whither we would for queen elizabeth reigned and this was her coronation day how strange it was to be free i marvelled what thou wert suffering robin dear said isoult but we never thought of little ease we took thee for dead so i thought you would said he and now that i am returned to mens life again tell me i pray you what day is thisof the month and week tis the th of january said she and sunday and the year he resumed pausing i suppose is fifteen hundred and fiftyeight by the old reckoning from easter to easter it is so dear heart answered isoult it seemeth me said robin a little picture of the resurrection come friends cried mr underhill springing up i must be going and i will not be balked of my te deum jack thou promisedst it me so i did answered he smiling strike up and we will all follow he struck up the chant in his fine deep voice and all joined in then mr underhill took his leave and went home after which the rest sat a little while in silence mr rose was the first to break it robin hast thou still a purpose to receive orders more than ever cried robin eagerly i never could before have told the people onehalf of what i can tell now i knew that god was sufficient for some things but now i see him allsufficient and for all i knew he could lift man up to him like a mother learning a child day by day but i scantly knew how he could come down to man like the same mother bending her sense down to the stature of her child entering into his difficulties feeling his troubles making her a child for him i even i am he that comforteth you i will comfort you and ye shall be comforted yea as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you i think thou art right said mr rose softly again they sat in silence till the clock struck eightthe hour at which they commonly parted for the night before any one moved mr rose called thekla to him when she obeyed he took her hand and laid it in robins the lord bless you and keep you he said tenderly my son thou hast been in sorrow and god hath been with thee see thou leave him not out of thy joy may jesus who was the chief guest at the wedding in cana of galilee be with you also and turn the water of earthly hope into the best wine of heavenly peace we have asked him to the match lord make one at the marriage there was no voice silent in the amen and then as if the very act of lifting up his heart to god had borne him above earth and he had forgotten the thing that caused it mr rose went on for thou only art holy thou only art the lord thou only o christ with the holy ghost art most high in the glory of god the father note there were several prisons which bore this name one of them in london the most horrible of all was that at woburn and was i believe the only one constructed on this cruel principle chapter thirteen appendix historical notes bernher augustine by birth a germanswiss probably from the neighbourhood of basle in contemporary notices often called latimers servant but if the meaning of the word at that time be borne in mind and the kind of service noted it will be seen that he was only a servant in the sense of being in receipt of a salary from his employer he was ordained in or before the reign of edward the sixth and during the persecution under mary no man was more fervid and fearless than he at many martyrdoms we find him consoling the martyr visiting the condemned prisoners and forming the recognised means of communication between them his safety through all can only be attributed to the direct interposition of his almighty master mine own good augustine wrote bradford the lord of mercy bless thee my dear brother for ever the keeper telleth me that it is death for any to speak with me but yet i trust that i shall speak with you foxes acts and monuments eight at the commencement of the persecution bernher lived at baxterley near mancetter but for a time during its height he was minister of a small london congregation which assembled secretly sometimes in very curious places and often on board some vessel in the thames bernher was a married man after the accession of elizabeth this christian hero was presented by the crown to the rectory of southam county warwick richings narrative of sufferings of glover etcetera pages but only for a very few years did bernher survive the persecution the scaffolding had served its purpose and was taken down the servant of god had done his work in aiding the brethren at risk of life and the summons was issued to himself come up higher on april bartholomew greene was presented to the rectory of southam vacant by the death of augustine barnehere dugdales warwickshire page bonner bishop edmund this coarsest and most cruel persecutor of the protestants whose anger was particularly rife against married priests was himself the illegitimate son of a priest george savage the illegitimate son of sir john savage of cheshire his father was parson of dunham and during his earlier years he was known indiscriminately as edmund savage or bonner which last appears to have been his mothers name the only punishment which this monster received at the hands of men lay in the refusal of elizabeth to permit him to kiss her hand when the bishops met her on her coronation progress and the restriction of his residence for the remainder of his life probably he might even have been spared the last penalty had he not had the cool effrontery to take his seat in the house of lords as bishop of london in elizabeths first parliament this provocation was too much for the patience of that determined princess and bonner speedily found himself in the marshalsea where he was not uncomfortably accommodated until his death elected bishop of hereford december but translated to london before consecration consecrated bishop of london in the bishop of londons palace by stephen gardiner of winchester richard sampson of chichester and john william skippe of hereford april deprived october restored august redeprived may died september buried in the churchyard of saint george southwark ferris george this worthy is sometimes called george ferrers he was born at or near saint albans educated at oxford studied at lincolns inn wrote poems much admired in his day and translated magna charta from french into latin he was patronised by cromwell and was master of the revels in the kings house in and ferris died at flamstead in hertfordshire in grey lady jane the opinion which her contemporaries formed of this lady and which is to a great extent shared by their posterity was not the true view of her character she was by no means the meek gentle spiritless being whom novelists and even historians have usually depicted under her name on the contrary she was a woman with a very decided will of her own and with far more character than her husband who had set his weak mind on being proclaimed king this jane bluntly refused though she was willing to create him a duke through all her letters now extant there runs a complaining querulous strain which rather interferes with the admiration that would otherwise be excited by her talents character and fate my business in the story is to paint lady jane as the protestants of her day believed her to be but it is hardly just not to add that they believed her to be made of softer and more malleable material than she really was the fact of her having been persuaded or rather forced to accept the crown has given this erroneous impression of her disposition it was the only point on which she was ever influenced against her own judgment the instigator being lord guilford who in his turn was urged by his ambitious unprincipled father and his equally ambitious and unprincipled mother in whose hands his weak affectionate yielding temperament rendered him an easy tool the probability is that had jane been firmly established as queen she would have shown a character more akin to that of elizabeth than is commonly supposed though undoubtedly her personal piety was much more marked than that of her cousin it seems rather strange that the child of parents morally speaking so weak as dorset and frances should have displayed so strong and resolved a character as did lady jane grey born at bradgate married at durham house london may beheaded on tower hill february holland roger as much as is known of the history of this last of the smithfield martyrs will be found in foxes acts and monuments eight there is much difficulty however in deciding from what branch of the great holland family the martyr came all accounts tell us that he was a holland of lancashire yet his name does not appear in any pedigree of the numerous lancastrian lines all these families are descended from sir robert de holand who died in and his wife maude heiress of la zouche nor is it any easier to trace the relationship between roger holland and lord strange or mr eccleston both of whom foxe calls his kinsmen more than one branch of holland married into eccleston and the derby connection has eluded all my researches rogers wife was named elizabeth but her surname does not appear they were married in the first year of queen mary and had issue one child sex and name unknown his martyrdom took place on the th of june or about that time foxe speaks doubtfully as to the exact day nothing further is known of his wife and child monke thomas son of anthony monke of potheridge and elizabeth woode of london born in he was twice married after the death of lady francesfirst to elizabeth powell of stroud and lastly to katherine hawkes the third wife was childless by the second he had one daughter dorothy the male line of monke failed in christopher only son of george monk duke of albemarle in the female line the blood of the plantagenets descended to many very obscure families the wife of colonel pride who conducted king charles the first to his trial was elizabeth monke of potheridge the eventual representative of the family ancient compotuses of exchequer devon h eight harl mss folio folio northumberland john dudley duke in some respects this was the most remarkable man of his age he may be said to have risen from nothing for though his mother was elizabeth eleventh viscountess lisle in her own right his father was edmund dudley the mean and avaricious favourite of henry the seventh the marriage of dudley and elizabeth was apparently forced upon the viscountess then a mere girl of some twenty years of age or under and when she was left free she remarried sir arthur plantagenet viscount lisle to whom it seems probable that she had been originally betrothed john dudley was the eldest child of this illmatched pair and was born in the solitary object of his love was john dudley and the one aim of his existence was to advance that gentlemans fortunes from a worldly point of view he succeeded remarkably well he passed gradually through the several gradations of knight viscount lisle march lord high admiral governor of calais about earl of warwick february duke of northumberland october the last title placed him at the very summit of his ambition there were only two other dukes in england norfolk and suffolk and had he been proclaimed king his power could scarcely have been any greater than it was yet all this availed haman nothing so long as he saw mordecai the jew sitting at the kings gate and so long as edward seymour drew the breath of life there was bitterness in all the honours of john dudley he stooped to the lowest and vilest means of destroying his rival and he effected his purpose himself to be destroyed in his turn by the accession of mary not two years later his attempt to make his daughterinlaw queen was his last and most aspiring effort at his own aggrandisement when that failed all failed and he sank down as low as high he soared through life he was the acknowledged head of the lutheran party but in respect of personal religion he was a byends adopting the creed which he thought would best advance his interests his own proclivity being towards popery as he showed in the last days of his lifeunless it be thought that this his latest act worthy of the life which had preceded it was a mere attempt to curry favour with queen mary bad as the man was i do not like to think that his dying act was a lie he suffered on tower hill august northumberland was but once married though he left a large family his wife was jane daughter of sir edmund

him with the uttering on the trial he was the principal witness though the duke denied his accusation and declared all the ill he could devise of palmer it was not necessary to devise much it was soon

were early divided into two great parties known as lutherans and gospellers or consubstantiaries and sacramentaries these were nearly equivalent to the modern high church not ritualistic and evangelical parties there was yet a further division at a later period by the formation of a third sect known as hot gospellers the direct ancestors of the puritans without bearing these facts in mind it is scarcely possible to enter into the politics of the period many who began as lutherans ended as gospellers eg cranmer somerset katherine duchess of suffolk some remained lutherans for life eg queen katherine parr queen elizabeth and there were a few who never were lutherans at all of whom the representative is latimer the enmity between somerset and northumberland had a religious origin somerset being a gospeller and northumberland professedly a lutheran it may be added that the gospellers were as a rule calvinists the lutherans arminians rose reverend thomas i do not think it needful to recapitulate the history of rose which may be found at length in foxes acts and monuments eight et seq and i only propose to add a few particulars and explanations which are not to be found in foxe it is only probable not certain that mrs rose was a foreigner her name not being on record and the age and existence of their only child are the sole historical data for the character of thekla i must in honesty own that it is not even proved that roses wife and child were living at the time of his arrest but the contrary is not proved either the accusation brought against him is extant among foxes mss harl ms folio from which we find that he was detained at the cross in the green yard near the cathedral norwich and that he was accused of having publicly held and taught that in the eucharist or sacrament of the altar the true natural and real body and blood of christ under the forms of bread and wine are not but that after consecration the substance of bread and wine remaineth and that whosoever shall adore that substance committeth idolatry and giveth divine honour to a creature foxes mss harl ms folio sir thomas rose clerk saith that he hath so preached and will so preach ibidem folio on the th of may mr thomas rosse preacher was by the counsailles letters delyvered from the tower to the shrief of norfolk to be convayed and delyvered to the bishop of norwiche and he either to reduce hym to recante or elles to precede against hym accordinge the lawe diary of the councils proceedings ibidem harl ms page and four days later may a letter to the lord treasourer signifyinge what the lords had done for rosse and that order should be given according his ls lordships request for letters to the busshopps ibidem rose is by many of his contemporaries called ross or rosse but he appears to have spelt his own name rose i say appears because his autograph has been searched for in vain the narrative of his sufferings written by himself and printed in the acts and monuments is not extant among foxes papers when rose returned to england after the accession of elizabeth he took possession again of his old vicarage west ham but resigned it when he was presented by the crown to the vicarage of luton in bedfordshire this was on november and the living was vacant by the death of the reverend mason it formed a quiet retreat for the old age of the persecuted preacher at luton he spent nearly thirteen years dying there in for on the th of june in that year william home was presented to the vacant living rot parl elizabeth part elizabeth bibl topogr british antiquities volume four foxe therefore was apparently mistaken when he spoke of rose as still living in his edition of he had in all probability not yet heard of his death as rose was born at exmouth in or about his age was about seventyfour when he diedprobably rather more than less for such further details of his life as can be found in foxes volumes i must refer my readers to his familiar and accessible work somerset edward seymour duke this very eminent man was the second son of sir john seymour of wolf hall and margaret wentworth of nettlestead and owed his first rise to notice entirely to the elevation of his sister queen jane seymour he married at some period previous to this katherine daughter and coheir of sir william folliott whom he repudiated when he reached a rather higher position in order to marry anne stanhope a great heiress this was probably in on the th of june in that year he was created viscount beauchamp and on the th of october following was advanced to the dignity of earl of hertford so late as the accession of edward the sixth he was still a lutheran for had he been then a gospeller we should not have found his signature to a letter written to the council recommending a pardon at the coronation because the late king being in heaven has no need of the merit of it he was created by his royal nephew february duke of somerset and lord protector of england during the kings minority it was very soon after this that he became a gospeller and immediately the lords of the council headed by northumberland conspired to ruin him the fullest and the saddest account of the plot against somerset will be found in that diary of edward the sixth which records only facts not opinions much less feelings edward never enters anything in his diary but events and he did not see that the affair was a plot among somersets judges were his rival northumberland his daughterinlaws father suffolk the gospeller sussex his enemy pembroke and his cousin wentworth the duke was acquitted of high treason and condemned to death for felony ie for devising the death of northumberland somerset rose and owned honestly so much of the accusation as was true he had considered whether it were advisable to impeach northumberland and others and had decided not to do so he might have added that for his rival a simple member of the council to depose and afterwards to impeach the lord protector was at last as felonious or treasonable as any act of his but words were vain however true or eloquent northumberland had resolved upon his death and thirsted for his blood somerset died upon tower hill january his duchess survived him but she was not released from the tower until the accession of mary he left behind him twelve children three by katherine folliott nine by anne stanhope the present duke of somerset is the representative of the former the duke of northumberland by the female line of the latter lady jane the proposed queen of edward the sixth was afterwards maid of honour to queen elizabeth and died unmarried march aged only nineteen somersets failings were pride and ambition and he suffered in having married a woman whose faults were similar to his own the character delineated in the text is not that attributed to him by modern historians i must beg my readers to remember that the necessities of the story oblige me to paint the historical persons who enter into it not as modern writers regard them nor indeed as i myself regard them but as they were regarded by the gospellers of their day and the feelings of the gospellers towards somerset were those of deep tenderness and veneration whether the gospellers or the historians were in the right is one of those questions on which men will probably differ to the end of the world i believe that his last days the worst from a worldly point of view were the best from a religious one and that he was chastened of the lord that he should not be condemned with the world titles but a very short time had elapsed at the date of this story since the titles of lord and lady had been restricted to members of the royal family alone when used with the christian name only a great deal of this feeling was still left and it will be commonly found i do not say universally that when persons of the sixteenth century used the definite article instead of the possessive pronoun before a title and a christian name they meant to indicate that they regarded him of whom they spoke as a royal person let me instance lord guilford dudley those who called him the lord guilford were partisans of lady jane grey those from whose lips he was my lord guilford dudley were against her this is perhaps still more remarkable in the case of arthur lord lisle whom many persons looked upon as the legitimate son of edward the fourth as a viscount his daughters of course had no claim to the title of lady those who gave it regarded him as a prince oddly enough his friends generally give the higher title his servants the lower from his agent husee it is always mrs frances never lady but from sir francis lovell her sister is the lady elyzabeth plantagenet underhill edward the hot gospeller most prominent of his party was the eldest son of thomas underhill of wolverhampton and anne wynter of huddington he is known in the pedigrees of his family as edward underhill of honingham he was born in and at the age of eight succeeded to the family inheritance on the death of his grandfather having previously lost his father harl ms folio underhill married in jane daughter of a london tradesman whom the pedigrees call thomas price or perrins harl ms folio folio but as underhill himself calls his brotherinlaw john speryn i have preferred his spelling of the name the narrative of the examynacione and impresonmentt off edwarde underehyll from august to september is extant in his own handtall upright legible writingin harl mss folio and folios nearly the whole narrative so far as it refers to underhill himself has been worked into the present story two short extracts have been printed from it in the chronicle of queen jane and queen mary pages and strype has made use of it also the ballad given in chapter eight is evidently not the one on account of which the author was imprisoned underhill had eleven children anne born december query christian

henry born september living some writers speak of a twelfth child francis but this seems to require confirmation underhill removed to baginton near coventry about easter he appears to have lost his wife in if she were the mistress hunderell buried in saint botolphs on the th of april he was living himself in rot pat elizabeth part two nothing has been ascertained concerning him subsequent to that date but according to one of the heralds visitations he returned to honyngham notices of his descendants are very meagre lord leicesters servant underhill in is reported to have been one of his two surviving sons edward and henry and captain john underhill the antinomian who figures in the early history of america is said to have been the grandson of the hot gospeller the ms which has chiefly supplied the dates given above was not found until too late to correct the text the dates of birth therefore of anne and edward as given in the story are inaccurate underhill lent his narrative to foxe who is said to have returned it without making use of it that he made no use of it is certain beyond recording the day of underhills committal to newgate but whether he ever returned it is not so certain for it is bound with foxes papers at this day to which fact we probably owe its preservation in ainsworths tower of london a fancy portrait of underhill is given precisely the opposite of that which i should sketch he was a tall thin man with sandy hair and a scanty beard of the same colour his eyes were blear and glassy with pink lids utterly devoid of lashes and he had a
