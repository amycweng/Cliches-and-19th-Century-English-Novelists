the kings daughters how two girls kept the faith by emily sarah holt you will enjoy this book about the time when mary was queen of england following the rise of protestantism during henry the eighths and edward the sixths reigns mary was a catholic and during her reign there was a time when people with the protestant faith were apt to be tortured and burnt at the stake so the king of the title is the king of heaven and his daughters are those women who retain their faith even up to the moment when they die in the flames the subtitle is how two girls kept the faith the problem with killing saintly mothers is that they may leave young children behind them and a great deal of this book deals with the three young children of one such woman the edition used was not registered in the copyright library but it appears to have been a rather badly printed pirated version it was not an easy job to create this ebook but i believe the author would approve of what we have done for you the kings daughters how two girls kept the faith by emily sarah holt chapter one choosing a new gown give you good den master clere said a rosyfaced countrywoman with a basket on her arm as she came into one of the largest clothiers shops in colchester it was an odd way of saying good evening but this was the way in which they said it in the rosyfaced woman set down her basket on the counter and looked round the shop in the leisurely way of somebody who was in no particular hurry they did not dash and rush and scurry through their lives in those days as we do in these she was looking to see if any acquaintance of hers was there as she found nobody she went to business could you let a body see a piece of kersey think you id fain have a brown or a good dark murrey d serve mesomewhat that should not show dirt and may be trusted to wear wellgood den mistress clerehave you eer a piece o kersey like that master nicholas clere who stood behind the counter did not move a finger he was a tall big man and he rested both hands on his counter and looked his customer in the face he was not a man whom people liked much for he was rather queertempered and as mistress clere was wont to remark a bit easier put out than in a man of few words but those were often pungent was nicholas clere what price said he well you mustnt ask me five shillings a yard said the rosyfaced woman with a little laugh that was the price of the very best and finest kersey shouldnt think o doing answered the clothier come you know the sort as ill serve me shilling a yard at best if youve any at eightpence havent well then i reckon i must go a bit higher weve as good a kersey at elevenpence broke in mrs clere as youd wish to see alice mount of a summer day a good brown belike and not one as ll fadeand a fine threadfor the price you know you dont look for kersey at elevenpence to be even with that at halfacrown now do you but youll never repent buying this i promise you mrs clere was not by any means a woman of few words while she was talking her husband had taken down the kersey and opened it out upon the counter there said he gruffly take it or leave it there were two other women in the shop to whom mrs clere was showing some coarse black stockings they looked like mother and daughter while alice mount was looking at the kersey the younger of these two said to the other isnt that alice mount of bentleyshe that was had to london last august by the sheriffs for heresy with a main lot more ay tis she answered the mother in an undertone twentythree of them werent there thereabouts they stood to it awhile if you mind and then they made some fashion of submission and got let off so they did but i mind master maynard said it was but a sorry sort he wouldnt have taken it quoth he the other woman laughed slightly truly i believe that if he had a chance to lay hold on em else he loves bringing folk to book and prison too theres margaret thurston coming across said the younger woman after a moments pause i rather guess she means to turn in here when people say i guess now we set them down at once as americans but in everybody in england said it our american cousins have kept many an old word and expression which we have lost see note two in another minute a woman came in who was a strong contrast to alice mount instead of being small round and rosy she was tall and spare and very pale as if she might have been ill not long before she too carried a basket but though it was only about half as large as alices it seemed to try her strength much more good den neighbour said alice with a pleasant smile good den alice i looked not to find you here what come you after a piece of kersey for my bettermost gown this summer what seek you well i want some linsey for mine go you on and when youve made an end ill ask good master clere to show me some without mistress cleres at liberty sooner alice mount was soon satisfied she bought ten yards of the brown kersey with some black buckram to line it and then as those will who have time to spare and not much to occupy their thoughts she turned her attention to helping margaret thurston to choose her gown but it was soon seen that margaret was not an easy woman to satisfy she would have striped linsey no she wouldnt she would have a self colour no she wouldnt she would have a little pattern lastly she did not know which to have what did master clere think or what would alice recommend her master clere calmly declined to think anything about it take it or leave it said he youll have to do one or tother might as well do it first as last margaret turned from one piece to another with a hopelessly perplexed face there were three lying before her a plain brown a very dark green with a pretty little pattern and a delicate grey striped with a darker shade of the same colour browns usefullest maybe said she in an uncertain tone greens none so bad though and that greys proper prettyit is a gentlewomans gown id like that grey the grey was undoubtedly ladylike but it was only fit for a lady not for a working mans wife who had cooking and cleaning to do a week of such work would ruin it past repair you have the brown neighbour said alice its not the prettiest maybe but it ll look the best when its been used a while that grey ll never stand nought and the green though its better ll not wear even to the brown you have the brown now still margaret was undecided she appealed to mrs clere why look you responded that talkative lady if you have yonder green gown you can don it of an even when your master comes home from work and hell be main pleased to see you asitting in the cottage door with your bit o needlework in a pretty green gown ay so he will said margaret suddenly making up as much mind as she had i thank you mistress clere ill have the green master clere an it please you now alice mount had offered a reason for choosing the brown dress and mrs clere had only drawn a picture but margaret was the sort of woman to be influenced by a picture much more than by a solid reason so the green linsey was cut off and rolled upnot in paper that was much too precious to be wasted on parcels of common things it was only tied with string and each woman taking her own package the two friends were about to leave the shop when it occurred to mrs mount to ask a question so youve got bessy foulkes at last mistress clere ay we have alice was the answer and you might have said at long last trow never saw a maid so hard to come by i could have got twenty as good maids as she to hire themselves while bess was thinking on it she should be worth somewhat now you have her if she took such work to come by observed margaret thurston oh well shell do middling shes a stirring maid over her work but shes mortal quiet she is not a word can you get out of her without tis needed and for a young maid of nineteen you know thats strange fashions humph said master nicholas rolling up some woollen handkerchiefs the world d do with another or twain of that fashion now nicholas you cant say you get too much talk exclaimed his wife turning round why amy and me were as quiet as a couple of mice from morning till night arent we now cant i said nicholas depositing the handkerchiefs on a shelf well any way youve got no call to it nobody can say i talk too much that i know nor yet amy you know do you said her husband coolly well then i need not to say it now neighbours isnt that too bad demanded mrs clere as nicholas moved away to attend to another customer i never was a rattle not i but tis right like men they take in their heads that all women be talkers and be as still as you will they shall write you down a chatterbox well now cant i tempt you with nought more stockings or kerchiefs or a knitted cap well then good den i dont so well like the look of them clouds yonder we shall have rain afore night take my word for it farewell mulberrycolour much like that we call plumcolour or prune note they say i want to have you go when we should say i want you to go queen elizabeth would have used the former expression chapter two who took care of cissy the clothiers shop which we entered in the last chapter was in balcon or balkerne lane not far from its northern end the house was built as most houses then were with the upper storey projecting beyond the lower and with a good deal of window in proportion to the wall the panes of glass were very small set in lead and of a greenish hue and the top of the house presented two rather steeply sloped gables houses in that day were more picturesque than they have been for the last two hundred years though they have shown a tendency in recent times to turn again in that direction over master cleres doorand over every door in the streethung a signboard on which some sign was painted each different from the rest for signs then served the purpose of numbers so that two alike in the same street would have caused confusion as far as eye could see ran the gailypainted boardsblue lion varied by red black white and golden lions white hart kings head golden hand vine wheelbarrow star cardinals hat crosskeys rose magpie saracens head and katherine wheel master nicholas clere hung out a magpie why he best knew and never told his neighbours sarcastically said that it was because a magpie lived there meaning mistress clere who was considered a chatterbox by everybody except herself our two friends margaret thurston and alice mount left the shop together with their baskets on their arms and turning down a narrow lane to the left came out into high street down which they went then along wye street and out at bothals gate they did not live in colchester but at much bentley about eight miles from the town in a southeasterly direction i marvel said margaret as the two pursued their way across the heath how bessy foulkes shall make way with them twain do you so answered alice truly i marvel more how she shall make way with the third what mistress amy alice nodded but why theres no harm in her trow she means no harm said alice but theres many an one meg as doesnt mean a bit of harm and does a deal for all that im feared for bessy but i cant see what youre feared for these be times for fear said alice mount neighbour have you forgot last august eh no trust me cried margaret didnt i quake for fear when my master came in and told me you were taken afore the justices truly i reckoned he and i should come the next i thank the good lord that stayed their hands tis well we be on the heath said alice glancing round as if to see whether they could be overheard if we spake thus in the streets of colchester neighbour it should cost us dear well i do hate to be so careful folks cannot have alway what they would said alice but you know neighbour bessy foulkes is one of us well what then sos master clere alice made no answer what mean you alice mount master cleres a gospeller and has been this eight years or more i did not gainsay it meg nay you might not gainsay it but you looked as if you would if you opened your mouth well neighbour my brother at stoke nayland sells a horse by nows and thens and the last time i was yonder a gentleman came to buy one there was a right pretty black one and a bay not quite so welllooking says the gentleman to gregory id fainer have the black so far as looks go but which is the better horse quoth gregory well master that hangs on what you mean to do with him if you look for him to make a pretty picture in your park and now and then to carry you four or five mile why hell do it as well as eer a one but if you want him for good stiff work youd best have the bay the blacks got no stay in him saith he so meg thats what i think of master clerehes got no stay in him i doubt hes but one of your fairweathered folks thatll side with truth when she steps bravely forth in her satin gown and her velvet slippers but when she comes in a threadbare gown and old clouted shoes then shes not for their company theres a many of that sort and you think master cleres one said margaret in a tone which sounded as if she did not think so im feared he is id not say it if there wasnt need but if you see bess afore i doand you are more like for you go into town oftenerdo drop a word to her to be prudent tell elizabeth foulkes to be prudent exclaimed margaret laughing nay that were carrying coals to newcastle well and the day may come for that if the pits there be used up meg have you neer noted that folks oftener come to trouble for want of their chief virtue than from overdoing it nay alice nor i dont think it neither well let be said alice shifting the basket to her other arm them that lives ll see it but what mean you touching mistress amy you said you were feared shed make trouble for bess ay i am but thats another matter weve faultfound enough for one even who be them two afore us what those bits of children why theyre two of jack johnsons of thorpe they look as if theyd got too much to carry said alice as they came up to the children they were now about half way to bentley the younger a boy of about six held one ear of a large jar full of meal and the other was carried by his sister whose apparent age was eight they were plodding slowly along as if afraid of spilling their meal for the jar was pretty full well cis thou hast there a load was margarets greeting the little girl turned her head to see who spoke but she only said gravely ay a very grave demure little maiden she seemed to be whither go you asked alice mount were going home said the small boy what a matter of five miles with that jar why youll drop in the road couldnt nobody have fetched it but you there wasnt nobody said the little boy and his sister looked up to say in her grave way you know mothers gone to heaven and who looks after you will looks after baby answered cissy demurely and i look after will and who looks after thee asked alice much amused im older than i look replied cissy drawing herself up but she was not big enough to go far im ninegoing in ten i can make porridge and clean the room and wash baby and wills learning to wash himself and then hell be off my hands it was irresistibly funny to hear this small mite talk like a woman for she was very small of her age and alice and margaret could not help laughing well but thou knowest thou canst not do a many things that must be done who takes care of you all i dare be bound thou does thy best but somebody there must be older than thee who is it now have you eer an aunt or a grandmother added margaret cissy looked up quietly into alices face god takes care of us she said father helps when his works done but when hes at work god has to do it all theres nobody but god alice and margaret looked at each other in astonishment poor little souls cried margaret oh but we arent said cissy rather more eagerly god looks after us you know hes sure to do it right father says so alice mount laid her hand softly on cissys head ay little maid god will do it right she said but maybe hed let me help too by nows and thens thou knowest the black bear at much bentleycorner of lane going down to thorpe yes cissy knew the black bear as her face showed well when thou gets to the black bear count three doors down the lane and thoult see a sign with a bell thats where i live thee rap at the door and my daughter shall go along with you to thorpe and help to carry the meal too maybe we can find you a sup of broth or milk while you rest you a bit oh thank you said cissy in her grownup way that will be good well come chapter three rose poor little souls repeated margaret thurston when the children were out of hearing alice mount looked back and saw the small pair still toiling slowly on the big jar between them it would not have been a large jar for her to carry but it was large and heavy too for such little things as these however will they get home said she nobody to look after them but god and father the moment she had said it her heart smote her was that not enough if the lord cared for these little ones did it matter who was against them how many unseen angels might there be on that road watching over the safety of the children and of that homely jar of meal for their sakes it was not the first time that angels had attended to springs of water and cakes baken on the coals no angel would dream of stopping to think whether such work degraded him it is only men who stoop low enough for that the highest work possible to men or angels is just doing the will of god and god was the father of these little ones what is their father asked alice mount johnson oh he is a labouring mana youngish man only fourandthirty his mistress died a matter of six months back and truly i know not how those bits of children have done since they have had god and father said alice well ive no doubt hes a good father answered margaret john johnson is as good a man as ever stepped ill say that for him and so was helen a rare good woman i knew her well when we were maids together those children have been well fetched up take my word for it it must have been a sad matter to lose such a wife said alice well what think you answered margaret dropping her voice agnes love told mejack loves wife that dwells on the heathyoull maybe know her ay i know her though not well ive known her ever since she was a yard long well she told me the even it happed came jack johnson to their house and when she oped the door she was fair feared of him he looked so strangehis face all white and such a glitter of his eyesshe marvelled what had taken him and says he agnes my helens gone gone oh dear says she ay shes gone thank god says he well agnes thought this right strange talk and says she jack johnson what can you mean never was a better woman than your helen and you thanking god youve lost her nay agnes could you think that says he im thanking god because now i shall never see her stand up on the waste by lexden road says he shes safe from that anguish for evermore and you know what that meant yes alice mount knew what that meantthat allusion to the waste ground by colchester town wall on the road to lexden where the citizens shot their rubbish and buried their dead animals or threw them unburied and burned their martyrs it was another way of saying what the voice from heaven had cried to the apostleblessed are the dead that die in the lord from henceforth its a marvel they havent done somewhat to them loves afore now said margaret after a minutes silence i thought they had replied alice wasnt john love up afore the sheriff once at any rate oh ay theyve had him twice oer dont you mind they gat them away in the night the last time and all his goods was taken to the queens use but now see hes come back and they let him alone theyve done all they mean to do i reckon god grant it said alice with a sigh meg i cannot forget last august twentytwo of us had up afore the bishop and we only escaped by the very skin of our teeth as saith job ay me i sometimes marvel if we did well or no when we writ our names to that submission truly neighbour so have i replied margaret rather bluntly i would not have set mine thereto i warrant you alice sighed heavily god knoweth we meant not to deny his truth said she and he looketh on the heart after that they were silent till they came to much bentley turning down the lane which led to thorpe they came in sight of a girl of twenty years sitting on a low stool at the door of the third cottage in the lane weaving worsted lace on a pillow with bobbins over the door hung a signboard bearing a bell painted blue the lacemaker was a smallbuilt girl not in any way remarkable to look at with smooth dark hair nicely kept and a rosy face with no beauty about it but with a bright kindhearted expression which was better than outside beauty if a person accustomed to read faces had been there he might perhaps have said that the small prominent chin and the firm setting of the lips suggested that rose allen occasionally had a will of her own the moment that rose saw who was coming she left her stool with a bright smile which lighted up all her face and carrying the stool in one hand and her lace pillow in the other disappeared within the house shes quick at her work yonder maid said margaret ay shes a good lass my rose was her mothers answer youll come in and sit a bit neighbour well thank you i dont mind if i doat any rate till them children comes up responded margaret with a little laugh will you have me while then ay and as long after as youve a mind said alice heartily leading the way into her cottage as margaret had a mile yet to walk for she lived midway between much bentley and thorpe she was glad of a rest in the kitchen they found rose very busy with a skillet over the fire there was no tea in those days so there was no putting on of the kettle and rose was preparing for supper a dish of boiled cabbage to which the only additions would be bread and cheese in reply to her mothers questions she said that her stepfather had been in but finding his wife not yet come from market he had said that he would step into the next neighbours until she came and rose was to call him when supper was ready william mount the second husband of alice was twenty years older than his wife their ages being sixtyone and fortyone he was a tall grey gravelooking mana field labourer like most of the dwellers in much bentley this was but a small place nestling at one corner of the large park of the earl of oxford the owner of all the property for some distance round of course he was the great man in the esteem of the much bentley people during the reign of edward the sixth when protestantism was in favour at court lord oxford had been a protestant like other people but also like many other people he was one of those of whom it has been well said that hes a slave who dare not be in the right with two or three lord oxford was a slave in this sensea slave to what other people said and thought about himand very sad slavery it is i would rather sweep a crossing than feel that i did not dare to say what i believed or disbelieved what i liked or did not like because other people would think it strange it is as bad as being in egyptian bondage yet there are a great many people quite contented to be slaves of this kind who have not half so much excuse as lord oxford if he went against the priests who then were masters of everything he was likely to lose his liberty and property if not his life while we may say any thing we like without need to be afraid it is not always an advantage to have a great deal to lose the poor labourers of much bentley who had next to no property at all and could only lose liberty and life were far braver than the earl whom they thought such a grand man and who carried a golden wand before the queen supper was over at the blue bell and margaret thurston was thinking about going home when a little faint rap came on the door of the cottage rose opened it and saw a big jar standing on the doorsill a little boy sitting beside it and an older girl leaning against the wall please were come said cissy chapter four on the way to thorpe please were come said cissy weve been a good while getting here but weoh it isnt you what isnt me said rose laughingfor people said me where it should have been i then as they do still i rather think it is me dont you yes but you are not she that spake to us on the road said cissy somebody told us to call here as we went down the lane and her daughter should go home with us and help us to carry the big jar perhaps youre the daughter well i guess i am answered rose wheres home its at the further end of thorpe all right come in and rest you and ill fetch a sup of something to do you good poor little white faces rose took a hand of each and led them forward mother here be two bits of maypoles said she for they be scarce fatter and two handfuls of snow for they be scarce rosierthat say you promised them that i should go home with them and bear their jar of meal so i did rose bring them in and let them warm themselves answered mrs mount give them a sup of broth or what we have to put a bit of life in them and at after thou shalt bear them company to thorpe poor little souls they have no mother and they say god looks after them only then i shall be in his company too said rose softly then dropping her voice that the children might not hear she added mother theres only that drop of broth you set aside for breakfast and its scarce enough for you and father both must i give them that alice mount thought a moment she had spoken before almost without thinking daughter she said if their father which is also ours had come with them visible to our eyes we should bring forth our best for him and he will look for us to do it for the little ones whose angels see his face ay fetch the broth rose perhaps cissy had overheard a few words for wheel the bowl of broth was put into her hands she said can you spare it didnt you want it for something else than us we can spare it little maid said alice with a smile sup it up added rose laying her hand on the childs shoulder and much good may it do thee then when you are both warmed and rested ill set forth with you cissy did not allow that to be long she drank her broth admonished will by a look to finish hisfor he was disposed to loiterand after sitting still for a few minutes rose and put down the bowl we return you many thanks she said in her prim little way and i think if you please we ought to go home father ll be back by the time we get there and i dont like to be away when he comes mother bade me not she said hed miss her worse if he didnt find me you see ive got to do for mother now both for father and the children alice mount thought it very funny to hear this little mite talking about the children as if she were not a child at all well tarry a minute till i tie on my hood said rose ill be ready before you can say this is the house that jack built what do you with the babe little maid when you go forth asked alice baby said cissy looking up oh we leave her with ursula felstede next door shes quite safe till we come back rose now came in from the inner room where she had been putting on her hood and mantle there were no bonnets then what women called bonnets in those days were close thick hoods made of silk velvet fur or woollen stuff of some sort nor had they either shawls or jacketsonly loose mantles for outdoor wear rose took up the jar of meal please i can carry it on one side said cissy rather eagerly thou mayest carry thyself said rose thats plenty i havent walked five miles today im a bit stronger than thou too little will had not needed telling that he was no longer wanted to carry the jar he was already off after wild flowers as if the past five miles had been as many yards though he had assured cissy at least a dozen times as they came along that he did not know how he was ever to get home and as they were entering bentley had declared himself unable to take another step cissy shook her small head with the air of a prophetess will shouldnt say such things said she he said he couldnt walk a bit furtherthat i should have to carry him as well as the jarand i dont know how i could unless id poured the meal out and put him in and hed never have gone im sure and now do but look at him after those buttercups he didnt mean to tell falsehoods said rose he was tired i dare say lads will be lads thou knowest oh dear i dont know how im to bring up these children to be good people said cissy as gravely as if she had been their grandmother ursula says children are great troubles and im sure its true if theres any place where will should be thats just where he always isnt and if theres one spot where he shouldnt be thats the place where you commonly find him baby cant walk yet so shes safe but whatever i shall do when she can im sure i dont know i cant be in all the places at once where two of them shouldnt be rose could not help laughing little maid she said kindly thy small shoulders will never hold the world nor even thy fathers cottage hast thou forgot what thou saidst not an halfhour gone that god takes care of you all oh yes he takes big care of us was cissys answer hell see that we have meat and clothes and so forth and that father gets work but hell hardly keep will and baby out of mischief will he isnt that too little for him the whole world is but a speck little cicely compared with him if he will humble himself to see thee and me at all i reckon he is as like to keep will out of mischief as to keep him alive it is the very greatness of god that he can attend to all the little things in the world at once they are all little things to him hast thou not heard that the lord jesus said the very hairs of our heads be numbered yea sir thomas read that one eve at ursulas sir thomas tye was the vicar of much bentley well said rose and isnt it of more importance to make will a good lad than to know how many hairs hes got on his head wouldnt thy father think so for sure he would said cissy earnestly and isnt god thy father just as rose asked that a tall dark figure turned out of a lane they were passing and joined them it was growing dusk but rose recognised the vicar of whom they had just been speaking most priests were called sir in those days christ bless you my children said the vicar both rose and cissy made low courtesies for great respect was then paid to a clergyman they called them priests for very few could read the bible which tells us that the only priest is our lord jesus christ a priest does not mean the same thing as a clergyman though too many people thoughtlessly speak as if it did a priest is a man who offers a sacrifice of some living thing to god so as jesus christ who offered himself is our sacrifice and there can never be any other there cannot be any priests now there are a great many texts which tell us this but i will only mention one which you can look out in your bibles and learn by heart the tenth verse of the tenth chapter of the epistle to the hebrews it is easy to remember two tens cissy was a little frightened when she saw that sir thomas walked on with them but rose marched on as if she did not care whether he came or not for about a year after queen marys accession sir thomas had come pretty regularly to the prayermeetings which were held sometimes at the blue bell and sometimes at ursula felstedes at thorpe and also sometimes at john loves on the heath he often read the bible to them and gave them little sermons and seemed as kind and pleasant as possible but when queen mary had been about a year on the throne and it could be plainly seen which way things were goingthat is that she would try to bring back the popish religion which her brother had cast offsir thomas began to come less often he found it too far to john loves and to thorpe and whenever the meeting was at the blue bell which was only a few hundred yards from the vicaragewell it certainly was odd that sir thomas was always poorly on that night still nobody liked to think that he was making believe but alice mount said so openly and rose had heard her chapter five in difficulties cissy johnson was not old enough to understand all the reasons why her father distrusted the priest but she knew well that father didnt like him and like the dutiful little girl she was she was resolved not to make a friend of any one whom her father disliked for she knew that he might have good reasons which she could not understand but cissy had been taught to be civil to everybody and respectful to her betters lessons of which a little more would not hurt some folks in the present day people make a great mistake who think that you cannot both be respectful to others and independent for yourself the bible teaches us to do both being in this state of mind cissy was decidedly pleased to see her father coming up from the other end of the lane oh heres father she said to rose and little will ran on joyfully to meet him well my lad was johnsons greeting to his boy so thou and cissy have got back its a right long way for such as thou little will suddenly remembered that he was exceedingly tired and said so thoud better go to bed said her father as they came up with the girls well cis who hast thou picked upim right thankful to you he added looking at rose for giving my little maid a helping hand its a long way for such little ones all the way from the heath and a heavy load for little arms and im main thankful will you come in a bit and rest you he said to rose but rose declined for she knew her mother would expect her to come back at once she kissed cissy and told her whenever she had a load to carry either way to be sure she looked in at the blue bell when rose would help her if she possibly could and giving the jar to johnson she bade him goodnight and turned back up the lane sir thomas had walked on as rose supposed at any rate he was not to be seen she went nearly a mile without seeing any one until margaret thurstons cottage came in sight as rose began to go a little more slowly she heard footsteps behind her and the next minute she was joinedto her surpriseby the priest my daughter he said in a soft kind voice i think thou art rose allen rose dropped a courtesy and said she was i have been wishful to speak with some of thy fathers household said sir thomas in the same gentle way so that i am fain to meet thee forth this even tell me my child is there illness in the house or no rose breathed quickly she guessed pretty well what was coming no father she answered we are all in good health god be thanked for that same truly i am glad to hear thee so speak my daughter and in especial that thou rememberest to thank god but wherefore then being in good health have ye not come to give thanks to god in his own house these eight sundays past ye have been regular aforetime since ye were back from the bishops court surely it is not truei do hope and trust it is not true that ye be slipping yet again into your past evil ways of ill opinions and presumptuous sin the reason why the mounts had not been to church was because the services were such as they could no longer join in queen mary had brought back the popish mass and all the images which king edward had done away with so that to go to church was not to worship god but to worship idols and so terrible was the persecution mary had allowed to be set up that the penalty for refusing to do this was to be burnt to death for what she called heresy it was a terrible position for a young girl in which rose allen stood that night this man not only held her life in his hands but also those of her mother and her stepfather if he chose to inform against them the end of it might be death by fire for one moment rose was silent during which she cried silently but most earnestly to god for wisdom and couragewisdom to keep her from saying what might bring them into needless danger and courage to stand true and firm to god and his truth might i be so bold as to pray you father she said at last to ask at my mother the cause of such absence from mass you wot i am but a young maid and under direction of mine elders sir thomas tye smiled to himself he thought rose a very cautious prudent girl who did not want to bring herself into trouble so be it my daughter said he in the same gentle way doubtless it was by direction of thine elders that then wert absent aforetime ere ye were had up to the bishop he meant it as a question by which he hoped to entangle poor rose she was wise enough not to answer but to let it pass as if he were merely giving his own opinion about which she did not wish to say anything crafty girl thought sir thomas then he said aloudthe festival of our lady cometh on apace ye will surely have some little present for our blessed lady the virgin mary was then called our lady we be but poor folks said rose truly i know ye be poor folks was the priests reply yet even poor folks do oft contrive to pleasure their friends by some little present and if ye might bring no more than an handful of daisies from the field yet is our lady so gracious that she will deign to accept even so small an offering ye need not be emptyhanded i trust we shall do our duty said poor rose in great perplexity father i cry you mercy if i stay me here for i would fain speak with the woman of this cot so do my daughter was the soft reply and i will call here belike for i do desire to speak with thurston poor rose was at her wits end her little manoeuvre had not succeeded as she hoped she wanted to be rid of the unwelcome company of the priest and now it seemed as if by calling on margaret thurston instead of going straight home she would only get more of it however she must do it now she had nothing particular to say to margaret whom she had already seen that day though her mother had said after margaret was gone that she wished she had told her something and rose meant to use this remark as furnishing an excuse she tapped lifted the latch and went in the priest following john thurston sat by the fire cutting clothespegs margaret was ironing clothes thurston rose when he saw the priest and both received him reverently feeling that her best chance of escaping the priest was to proceed immediately rose drew margaret aside and told her what her mother had said but margaret who was rather fond of talking had something to say too and the precious minutes slid by meanwhile the priest and thurston went on with their conversation and at last rose saying she really could not stay any longer bade them goodbye and went out but just as margaret was opening the door to let her out sir thomas said a few words in reply to thurston which rose could not but overhear oh master clere is a worthy man enough if he hath gone somewhat astray in times past that shall now be amended mistress cicely too is an honest woman that wist how to do her duty all shall be well there i trust john thurston that thou shalt show thyself as wise and well ruled as he rose heard no more she passed out into the night and ran nearly all the way home why rose how breathless art thou maid said the other when she came in well i may mother cried rose there is evil ahead for us and that not a little father tye overtook me as i came back and would know of me why we had not been to mass these eight sundays and i staved him off and prayed him to ask of you and mother he saith master clere the draper though he have gone somewhat astray is now returned to his duty and you wot what that meaneth and i am feared for us and bessy too the good lord have mercy on us said alice mount amen responded william mount gravely but it had best be such mercy as he will alice not such as we would on one matter i am resolvedi will sign no more submissions i fear we have done it once too often o father im so fain to hear you say it cried rose art thou so daughter he answered a little sadly have a care thy quick tongue bring thee not into more trouble than need be child to refuse that submission may mean a fiery death and we may notwe must notshrink from facing death for him who passed through death for us lord grant us thy grace to stand true and william mount stood up with uncovered head and looked up as we all do instinctively when we speak to him who dwelleth in the heavens who hath abolished death was the soft response of alice chapter six rose asks a favour youll not find no better search all colchester through said mrs clere to a fat woman who did not look particularly amiable holding up some worsted florence drab with a red stripe well im not so sure replied the crosslooking customer tomkins now in wye street they showed me some kendal frieze thicker nor that and a halfpenny less by the yard tomkins said mrs clere in a tone not at all flattering to the despised tomkins why if that man knows a kendal frieze from a piece of black satin its all you can look for never bred up to the business he wasnt and his wifes a poor goodfornought that wouldnt know which end of the broom to sweep with and his daughters idle gossiping hussies thatll drive their husbands wild one o these days dont talk to me about tomkins and mrs clere turned over the piece of florence as roughly as if it had been tomkins instead of itself it was right good frieze said the customer doubtfully then youd better go and buy it snapped mrs clere whom something seemed to have put out that morning for she was generally bettertempered than that well but im not so sure repeated the customer its a good step to wye street and ive lost a bit o time already if youll take tenpence the ell you may cut me off twelve tenpence the fiddlesticks said mrs clere pushing the piece of worsted to one side ill not take a farthing under the shilling if you ask me while next week you can just go to tomkins and if you dont find youve got to darn his worthless frieze afore youve done making it up why my name isnt bridget clere thats all now rose allen whats wanting ant please you mistress clere black serge for a girdle suit yourself answered mistress clere giving three pieces of serge which were lying on the counter a push towards rose well audrey wastborowe what are you standing there for bent you agoing to that tomkins well nay i dont think i be if youll let me have that stuff at elevenpence the ell come now do ee mistress clere im not to be coaxed i tell you shilling an ell and not a bit under well then i guess i shall be forced to pay it but youll give me good measure ill give you as many ells as you give me shillings and neither more nor less twelve very good mrs clere measured off the florence tied it up received the twelve shillings which audrey drew from her pocket as slowly as possible perhaps fancying that mrs clere might relent and threw it into the till as if the coins were severely to blame for something audrey took up her purchase and went out whatevers come to mistress clere asked a young woman who stood next to rose waiting to be served she and audrey wastborowes changed tempers this morrow somethings vexed her said rose im sorry for i want to ask her a favour when ive done my business shes not in a mood for favourgranting said the young woman thats plain youd better let be while shes come round nay i cant let be whispered rose in answer now or never is it well i wish you well through it mistress clere who had been serving another customer with an ounce of threadthere were no reels of thread in those days it was only sold in skeins or large hanksnow came to rose and the other girl goodmorrow gillian mildmay whats wanting goodmorrow mistress clere my mother bade me ask if you had a fine marble cloth about five shillings the ell for a bettermost gown for her mrs clere spoke a little less crossly but with a weary air marbled cloths not so much worn as it was she said but i have a fair piece that may serve your turn its more nor that though i couldnt let it go under five and eightpence motherll want it better cheap than that said gillian i think thatll not serve her mistress clere but i want a pair of tawny sleeves ant like you wrought with needlework sleeves at this time were not a part of the dress but were buttoned in as the wearer chose to have them gillian found these to suit her paid for them and went away mrs clere turned to rose now then do be hasteful rose allen im that weary you seem so in truth mistress clere im feared youve been overwrought said rose in a sympathising tone overwrought ay body and soul too answered mrs clere softening a little in response to roses tone well folks know their own troubles best i reckon and its no good harrying other folks with them what priced serge would you have about eighteenpence have you some one and eightpence and one and fourpence the oneandfourpennys right good youll find thank you ill take the oneandfourpenny itll be quite good enough for me well i was going to ask you a favour mistress clere but seeing you look so oerwrought i have no mind to it oh its all in the days work what would you asked mrs clere rather more graciously well i scarce like to tell you but i was meaning to ask you the kindness if youd give leave for bessy foulkes to pass next saints day afternoon with us if you could spare her at least i can spare bessy foulkes uncommon well said mrs clere irascibly why mistress clere has bessy rose began in an astonished tone mrs cleres servant elizabeth foulkes was her dearest friend youd best give mistress elizabeth foulkes the go by rose allen shes a cantankerous illbeseen hussy and no good company for you shell learn you to do as ill as herself if you look not out but what has bessy done gone into schoolkeeping said mrs clere sarcastically expects her betters to go and learn their hornbook of her set herself up to tell all the world their duty and knows it a sight better than they do thats what mistress elizabeths done and doing ungrateful hussy i couldnt have thought it said rose in a tone of great surprise mixed with disappointment bessys always been so good a maid good dont i tell you shes better than every body else tell you what rose allen being goods all very well but for a young maid to stick herself up to be better than her neighbours ll never pay i dont hold with such doings if bessd be content to be the best cook or the best cleaner in colchester id never say nought to her but shes not content shed fain be the best priest and the best schoolmaster too and that isnt her work preaching isnt dressing meat and scouring pans and making beds is what shes called to and not lecturing folks at market cross has bessy been preaching at the market cross asked rose in genuine horror for she took mrs cleres statements literally thats not while tomorrow said mrs clere in the same sarcastic tone shes giving the lecture at home first to get perfect i promise you im just harried out of my life what with one thing and another well id like to speak with bessy if i might said rose in some perplexity weve always been friends bessy and me and maybe shed listen to meor any ways to mother could you kindly give leave for her to come mistress clere you may have her and keep her for all the good she is to me answered the clothiers wife moving away mind she doesnt give you the malady rose allen thats all i say its a fair infection going about and the great doctors up to london ll have to come down and look to itsee if they dont oh my lady can go if it like hershes so grand now o days im very nigh afeared of her goodmorrow and rose went out with her parcel lost in wonder as to what could be the matterfirst with mistress clere and then with her friend elizabeth chapter seven the clouds begin to gather methinks that becomes me better what sayest thou bess two girls were standing in an upper room of nicholas cleres house and the younger asked this question of the elder the elder girl was tall of stately carriage and graceful mien with a very beautiful face but her whole aspect showed that she thought nothing about herself and never troubled her head to think whether she was pretty or ugly the younger who was about seventeen was not nearly so handsome but she would have been pleasant enough to look at if it had not been for a silly simper and a look of intensely satisfied vanity which quite spoiled any prettiness that she might have had she had just fastened a pair of earrings into her ears and she was turning her head from one side to the other before the mirror as she asked her companions opinion of the ornaments there are some savagesin polynesia i thinkwho decorate themselves by thrusting a wooden stick through their lips to our european taste they look hideous honestly i cannot see that they who make holes in their lips in order to ornament themselves are any worse at all than they who make holes in their ears for the same purpose the one is just as thorough barbarism as the other when amy clere thus appealed to her to express an opinion elizabeth foulkes looked up from her sewing and gave it no mistress amy i do scarce think it why wouldst thou better love these yellow ones to speak truth mistress amy i think you look best without either dear heart to hear the maid wouldst not thou fain have a pair bess nay mistress amy that would i not wherefore because as methinks such tawdry gewgaws be unworthy a christian profession if you desire my thought thereon mistress amy you have it now forsooth and thou mightest have kept it for all i want of it tawdry gewgaws indeed i tell thee bess these be three shillings the pair they may be i would not pay three halfpence for them bess tis ten thousand pities thou art not a nun i would rather be what i am mistress i rather not be neither said amy flippantly in those days they always put two nots together when they meant to speak strongly they did not see as we do now that the one contradicts the other well mistress amy you have no need said elizabeth quietly and as to christian professionwhy bess every lady in the land wears earrings yea up to the queens grace herself prithee who art thou to set thee up for better than all the ladies in england talking of christian profession as though thou wert a priest i am mistress cleres servantmaid but i set not myself up to be better than any so far as i know thee hold thy peace whether goeth this lace or the wide one best with my blue kirtle the narrower i would say mistress amy shall you have need of me this next wednesday afternoon why whats like to happen wednesday afternoon saint chrysostoms like to happen ant please you and mistress granted me free leave to visit a friend if so be you lacked me not what fashion of a friend trow a jolly one elizabeth looked a little amused scarce after your fashion mistress amy what as sad and sober as thyself wellnigh then ill not go with thee i mean to spend saint chrysostom with mary boswell and lucy cheyne and their friends and i promise thee we shall not have no sadness nor sedateness in the company thats very like answered elizabeth as merry as crickets we shall be dost not long to come withal i were liefer to visit rose if it liked you what a shame to call a sad maid by so fair a name oh thou canst go for all me thy companys never so jolly i need shed tears to lose it and with this rather uncomplimentary remark amy left the room with the blue earrings in her ears and the yellow ones in her hand elizabeth waited till her piece of work was finished then folding it up and putting it away in a drawer she ran down to prepare suppera task wherein amy did not offer to help her though it was usual then for the mistress of the house and her daughters to assist in the cooking about two oclock on the afternoon of the following wednesday a tap on the door of the blue bell called rose to open it and she greeted her friend elizabeth with much pleasure rose had finished her share of the household work until supper and she took her lace pillow and sat down in the window elizabeth drew from her pocket a couple of nightcaps and both girls set to work mrs mount was sewing also in the chimneycorner and how be matters in colchester bess at this present the clouds be gathering for rain or i mistake said elizabeth gravely you know the thing i mean alice mount had put down her work and she looked grave too bess you never mean we shall have last augusts doings oer again that do i alice and more i was last night at the kings head where you know they of our doctrine be wont to meet and master pulleyne was there that good man that was sometime chaplain to my ladys grace of suffolk he mostly puts up at the kings head when he cometh to town and quoth he there shall shortly be another search made for gospel booksay and gospellers belike and they be not like to scape so well as they did last year and john love saithhe was there john love of the heath you know himwell he saith he heard master simnel the bailiff to swear that the great doctors of colchester should find it warm work ere long theres an ill time coming friends take you heed the good lord be our aid if so be said alice but what shall master clere do bessy asked rose he hath ever been a gospeller he hath borne the name of one rose god knoweth if he be true im feared elizabeth stopped suddenly that hell not be staunch said alice he is my master and i will say no more alice but this may i say theres many in colchester shall bear faggots ere they burn ay and all over england belike those who recanted had to carry a faggot as if owning themselves worthy to be burned thourt right there bess the lord deliver us some thinketh we have been too bold of late you see john love coming home again and nothing done to him made folks think the worst was over isnt it then said rose master benold says he misdoubts if tis well begun master benold the chandler of east hillay he was at the kings head last night so was old mistress silverside and mistress ewring the millers wife and johnsonthey call him alegardown at thorpe call him alegar what on earth for asked rose indignantly elizabeth laughed well they say hes so sour hell not dance nor sing idle songs nor play quoits and bowls but loveth better to sit at home and read so they call him alegar alegar is malt vinegar the word vinegar was then used only of white wine vinegar hes not a bit sour cried rose ive seen him with his little lad and lass and right good to them he was its a shame to call folks names that dont fit them nay i dont call him no names but other folks do did you know his wife that died six months gone no but ive heard her well spoken of then youve heard truth those children lost a deal when they lost her and so did poor johnson well hell never see her burn thats one good thing ay said alice and thats what he said himself when she died well god help us to stand firm have you been asked any questions bess not yet said elizabeth quietly but i look for it every day have you not i but our rose here foregathered with the priest one even of late and he was set to know why we came not to church these eight weeks past she parried his darts right well but i look to hear more thereabout chapter eight not a bit afeard alice mount had only just spoken when the latch was lifted by margaret thurston pray you let me come in and get my breath said she im that frighted i can scarce stand come in neighbour and welcome replied alice and rose set a chair for margaret what ails you is there a mad bull about or what mad bull indeed a mad bulls no great shakes not to him any way well id as soon not meet one in our lane said alice but whos him hims the priest be sure met me up at top o the lane he did and he must needs turn him round and walk by me i wellnigh cracked my skull trying to think of some excuse to be rid of him but no such luck for me on he came till we reached hither and then i could bear no more and i said i had to see you he said he went about to see you afore long but he wouldnt come in today so on he marched and right thankful was i be sure eh the things he asked me ive not been so hauled oer the coals this year out but what about marry gramercy wherefore i came not to mass and why master didnt and what i believed and didnt believe and wherefore i did this and didnt do that till i warrant you afore he left off i was that moithered i couldnt have told what i did believe i got so muggy i only knew one thing under the sun and that was that id have given my best gown for to be rid of him well you got free without your best gown margaret said rose may be i have but i feel as if id left all my wits behind me in the lane or mayhap in the priests pocket whatever would the man be at we pay our dues to the church and were honest peaceable folks if it serve us better to read our bible at home rather than go look at him hocuspocussing in the church cant he let us be truly if hed give us something when we came thered be some reason for finding fault nobody need beg me to go to church when theres sermon but what earthly good can it do any mortal man to stare at a yellow cross on father tyes back and what good do you ever get beyond it sermons have always been a protestant institution in this sense that the more pure and scriptural the church has been the more sermons there have generally been while whenever the clergy have taken up with foolish ceremonies and have departed from the bible they have tried to do away with preaching and of course when very few people could read their bibles there was more need of preaching than there is now when nearly everybody can read very very few poor people could read a word in it was put down as something remarkable in the case of cissys father that he could read a little saint paul says that it pleased god by preaching to save them that believe corinthians one but he never says by hearing music or by looking at flowers or candles or embroidered crosses those things can only amuse our eyes and ears they will never do our souls any good how can they the only thing that will do good to our souls is to get to know god better and flowers candles music and embroidery cannot teach us anything about god what laugh you at rose asked elizabeth only margarets notion that it could do no man good to stare at the cross on father tyes back said rose trying to recover her gravity well the only animal made with a cross on his back is an ass said margaret and one would think a man should be better than an ass but if his chief business be to make himself look like one i dont see that he is so much better this amused rose exceedingly elizabeth foulkes though the same age as rose was naturally of a graver turn of mind and she only smiled well if i havent forgot all i was charged with id better give my message said margaret but father tyes wellnigh shook all my wits out of my head robin purcas came by this morrow and he lifted the latch and gave me a word from master benold that i was to carry on for hes got a job of work at saint osyth and wont be back while fridaysaith he on friday even master pulleyne and the scots priest that were chaplains to my lady of suffolk shall be at the kings head and all of our doctrine that will come to hear shall be welcome will you go verily that will i replied alice heartily you see if father tye should stir up the embers and get all alight again maybe we shallnt have so many more sermons afterward so wed best get our good things while we can ay there may be a famine of hearing the words of the lord said alice gravely god avert the same if his will is johnson he says hes right sure master simnel means to start of his inquirations alice think you you could stand firm alice mount sighed and half shook her head i didnt stand over firm last august margaret said she and only the lord knows how ive since repented it if hell keep me truebut im feared of myself well do you know im not a bit feared its true i wasnt tried in august when you were but if i had been be sure id never have signed that submission that you did i wouldnt so maybe not neighbour answered alice meekly i was weak now mother said rose who could bear no longer you know you stood forth best of anybody there it was father that won her to sign margaret she never would have done it if shed been left to herself i know she wouldnt then what didst thou sign for rose was the reply rose went the colour of her name her mother came at once to her help as rose had just done to hers why she signed because we did like a dutiful maid as she is alway and it was our faults margaret may god forgive us well but after all it wasnt so very ill was it asked margaret rather inconsistently with what she had said before but people are not always consistent by any means did you promise anything monstrous wrong i thought it was only to live as became good christians and faithful subjects nay meg it was more than that we promised right solemnly to submit us to the church in all matters and specially in this that we did believe the sacrament to be christs body according to his words why so do we all believe said margaret according to his words have you forgot the tale father tye did once tell us at the kings head of my lady elizabeth the queens sister that when she was asked what she did believe touching the sacrament she made this answer christ was the word that spake it he took the bread and brake it and what that word did make it that i believe and take it that was a bit crafty methinks said rose i love not such shifts i would rather speak out my mind plainly ay but if you speak too plainly you be like to find you in the wrong place answered margaret that would not be the wrong place wherein truth set me was roses earnest answer that were never the wrong place wherein god should be my company and if the fire were too warm for my weakness to bear the holy angels should maybe fan me with their wings till i came to the covert of his tabernacle well thats all proper pretty said margaret and like a book as ever the parson could talk but i tell thee what rose allen thoult sing another tune if ever thou come to smithfield see if thou doesnt and rose answered the word that god putteth in my mouth that will i speak chapter nine come to the preaching dorothy denny art thou never going to set that kettle on oh deary me a body never has a bit of peace thats true enough of me but its right false of thee thous nought but peace all day long for thou never puts thyself out i dare be bounden if the queens grace and all her noble company were to sup in this kitchen at five o the clock i should come in and find never a kettle nor a pan on at the threequarter past if thy uncle wasnt a sloth and thine aunt a snail im not hostess of the kings head at colchester thourt no more worth thy saltnay salt forsooth thourt not worth the water salts one and fourpence the raser and thats a deal too much to give for thee now set me the kettle on and then teem out that rubbish in the yard and run to the nests to see if the hens have laid dont be all day and night about it run dolleh deary me i might as well have said crawl there she goes with the lead on her heels if these maids bent enough to drive an honest woman crazy my names not philippa wade and mistress wade began to put things tidy in the kitchen with a promptitude and celerity which dorothy denny certainly did not seem likely to imitate she swept up the hearth set a chair before the table fresh sanded the floor and arranged the forms in rows before dorothy reappeared carefully carrying something in her apron why thou doesnt mean to say thoust done already inquired her mistress sarcastically thoust been all across the yard while ive done no more than sand the floor and side things for the gathering whats that in thine apron one of the queens majestys jewels its an egg mistress an egg an egg demanded mrs wade with a burst of hearty laughter for she laughed as she did everything else with all her might is that all thoust got by thy journey marry but i would have tarried another day and fetched two poor father pulleyne so hes but to have one egg to his supper if them hens have laid no more im a dutchwoman see thou take this duster and dust the table and forms and ill go and search for eggs if ever a mortal woman mistress wade was in the yard before she got further and dorothy was left to imagine the end of the sentence before that leisurely young woman had finished dusting the first form the landlady reappeared with an apronful of eggs i marvel whither thou wentest for thy egg doll here be eighteen thou leftest for me to gather its no good to bid thee be shamed for thou dost not know how i should in thy place ill warrant thee verily i do marvel whatever the worlds acoming to before mrs wade had done more than empty her apron carefully of the eggs a soft rap came on the door and she called out come within please i cant reach said a little voice open the door doll said mrs wade and in came three childrena girl of nine a boy of six and a baby in the arms of the former well what are you after come for skim milk ive none this even no please please were come to the preaching youre come to the preaching why youre only as big as mice the lot of you whence come you please weve come from thorpe youve come from thorpe you poor little bits of things all that way cried mrs wade whose heart was as large as her tongue was ready why i do believe youre cicely johnson you are so grown i didnt know you at firstand yet youre no bigger than a mouse as i told you have you had any supper no mistress please we dont have supper only now and then we shall do very well indeed if we may stay for the preaching youll sit down there and eat some bread and milk before youre an hour older poor little whitefaced mortals as ever i did see but youve never carried that child all the way from thorpedoll didst ever see such children theyre proper peaked mistress said dorothy see note oh no answered the truthloving cissy i only carried her from the gate neighbour ursula she bare her all the way thourt an honest lass said mrs wade patting cissy on the head there eat that and she put a large slice of bread into the hand of both will and cissy setting a goodly bowl of milk on the table between them thats good commented will attacking the milkbowl immediately cissy held him back and looked up into mrs wades kindly and capacious face but please we havent got any money she said anxiously marry come up to think id take money from such bits of things as you i want no money child the good lord he pays such bills as yours and what set you coming to the preaching did your father bid you see note father likes us to come said cissy when her thanks had been properly expressed but he didnt bid usnot tonight mother she said we must always come if we could im feared baby wont understand much but will and me well try i should think not replied mrs wade laughing why if you and will can understand aught thatll be as much as need be looked for how much know you about it please we know about the lord jesus said cissy putting her hands together as if she were going to say her prayers we know that he died on the cross for us so that we should not be punished for our sins and he sends the holy ghost to make us good and the bible which is gods word and we mustnt let anybody take it away from us well if you know that much in your little hearts youll do said the landlady theres many a poor heathen doesnt know half as much as that ay child you shall bide for the preaching if you want but youre too soon yet youve come afore the parson eat your bread and milk up and bide where you are thats a snug little corner for you where youll be warm and safe is father coming too and neighbour ursula yes theyre both coming presently said cissy the next arrival was that of two gentlemen the preacher and a friend after this people began to drop in at first by twos and threes and as the time drew near with more rapidity the mounts and rose allen came early elizabeth foulkes was late for she had hard work to get away at all last of anybody was margaret thurston and with her a tall stronglooking man who was john thurston her husband john johnson found out the corner where his children were and made his way to them but rose allen had been before him and was seated next to cissy holding the little hand in hers on the other side of little will sat an old lady with grey hair and a very sweet kind face she was mrs silverside the widow of a priest by her was mrs ewring the millers wife who was a little deaf and wanted to get near the preacher when the room was full mr pulleyne who was to preach that evening rose and came forward to the table and gave out the fortysecond psalm they had no hymnbooks as we have there were just a few hymns generally bound up at the end of the prayerbook which had been written during the reign of good king edward the sixth but hardly any english hymns existed at all then they had one collection of metrical psalms that of sternhold and hopkins of which we never sing any now except the hundredththat version known to every one beginning all people that on earth do dwell the psalms they sang then sound strange to us now but we must remember they did not sound at all strange to those who sang them here are two verses of the fortysecond like as the hart doth pant and bray the wellsprings to obtain so doth my soul desire alway with thee lord to remain my soul doth thirst and would draw near the living god of might oh when shall i come and appear in presence of his sight the tears all times are my repast which from mine eyes do slide whilst wicked men cry out so fast where now is god thy guide alas what grief is it to think the freedom once i had therefore my soul as at pits brink most heavy is and sad note peaked very thin and pinchedlooking note come up an exclamation of surprise then often used chapter ten brought out to be brought in loud and full rang the volume of voices in the kitchen of the kings head at colchester that winter evening they did not stand up in silence and let a choir do it for them while they listened to it as they might to a german band and with as little personal concern when mens hearts are warm with patriotism or overflowing with loyalty they dont want somebody else to sing rule britannia or god save the queen the very enjoyment lies in doing it themselves nobody would dream of paying another person to go to a party or to see a royal procession for him well then when we prefer to keep silent and hear somebody sing gods praises instead of doing it ourselves what can it mean except that our hearts are not warm with love and overflowing with thankfulness as they ought to be and cold hearts are not the stuff that makes martyrs there was plenty of martyr material in the kings head kitchen that nightfrom old agnes silverside to little cissy johnson from the learned priest mr pulleyne to many poor men and women who did not know their letters they were not afraid of what people would say nor even of what people might do and yet they knew well that it was possible and even likely that very terrible things might be done to them their feeling waswell let them be done if that be the best way i can glorify god let them be done if it be the way in which i can show that i love jesus christ let them be done if by suffering with him i can win a place nearer to him and send a thrill of happiness to the divine and human heart of the saviour who paid his hearts blood to ransom me so the hymn was not at all too long for them though it had fifteen verses and the sermon was not too long though it lasted an hour and a half when people have to risk their lives to hear a sermon is not the time when they cry out to have sermons cut shorter they very well knew that before another meeting took place at the kings head some and perhaps all of them might be summoned to give up liberty and life for the love of the lord jesus mr pulleyne took for his text a few words in the rd verse of the sixth chapter of deuteronomy he brought us out from thence that he might bring us in he said to the people he brought us outwho brought us god our maker god that loved the world he brought us outwho be we poor vile wicked sinners worms of the earth things that he could have crushed easier than i can crush a moth from whence from egypt the house of bondage from sin self satanthe only three evil things there be whereby i mean necessarily inwardly utterly evil thence he brought us out friends we must come out of egypt out from bondage out of these three ill things sin and self and satan god will have us out he will not suffer us to tarry in that land and if we slack hesitate feel reluctant to come out he will drive us sharp thence let us come out quick and willingly there is nothing we need sorrow to leave behind only the taskmaster satan and the great monster sin and the slime of the river wherein he lieth hid self he will have at us with his ugly jaws and bite our souls in twain if we have not a care let us run fast from this land where we leave behind such evil things but see there is more than this god had an intent in thus driving us forth he did not bring us out and leave us there nay he brought us out that he might bring us in in where into the holy land that floweth with milk and honey the fair land where nothing shall enter that defileth the safe land where in all the holy mountain nothing shall hurt nor destroy his own land where he hath his throne and his temple and is king and father of them that dwell therein look you is not this a good land are you not ready to go and dwell therein do not the clusters of its grapesthe hearing of its gloriesmake your mouths water see what you shall exchange for a cruel taskmaster a loving father for a dread monster an holy city for the base and ugly slime of the river the fair paving of the golden streets and the soft waving of the leaves of the tree of life and the sweet melody of angel harps truly i think this good barter if a man were to exchange a dead rat for a newstruck royal see note men would say he had well traded he had bettered himself he was a successful merchant lo here is worse than a dead rat and better than all the royals in the kings mint will ye not come and trade now friends ye must not misconceive me as though i did mean that men could buy heaven by their own works nay heaven and salvation be free giftsthe glorious gifts of a glorious god and worthy of the giver but when such gifts are set before you but for the asking is it too much that ye should rise out of the mire and come he brought them out that he might bring them in he left them not in the desert to find their own way to the holy land marry should they ever have come there i trow not nay no more than a babe of a month old if ye set him down at bothals gate could find his way to the moot hall but he dealt not with them thus he left them not to find their own way he brought them he led them he showed them where to plant their feet first one step then another as mothers do to a child when he learneth first to walk as a nurse cherisheth her children the apostle saith he dealt with his converts and the lord useth yet tenderer image for as a mother comforteth her babe saith he will i comfort you yea he bids the prophet esaias to learn them line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a littlelook you how careful is god of his nursechildren feed my lambs saith he and lambs may not nibble so hard as sheep they take not so full a mouthful they love the short grass that is sweet and easily cropped we be all lambs afore we be sheep sheep lack much shepherding but lambs yet more both be silly things apt to stray away and the wolf catcheth them with little trouble now if a dog be lost he shall soon find his way back but a lamb and a babe if they be lost they are utterly lost they can never find the way look you the lord likeneth his people to lambs and babes these silly things that be continually lost and have no wit to find the way so brethren he finds the way he goeth after that which is lost until he find it first he finds the poor silly lamb and then he leadeth it in the way wherein it shall go he brings us in to the fair green pastures and by the still watersbrings us in to the safe haven where the little boats lie at restbrings us in to the kings banquethall where the feast is spread and the king himself holdeth forth hands of welcome he stretched not forth the cold sceptre he giveth his own handthat hand that was pierced for our sins what say i nay he shall gird himself and shall come forth and serve themso great honour shall they attain which serve god as to have him serve them now brethren is this not a fair lot that god appointeth for his people a king to their guide and a throne to their bed and angels to their servingmenverily these be folks of much distinction that be so served but look you there is one little point we may not missif we suffer we shall reign there is the desert to be passed there is the jordan to be forded there is the cross to bear for the master that bare the cross for us yea we shall best bear our cross by looking well and oft on his cross ah brethren he standeth close beside he hath borne it all he knoweth where the nails run and in what manner they hurt yet a little patience poor suffering soul yet a little courage yet a little stumbling over the rough stones of the wilderness and then the golden city and the royal banquethall and the king that brought us out despite all the egyptians that brought us in despite all the dangers of the desertthe king our shield and guide and father shall come forth and serve us old agnes silverside the priests widow sat with her hands clasped and her eyes fixed on the preacher as he ended she laid her hand upon rose allens my maid she said never mind the wilderness the stones be sharp and the sun scorching and the thirst sore but one sight of the king in the golden city shall make up for all note ten shillings this was then the largest coin made chapter eleven unexpected lodgings now then who goes home cried the cheerful voice of mrs wade when the sermon was over you mistress benoldyou alice

but if youd kindly allow it id fain go up too and have a chat with rose my mistress gave me leave for another hour yet hie thee up good maid and so do replied mrs wade cheerily taking up a candlestick to light mr pulleyne to the room prepared for him where as she knew from past experience he was very likely to sit at study till far into the night dorothy lighted another candle and offered it to rose see youll lack a light said she nay not to find our tongues answered rose smiling ah but to put yon children abed look you in the closet rose as you go into the loft and youll see a mattress and a roll of blankets with a canvas coverlet that shall serve them youll turn in with me all right doll i thank you you look weary doll said elizabeth weary eh but if you dwelt with our mistress youd

many a time whether the angels ll fly fast enough to serve her when she gets to heaven marry come up but theyll have to step out if they do rose laughed and led the way upstairs where she had been several times before inns at that time were built like continental country inns are now round a square space with a garden inside and a high archway for the entrance so high that a load of hay could pass underneath there were no inside stairs but a flight led up to the second storey from the courtyard and a balcony running all round the house gave access to the bedrooms rose however went into none of the rooms but made her way to one corner where a second steep flight of stairs ran straight up between the walls these the girls mounted and at the top entered a low door which led into a large low room lighted by a skylight and occupied by little furniture at the further end was a goodsized bed covered with a patchwork quilt but without any hangingsthe absence of these indicating either great poverty or extremely low rank there was neither drawers dressingtable nor washstand a large chest beside the bed held all dorothys possessions and a leaftable which would let down was fixed to the wall under a mirror a form in one corner and two stools made up the rest of the furniture in a corner close to the entrance stood another door which rose opened after she had set up the leaftable and put the candle upon it then with elizabeths help she dragged out a large thick straw mattress and the blankets and coverlet of which dorothy had spoken and made up the bed in one of the unoccupied corners a further search revealed a bolster but no pillows were forthcoming that did not matter for they expected none now then children well get you into bed said rose will must say his prayers first said cissy anxiously of course now will come and say thy prayers like a good lad will knelt down beside the bed and did as he was told in a shrill singsong voice odd prayers they were but in those days nobody knew any better and most children were taught to say still queerer things first came the lords prayer so far all was right then will repeated the ten commandments and the creed which are not prayers at all and finished with this formula matthew mark luke and john bless the bed that i lie on four corners to my bed four angels at their head one to read and one to write and one to guard my bed at night and now i lay me down to sleep i pray that christ my soul may keep if i should die before i wake i pray that christ my soul may take wake i at morn or wake i never i give my soul to christ for ever after this strange jumble of good things and nonsense will jumped into bed where the baby was already laid it was cissys turn next ever since it had been so summarily arranged by mrs wade that the children were to stay the night at the kings head cissy had been looking preternaturally solemn now when she was desired to say her prayers as a prelude to going to bed cissys lip quivered and her eyes filled with tears why little maid what ails thee asked rose its father said cissy in an unsteady voice i dont know however father will manage without me hell have to dress his own supper i only hope hell leave the dish for me to wash when i get home no body never put father and me asunder afore little maid answered elizabeth mistress wade meant to save thee the long walk home oh i know she meant it kind replied cissy and im right thankful but please id rather be tired than father be without me weve never been asunder aforenever chapter twelve trying on the armour oh thy father ll do right well said rose encouragingly i dare be bound he thought it should be a pleasant change for thee ay i dare say father thought of us and what we should like said cissy he nodded to mistress wade and smiled on me as he went forth so of course i had to bide but then you see im always thinking of father i see said rose laughing its not how shall i do without father but how can father do without me thats it replied cissy nodding her capable little head hell do without will and babynot but hell miss them you know but they dont do nothing for him like me this was said in cissys most demure manner and rose was exceedingly amused and prithee what dost thou for him said she i do everything said cissy with an astonished look i light the fire and dress the meat note and sweep the floor only i cant do all the washing yet neighbour ursula has to help me with that but about fatherplease when ive said the paternoster the lords prayer and the belief and the commandments might i ask think you for somebody to go in and do things for father i know hell miss me very ill thou dear littlesoul cried rose but cissy was looking up at elizabeth whom she dimly discerned to be the graver and wiser of the two girls elizabeth smiled at her in that quiet sweet way which she usually did little cissy she said is not god thy father and his likewise and thinkest thou fathers love to see their children happy and at ease or no father likes us to be happy said cissy simply and your father knoweth softly replied elizabeth that ye have need of all these things oh then hell send in ursula or somebody responded cissy in a contented tone itll be all right if i ask him to see to it and cissy asked him to see to it and then lay down peacefully her tranquillity restored by the side of little will and all the children were asleep in a few minutes now bessy we can have our talk so saying rose drew the stools into a corner out of the way of the wind which came puffing in at the skylight in a style rather unpleasant for november and the girls sat down together for a chat how go matters with you at master cleres bessy oh middling i go not about to complain only that i would mistress amy were a bit steadier than she is shes a gadabout isnt she nay ive said all i need and maybe more than i should doth master clere go now to mass bessy oh ay as regular as any man in the town and the mistress belike the nets drawing closer rose the time will soon come when even you and i low down as we are shall have to make choice with death at the end of one way ay im afeard so said rose gravely bessy think you that you can stand firm firm as a rock if god hold me up weak and shifting as water if he hold me not ay thou hast there the right but we are only weak ignorant maidens bessy then is he the more likely to hold us up since he shall see we need it rather if thou be high up on the rock out of reach of the waves what matter whether thou be a stone weight or a crystal vessel the waters beat upon the rock not on thee but one sees them coming bess well what if thou dost theyll not touch thee eh bess the fire ll touch us be sure itll touch our fleshthe outward case of usthat which can drop off and turn to dust it can never meddle with rose allen and elizabeth foulkes bessy i wish i had thy good courage why rose art feared of death not of what comes after thank god but im feared of pain bessy and of dying it seems so shocking when one looks forward to it best not look forward maybe tis more shocking to think of than to feel thats the way with many things o bessy i cant look on it calm like that it isnt nature nay dear heart tis grace not nature and thou seest in one way tis worser for me than for thee thou art thyself alone but theres father and mother with me how could i bear to see them suffer the lord will never call thee to anything rose which he will not give thee grace to bear be sure of that well ive no fatherhes in heaven long years ago but ive a good mother at stoke nayland and id sooner hurt my own head than her little finger any day i live dear maid neither thou nor i know to what the lord will call us we do but know that on whatever journey he sendeth us himself shall pay the charges thou goest not a warfare at thine own cost how many times in gods word is it said fear not would the lord have so oft repeated it without he had known that we were very apt to fear ah said rose sighing and the fearful be among such as are left without the gate o bessy if that fear should overcome me that i draw back i cannot but think every moment shall make it more terrible to bear and if one held not fast but bought life as soon as the fire were felt by denying the truth i am feared dear heart im feared it shall do thee no hurt to be feared of thyself only lose not thine hold on god hold thou me up and i shall be safe but that should not be buying life bessy but selling it i know it should be bartering the life eternal for the sake of a few years at most of this lower life yet life is main sweet bessy and we are young all that a man hath will he give for his life think not on the life rose nor on what thou givest but alone on him for whom thou givest it is he not worth the pain and the loss couldst thou bear to lose himhim who endured the bitter rood cross rather than lose thee that must never be dear heart i do trust not verily yet what not abed yet cried the cheery voice of mrs wade i came up but to see if you had all you lacked dolls on her way up i reckon she shall be here by morning a good maid surely but main slow what the little ones be asleep thats well but deary me what long faces have you two are you taking thought for your funeral or what discourse have you that you both look like judges something like it hostess said elizabeth with her grave smile truly we were considering that which may come and marvelling if we should hold fast the landlady set her arms akimbo and looked from one of the girls to the other why whats acoming said she nay we know not what but dear heart then id wait till i did ill tell you what it isi hate to have things wasted even an old shoelatchet why i pity to cast it aside lest it should come in for something some day now my good maids dont waste your courage and resolution just you keep them till theyre wanted and then theyll be bright and ready for use youre not going to be burned tonight youre going to bed and screwing up your courage to be burned is an ill preparation for going to bed i can tell you you dont know and i dont that any one of us will be called to glorify the lord in the fires if we are depend upon it hell show us how to do it now then say your prayers and go to sleep i thank you hostess but i must be going home goodnight then bessy and dont sing funeral dirges over your own coffin afore it comes from the undertaker what doll hast really got here i scarce looked to see thee afore morning goodnight maids and mrs wade bustled away note at this time they used the word meat in the sense of food of any kindnot butchers meat only chapter thirteen a dark nights errand must you be gone bessy said dorothy denny sitting down on the side of her bed with a weary air eh im proper tired thought this day d never come to an end i did couldnt you tarry a bit longer i dont think i ought dorothy your mistress looked to see rose abed by now twas plain and mine gave me leave but till eight o the clock id better be on my way oh youre one of that sort thats always thinking what they ought are you thats all very well in the main but dear heart one wants a bit of what one would like by nows and thens one gets that best by thinking what one ought said elizabeth ay but its all to come sometime a long way off and how do i know itll come to me great folks doesnt take so much note of poor ones and them above ll very like do so too theres only one above that has any right to bid aught answered elizabeth and he takes more note of poor than rich doll as youll find by the bible goodnight rose goodnight dorothy and elizabeth ran lightly down the stairs and out so into the street she had a few minutes left before the hour at which mrs clere had enjoined her to be back so she did not need to hurry and she went quietly on towards balcon lane carrying her lanternfor there were no street lamps and nobody could have any light on a winter evening except what he carried with him just before she turned the corner of the lane she met two women both rather heavily laden elizabeth was passing on when her steps were arrested by hearing one of them say i do believe thats bess foulkes and if it be elizabeth came to a standstill yes im bess foulkes she said what of that why then youll give me a lift be sure as far as the north hill ive got more than i can carry and i was casting about for a face i knew ive not much time to spare said elizabeth but ill give you a lift as far as saint petersi cant go further margaret thurston isnt it i must be in by eight ill go with you till then ive only to go four doors past saint peters so thatll do well you were at the preaching werent you this even ay and i thought i saw you yes i was there he talked full bravely i marvel if hed stand if it came to it i dont think many would i misdoubt if any would without god held them up margaret says shes sure she would said the other woman oh ay i dont doubt myself said margaret then i cry you mercy but i doubt you replied elizabeth im sure you neednt id never flinch for pope nor priest maybe not but you might for rack or stake itll neer come to that here queen marys not like to forget how colchester folk all stood with her against lady jane she maynt but think you the priests shall tarry at that and shell do as the priests bid her ay they say my lord of winchester when he lived had but to hold up his finger and shed have followed him if it were over london bridge into the thames said the other woman and the like with my lord cardinal that now is by my lord of winchester she meant bishop gardiner who had been dead rather more than a year the cardinal was reginald pole the queens third cousin who had lately been appointed archbishop of canterbury in the room of the martyred cranmer why the queen and my lord cardinal were ever friends from the time they were little children answered margaret ay there was talk once of her wedding with him if hed not become a priest but i rather reckon youre right my maid a priests a priest without hes a gospeller and theres few of them will think more of goodness and charity than of their own order and of the church goodness and charity marry theres none in em cried margaret howbeit heres the green sleeves where im bound and im beholden to you bessy for coming with me good even elizabeth returned the greeting and set off to walk back at a quick pace to balcon lane she had not gone many steps when she was once more stopped this time by a young man named robert purcas a fuller who lived in the neighbouring village of booking bessy said he it is thou i know well for i heard thee bid margaret thurston good den and i should know thy voice among a thousand i cannot bide robin im late even now tarry but one minute bessy trust me thou wouldst if well then make haste said elizabeth pausing thou art friends with alice mount of bentley and she knows mistress ewring the millers wife ay well what so bid alice mount tell master ewring theres like to be a writ out against him for heresy and contumaciousness toward the church never mind how i got to know i know it and thats enough he and mistress silverside and johnson of thorpe be like enough to come into court bessy take heed to thy ways i pray thee that thou be not suspect no thought of herself had caused elizabeth foulkes to lay her hand suddenly on the buttress of saint peters beside her the father who was so dear to little cissy was in imminent danger and cissy had just been asking god to send somebody to see after him elizabeths voice was changed when she spoke again they must be warned she said robin thou and i must needs do this errand tonight i shall be chidden but that does not matter canst thou walk ten miles for the love of god id do that for the love of thee never name god elizabeth did not answer the words there was too much at stake to lose time then go thou to thorpe and bid johnson get away ere they take him mistress wade has the children and shell see to them or alice mount will i must thoud best not put too much on alice mount for will mounts as like as not to be in the next batch lord have mercy on us ill go warn themthey are with mistress ewring at the mill and then ill go on to mistress silverside make haste robin for mercys sake and without waiting for anything more elizabeth turned and ran up the street as fast as she dared in the comparative darkness streets were very rough in those days and lanterns would not light far old mistress silverside lived in tenants lane which was further off than the mill elizabeth ran across from the north hill to bouchers street and up that towards the gate beyond which the mill stood on the bank of the colne mr ewring the miller was a man who kept early hours and as elizabeth ran up to the gate she saw that the lights were already out in the windows of the mill the gate was closed elizabeth rapped sharply on the window and the shutter was opened but all being dark inside she could not see by whom prithee let me through the gate ive a message of import for master ewring at the mill gates shut said the gruff voice of the gatekeeper cant let any through while morning darnell youll let me through pleaded elizabeth im servant to master clere clothier of balcon lane and im sent with a message of grave import to the mill tell master clere if he wants his corn ground he must send by daylight and the wooden shutter was flung to elizabeth stood for an instant as if dazed i cant get to them she said to herself theres no chance that way i must go to tenants lane she turned away from the gate and went round by the wall to the top of tenants lane pray god i be in time to warn somebody we are all in danger we who were at the preaching tonight and mistress wade most of all for it was in her house ill go to the kings head ere i go home thus thinking elizabeth reached mrs silversides and rapped at the door oncetwicethricefour times not a sound came from inside and she was at last sorrowfully compelled to conclude that nobody was at home down the lane she went and came out into high street at the bottom then i can only warn mistress wade i dare be bound shell let the others know as soon as morning breaks i do trust that will be time enough she picked her way across high street and had just reached the opposite side when her arm was caught as if in an iron vice and she felt herself held fast by greater strength than her own hussy what goest thou about said the stern voice of her master nicholas clere chapter fourteen stopped on the way nicholas clere was a man of one idea at once and people of that sort do a great deal of good when they get hold of the right idea and a great deal of harm when a wrong idea gets hold of them once let notion get into the head of nicholas and no reasoning nor persuasion would drive it out he made no allowances and permitted no excuses if a thing looked wrong then wrong it must be and it was of no use to talk to him about it that he should have found elizabeth who had been ordered to come home at eight oclock running in the opposite direction at halfpast eight was in his eyes an enormity which admitted of no explanations that she either had been in mischief or was then on her way to it were the only two alternatives possible to the mind of her master and circumstances were especially awkward for elizabeth since she could not give any explanation of her proceedings which would clear her in the eyes of her employers nicholas clere like many other people of prejudiced minds and fixed opinions had a mind totally unfixed in the one matter of religion his religion was whatever he found it to his worldly advantage to be during king edwards reign it was polite and fashionable to be a protestant now under queen mary the only way to make a mans fortune was to be a roman catholic and though nicholas did not say even to himself that it was better to have plenty of money than to go to heaven when he died yet he lived exactly as if he thought so during the last few years therefore nicholas had gradually been growing more and more of a papist and especially during the last few weeks first he left off attending the protestant meetings at the kings head then he dropped family prayer papists whether they be the genuine article or only the imitation always dislike family prayer they say that a church is the proper place to pray in though our lords bidding is when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret the third step which nicholas took was to go to mass and command all his household to follow him this had elizabeth hitherto but quite respectfully declined to do she was ready to obey all orders of her earthly master which did not interfere with her higher duty to god almighty but his holy wordnot her fancy nor the traditions of men forbade her to bow down to graven images or to give his glory to any person or thing but himself and elizabeth knew that she could not attend mass without doing that a piece of consecrated bread would be held up and she would be required to worship it as god and it was not god it could neither see nor hear nor speak it was not even as like god as a man is to worship a bit of bread because christ likened his body to bread would be as silly as to worship a stone because the bible says that rock was christ it was evident that he was speaking figuratively just as he spoke when he said i am the door of the sheep and i am the morning star who in his senses would suppose that christ meant to say that he was a wooden door it is important that we should have true ideas about this because there are just now plenty of foolish people who will try to persuade us to believe that that poor powerless piece of bread is god himself it is insulting the lord god almighty to say such a thing look at the th psalm from the fifth verse to the eight and you will see how god describes an idol which he forbids to be worshipped and then look at the th and th verses of the th chapter of saint matthew and you will see that the lord jesus distinctly says that you are not to believe anybody who tells you that he is come before you see him when he really does come nobody will want any telling we shall all see him for ourselves so we find from his own words in every way that the bread and wine in the sacrament are just bread and wine and nothing more which we eat and drink in remembrance of him just as you might keep and value your mothers photograph in remembrance of her but i am sure you never would be so silly as to think that the photograph was her own real self this was the reason why elizabeth foulkes would not go to mass every sunday morning mrs clere ordered her to go and elizabeth quietly respectfully but firmly told her that she could not do so elizabeth had gods word to uphold her god forbade her to worship idols it was not simply that she did not like it nor that somebody else had told her not to do it nothing can excuse us if we break the laws of our country unless the law of our country has broken gods law and elizabeth would have done very wrong to disobey her mistress except when her mistress told her to disobey god what god said must be her rule not what she thought generally speaking mrs clere called elizabeth some ugly names and then let her do as she liked up to this time her master had not interfered with her but she was constantly expecting that he would she was not afraid of answering for herself but she was terribly afraid for her poor friends to tell him that she was on her way to warn them of danger and beg them to escape would be the very means of preventing their escape for what he was likely to do was to go at once and tell the priests in order to win their favour for himself hussy what goest thou about came sternly from nicholas clere as he held her fast master i cry you mercy i was on my way home and i was turned out of it by one that prayed me to take a word of grave import to a friend elizabeth thought she might safely say so much as that i believe thee not answered nicholas all young maids be idle gadabouts if they be not looked to sharply and thou art no better than the rest whither wert thou going i have told all i may master and i pray you ask no further the secret is not mine but theirs that sent me and should have received my message in those days nothing was more usual than for secret messages to be sent from one person to another it was not safe then as it is now for people to speak openly freedom always goes hand in hand with protestantism if england should ever again become a roman catholic countrywhich many people are trying hard to make herenglishmen will be no longer free nicholas clere hesitated a moment elizabeths defence was not at all unlikely to be true but he had made up his mind that she was in fault and probabilities must not be allowed to interfere with it rubbish said he what man having his eyes in his head should trust a silly maid with any matter of import women can never keep a secret much less a young jade like to thee tell no more lies prithee and he began to walk towards balcon lane still firmly holding elizabeth by the arm master i beseech you let me go on my way she pleaded earnestly i will tarry up all night if it be your pleasure to make up for one halfhour now truly as i am an honest maid i have told you the truth and i am about nothing ill tush jade hold thy tongue thou goest with me and if not peaceably then by force will you of your grace master let me leave my message with some other to take instead of me may i have leave to speak but one moment with mistress wade of the kings head she would find a trusty messenger to go forward tell me thy message and if it be truly of any weight then shall it be sent answered nicholas still coldly but less angrily than before could she tell him the message would it not go straight to the priest and all hope of escape be thus cut off like nehemiah elizabeth cried for wisdom master i cry you mercy yet again but i may not tell the message yet thou wouldst fain tell mistress wade thou wicked hussy thou canst be after no good what message is this which thou canst tell mistress wade but mayest not tell me i crede thee not a word have forward and thy mistress shall deal with thee chapter fifteen silence under difficulties elizabeth foulkes was almost in despair her master held her arm tight and he was a strong manto break away from him was simply impossible and to persuade him to release her seemed about as unlikely still she cried master let me go in tones that might have melted any softer heart than that of nicholas clere step out was all he said as he compelled elizabeth to keep pace with him till they reached balcon lane mrs clere was busy in the kitchen she stopped short as they entered with a gridiron in her hand which she had cleaned and was about to hang up well this is a proper time of night to come home mistress marched in too with thy master holding of thee as if the constable had thee in custody this is our pious maid that can talk nought but bible and says her prayers once a day oftener nor other folks i always do think that sort no better than hypocrites what hath she been about nicholas what saith she a pack o lies said nicholas harshly whined out a tale of some message of dread import that somebody that must not be named hath sent her on i found her hasting with all speed across the high street the contrary way from what it should have been youd best give her the strap wife she deserves it or will ere long nicholas sat down in the chimneycorner leaving mistress clere to deal with the offender elizabeth well knew that the strap was no figure of speech and that mistress clere when angry had no light hand girls were beaten cruelly in those days and grown women too when their mothers or mistresses chose to punish them for real or supposed offences but elizabeth foulkes thought very little of the pain she might suffer and very much of the needed warning which had not been given and then suddenly the words flashed across her thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven then the warning was better let alone if it were gods will she rose with a calmer face and followed mistress clere to the next room to receive her penalty there said that lady when her arm began to ache with beating elizabeth thatll do for a bit i hope perhaps thoult not be so headstrong next time i vow she looks as sweet as if id given her a box of sugar plums im feared thoud have done with a bit more but im proper tired now speak the truth who sent thee on this wildgoose chase mistress i was trusted with a secret pray you ask me not secret me no secrets ill have it forth not of me said elizabeth quietly but firmly hightytighty and who art thou my lady i am your servant mistress and will do your bidding in everything that toucheth not my duty to god almighty but this i cannot ill tell thee what hussy it was never good world since folks set up to think for themselves what was right and wrong instead of hearkening to the priest and doing as they were bid thourt too proud bess foulkes thats where it is with thy pretty face and thy dainty ways go thou up and get thee abedits on the stroke of nine and ill come and lock thee in dear heart to see the masterfulness of these maids mistress said elizabeth pausing i pray you reckon me not disobedient for in very deed i have ever obeyed you and yet will touching all concerns of yours but under your good leave this matter concerns you not and i have no freedom to speak thereof in very deed my lady said mistress clere dropping a mock courtesy i desire not to meddle with your ladyships high matters of state and do intreat you of pardon that i took upon me so weighty a matter go get thee abed hussy and hold thine idle tongue elizabeth turned and went upstairs in silence words were of no use mistress clere followed her in the bedroom where they both slept which was a loft with a skylight was amy half undressed and employed in her customary but very unnecessary luxury of admiring herself in the glass amy im going to turn the key heres an ill maid that ive had to take the strap to see thou fall not in her ways ill let you out in the morning so saying mistress clere locked the door and left the two girls together like most idle folks amy clere was gifted with her full share of curiosity the people who do the worlds work or who go about doing good are not usually the people who want you to tell them how much miss smith gave for her new bonnet or whom mr robinson had yesterday to dinner they are a great deal too busy and generally too happy to give themselves the least trouble about the bonnet or to feel the slightest interest in the dinnerparty but idle peoplepoor pitiable thingswho do not know what to do with themselves are often very ready to discuss anything of that sort which considerately puts itself in their way to have something to talk about is both a surprise and a delight to them no sooner had mrs clere shut the door than amy dropped her edifying occupation and came up to elizabeth who had sat wearily down on the side of the bed why bess what ails mother and what hast thou been doing thou mayest tell me ill not make no mischief and id love dearly to hear all about it if experience had assured elizabeth foulkes of anything it was that she might as safely repeat a narrative to the towncrier as tell it to amy clere i have offenced mistress said she and i am sorry thereat yet i did but what i thought was my duty i can say no more thereanent mistress amy but what didst thou bessy do tell me elizabeth shook her head best not mistress amy leave it rest i pray you and me likewise for of a truth i am sore wearied come bessy dont be grumpy lets know what it was lifes monstrous tiresome and never a bit of play nor show i want to know all about it maybe therell be shows ere long for you mistress amy answered elizabeth gravely as a cold shiver ran through her to think of what might be the consequence of her untold message well cissys father at any rate would be safe thank god for that why will there hast been at one tonight no elizabeth checked herself from saying more what a difference there was between amys fancies and the stern realities she knew theres no lugging nought out of thee said amy with a pout thourt as close shut as an oyster shell and she went back to the mirror and began to plait her hair the more conveniently to tuck it under her nightcap oh how elizabeth longed for a safe confidant that night sometimes she felt as though she must pour out her knowledge and her fearsto amy if she could get no one else but she knew too well that without any evil intention amy would be certain to make mischief from sheer love of gossip the moment she met with any one who would listen to her mistress amy im right weary pray you leave me be hold thy tongue if thou wilt i want nought with thee not i replied amy with equal crossness and untruth since as she would herself have expressed it she was dying to know what elizabeth could have done to make her mother so angry but amy was angry herself now get thee abed mistress glumface ill pay thee out some day see if i dont elizabeths reply was to kneel down for prayer there was one safe confidant who could be relied upon for sympathy and secrecy and he might be spoken to without words it was well for the words refused to come only one thing would present itself to elizabeths weary heart and brain and that was the speech of little cissy that it would be all right if she asked god to see to it a sob broke from her as she sent up to heaven the one petition of which alone she felt capable just thenlord help me he would know how and when to help elizabeth dropped her trouble into the almighty hands and left it there then she rose undressed and lay down beside amy who was already in bed amy clere was not an illnatured girl and her anger never lasted long when she heard elizabeths sob her heart smote her a little but she said to herself that she was not going to humble herself to that crusty bess so she turned round and went to sleep chapter sixteen the storm breaks when the morning came amys good temper was restored by her nights rest and she was inclined to look on her lockingin as a piece of amusement i vow bess this is fun said she ive twenty minds to get out on the roof and see if i can reach the next window it would be right jolly to wake up ellen malloryshes always lies abed while seven and i do think i could wilt aid me ellen mallory was the next neighbours daughter a girl of about amys age and seven oclock was considered a shocking late hour for rising in mistress amy i do pray you never think of such a thing cried elizabeth in horror youll be killed well im not wishful to be killed answered amy lightly i only want some fun while we are shut up here i marvel when mother shall come to let us out shell have to light the fire herself if she does not thats one good thing elizabeth thought it a very undutiful idea but she was silent if she had but had wings like a dove how gladly would she have flown to warn her friends she well knew that mrs clere was not likely to be in the mood to grant a favour and let her go after what had happened the night before to go without leave was a thing which elizabeth never contemplated that would be putting herself in the wrong but her poor friends would they escape how if robert purcas had been stopped as she had i was strange but her imagination did not dwell nearly so much upon her own friend rose as on little cissy if johnson were taken if he were martyred what would become of little cissy the child had crept into elizabeths heart before she was aware suddenly amys voice broke in upon her thoughts come bess art in a better mood this morrow ill forgive thee thy misswords last night if thoult tell me now all the cross words there had been the night before had come from amy herself but elizabeth let that pass mistress amy said she this matter is not one whereof i may speak to you or any other i was charged with a secret and bidden not to disclose the same think you i can break my word dear heart i break mine many a time in the week cried amy with a laugh im not nigh so peevish as thou but mistress amy it is not right returned elizabeth earnestly before amy could answer mrs cleres heavy step was heard approaching the door and the key turned in the lock amy who sat on the side of the bed swinging her feet to and fro for amusement jumped down mother youll get nought from her ive essayed both last night and this morrow and i might as well have held my tongue go and light the fire said mrs clere sternly to elizabeth ill have some talk with thee at after elizabeth obeyed in silence she lighted the fire and buttered the eggs and swept the house and baked the bread and washed the clothes and churned the butterall with a passionate longing to be free hidden in her heart and constant ejaculatory prayerssilent ones of course for the safely of her poor friends mrs clere seemed to expect elizabeth to run away if she could and she did not let her go out of her sight the whole day the promised scolding however did not come supper was over and the short winter day was drawing to its close when nicholas clere came into the kitchen heres brave news wife said he what thinkest here be an halfdozen in the town arrest of heresyand some without too mercy on us who demanded mrs clere why master benold chandler and master bongeor glazier and old mistress silverside and mistress ewring at the millthese did i hear i know not who else and suddenly turning to elizabeth he said hussy was this thine errand or had it ought to do therewith all the passionate pain and the earnest longing died out of the heart of elizabeth foulkes she stood looking as calm as a marble statue and almost as white master she said quietly enough mine errand was to warn these my friends god may yet save them if it be his will and may he not lay to your charge the blood that will otherwise be shed mercy on us cried mrs clere again dropping her duster why the jades never a bit better than these precious friends of hers im sore afeared we have been nourishing a serpent in our bosoms said nicholas in his sternest manner i had best see to this well i wouldnt hurt the maid said his wife in an uneasy tone but dear heart we must see to ourselves a bit we shall get into trouble if such things be tracked to our house so we shall answered her husband i shall go speak with the priest and see what he saith withoutand he turned to elizabeththou wilt be penitent and go to mass and do penance for thy fault i am willing enough to do penance for my faults master said elizabeth but not for the warning that i would have given for no fault is in it then must we need save ourselves replied nicholas for the innocent must not suffer for the guilty wife thou wert best lock up this hussy in some safe place and daughter go thou not nigh her this manner of heresy is infectious and i would not have thee defiled therewith nay ill have nought to do with what might get me into trouble said amy flippantly bessy may swallow the bible if she likes i shant elizabeth was silent quietly standing to hear her doom pronounced she knew it was equivalent to a sentence of death no priest consulted on such a subject would dare to leave the heretic undenounced and she had no friends save that widowed mother at stoke naylanda poor woman without money or influence and that other friend who would be sure to stand by herwho that he might save others had not saved himself nicholas took up his hat and marched out and mrs clere ordered elizabeth off to a little room over the porch generally used as a lumber room where she locked her up now then think on thy ways said she itll mayhap do thee good bread and waters all thoult get i promise thee and better than thy demerits dear heart to turn a tidy house upsidedown like this and all for a silly maids fancies forsooth i hope thou feels ashamed of thyself for i do for thee mistress i can never be ashamed of gods truth to that will i stand if he grant me grace have done with thy cant ive no patience with it and mistress clere banged the door behind her locked it and left elizabeth alone till dinnertime when she carried up a slice of bread only one and that the coarsest ryebreadand a mug of water there said she thou shouldst be thankful when ive every bit of work on my hands in all this house owing to thy perversity i do thank you mistress said elizabeth meekly would you suffer me to ask you one favour i have served you well hitherto and i never disobeyed you till now it was true and mrs clere knew it well the brazenfacedness of some hussies cried she prithee whats your pleasure mistress would you a new satin gown for your trial and a pearlnecklace or do you desire an hundred pounds given to the judges to set you free or would you a petition to the queens majesty headed by mr mayor and my lord of oxenford elizabeth let the taunts go by her like a summer breeze she felt them keenly enough nobody enjoys being laughed at but he is hardly worth calling a man who allows a laugh to turn him out of the path of duty mistress she said quietly should you hear of any being arrested for heresy would you do me so much grace as to let me know the name and the like if you hear of any that have escaped mrs clere looked down into the eyes that were lifted to her as elizabeth stood before her quiet meek tranquil eyes without a look of reproach in them with no anxiety save that aroused for the fate of her friends she was touched in spite of herself thou foolish maid said she why couldst thou not have done as other folks and run no risks i vow im wellnigh sorry for thee for all thy perversity well well see mayhap i will if i think ont thank you mistress said elizabeth gratefully as mistress clere took the mug from her and left the little porchchamber as before locking her prisoner in the prison chapter seventeen rose hears the news while elizabeth foulkes was passing through these experiences the mounts rose allen and the children had gone back to much bentley as soon as morning broke rose took the little ones home to thorpe and they met johnson just at the door of his own cottage truly friend i am much beholden to you said he to rose for your kindly care of my little ones but i pray you is it true what i heard that mistress silverside is arrest for heresy rose looked up in horrified astonishment why we left them right well she said but five hours gone i brought the children oer to you so soon as they had had their dinner is it true think you nay that would i fain know of you that were in town twelve hours later than i answered johnson then in very deed we heard nought said rose i do trust it shall prove but an ill rumour may it be so yet i cannot but fear it be true robin purcas came to me last night and i could not but think he should have told me somewhat an he might but he found father tye in mine house and might not speak they both tarried so long added johnson with a laugh that i was fain to marvel if each were essaying to outsit the other but if so father tye won for love of the heath came for robin and took him away ere the priest were wearied out if any straitness do arise against the gospellers love had best look out ay they know him too well to leave him slip through their fingers again replied rose that do they verily well dear hearts and have ye been good children weve tried said cissy theyve been as good as could be answered rose father did anybody come and see to you i asked the lord to see to it because i knew youd miss me sore said cissy anxiously and i want to know if he did ay my dear heart replied johnson smiling as he looked down on her ursula felstede came in and dressed dinner for me and margaret thurston looked in after and she washed some matters and did a bit of mending and at after i had companyfather tye and robin purcas and jack love so thou seest i was not right lonesome he took good care of you father said cissy looking happy it was evident that cissy lived for and in her father whatever he was for good or evil that she was likewise well ive got to look in on margaret thurston said rose for i did a bit of marketing for her this morrow in the town and i have a fardel to leave she was not at home when we passed coming but now i think id better be on my way so ill wish you good den johnson god bless you little ones good den rose said cissy and youll learn me to weave lace with those pretty bobbins that will i with a very good will sweet heart said rose stooping to kiss cissy weave lace commented her father what what is the child thinking that she would fain learn to weave lace oh father please you wont say nay pleaded cissy embracing her fathers arm with both her own i want to bring you in some money cissy spoke with a most important air you know of an even i alway have a bit of time after will and baby be abed and at times too in the day when wills out with george felstede and im minding baby i can rock her with my feet while i make lace with my hands and you know father will and baby ll be growing big by and bye and you wont have enough for us all without we do something and rose says shell learn me how and that if i have a lace pillowand it wont cost very much fatheri can alway take it up for a few minutes by nows and thens when i have a bit of time and then dont you see father i can make a little money for you please please dont say i mustnt cried cissy growing quite talkative in her eagerness johnson and rose looked at each other and rose laughed but though cissys father smiled too he soon grew grave and laid his hand on his little girls head as she stood looking up earnestly nay my little maid ill never say nought of the sort if rose here will be so good as to learn thee aught that is good whether for body or soul i will be truly thankful to her and bid thee do the like and be diligent to learn good little maid god bless thee then as cissy trotted into the cottage well pleased johnson added bless the little maids heart she grows more like her mother in heaven every day ill never stay the little fingers from doing what they can itll not bring much in i reckon but itll be a pleasure to the child and good for her to be ever busy at something that she maynt fall into idle ways think you not so rose indeed and it so will johnson answered rose not that i think cissy and idle ways ll ever have much to do one with the other shes not one of that sort but i shouldnt wonder if laceweaving brings in more than you think ive made a pretty penny of it and i wasnt so young as cissy when i learned the work and its like everything else them that begin young have the best chance to make good workers shell be a rare comfort to you cissy if she goes on as shes begun johnson did not reply for a moment when he did it was to say well god keep us all im right thankful to you rose for all your goodness to my little maid good den when she had returned the good evening rose set off home and walked rather fast till she came to margaret thurstons cottage after the little business was transacted between her and margaret rose inquired if they had heard of mistress silversides arrest both margaret and her husband seemed thunderstruck nay we know nought thereof answered thurston pray god it be not true therell be more an it so be i fear so much said rose she did not tell her mother for alice had not been well lately and rose wished to spare her an apprehension which might turn out to be quite unfounded or at least exaggerated but she told her stepfather and old mount looked very grave god grant it be not so said he but if it be rose thou wist they have our names in their black list of heretics ay father i know they have god keep us all said william mount looking earnestly into the fire and rose knew that while he might intend to include being kept safe yet he meant far more than that being kept true when john love called at johnsons cottage to fetch robert purcas the two walked about a hundred yards on the way to bentley without either speaking a word then robert suddenly stopped look you love what would you with me i cannot go far from thorpe tonight i was sent with a message to johnson and i have not found a chance to deliver it yet must it be tonight and what chance look you for ay it must answered robert earnestly what i look for is yon black snake coming out of his hole and then slip i in and deliver my message love nodded he knew well enough who the black snake was then maybe you came with the like word i did was it to warn johnson to scape ere the bailiff should be on him ay it was and you i came to the same end but not alone for johnson robin thou hadst best see to thyself dost know thou art on the black list ive looked for that this many a day but so art thou love and thou hast a wife to care for and ive none im in danger anyway rob but theres a chance for thee think of thy old father and haste thee lad robert shook his head i promised to warn johnson he said and i gave my word for it to one that i love right dearly ill not break my word no love i tarry here till ive seen him the lord must have a care of my old father if they take me love found it impossible to move robert from his resolution he bade him goodnight and turned away chapter eighteen what befell some of them for halfanhour safely hidden behind a hedge robert purcas watched the door of johnsons cottage until at last he saw the priest come out and go up the lane for a short distance then he stopped looked round and gave a low peculiar whistle a man jumped down from the bank on the other side of the lane with whom the priest held a long lowtoned conversation robert knew he could not safely move before they were out of the way at length they parted and he just caught the priests final words good we shall have them all afore the even that you shall not if god speed me said robert to himself the priest went up the lane towards bentley and the man who had been talking with him took the opposite way to thorpe when his footsteps had died away robert crept out from the shelter of the hedge and made his way in the dark to johnsons cottage a rap on the door brought cissy who is it please she said because i cant see it is robin purcas cis i want a word with thy father come in robin called johnsons voice from within i could see thou wert bursting with some news not to be spoken in the presence but just gone what ails thee man ay i was and i promised to tell you jack thou must win away ere daylight or the bailiff shall be on thee set these little ones in safe guard and hie thee away with all the speed thou mayest is it come so near said johnson gravely father youre not going nowhere without me said cissy creeping up to him and slipping her hand in his you can leave will and baby with neighbour ursula but ill not be left unless you bid meand you wont father you can never do without me i must go where you go shes safe i reckon said robert answering johnsons look theyd never do no mischief to much as she only maybe shed be more out of reach if i took her with me theyll seek to breed her up in a convent most like cissy felt her fathers hand tighten upon hers im not going with you nor nobody said she ill go with father nobodyll get me nowhere else without they carry me johnson seemed to wake up as if till then he had scarcely understood what it all meant god bless thee for the warning lad he said now hie thee quick and get out of reach thyself cis go up and fetch a warm wrap for baby and all her clothes ill take her next door i reckon will must tarry there too itd be better for thee cis but ill not compel thee if thy little hearts set on going with me thoult have to rough it little maid ill not stop nowhere was cissys determination robert bade them goodbye with a smile closed the door and set off down the lane as fast as the darkness made it prudent he did not think it wise to go through the village so he made a detour by some fields and came into the road again on the other side of thorpe he had not gone many yards when he became aware that a number of lights were approaching accompanied by a noise of voices robert turned straight round if he could get back to the stile which led into the fields he would be safer and if not still it would be better to be overtaken than to meet a possible enemy face to face he would be less likely to be noticed in the former case than in the latterat least so he thought there must be a good number of people coming behind him judging from the voices at length they came up with him pray you young man how far be we from thorpe you are very nigh straight on was roberts answer do you belong there no im nigh a stranger to these parts im from the eastern side of the county i cant tell you much about folks if that be your meaning and what do you here if you be a stranger ive a job o work at saint osyth at this present what manner of work im a fuller by trade robert had already recognised that he was talking to the bailiffs searching party every minute that he could keep them was a minute more for johnson and the little ones know you a man named johnson what here ay at thorpe robert pretended to consider well lets seetheres will johnson the miller and luke johnson the weaver andeh theres ever so many johnsons i couldnt say to one or another without i knew more john johnson hes a labouring man well there is johnsons that lives up by the wood but im none so sure of the mans name i think its andrew but ill not say certain it may be john i couldnt speak not to be sure let him be gregory he knows nought said the bailiff robert touched his cap and fell behind the bailiff suddenly turned round whats your own name it was a terrible temptation if he gave a false name the strong probability was that they would pass on and he would very likely get safe away it was johnson of whom they were thinking not himself but that would enable them to reach johnsons cottage a minute sooner and it would be a cowardly lie no robert purcas had not so learned christ he gave his name honestly robert purcas if thats not on my list said the bailiff feeling in his pocket ay here it isstay william purcas of booking fuller aged twenty single is that you my name is robert not william said the young man but thou art a fuller and single and aged twenty ay all that is so dost thou believe the bread of the sacred host to be transmuted after consecration into the body of christ so that no substance of bread is left there at all i do not i cannot for i see the bread hes a heretic cried simnel robert or william it is all one take the heretic and so robert purcas was seized and carried to the moot hall in colchestera fate from which one word of falsehood would have freed him but it would have cost him his fathers smile the moot hall of colchester was probably the oldest municipal building in england it was erected soon after the conquest and its low circular arches and piers ornamented the high street until when the town vandals were pleased to destroy it because it impeded the traffic robert was taken into the dungeon and the great door slammed to behind him he could not see for a few minutes coming fresh from the light of day and before he was able to make anything out clearly an old ladys voice accosted him robert purcas if i err not she said i am sorry to behold thee here friend truly mistress more than i am that am come hither in christs cause ay then thou art well come methinks it is mistress silverside thou sayest well i shall have company now said the old lady with a smile methought some of my brethren and sisters should be like to have after i reckon responded purcas we be sure at the least of our fathers company the great door just then rolled back and they heard the gaolers voice outside gramercy but this is tidy work cried he never had no such prisoners here afore i dont know what to do with em there get you in you arent the first there there was a moments pause and then mrs silverside and robert who were looking to see what uncommon sort of prisoners could be at hand found that their eyes had to come down considerably nearer the floor as the gaoler let in hand in hand cissy and will johnson followed by their father chapter nineteen fathers come too why my dear hearts cried old mrs silverside as the children came in how won ye hither please we havent been naughty said will rubbing his eyes with his knuckles fathers come too so its all right added cissy in a satisfied tone mrs silverside turned to robert purcas is not here a lesson for thee and me my brother our father is come too god is with us and thus it is all right marry these heretics beareth a good brag said wastborowe the gaoler to his man it is bad grammar now to use a singular verb with a plural noun but in it was correct english over the whole south of england and the use of the singular with the singular or the plural with the plural was a peculiarity of the northern dialect they always doth answered the undergaoler will ye be of as good courage think you asked wastborowe the day ye stand up by colne water god knoweth was the reverent answer of mrs silverside if he holds us up then shall we stand they be safe kept whom he keepeth said johnson please mr wastborowe said cissy in a businesslike manner would you mind telling me when we shall be burned the gaoler turned round and stared at his questioner thou arent like to be burned i reckon said he with a laugh i must if father is was cissys calm response itll hurt a bit i suppose but you see when we get to heaven afterwards every thing will be so good and pleasant i dont think we need care much do you please mr wastborowe marry come up thou scrap of a chirping canary answered the gaoler half roughly and half amused if babes like this be in such minds tis no marvel their fathers and mothers stand to it but im not a baby mr wastborowe said cissy rather affronted will and baby are both younger than me im going in ten and i takes care of father mr wastborowe who was drinking ale out of a huge tankard removed it from his lips to laugh mighty good care thoult take ill be bound yes i do mr wastborowe replied cissy quite gravely i dress fathers meat and mend his clothes and love him thats taking care of him isnt it the gaolers men who were accustomed to see every body in the prison appear afraid of him were evidently much amused by the perfect fearlessness of cissy wastborowe himself seemed to think it a very good joke and who takes care of thee asked he cissy gave her usual answer god takes care of me and not of thy father said wastborowe with a sneer the sneer passed by cissy quite harmlessly god takes care of all of us she said he helps father to take care of me and he helps me to take care of father hell be taken goodly care of when hes burned said the gaoler coarsely taking another draught out of the tankard cissy considered that point please mr wastborowe we mustnt expect to be taken better care of than the lord jesus and he had to suffer you know but it wont signify when we get to heaven i suppose heretics dont go to heaven replied wastborowe i dont know what heretics are said cissy but every body who loves the lord jesus is sure to get there satan would not want them you know and jesus will want them for he died for them hell look after us i expect dont you think so mr wastborowe hold thy noise said the gaoler rising with the empty jug in his hand he wanted some more ale and he was tired of amusing himself with cissy hush thee my little maid said her father laying his hand on her head is he angry father asked cissy looking up i said nothing wrong did i theres somewhat wrong responded he but its not thee child meanwhile wastborowe was crossing the court to his own house jug in hand opening the door he set down the jug on the table with the short command fill that you may tarry till ive done answered audrey calmly ironing on she was the only person in the place who was not afraid of her husband in fact he was afraid of her when as he expressed it she was wrong side up come wife i cant wait replied wastborowe in a tone which he never used to any living creature but audrey or a priest audrey coolly set down the iron on its stand folded up the shirt which she had just finished and laid another on the board you can wait uncommon well john wastborowe said she youve had as much as is good for you already and maybe a bit to spare i cant leave my ironing am i to get it myself then asked the gaoler sulkily just as you please was the calm response im not going wastborowe took up his jug went to the cellar and drew the ale for himself in a meek subdued style very different indeed from the aspect which he wore to his prisoners he had scarcely left the door when a shrill voice summoned him to come back and shut the door thou blundering dizzard when will men ever have a bit of sense the gaoler came back to shut the door and then returning to the dungeon showed himself so excessively surly and overbearing that his men whispered to one another that hed been having it out with his mistress before he recovered his equanimity the bailiff returned and called him into the courtyard hearken wastborowe how many of these have you now in ward wellnigh all methinks and he read over the list elizabeth wood christian hare rose fletcher joan kent agnes stanley margaret simson robert purcas agnes silverside john johnson elizabeth foulkes got em all save that last said wastborowe who is she i know not the name by the same token what didst with the babe there were three of johnsons children and one in arms left it wi jane hiltoft said the gaoler gruffly i didnt want it screeching here the bailiff nodded maybe she can tell us who this woman is said he and stepping a little nearer the porters lodge he summoned the porters wife mrs hiltoft came to the door with little helen johnson in her arms well i dont know said she ill tell you what youd best ask audrey wastborowe shes a bit of a gossip and i reckon she knows everybody in colchester by name and face if no more shell tell you if anybody can the bailiff stepped across the court and rapped at the gaolers door he was desired by a rather shrill voice to come in he just opened the door about an inch and spoke through it audrey do you know aught of one elizabeth foulkes lizbeth whatdidyousay inquired mrs wastborowe hastily drying her arms on her apron and coming forward elizabeth foulkes repeated the bailiff what yon lass o cleres the clothier oh ay youll find her in balcon lane at the magpie a tall wellfavoured young maid she is might be a princess to look at her whats she been doing now heresy said the bailiff shortly heresy dear dear to think of it well now who could have thought it but master cleres a bit unsteady in that way his self aint he oh nay hes reconciled oh the tone was significant why was you wanting yon maid o mistress cleres said the porters wife youll have her safe enough for i met amy clere this even and she said her mother was downright vexed with their bess and had turned the key on her i did not know it was her you meant ive never heard her called nought but bess you see then thats all well said maynard ill tarry for her till the morrow for im well wearied tonight chapter twenty led to the slaughter the long hours of that day wore on and nobody came again to elizabeth in the porchchamber the dusk fell and she heard the sounds of locking up the house and going to bed and began to understand that neither supper nor bed awaited her that night elizabeth quietly cleared a space on the floor in the moonlight heaping boxes and baskets on one another till she had room to lie down and then after kneeling to pray she slept more peacefully than queen mary did in her palace she was awoke suddenly at last it was broad daylight and somebody was rapping at the street door amy she heard mistress clere call from her bedchamber look out and see who is there amy slept at the front of the house in the room next to the porchchamber elizabeth rose to her feet giving her garments a shake down as the only form of dressing just then in her power and looked out of the window the moment she did so she knew that one of the supreme moments of her life had come before the door stood mr maynard the bailiff of colchesterthe man who had marched off the twentythree prisoners to london in the previous august everybody who knew him knew that he was a stout papist to whom it was dear delight to bring a protestant to punishment elizabeth did not doubt for an instant that she was the one chosen for his next victim just as amy clere put her head out of the window mr maynard who did not reckon patience among his chief virtues and who was tired of waiting signed to one of his men to give another sharp rap accompanied by a shout ofopen in the queens name saints love us and help us ejaculated amy taking her head in again mother its the queens men go down and open to em was mrs cleres next order eh i

bailiff were at hand or theyll mayhap break the door in a third violent rap enforced mrs cleres command have a bit of patience master bailiff cried amy from her window were acoming as quick as may be let a body get some clothes on do somebody under the window was heard to laugh then mrs clere went downstairs her heavy tread followed by the light run of her daughters steps and then elizabeth heard the bolts drawn back and the bailiff and his men march into the kitchen of the magpie goodmorrow mistress clere i am verily sorry to come to the house of a good catholic on so ill an errand but i am in search of a maid of yours by name elizabeth foulkes whose name hath been presented a afore the queens graces commission for heresy is this the maid mr maynard as he spoke laid his hand not very gently on amys shoulder eh bless me no cried amy in terror im as good a catholic as you or any ill say aught you want me and i dont care what it is that the moons made o green cheese if you will and id a shive last night for supper dont take me for mercys sake im not like said mr maynard laughing and giving amy a rough pat on the back you arent the sort i want youre after bess foulkes arent you said mrs clere amy theres the key go fetch her down i locked her up you see that she should be safe when wanted im a true woman to queen and church i am master bailiff youll find no heresy here outside yon jade of a bessy mrs clere knew well that suspicion had attached to her husbands name in time past which made her more desirous to free herself from all complicity with what the authorities were pleased to call heresy amy ran upstairs and unlocked the door of the porchchamber bessy the bailiffs come for thee a faint flush rose to elizabeths face as she stood up now do be discreet bessy and say as he says bless you its only words i told him id say the moon was made o green cheese if he wanted why shouldnt you mistress amy it would be dishonour to my lord and i am ready for anything but that good lack couldst not do a bit o penance at after bess its thy life thats in danger do be wise in time lass it is only this life said elizabeth quietly and he that saveth his life shall lose it they that be faithful to the end shall have the crown of lifemaster bailiff i am ready the bailiff looked up at the fair tall queenly maiden who stood before him i trust thou art ready to submit to the church he said it were sore pity thou shouldst lose life and all things nay i desire to win them answered elizabeth i am right ready to submit to all which it were good for me to submit to come well said replied the bailiff and he tied the cord round her hands and led her away to the moot hall just stop and think a moment what it would be to be led in this way through the streets of a town where nearly everybody knew you as if you had been a thief or a murdererled by a cord like an animal about to be soldnay as our master christ was led like a sheep to the slaughter fancy what it would be to a girl who had always been respectable and wellbehaved to be used in this way to hear the rough coarse jokes of the bystanders and of the men who were leading her and not to have one friend with hernot one living creature that cared what became of her except that lord who had once died for her and for whom she was now for aught she knew upon her way to die and even he seemed as if he did not care men did these things and he kept silence dont you think it was hard to bear when elizabeth reached the moot hall and was taken to the prison for an instant she felt as if she had reached home and friends mrs silverside bade her welcome with a kindly smile and robert purcas came up and kissed herpeople kissed each other then instead of shaking hands as we do nowand elizabeth felt their sympathy a true comfort but she was calm under her suffering until she caught sight of cissy then an exclamation of pain broke from her o cissy cissy i am so sorry for thee o bessy but im so glad dont say youre sorry why cissy how canst thou be glad dost know what it all signifieth i know theyve taken father and im sorry enough for that but then father always said they would some day but dont you see why im glad theyve got me too i was always proper feared theyd take father and leave me all alone with the children and hed have missed us dreadful now you see i can tend on him and do everything for him and thats why im glad if it had to be you know elizabeth looked up at cissys father and he said in a husky voice of such is the kingdom of heaven chapter twenty one before the commissioners bessy said cissy in a whisper do you think theyll burn us all today i reckon sweet heart they be scarce like to burn thee but theyll have to do to me whatever they do to father cried cissy earnestly dear child thou wist not what burning is oh but ive burnt my fingers before now said cissy with an air of extensive experience which would have suited an old woman its not proper pleasant but the worsts afterwards and there wouldnt be any afterwards would there it would be heaven afterwards wouldnt it i dont see that theres so much to be feared of in being burnt if they didnt burn me and did will and baby andand fatherand cissys voice faltered and she began to sobthat would be dreadfuldreadful o bessy wont you ask god not to give them leave they couldnt could they unless he did nay dear heart not unless he did answered elizabeth feeling her own courage strengthened by the childs faith then if you and i both ask him very hardo bessy dont you think he will before elizabeth could answer johnson saidi wouldnt cis you wouldnt father please why because dear heart he knoweth better than we what is good for us sometimes when folk ask god too earnestly for that they desire he lets them have it but in punishment not in mercy it would have been a sight better for the israelites if they hadnt had those quails dost thou mind how david saith he gave them their desire but sent leanness withall into their souls id rather be burnt cis than live with a lean soul and my father in heaven turning away his face from me cissy considered father i could never get along a bit if you were so angry you wouldnt look at me truly dear heart and i would not have my father so ask the lord what thou wilt cis if it be his will only remember that his will is best for usthe happiest as well as the most profitable wilt shut up o thy preachment shouted wastborowe with a severe blow to johnson thou wilt make the child as ill an heretic as thyself and we mean to bring her up a good catholic christian johnson made no answer to the gaolers insolent command a look of great pain came into his face and he lifted his head up towards the sky as if he were holding communion with his father in heaven elizabeth guessed his thoughts if he were to be martyred and his little helpless children to be handed over to the keeping of priests who would teach them to commit idolatry and forbid them to read the bible that seemed a far worse prospect in his eyes than even the agony of seeing them suffer that at the worst would be an hours anguish to be followed by an eternity of happy rest but the other might mean the loss of all thingsbody and soul alike little will did not enter into the matter he might have understood something if he had been paying attention but he was not attending and therefore he did not but cissy to whom her father was the centre of the world and who knew his voice by heart understood his looks as readily as his words father she said looking at him dont be troubled about us ill never believe nobody that says different from what youve learned us and ill tell will and baby they mustnt mind them neither and elizabeth added softlyi will be a god to thee and to thy seed after thee leave thy fatherless children i will preserve them alive god bless you both said johnson and he could say no more the next day the twelve prisoners accused of heresy were had up for examination before the commissioners sir john kingston mr roper and mr boswell the bishops scribe six of themelizabeth wood christian hare rose fletcher joan kent agnes stanley and margaret simsonwere soon disposed of they had been in prison for a fortnight or more they were terribly frightened and they were not strong in the faith they easily consented to be reconciled to the churchto say whatever the priests bade them and to believeor pretend to believe all that they were desired robert purcas was the next put on trial the bishops scribe called him in the account he wrote to his master obstinate and a glorious prating heretic what this really meant was that his arguments were too powerful to answer he must have had considerable ability for though only twenty years of age and a village tradesman he was set down in the chargesheet as lettered namely a welleducated man which in those days was most extraordinary for a man of that description when confessed you last asked the commissioners of purcas i have not confessed of long time was the answer nor will i for priests have no power to remit sin come you to church to hear the holy mass i do not nor will i for all that is idolatry have you never then received the blessed sacrament of the altar i did receive the supper of the lord in king edwards time but not since nor will i except it be ministered to me as it was then do you not worship the sacred host that is the consecrated bread in the lords supper those who worship it are idolaters said robert purcas without the least hesitation that which there is used is bread and wine only have him away cried sir john kingston what need to question further so obstinate a man so they had him awaynot being able to answer himand agnes silverside was called in his stead she was very calm but as determined as purcas come hither mistress said boswell roughly why what have we here in the chargesheet agnes silverside alias smith alias downes alias may hast thou had four husbands old witch or how comest by so many names sir was the quiet answer my name is smith from my father and i have been thrice wed the commissioners having first amused themselves by a little rough joking at the prisoners expense inquired which of her husbands was the last my present name is silverside she replied and what was he this silversidea tanner or a chimneysweep sir he was a priest the commissionerswho knew it all beforehandprofessed themselves exceedingly shocked god never forbade priests to marry under the old testament nor did he ever command christian ministers to be unmarried men but the church of rome has forbidden her priests to have any wives as saint paul told timothy would be done by those who departed from the faith see one timothy four thus teaching for doctrines the commandments of men see matthew fifteen verse chapter twenty two gently handled when the commissioners had tormented the priests widow as long as they thought proper they called on her to answer the charges brought against her dost thou believe that in the blessed sacrament of the altar the bread and wine becometh the very body and blood of christ so soon as the word of consecration be pronounced nay it is but bread and wine before it is received and when it is received in faith and ministered by a worthy minister then it is christ flesh and blood spiritually and not otherwise dost though worship the blessed sacrament truly nay for ye make the sacrament an idol it ought not to be worshipped with knocking kneeling or holding up of hands wilt thou come to church and hear mass that will i not so long as ye do worship to other than god almighty nothing that is made can be the same thing as he that made it they must needs be idolators and of the meanest sort that worship the works of their own hands aroint thee old witch wilt thou go to confession neither will i that for no priest hath power to remit sin that is against god to him surely will i confess and having so done i have no need to make confession to men take the witch away cried the chief commissioner shes a froward obstinate heretic only fit to make firewood the gaoler led her out of the court and john johnson was summoned next what is thy name and how old art thou my name is john johnson i am a labouring man of the age of four and thirty years canst read but a little then how darest thou set thee up against the holy doctors of the church that can read latin cannot a man be saved without he read latin hold thine impudent tongue it is our business to question and thine to answer where didst learn thy pestilent doctrine i learned the gospel of christ jesus if that be what you mean by pestilent doctrine from master trudgeon at the first he learned me that the sacrament as ye minister it is an idol and that no priest hath power to remit sin dost thou account of this trudgeon as a true prophet ay i do what then sayest thou to our saviour christs word to his apostles whosesoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them marry i say nought without you desire it what meanest by that why you are not apostles nor yet the priests that be now alive he said not whosesoever sins sir thomas tye shall remit they are remitted unto them thou foolish man sir thomas tye is successor of the apostles well but it sayeth not neither whosesoever sins ye and your successors do remit ill take the words as they stand by your leave to apostles were they said and to apostles will i leave them the man hath no reason in him said kingston have him away likewise please your worships said the gaoler here be all that are indicted there is but one left and she was presented only for not attending at mass nor confession bring her up and elizabeth foulkes stepped up to the table and courtesied to the representatives of the queen what is thy name elizabeth foulkes how old art thou twenty years art thou a wife girls commonly married then younger than they do now the usual length of human life was shorter people who reached sixty were looked upon as we now regard those of eighty and a man of seventy was considered much as one of ninety or more would be at the present time nay i am a maid said elizabeth the word maid was only just beginning to be used instead of servant it generally meant an unmarried woman what is thy calling i am servant to master nicholas clere clothier of balcon lane art colchesterborn i was born at stoke nayland in suffolk and wherefore dost thou not come to mass because i hold the sacrament of the altar to be but bread and wine which may not be worshipped under peril of idolatry well and why comest not to confession because no priest hath power to remit sins hang em they are all in a story said the chief commissioner wrathfully but shes a wellfavoured maid this it were verily pity to burn her if we could win her to recant what a poor weak mean thing human nature is the men who had no pity for the white hair of agnes silverside or the calm courage of john johnson or even the helpless innocence of little cissy such things as these did not touch them at allthese very men were anxious to save elizabeth foulkes not because she was good but because she was beautiful it is a sad sad blunder which people often make to set beauty above goodness some very wicked things have been done in this world simply by thinking too much of beauty admiration is a good thing in its proper place but a great deal of mischief comes when it gets into the wrong one whenever you admire a bad man because he is clever or a foolish woman because she is pretty you are letting admiration get out of his place if we had lived when the lord jesus was upon earth we should not have found people admiring him he was not beautiful his face was marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men and would it not have been dreadful if we had admired pontius pilate and judas iscariot and had seen no beauty in him who is altogether lovely to the hearts of those whom the holy ghost has taught to love him so take care what sort of beauty you admire and make sure that goodness goes along with it we may be quite certain that however much men thought of elizabeths beautiful face god thought very little of it the beauty which he saw in her was her love to the lord jesus and her firm stand against what would dishonour him this sort of beauty all of us can have oh do ask god to make you beautiful in his eyes no sooner had the chief commissioner spoken than a voice in the court called out pray you worshipful sirs save this young maid i am her mothers brother thomas holt of colchester and i do you to wit she is of a right good inclination and no wise perverse i do entreat you grant her yet another chance then a gentleman stepped forward from the crowd of listeners worshipful sirs said he may i have leave to take charge of this young maiden to the end that she may be reconciled to the church and obtain remission of her errors truly as master commissioner saith it were pity so fair a creature were made food for the fire who are youand what surety give you asked sir john sir thomas tye rose from his seat on the bench please it your worships that is master ashby of this town a good catholic man and well to be trusted if your worships be pleased to show mercy to the maid as indeed i would humbly entreat you to do there were no better man than he to serve you in this matter the priest having spoken in favour of mr ashby the commissioners required no further surety art thou willing to be reformed they asked elizabeth sirs she answered cautiously i am willing to be shown gods true way if so be i err from it this was enough for the commissioners they wanted to get her free and they therefore accepted from her words which would probably have been used in vain by the rest mr ashby was charged to keep and reconcile her which he promised to do or to feed her on barley bread if she proved obstinate as elizabeth turned to follow him she passed close by robert purcas whom the gaoler was just about to take back to prison thou hast set them in slippery places whispered purcas as she passed him keep thou true to christ o elizabeth mine own love keep true the tears rose to elizabeths eyes pray for me robin she said and then each was led away chapter twenty three respite the commissioners who tried these prisoners were thoroughly worldly men who really cared nothing about the doctrines which they burned people for not believing had it been otherwise when queen elizabeth came to the throne less than two years afterwards these men would have shown themselves willing to suffer in their turn but most of them did not do thisseldom even to the extent of losing promotion scarcely ever to that of losing life they simply wheeled round again to what they had been in the reign of edward the sixth it is possible to respect men who are willing to lose their lives for the sake of what they believe to be true even though you may think them quite mistaken but how can you respect a man who will not run the risk of losing a situation or a few pounds in defence of the truth it is not possible after the trial of the colchester prisoners the commissioners passed on to other places and the town was quiet for a time mrs silverside johnson and the children and purcas remained in prison in the moot hall and elizabeth foulkes was as truly a prisoner in the house of henry ashby at first she was very kindly treated in the hope of inducing her to recant but as time went on things were altered mr ashby found that what elizabeth understood by being shown gods true way was not being argued with by a priest nor being commanded to obey the church but being pointed to some passage in the bible which agreed with what he said and since what he said was not in accordance with the bible of course he could not show her any texts which agreed with it the church of rome herself admits that people who read the bible for themselves generally become protestants does not common sense show that in that case the protestant doctrines must be the doctrines of the bible why should rome be so anxious to shut up the bible if her own doctrines are to be found there above four months passed on and no change came to the prisoners but there had not been any fresh arrests the other gospellers began to breathe more freely and to hope that the worst had come already mrs wade was left at liberty mr ewring had not been taken surely all would go well now how often we think the worst must be over just a minute before it comes upon us a little rap on margaret thurstons door brought her to open it why rose im fain to see thee maid come in my mother bade me tell you margaret said rose when the door was shut that there shall be a scripture reading in our house this even will you come that will we right gladly dear heart at what hour midnight we dare not afore well be there how fares thy mother today why not over well she seems but ill at ease her hands burn and she is ever athirst tis an ill rheum methinks ay she has caught a bad cold said margaret rose ill tell you whatwell come a bit afore midnight and see if we cannot help you my master knows a deal touching herbs hes wellnigh as good as any apothecary though i say it and hell compound an herb drink that shall do her good with gods blessing while i help you in the house what say you have i well said indeed margaret and id be right thankful if you would for itll be hard on father if hes neither mother nor me to do for himshe sick abed and me waiting on her be sure it will but i hope itll not be so bad as that well then look you well shut up the hut and come after you you haste on to her and when ive got things a bit tidy and my masters come from workhe looked to be overtime tonightwell run over to bentley and do what we can rose thanked her again and went on with increased speed she found her mother no better and urged her to go to bed telling her that margaret was close at hand it was now about five in the afternoon alice agreed to this for she felt almost too poorly to sit up she went to bed and rose flew about the kitchen getting all finished that she could before margaret should arrive it was saturday night and the earliest hours of the sabbath were to be ushered in by the reading only a few neighbours were asked for it was necessary now to be very careful halfadozen might be invited as if to supper but the times when a hundred or more had assembled to hear the word of god were gone by would they ever come again they dared not begin to read until all prying eyes and ears were likely to be closed in sleep and the readers voice was low that nobody might be roused next door few people could read then especially among the labouring class so that except on these occasions the poorer gospellers had no hope of hearing the words of the lord the reading was over and one after another of the guests stole silently out into the nightblack noiseless shadows going up the lane into the village or down it on the way to thorpe at length the last was gone except the thurstons who offered to stay for the night john thurston lay down in the kitchen and margaret finding alice mount apparently better said she would share roses bed alice mounts malady was what we call a bad feverish cold and generally we do not expect it to do anything more than make the patient very uncomfortable for a week but in queen marys days they knew very much less about colds than we do and they were much more afraid of them it was only six years since the last attack of the terrible sweating sicknessthe last ever to be but they did not know thatand people were always frightened of anything like a cold turning to that dreadful epidemic wherein as king edward the sixth writes in his diary if one took cold he died within three hours and if he escaped it held him but nine hours or ten at the most it was therefore a relief to hear alice say that she felt better and urge rose to go to bed well it scarce seems worth while going to bed said margaret what time is it can you see the church clock rose we can when its light said rose but i think youll not see it now margaret drew back the little curtain but all was dark and she let it drop again itll be past one i reckon said she oh ay a good way on toward two was roses answer rose have you heard aught of bessy foulkes of late nought ive tried to see her but they keep hot so close at master ashbys theres no getting to her and those poor little children of johnsons theyre yet in prison trow oh ay i wish theyd have let us have the baby jane hiltoft has it shell care it well enough for the body but for the soul oh when johnsons burnedas he will be i reckonthe children ll be bred up in convents be sure was margarets answer nay ill be sure of nought so bad as that as long as gods in heaven theres no miracles now o days rose theres gods care just as much as in elijahs days and margaret theyve burned little children afore now eh dont rose you give me the cold chills whats that rose was listening intently whats what said margaret who had heard nothing that dont you hear the faroff tramp of men they looked at each other fearfully margaret knew well enough of what rose thoughtthe bailiff and his searching party they stopped their undressing nearer and nearer came that measured tread of a body of men it paused went on came close under the window and paused again then a thundering rattle came at the door open in the queens name then they knew it had comenot the worst but that which led to itthe beginning of the end rose quietly but quickly put her gown on again before she was ready she heard her stepfathers heavy tread as he went down the stairs heard him draw the bolt and say as he opened the door in calm tones goodmorrow master bailiff pray you enter with all honour an you come in the queens name just then the church clock struck two two oclock on the sabbath morning chapter twenty four roses fiery ordeal art thou come dear heart said alice mount as her daughter ran hurriedly into her bedchamber that is well rose the master is come and calleth for us and he must find us ready there was no time to say more for steps were ascending the stairs and in another minute master simnel enteredthe bailiff of colchester hundred whose office it was to arrest criminals within his boundaries he was a rough rude sort of man from whom women were wont to shrink come mistress turn out said he well find you other lodgings for a bit master i will do mine utmost said alice mount lifting her aching head from the pillow but i am now ill at ease and i pray you give leave for my daughter to fetch me drink ere i go hence or i fear i may scarce walk we must remember that they had then no tea coffee or cocoa and they had a funny idea that cold water was excessively unwholesome the rich drank wine and the poor thin weak ale most of which they brewed themselves from simple malt and hopsnot at all like the strong intoxicating stuff which people drink in publichouses now mr simnel rather growlingly assented to the request rose ran down making her way to the dresser through the rough men of whom the kitchen was full to get a jug and a candlestick as she came out of the kitchen with the jug in her right hand and the candle in her left she met a mani believe he called himself a gentlemannamed edmund tyrrel a relation of that tyrrel who had been one of the murderers of poor edward the fifth and his brother rose dropped a courtesy as she had been taught to do to her betters in social position mr tyrrel stopped her look thou maid wilt thou advise thy father and mother to be good catholic people catholic means general and for any one church to call itself the catholic church is as much as to say that it is the only christian church and that other people who do not belong to it are not christians it is therefore not only untrue but most insulting to all the christians who belong to other churches saint paul particularly warned the church of rome not to think herself better than other churches as you will see in the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the romans verses to but she took no heed and keeps calling herself the catholic church as if nobody could be a christian who did not belong to her no protestant church has ever committed this sin though some few persons in several denominations may have done so however rose was accustomed to the word and she knew what mr tyrrel meant so she answered gently master they have a better instructor than i for the holy ghost doth teach them i hope which i trust shall not suffer them to err see note mr tyrrel grew very angry he remembered that rose had been before the magistrates before on account of protestant opinions why art thou still in that mind thou naughty hussy cried he marry it is time to look upon such heretics indeed naughty was a much stronger word then than it is now it meant utterly worthless and most wicked brave rose allen she lifted her eyes to the face of her insulter and repliedsir with that which you call heresy do i worship my lord god i tell you truth then i perceive you will burn gossip with the rest for companys sake said mr tyrrel making a horrible joke no sir not for companys sake said rose but for my christs sake if so be i be compelled and i hope in his mercies if he call me to it he will enable me to bear it never did apostle or martyr answer better nor bear himself more bravely than this girl mr tyrrel was in the habit of looking with the greatest reverence on certain other young girls whom he called saint agnes saint margaret and saint katherinegirls who had made such answers to pagan persecutors twelve hundred years or so before that time but he could not see that the same scene was being enacted again and that he was persecuting the lord jesus in the person of young rose allen he took the candle from her hand and she did not resist him the next minute he was holding her firmly by the wrist with her hand in the burning flame watching her face to see what she would do she did nothing not a scream not a word not even a moan came from the lips of rose allen all that could be seen was that the empty jug which she held in the other hand trembled a little as she stood there wilt thou not cry sneered tyrrel as he held herand he called her some ugly names which i shall not write the answer was as calm as it could be i have no cause thank god said rose tranquilly but rather to rejoice you have more cause to weep than i if you consider the matter well when people set to work to vex you nothing makes them more angry than to take it quietly and show no vexation that is if they are people with mean minds if there be any generosity in them then it is the way to make them see that they are wrong there was no generosity nor love of justice in edmund tyrrel when rose allen stood so calmly before him with her hand on fire he was neither softened nor ashamed he burned her till the sinews began to crack and then he let go her hand and pushed her roughly away calling her all the bad names he could think of while he did so sir was the meek and christlike response have you done what you will do surely few even among martyrs have behaved with more exquisite gentleness than this the maidens hand was cruelly burnt and her tormentor was adding insult to injury by heaping false and abominable names upon her and the worst thing she had to say to him was simply to ask whether he wished to torture her any more yes sneered tyrrel and if thou think it not well then mend it mend it repeated rose nay the lord mend you and give you repentance if it be his will and now if you think it good begin at the feet and burn to the head also for he that set you awork shall pay you your wages one day i warrant you and with this touch of sarcasmonly just enough to show how well she could have handled that weapon if she had chosen to fight with itrose calmly went her way wetted a rag and bound up her injured hand and then drew the ale and carried it to her mother how long hast thou been child said her mother who of course had no notion what had been going on downstairs ay mother i am sorry for it was the quiet reply master tyrrel stayed me in talk for divers minutes what said he to thee anxiously demanded alice he asked me if i did mean to entreat you and my father to be good catholics and when i denied the same gave me some ill words rose said nothing about the burning and as she dexterously kept her injured hand out of her mothers sight all that alice realised was that the girl was a trifle less quick and handy than usual shes a good quick maid in the main said she to herself ill not fault her if shes upset a bit while rose was helping her mother to dress the bailiff was questioning her stepfather whether any one else was in the house im here said john thurston rising from the palletbed where he lay in a corner of the little scullery youd best take me if you want me take them all cried tyrrel they be all in one tale be sure were you at mass this last sunday said the bailiff to thurston he was not quite so bad as tyrrel no that was i not answered thurston firmly wherefore because i will not worship any save god almighty why who else would we have you to worship nay its not who else its what else you would have me to worship stocks and stones that cannot hear nor see and cakes of bread that the baker made overnight in his oven ive as big a throat as other men yet can i not swallow so great a notion as that the baker made him that made the baker of a truth thou art a naughty heretic said the bailiff and i must needs carry thee hence with the rest but where is thy wife ay where was margaret nobody had seen her since the bailiff knocked at the door he ordered his men to search for her but she had hidden herself so well that some time passed before she could be found at length with much laughter one of the bailiffs men dragged her out of a wallcloset where she crouched hidden behind an old box then the bailiff shouted for alice mount and rose to be brought down and proceeded to tie his prisoners together two and tworose contriving to slip back so that she should be marched behind her parents note this part of the story is all quite true and i am not putting into roses lips in her conversation with mr tyrrel one word which she did not really utter chapter twenty five in colchester castle the whole population of much bentley seemed to have turned out to witness the arrest at the blue bell some were kindly and sympathising some bitter and full of taunts but the greater number were simply inquisitive neither friendly nor hostile but gossipping it was now four oclock a time at which half the people were up in the village and many a woman rose an hour earlier than her wont in order to see the strange sight there were the carpenters with baskets of tools slung over their shoulders the gardeners with rake or hoe the labourers with their spades the fishermen with their nets the colne oysterfishery is the oldest of all known fisheries in england and its fame had reached imperial rome itself nearly two thousand years ago when the emperor caligula came over to england partly for the purpose of tasting the colchester oyster the oysters are taken in the colne and placed in pits where they are fattened till they reach the size of a silver oyster preserved among the town treasures in april or may when the baby oyster first appears in the river it looks like a drop from a tallow candle but in twentyfour hours the shell begins to form the value of the oyster spawn as the baby oysters are called in the river is reckoned at twenty thousand pounds and from five to ten thousand pounds worth of oysters is sold every year well master mount how like you your new pair o bracelets said one of the fishermen as william mount was led out and his hands tied with a rough cord friend i count it honour to bear for my lord that which he first bare for me was the meek answer father tye ll never preach a better word than that said a voice in the crowd mr simnel looked up as if to see who spoke go on with thy work old cagemaker cried another voice well not find thee more gaolbirds today than what thou hast youd best hold your saucy tongues said the nettled bailiff nay be not so tetchy master simnel said another the same person never seemed to speak twice a wise precaution since the speaker was less likely to be arrested if he did not repeat the offence five slices of meat be enough for one mans supper this allusion to the number of the prisoners and the rapacity of the bailiff was received with laughter by the crowd the bailiffs temper never of the best was quite beyond control by this time he relieved it by giving mount a heavy blow as he pushed him into line after tying his wife to him hit him back father mount cried one of the voices william mount shook his head with a smile ill hit some of yousee if i dont responded the incensed bailiff who well knew his own unpopularity hush fellows said an authoritative voice will ye resist the queens servants john thurston and his wife were next tied together and placed behind the mounts the crowd remaining quiet while this was being done then they brought rose allen and fastened her by a cord round her wrists to the same rope eh lord have mercy on the young maid said a womans voice in a compassionate tone young witch rather responded a man roughly hold thy graceless tongue jack milman replied a womans shrill tones didnt rose allen make broth for thee when we were both sick and go out of a cold winter night agathering herbs to ease thy pain be shamed to thee if thou knows what shame is casting ill words at her in her trouble just as the prisoners were marched off another voice hitherto silent seemed to come from the very midst of the crowd it said be ye faithful unto death and christ shall give you a crown of life take that man said the bailiff stopping but the man was not to be found nobody knewat least nobody would ownwho had uttered those fearless words so the prisoners were marched away on the road to colchester they went in at bothals gate up bothal street and past the black friars monastery to the castle colchester castle is one of the oldest castles in england for it was built by king edward the elder the son of alfred the great it is a low square mass with the largest norman keep or centre tower in the country the walls are twelve feet thick and the whole ground floor and two of the four towers are built up perfectly solid from the bottom that it might be made as strong as possible it was built with roman bricks and the roman mortar still sticks to some of them builders always know roman mortar for it is so much harder than any mortar people know how to make nowquite as hard as stone itself the chimneys run up through the walls the prisoners were marched up to the great entrance gate on the south side of the castle the bailiff blew his horn and the porter opened a little wicket and looked out give you goodmorrow master bailiff another batch i reckon ay another batch belike youll have your dungeons full ere long oh weve room enough and to spare said the porter with a grin none so many yet two men fetched in yestereven for breaking folks heads in a drunken brawl and two or three debtors and a lad for thieving and such then master maynard brought an handful in this morrowmoot hall was getting too full he said ay so who brought he oh alegar o thorpe and them bits o children o his that should be learning their hornbooks i school sooner than be here trow youd best teach em tom suggested mr simnel with a grim smile now then in with you and the prisoners were marched into the castle dungeon in the corner of the dungeon sat john johnson his bible on his knee and beside him snuggled close to him cissy little will was seated on the floor at his fathers feet playing with some bits of wood johnson looked up as his friends entered why good friends shall i say i am glad or sorry to behold you here glad answered william mount firmly if so we may glorify god im glad i know said cissy jumping from the term and giving a warm hug to rose i thought god would send somebody you see father was down a bit when we came here this morning and left everybody behind us but youve come now and hell be ever so pleased it isnt bad you knownot bad at alland then theres father but rose what have you done to your hand its tied up hush dear only hurt it a bit cissy dont speak of it said rose in an undertone i dont want mother to see it or shell trouble about it maybe it doesnt hurt much now cissy nodded with a face which said that she thoroughly entered into roses wish for silence eh dear dear that we should have lived to see this day cried margaret thurston melting into tears as she sat down in the corner rose said her father suddenly thy left hand is bound up hast hurt it maid roses eyes behind her mothers back said please dont ask me anything about it but alice turned round to look and she had to own the truth why maid that must have been by the closet where i was hid and i never heard thee scream said margaret nay meg i screamed not lackaday how couldst help the same didnt it hurt sore rose asked john thurston not nigh so much as you might think answered rose brightly at the first it caused me some grief but truly the more it burned the less it hurt till at last it was scarce any hurt at all but thou hadst the pot in thine other hand maid wherefore not have hit him a good swing therewith truly meg i thank god that he held mine hand from any such deed the servant of the lord must not strive i should thus have dishonoured my master marry but that may be well enough for angels and such like we dwell in this nether world rose hath the right said william mount we may render unto no man railing for railing if we suffer as christians happy are we for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon us let us not suffer as malefactors you say well neighbour added john thurston we be called to the defence of gods truth but in no wise to defend ourselves nay the lord is the avenger of all that have none other said alice but let me see thine hand child maybe i can do thee some ease under your good leave mother i would rather not unlap it replied rose truly it scarce doth me any hurt now and i bound it well with a wet rag that i trow it were better to let it be it shall do well enough i cast no doubt she did not want her mother to see how terribly it was burned and in her heart was a further thought which she would not put into wordsif they shortly burn my whole body what need is there to trouble about this little hurt to my hand chapter twenty six shutting the door once more the days wore on and no fresh arrests were made but no help came to the prisoners in the castle and the moot hall nor to elizabeth foulkes in the keeping of mr ashby two priests had talked to elizabeth and the authorities were beginning to change their opinion about her they had fancied from her quiet meek appearance that she would be easily prevailed upon to say what they wanted now they found that under that external softness there was a will of iron and a power of endurance beyond anything they had imagined the day of examination for all the prisonersthe last day when they would be sentenced or acquittedwas appointed to be the rd of june on the previous day the commissioners called elizabeth foulkes before them she came accompanied by mr ashby and her uncle and they asked her only one question dost thou believe in a catholic church of christ or no of course elizabeth replied yes for the bible has plenty to say of the church of christ though it never identifies it with the church of rome they asked her no more for boswell the scribe interposed and begged that she might be consigned to the keeping of her uncle the commissioners assented and holt took her away it looks very much as if boswell had wanted her to escape she was much more carelessly guarded in her uncles house than in mr ashbys and could have got away easily enough if she had chosen she was more than once sent to open the front door whence she might have slipped out after dark with almost a certainty of escape it was quite dark when she answered the last rap pray you asked an old mans voice is here a certain young maid by name elizabeth foulkes i am she master what would you with me a word apart he answered in a whisper be any ears about that should not be elizabeth glanced back into the kitchen where her aunt was sewing and her two cousins gauffering the large ruffs which both men and women then wore none that can harm say on my master bessy dost know my voice i do somewhat yet i can scarce put a name thereto i am walter purcas of booking robins father ay i know you well now and i cry you mercy that i did no sooner come away with me bessy he said in a loud whisper i have walked all the way from booking to see if i might save thee for robins sake for he loves thee as he loveth nought else save me mistress wade shall lend me an horse and we can be safe ere night be oer in the house of a good man that i know in a place unsuspect o bessy my dear lass save thyself and come with me save thyself the words had been addressed once before fifteen hundred years back to one who did not save himself because he came to save the world before the eyes of elizabeth rose two visionsone fair and sweet enough a vision of safety and comfort of life and happiness which might be yet in state for her but it was blotted out by the othera vision of three crosses reared on a bare rock when the one who hung in the midst could have saved himself at the cost of the glory of the father and the everlasting bliss of his church and from that cross a voice seemed to whisper to herif any man serve me let him follow me verily i am loth you should have your pain for nought said she but indeed i cannot come with you though i do thank you with all my heart i am set here in ward of mine uncle and for me to scape away would cause penalty to fall on him i cannot save myself at his cost and should not the papists take it to mean that i had not the courage to stand to that which they demanded of me nay father purcas this will i not do for so should i lose my crown and dim the glory of my christ bessy cried her aunt from the kitchen do come within and shut the door maid heres the wind ablowing in till im nigh feared o losing my ears and all the lace like to go up the chimney while thou tarriest chatting yonder what gossip hast thou there canst thou not bring her in bessy come whispered purcas earnestly but elizabeth shook her head the lord bless you i dare not and she shut the door knowing that by so doing she virtually shut it upon life and happinessthat is happiness in this life elizabeth went quietly back to the kitchen and took up an iron she scarcely knew what she was ironing nor how she answered her cousin dorothys rather sarcastic observations upon the interesting conversation which she seemed to have had a few minutes later her eldest cousin a married woman who lived in a neighbouring street lifted the latch and came in good even mother said she well doll and jenny so thou gave in at last bess im fain for thee its no good fighting against a stone wall what dost thou mean chrissy what mean i why didnt thou give in lots o folks is saying so set thy name they say to a paper that thoud yield to the pope and be obedient in all things i hope it were true true that i yielded to the pope and promised to obey him cried elizabeth in fiery indignation its not true christian meynell tell every soul so that asks thee ill die before i do it where be the commissioners thank the saints theyve done their sitting said mrs meynell laughing or i do believe this foolish maid should run right into the lions den mother lock her up tomorrow wont you without shes summoned where are they peremptorily demanded elizabeth sitting down to their supper at mistress cosins was the laughing answer dont thou spoil it by rushing in all of a i shall go to them this minute said elizabeth tying on her hood which she had taken down from its nail no man nor woman shall say such words of me goodnight aunt i thank you for all your goodness and may the good lord bless you and yours for ever farewell and amid a shower of exclamations and entreaties from her startled relatives who never expected conduct approaching to this elizabeth left the house she had not far to go on that last walk in this world the white hart where the commissioners were staying was full of light and animation that night when she stepped into it from the dark street and asked leave to speak a few words to the queens commissioners what would you with them asked a redcheeked maid who came to her that shall they know speedily was the answer the commissioners were rather amused to be told that a girl wanted to see them but when they heard who it was they looked at each other with raised eyebrows and ordered her to be called in they had finished supper and were sitting over their wine as gentlemen were then wont to do rather longer than was good for them elizabeth came forward to the table and confronted them the commissioners themselves were two in number sir john kingston and dr chedsey but the scribe sheriff and bailiffs were also present worshipful sirs she said in a clear voice i have been told it is reported in this town that i have made this day by you submission and obedience to the pope and since this is not true nor by gods grace shall never be i call on you to do your duty and commit me to the queens highness prison that i may yet again bear my testimony for my lord christ there was dead silence for a moment dr chedsey looked at the girl with admiration which seemed almost reverence sir john kingston knit his brows and appeared inclined to examine her there and then boswell half rose as if he would once more have pleaded with or for her but maynard the sheriff whom nothing touched and who was scarcely sober sprang to his feet and dashed his hand upon the table with a cry that the jibbing jade should repent kicking over the traces this time he seized elizabeth marched her to the moot hall and thrust her into the dungeon and with a bass clang as if it had been the very gate of doom the great door closed behind her chapter twenty seven at the bar the great hall of the moot hall in colchester was filling rapidly every townsman and every townswoman wanted to hear the examination and to know the fate of the prisonersof whom there were so many that not many houses were left in colchester where the owners had not some family connection or friend among them into the hall robed in judicial ermine filed the royal commissioners sir john kingston and dr chedsey followed by boswell the scribe robert maynard and robert brown the sheriffs several priests and many magistrates and gentlemen of the surrounding country having opened the court they first summoned before them william bongeor the glazier of saint michaels parish aged sixty then thomas benold the tallowchandler and thirdly robert purcas they asked purcas what he had to say touching the sacrament when we receive the sacrament he answered we receive bread in an holy use that preacheth remembrance that christ died for us the three men were condemned to death and then agnes silverside was brought to the bar she was some time under examination for she answered all the questions asked her so wisely and so firmly that the commissioners themselves were disconcerted they took refuge as such men usually did in abuse calling her ugly names and asking if she wished to burn her rotten old bones helen ewring the millers wife followed and both were condemned then the last of the moot hall prisoners elizabeth foulkes was placed at the bar dost thou believe inquired dr chedsey that in the most holy sacrament of the altar the body and blood of christ is really and substantially present elizabeths reply in her quiet clear voice was audible in every part of the hall i believe it to be a substantial lie and a real lie shame shame cried one of the priests on the bench horrible blasphemy cried another what is it then that there is before consecration asked dr chedsey bread well said and what is there after consecration bread still nothing more nothing more said elizabeth firmly the receiving of christ lies not in the bread but is heavenly and spiritual only what say you to confession i will use none seeing no priest hath power to remit sin will you go to mass i will not for it is idolatry will you submit to the authority of the pope elizabeths answer was even stronger than before i do utterly detest all such trumpery from the bottom of my heart they asked her no more dr chedsey for the sixth and last time assumed the black cap and read the sentence of death thou shalt be taken from here to the place whence thou earnest and thence to the place of execution there to be burned in the fire till thou art dead never before had chedseys voice been known to falter in pronouncing that sentence he had spoken it to whitehaired men and delicate women ay even to little children but this once every spectator looked up in amazement at his tone and saw the judge in tears and then turning to the prisoner they saw her face as it were the face of an angel before any one could recover from the sudden hush of awe which had fallen upon the court elizabeth foulkes knelt down and carried her appeal from that unjust sentence to the higher bar of god almighty o lord our father she said i thank and praise and glorify thee that i was ever born to see this daythis most blessed and happy day when thou hast accounted me worthy to suffer for the testimony of christ and lord if it be thy will forgive them that thus have done against me for they know not what they do how many of us would be likely to thank god for allowing us to be martyrs these were true martyrs who did so men and women so full of the holy ghost that they counted not their lives dear unto themso upheld by gods power that the shrinking of the flesh from that dreadful pain and horror was almost forgotten we must always remember that it was not by their own strength or their own goodness but by the blood of the lamb that christs martyrs have triumphed over death and satan then elizabeth rose from her knees and turned towards the bench like an inspired prophetess she spokethis poor simple humble servantgirl of twenty yearsastonishing all who heard her repent all ye that sit there she cried earnestly and especially ye that brought me to this prison above all thou robert maynard that art so careless of human life that thou wilt oft sit sleeping on the bench when a man is tried for his life repent o ye halting gospellers and beware of bloodguiltiness for that shall call for vengeance yea if ye will not herein repent your wicked doingsand as elizabeth spoke she laid her hand upon the barthis very bar shall be witness against you in the day of judgment that ye have this day shed innocent blood oh how england needs such a prophetess now and above all those halting gospellers the men who talk sweetly about charity and toleration and sit still and will not come to the help of the lord against the mighty they sorely want reminding that christ has said he that is not with us is against us it is a very poor excuse to say oh i am not doing any harm are you doing any good that is the question if not a wooden post is as good as you are and are you satisfied to be no better than a wooden post what grand opportunities there are before boys and girls on the threshold of life what are you going to do with your life remember you have only one and there are only two things you can do with it you must give it to somebodyand it must be either god or satan all the lives that are not given to god fall into the hands of satan there are very few people who say to themselves deliberately now i will not give my life to god they only say oh theres plenty of time i wont do it just now i want to enjoy myself they dont know that there is no happiness on earth like that of deciding for god and so they go on day after day not deciding either way but just frittering their lives away bit by bit until the last day comes and the last bit of life and then it is too late to decide would you like such a poor mean valueless thing as this to be the one life which is all you have would you not rather have a bright rich full life with god himself for your best friend on earth and then a triumphal entry into the golden city and the singers harp and the victors palm and the princes crown and the kings well done good and faithful servant do you say yes i would choose that but i do not know how well then tell the lord that say to him lord i want to be thy friend and servant and i do not know how keep on saying it till he shows you how he is sure to do it for he cares about it much more than you do never fancy for one minute that god does not want you to go to heaven and that it will be hard work to persuade him to let you in he wants you to come more than you want it he gave his own son that you might come greater love hath no man than this now will you not come to himwill you not say to him lord here am i take me are you going to let the lord jesus feel that all the cruel suffering which he bore for you was in vain he is ready to save you if you will let him but he will not do it against your will how shall it be chapter twenty eight the song of triumph elizabeth foulkes was the last prisoner tried in the moot hall the commissioners then adjourned to the castle here there were six prisoners as before the first arraigned was william mount he was asked as they all wereit was the great test question for the marian martyrswhat he had to say of the sacrament of the altar which was another name for the mass i say that it is an abominable idol was his answer wherefore comest thou not to confession sirs i dare not take part in any popish doings for fear of gods vengeance said the brave old man brave ay for the penalty was death but what are they of whom there are so many whose actions if not words say that they dare not refuse to take part in popish doings for fear of mans scorn and ridicule poor mean cowards it was not worth while to go further william mount was sentenced to death and john johnson was brought to the bar neither were they long with him for he had nothing to say but what he had said before he too was sentenced to die then alice mount was brought up she replied to their questions exactly as her husband had done she was satisfied with his answers they should be hers once more the sentence was read and she was led away then rose allen was placed at the bar so little had the past daunted her that she did more than defy the commissioners she made fun of them standing there with her burnt hand still in its wrappings she positively laughed satan and all his servants to scorn they asked her what she had to say touching the mass i say that it stinketh in the face of god see note and i dare not have to do therewith for my life are you not a member of the catholic church i am no member of yours for ye be members of antichrist and shall have the reward of antichrist what say you of the see of the bishop of rome i am none of his as for his see it is for crows kites owls and ravens to swim in such as you be for by the grace of god i will not swim in that sea while i live neither will i have any thing to do therewith nothing could overcome the playful wit of this indomitable girl she punned on their words she laughed at their threats she held them up to ridicule this must be ended for the fourth time dr chedsey assumed the black cap rose kept silence while she was condemned to death but no sooner had his voice ceased than to the amazement of all who heard her she broke forth into song it was verily the shout of them that triumph the song of them that feast she was led out of the court and down the dungeon steps singing till her voice filled the whole court yea though i walk through deaths dark vale yet will i fear none ill thy rod thy staff doth comfort me and thou art with me still which was the happier do you think that night dr chedsey who had read the sentence of death upon ten martyrs or young rose allen who was to be burned to death in five weeks when roses triumphant voice had died away the gaoler was hastily bidden to bring the other two prisoners the commissioners were very much annoyed it was a bad thing for the people who stood by they thought when martyrs insisted on singing in response to a sentence of execution they wanted to make the spectators forget such scenes well where be the prisoners said sir john kingston please your worships they be at the bar answered the gaolor with a grin at the bar man but i see nought be they dwarfs something like said the gaoler he dragged up a form to the bar and lifted on it first will johnson and then cissy good lack such babes as these said sir john in great perplexity he felt it really very provoking here was a girl of twenty who had made fun of him in the most merciless manner and had the audacity to sing when condemned to die thus setting a shocking example and awakening the sympathy of the public and here to make matters worse were two little children brought up as heretics this would never do it was the more awkward from his point of view that cissy was so small that he took her to be much younger than she was i cannot examine these babes said he to chedsey dr chedsey in answer took the examination on himself how old art thou my lad said he to will will made no answer and his sister spoke up for him please sir hes six and what dost thou believe asked the commissioner half scornfully half amused please we believe what father told us who is their father was asked of the gaoler johnson worshipful sirs alegar of thorpe that you have sentenced this morrow gramercy said sir john take them down wastborowetake them down and carry them away have them up another day such babes cissy heard him and felt insulted as a young woman of her age naturally would please sir im not a baby babys a baby but wills six and im going in ten and we are going to be as good as we can and mind all father said to us take them awaytake them away cried sir john wastborowe lifted will down but please said cissy piteouslyisnt nothing to be done to us maynt we go long of father ay for the present answered wastborowe as he took a hand of each to lead them back but isnt father to be burned come along i cant stay said the gaoler hastily even his hard heart shrank from answering yes to that little pleading face but please oh please they mustnt burn father and not us we must go with father wastborowe sir johns voice called back take em down tom said wastborowe to his mannot at all sorry to go away from cissy he ran back to court we are of opinion wastborowe said dr chedsey rather pompously that these children are too young and ignorant to be put to the bar we make order therefore that they be discharged and set in care of some good catholic woman if any be among their kindred and if not let them be committed to the care of some such not akin to them please your worships i know nought of their kindred said the gaoler scratching his head jane hiltoft hath the babe at this present what is there a lesser babe yet asked dr chedsey laughing ay there is so a babe in arms worshipful sirs might it please you to hear a poor woman speak on good wife sirs said the woman who had spoken coming forward out of the crowd my name is ursula felstede and i dwell at thorpe the next door to johnson the babes know me and have been in my charge aforetime may i pray your good worships to set them in my care i have none of mine own and would bring them up to mine utmost as good subjects and honest folks ay so and how about good catholics sirs father tye will tell you i go to mass and confession both so she doth said the priest but i misdoubt somewhat if she be not of the halting gospellers whereof we heard this morrow in the moot hall better put them in charge of the black sisters of hedingham suggested dr chedsey come you this even good woman to the white hart and you shall then hear our pleasure father tye i pray you come with us to supper dr chedsey had quite recovered from his emotions of the morning meanwhile said sir john rising let the morrow of lammas be appointed for the execution of those sentenced see note note roses words are given as she spoke them but it must be remembered that they would not sound nearly so strong to those who heard them as they do to us note lammas is the second of august chapter twenty nine man proposes mrs cosin the landlady of the white hart prepared a very good supper for the commissioners these gentlemen did not fare badly first they had a dish of the oysters for which the town was famous then some roast beef and a big venison pasty then some boiled pigeons then two or three puddings a raspberry pie curds and whey cheese with a good deal of malmsey wine and old sack finishing up with cherries and sweet biscuits they had reached the cherry stage before they began to talk beyond mere passing remarks then the priest said i am somewhat feared master commissioners you shall reckon colchester an infected place seeing there be here so many touched with the poison of heresy it all comes of selfconceit said sir john nay answered dr chedsey selfconceit is scarce wont to bring a man to the stake it were more like to save him from it well but why cant they let things alone inquired sir john helping himself to a biscuit they know well enough what they shall come to if they meddle with matters of religion why dont they leave the priest to think for them dr chedsey was silent not because he did not know the answer the time was when he too had been one of those now despised and condemned gospellers in edward the sixths day he had preached the full rich gospel of the grace of god and now he was a deserter to the enemy some of such menperhaps mostgrew very hard and stony and seemed to take positive pleasure in persecuting those who were more faithful than themselves but there were a few with whom the spirit of god continued to strive who now and then remembered from whence they had fallen and to whom that remembrance brought poignant anguish when it came upon them dr chedsey appears to have been one of this type let us hope that these wandering sheep came home at last in the arms of the good shepherd who sought them with such preserving tenderness but the sad truth is that we scarcely know with certainty of one who did so on the accession of elizabeth when we might have expected them to come forward and declare their repentance if it were sincere they did no such thing they simply dropped into oblivion and we lose them there it is a hard and bitter thing to depart from god how hard and how bitter only those know in this world who try to turn round and come back it will be known fully in that other world whence there is no coming back dr chedsey then was silent not because he did not understand the matter but because he knew it too well sir john had said the protestants knew what they would come to that was the stake and the fire but those who persecuted christ in the person of his electwhat were they going to come to it was not pleasant to think about that dr chedsey was very glad that it was just then announced that a woman begged leave to speak with their worships it shall be yon woman that would fain take the children i cast no doubt said sir john and we have had no talk thereupon shall she have them or no what say you father tye truly that i have not over much trust in felstedes wife she was wont of old time to have biblereadings and prayermeetings at her house and though she feigneth now to be reconciled and catholic yet i doubt her repentance is but skin deep the children were better a deal with the black nuns yetthere may be some time ere we can despatch them thither and if you thought good felstedes wife might have them till then good said sir john call the woman in ursula felstede was called in and stood courtesying at the door sir john put on his stern and pompous manner in speaking to her it seemeth best to the queens graces commission said he that these children were sent in the keeping of the sisters of hedingham yet as time may elapse ere the prioress cometh to town we leave them in thy charge until she send for them thou shalt keep them well learn them to be good catholics and deliver them to the black nuns when they demand it ursula courtesied again and hoped she should do her duty so do i hope said the priest but i give thee warning ursula felstede that thy duty hath not been over well done ere this and tis high time thou shouldst amend if thou desire not to be brought to book ursula dropped halfadozen courtesies in a flurried way please it your reverence i am a right true catholic and shall learn the children so to be mind thou dost said sir john dr chedsey meanwhile had occupied himself in writing out an order for the children to be delivered to ursula to which he affixed the seal of the commission armed with this paper and having taken leave of the commissioners with many protests that she would do her duty ursula made her way to the castle gate who walks so late asked the porter looking out of his little wicket to see who it was good den master style i am james felstedes wife of thorpe and i come with an order from their worships the commissioners to take johnsons children to me they be to dwell in my charge till the black sisters shall send for them want em tonight asked the porter rather gruffly well what say youare they abed im but a poor woman and cannot afford another walk from thorpe id best take em with me now youre never going back to thorpe tonight well nay im going to tarry the night at my brothers outside east gate bless the woman then call for the children in the morning and harry not honest folk out o their lives at bedtime and style dashed the wicket to now then kate be those loaves ready the rogues shall be clamouring for their suppers cried he to his wife katherine style who baked the prison bread brought out in answer a large tray on which three loaves of bread were cut in thick slices with a piece of cheese and a bunch of radishes laid on each these were for the supper of the prisoners style shouted for the gaoler and he came up and carried the tray into the dungeon followed by the porter who was in rather a funny mood andas i am sorry to say is often the casewas not in his fun careful of other peoples feelings now johnson hast thou done with those children said he thoud best make thy last dying speech and confession to em for theyre going away tomorrow morning johnson looked up with a grave white face little cissy who was sitting by rose allen at once ran to her father and twined her arm in his with an uneasy idea of being parted from him though she did not clearly understand what was to happen where was all johnson seemed able to say black nuns of hedingham said the porter he did not say anything about the temporary sojourn with ursula felstede johnson groaned and drew cissy closer to him dont be feared father said cissy bravely though her lips quivered till she could hardly speak dont be feared well never do anything youve told us not god bless thee my darling and god help thee said the poor father little cissy he must be thy father now and looking upwards he said lord take the charge that i give into thine hands this night be thou the father to these fatherless little ones and lead them forth by a smooth way or a rough so it be the right way whereby they shall come to thy holy hill and to thy tabernacle keep them as the apple of thine eye hide them under the covert of thy wings i am no more in the world but these are in the world keep them through thy name give them back safe to my helen and to me in the land

commissioners against me than have the lord be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do but fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto thee fear him and mrs wade walked out of the door without saying another word she was going to look for the children the baby she had already seen asleep on ursulas bed little will she found in the midst of a group of boys down by the brook one of whom a lad twice his size was just about to fight him when mrs wade came up now jack tyler if thou dost not want to be carried to thy father by the scuff of thy neck like a cat and well thrashed to end with let that lad alonewill wheres thy sister little will who looked rather sheepish said over there wheres there on the stile shes

do you good and me too to give you a caning all round i shall have to let be tonight for i want to find cicely well youll see her o top o the stile little will turned back to his absorbing amusement of bulrushplaiting and mrs wade went up to the stile which led to the way over the fields towards colchester as she came near sheltered by the hedge she heard a little voice yea though i walk in vale of death yet will i fear no ill thy rod thy staff doth comfort me and thou art with me still mrs wade crept softly along till she could see through the hedge the stile was a stone one with steps on each side such as may still be seen in the north of england and on the top step sat cissy resting her head upon her hand and looking earnestly in the direction of colchester what dost there my dear heart mrs wade asked gently im looking at father said cissy rather languidly she spoke as if she were not well and could not care much about anything looking at father what dost thou mean my child well you see that belt of trees over yonder when the sun shines i can see all hallows tower stand up against it you cant see it today it does not shine but its there for all that and fathers just behind in the castle so i havent any better way to look at him only god looks at him you know they cant bar him out so i come here and look as far as i can and talk to god about father i cant see father but hes there and i cant see god but hes there too and hes got to see to father now i cant the desolate tone of utter loneliness in the little voice touched mrs wade to the core of her great warm heart my poor little cicely she said doth ursula use thee well yes i suppose so said cissy in a quiet matteroffact way only when i wont pray to her big image she slaps me but she cant make me do it father said not it would never do for god to see us doing things father forbade us because hes shut up and cant come to us im not going to pray to that ugly thing never and if it was pretty it wouldnt make any difference when father said not no dear heart that were idolatry said mrs wade yes i know replied cissy father said so but ursula says the black sisters will make me or theyll put me in the well i do hope god will keep away the black sisters i ask him every day when ive done talking about father i shouldnt like them to put me in the well and she shuddered evidently ursula had frightened her very much with some story about this but god would be there in the well wouldnt he they wont make me do it when father said not chapter thirty one sumptuous apartments well be sure who ever saw such a lad sent out to play at four o the clock and all oer mud at five where hast thou been will speak the truth now been down by the brook rushplaiting said little will looking as if his

sent him up to bed but theres no trusting him to go see he does prithee and cast his clothes into the tub yonder theres a good maid cissy knew very well that ursula spoke so amiably because mrs wade was there to hear her she went up to look after her little brother and the landlady turned to ursula now ursula felstede i want these children then you must ask leave from the queens commissioners mistress wade eh i couldnt give em up if it were ever so i darent for the life o me mrs wade begged coaxed lectured and almost threatened her but for once ursula was firm she dared not give up the children and she was quite honest in saying so mrs wade had to go home without them as she came up very weary and unusually dispirited to the archway of the kings head she heard voices from within i tell you shes not said dorothy dennys voice in a rather frightened tone she went forth nigh four hours agone and whither i know not thats an inquiry for me said mrs wade to herself as she sprang down from her old black mare and gave her a pat before dismissing her to the care of the ostler who ran up to take her good jenny good old lassis there any company giles she asked of the ostler mistress tis master maynard the sheriff and hes making inquiration for you i would you could ha kept away a bit longer dost thou so good giles well i would as god would the sheriff had best have somebody else to deal with him than doll and bab and she went forward into the kitchen barbara her younger servant who was only a girl stood leaning against a dresser looking very white and frightened with the rollingpin in her hand she had evidently been stopped in the middle of making a pie dorothy stood on the hearth fronting the terrible sheriff who was armed with a writ and evidently did not mean to leave before he had seen the mistress i am here mr maynard if you want me said mrs wade quite calmly well said answered the sheriff turning to her i have here a writ for your arrest my mistress and conveyance to the bishops court at london there to answer for your ill deeds i am ready to answer for all my deeds good and ill to any that have a right to question me i will go with youbab go and

willnow master maynard i am ready four days later several strokes were rang on the great bell of the bishops palace at fulham the gaoler came to his gate when summoned by the porter heres a prisoner up from colchesterphilippa wade hostess of the kings head there have you room room and to spare heresy i reckon ay heresythe old tale there must be a nest of it yonder down in essex theres nought else all oer the country methinks said the gaoler with a laugh come in mistress ill show you your lodging his lordship hath an apartment in especial furnished of polished black oak that he keepeth for such as you pray you follow me mrs wade followed the jocose gaoler along a small paved passage between two walls and through a low door which the gaoler barred behind her himself outside and then opened a little wicket through which to speak pray you sit down my mistress on whichsoever of the chairs you count desirable the furniture is all of one sort fair and goodly farfetched and dearbought which is good for gentlewomen and liketh them fast colours the broidery i do ensure you mrs wade looked round so far as she could see by the little wicket everything was blackeven the floor which was covered with black shining lumps of all shapes and sizes she touched one of the lumps there could be no doubt of its nature the polished black oak furniture was cobs of coal and the sumptuous apartment wherein she was tolodged was bishop bonners coalcellar chapter thirty two ready ay ready it was the evening of the first of august the prisoners in the castle now reduced to fourthe mounts rose and johnsonhad held their biblereading and their little evening prayermeeting and sat waiting for supper john and margaret thurston who had been with them until that day were taken away in the morning to undergo examination and had not returned the prisoners had not yet heard when they were to die they only knew that it would be soon and might be any day yet we are told they remained in their dungeons with much joy and great comfort in continual reading and invocating the name of god ever looking and expecting the happy day of their dissolution we should probably feel more inclined to call it a horrible day but they called it a happy day they expected to change their prison for a palace and their prison bonds for golden harps and the prison fare for the fruit or the tree of life and the company of scoffers and tormentors for that of seraphim and cherubim and the blessed dead and above all to see his face who had laid down his life for them supper was late that evening they could hear voices outside with occasional exclamations of surprise and now and then a peal of laughter at length the door was unlocked and the gaolers man came in with four trenchers piled on each other on each of which was laid a slice of ryebread and a piece of cheese he served out one to each prisoner want your appetites sharpened said he with a sarcastic laugh because if you do theres news for you prithee let us hear it bartle answered mount quietly well first writs is come down moot hall prisoners suffer at six tomorrow on the waste by lexden road and youll get your deserving i th afternoon in the castle yard god be praised solemnly responded william mount and the others added an amen well youre a queer set said bartle looking at them i shouldnt want to thank nobody for it if so be i was going to be hanged and thats easier of the two we are only going home answered william mount the climb may be steep but there is rest and ease at the end thereof well you seem mighty sure ont i know nought priests say youll find yourselves in a worser place nor you think nay god is faithful said johnson have it your own way i wish you might for you seem to me a deal tidier folks than most that come our way howbeit my news isnt all told alegar your brats be gone to hedingham god go with them replied johnson but he seemed much sadder to hear this than he had done for his own doom and margaret thurstons recanted shes reconciled and had to better lodging it was evident though to bartles astonishment that the prisoners considered this the worst news of all and john thurston ah they arent so sure of him they think hell bear a faggot but its not certain yet god help and strengthen him and mistress wade of the kings head is had up to london to the bishop god grant her his grace ive told you all now goodnight the greeting was returned and bartle went out he was commissioned to carry the writ down to the moot hall not many minutes later wastborowe entered the dungeon with the writ in his hand the prisoners were conversing over their supper but the sight of that document brought silence without any need to call for it hearken said wastborowe at six oclock in the morning on the waste piece by lexden road shall suffer the penalty of the law these men and women underwrittenwilliam bongeor thomas benold robert alias william purcas agnes silverside alias downes alias smith alias may helen ewring elizabeth foulkes agnes bowyer with one accord led by mr benold the condemned prisoners stood up and thanked god agnes bowyer repeated wastborowe in some perplexity your names not bowyer its bongeor bongeor said its bearer is my name wrong set down pray you mr wastborowe have it put right without delay that i be not left out i should think youd be uncommon glad if you were said he nay but in very deed it should grieve me right sore she replied earnestly let there not be no mistake i do entreat you ill see to it said wastborowe as he left the prison the prisoners had few preparations to make each had a garment readya long robe of white linen falling straight from the neck to the ankles with sleeves which buttoned at the wrist there were many such robes made during the reign of marytypes of those fairer white robes which would be given to every one of them when they should have crossed the dark valley and come out into the light of the glory of god only agnes bongeor and helen ewring had something else to part with with agnes in her prison was a little baby only a few weeks old and she must bid it goodbye and commit it to the care of some friend helen ewring had to say farewell to her husband who came to see her about four in the morning and to the surprise of elizabeth foulkes she found herself summoned also to an interview with her widowed mother and her uncle holt why mother exclaimed elizabeth in astonishment i never knew you were any where nigh didst thou think my lass that aught d keep thy mother away from thee when she knew ive been here these six weeks awaiting to hear eh my pretty mawther see note but to see this day ive looked for thee to be some good mans wife and a happy womansuch a good maid as thou always wastand now well well the will of the lord be done a happy woman mother said elizabeth with her brightest smile in all my life i never was so happy as this day this is my wedding day nay this is my crowning day for ere the sun be high this day i shall have seen the face of christ and have been by him presented faultless before the light of the glory of god mother rejoice with me and rejoice for me for i can do nothing save rejoice glory be to god on high and on earth peace goodwill towards men there was glory to god but little goodwill towards men when the six prisoners were marched out into high street on their way to martyrdom yet only one sorrowful heart was in the dungeon of the moot hall and that was agnes bongeors who lamented bitterly that owing to the misspelling of her name in the writ she was not allowed to make the seventh she actually put on her robe of martyrdom in the hope that she might be reckoned among the sufferers now when she learned that she was not to be burned that day her distress was poignant let me go with them she cried let me go and give my life for christ alack the day the lord counts me not worthy the other six prisoners were led tied together two and two through high street and up to the head gate first came william bongeor and thomas benold then mrs silverside and mrs ewring last robert purcas and elizabeth foulkes they were led out of the head gate to a plot of ground hard by the town wall on the outward side beside the lexden road there stood three great wooden stakes with a chain affixed to each the clock of saint maryatwalls struck six as they reached the spot around the stakes a multitude were gathered to see the sight mr ewring with set face trying to force a smile for his wifes encouragement mrs foulkes gazing with clasped hands and tearful eyes on her daughter thomas holt and all his family mr ashby and all his ursula felstede looking very unhappy dorothy denny looking very sad old walter purcas leaning on his staff from time to time shaking his white head as if in bitter lamentation a little behind the others mrs clere and amy and in front busiest of the busy sir thomas tye and nicholas clere there they all were ready and waiting to see the moot hall prisoners die note girl this is a suffolk provincialism chapter thirty three how they went home arrived at the spot where they were to suffer the prisoners knelt down to pray but not in such sort as they would for the cruel tyrants would not suffer them foremost of their tormentors at this last moment was nicholas clere who showed an especial spite towards elizabeth foulkes and interrupted her dying prayers to the utmost of his power when elizabeth rose from her knees and took off her outer garmentsunderneath which she wore the prepared robeshe asked the bailiffs leave to give her petticoat to her mother it was all the legacy in her power to leave even this poor little comfort was denied her the clothes of the sufferers were the perquisite of the sheriffs men and they would not give them up elizabeth smiledshe did nothing but smile that morningand cast the petticoat on the ground farewell all the world she said farewell faith farewell hope then she took the stake in her arms and kissed it welcome love ay faith and hope were done with now a few moments and faith would be lost in sight hope would be lost in joy but love would abide for ever and ever her mother came up and kissed her my blessed dear she said be strong in the lord they chained the two elder men at one stake the two women at another elizabeth and robert together at the last the sheriffs men put the chain round them both and hammered the other end fast so that they should not attempt to escape escape none of them dreamed of such a thing they cared neither for pain nor shame to their eyes heaven itself was open and the lord christ on the right hand of the father would rise to receive his servants nor did they say much to each other there would be time for that when all was over were they not going the journey together would they not dwell in happy company through the long years of eternity the man who was nailing the chain close to where elizabeth stood accidentally let his hammer slip he had not intended to hurt her but the hammer came down heavily upon her shoulder and made a severe wound she turned her head to him and smiled on him then she lifted up her eyes to heaven and prayed her last few moments were spent in alternate prayer and exhortation of the crowd the torch was applied to the firewood and tarbarrels heaped around them as the flame sprang up the six martyrs clapped their hands and from the bystanders a great cry rose to heaven the lord strengthen them the lord comfort them the lord pour his mercies upon them ah it was not england but rome who burned those marian martyrs the heart of england was sound and true she was a victim not a persecutor just as the flame reached its fiercest heat there was a slight cry in the crowd which parted hither and thither as a girl was borne out of it insensible she had fainted after uttering that cry it was no wonder said those who stood near the combined heat of the august sun and the fire was scarcely bearable she would come round shortly if she were taken into the shade to recover halfanhour afterwards nothing could be seen beside the lexden road but the heated and twisted chains with fragments of charred wood and of grey ashes the crowd had gone home and the martyrs had gone home too no more should the sun light upon them nor any heat the lamb in the midst of the throne had led them to living fountains of water and they were comforted for evermore who was that young woman that swooned and had to be borne away asked a woman in the crowd of another as they made their way back into the town the woman appealed to was audrey wastborowe oh it was amy clere of the magpie said she the heat was too much for her i reckon ay it was downright hot said the neighbour something beside the heat had been too much for amy clere the familiar face of elizabeth foulkes with that unearthly smile upon it had gone right to the girls heart for amy had a heart though it had been overlaid by a good deal of rubbish the crowd did not disperse far they were gathered again in the afternoon in the castle yard when the mounts and johnson and rose allen were brought out to die they came as joyfully as their friends had done calling upon the name of god and exhorting the people earnestly to flee from idolatry once more the cry rose up from the whole crowd lord strengthen them and comfort them and pour thy mercy upon them and the lord heard and answered joyfully joyfully they went home and the happy company who had stood true and had been faithful unto death were all gathered together for ever in the starry halls above to two other places the cry penetrated to agnes bongeor weeping in the moot hall because she was shut out from that blessed company and to margaret thurston in her better lodging in the castle who had shut herself out and had bought life by the denial of her lord the time is not faroff when we too shall be asked to choose between these two alternatives not perhaps between earthly life and death though it may come to that but between faith and unfaithfulness between christ and idols between the love that will give up all and the selflove that will endure nothing which shall it be with you will you add your voice to the side which tamely yields the priceless treasures purchased for us by these noble men and women at this awful cost or will you meet the romanising enemy with a firm front and a shout of no fellowship with idolsno surrender of the liberty which our fathers bought with their hearts blood god grant you grace to choose the last when mrs clere reached the magpie she went up to amys room and found her lying on the bed with her face turned to the wall amy what ailed thee my maidart better now mother were all wrong dear heart what does the child mean inquired the puzzled mother has the sun turned thy wits out o door the sun did nought to me mother it was bessies face that i could not bear bessies face that i knew so wellthe face that had lain beside me on this pillow over and over againand that smile upon her lips as if she were half in heaven alreadymother it was dreadful i felt as if the last day were come and the angels were shutting me out hush thee child hush thee tis not safe to speak such things heretics go to the ill place as thou very well wist names dont matter do they mother it is truth that signifies whatever names they please to call bessie foulkes she had heaven and not hell in her face that smile of hers never came from satan i know what his smiles are like ive seen them on other faces afore now he never had nought to do with her amy if thy father hears thee say such words as those hell be proper angry be sure amy sat up on the bed mother you know that bessie foulkes loved god and feared him and cared to please him as you and i never did in all our lives do folks that love god go to satan does he punish people because they want to please him i know little enough about it alacktheday but if an angel came from heaven to tell me bessie wasnt there this minute i could not believe him well well think what you will child only dont say it ive nothing against bess being in heaven not i i hope she may be poor lass but thou knowest thy fathers right set against it all and the priests too and amy i dont want to see thee on the waste by lexden road just hold thy tongue wilt thou or thoult find thyself in the wrong box afore long mother i dont think bessie foulkes is sorry for what happened this morning maybe not but do hold thy peace i can hold my peace if you bid me mother ive not been a good girl but i mean to try and be better i dont feel as if i should ever care again for the gewgaws and the merrymakings that i used to think all the world of its like as if id had a glimpse into heaven as she went in and the world had lost its savour but dont be feared mother ill not vex you nor father neither if you dont wish me to talk only nobody ll keep me from trying to go after bessie chapter thirty four dorothy takes a message now then attend cant you how much sugar please sister mary my head does ache so no excuses cicely answer at once a long sobbing sigh preceded the wordshalf a pound now get to your sewing cicely i must be obeyed and you are a right perverse child as one might look for with the training you have had let me hear no more about headache its nothing but nonsense but my head does ache dreadfully sister well it is your own fault if it do two mortal hours were you crying last nightthe stars know what for it was because i didnt hear nothing about father said poor cissy sorrowfully mistress wade promised she mistress wadewho is that please shes the hostess of the kings head and she said she would let me know when when what when father couldnt have any pain ever any more do you mean that you wish to hear your father is dead you wicked child cissy looked up wearily into the nuns face hes in pain now she said for he is waiting and knows he will have more but when it has come he will have no more never but will live with god and be happy for ever and ever i want to know that fathers happy how can these wicked heretics fall into such delusions said sister mary looking across the room at sister joan who shook her head in a way which seemed to say that there was no setting any bounds to the delusions of heretics foolish child thy father is a bad man and bad men do not go to heaven fathers not a bad man said cissy not angrily but in a tone of calm persuasion that nothing would shake i cry you mercy sister mary but you dont know him and somebody has told you wrong fathers good and loves god and people are not bad when they love god and do what he says to them youre mistaken please sister but thy father does not obey god child because he does not obey the church please i dont know anything about the church father obeys the bible and that is gods own word which he spoke himself the church cant be any better than that the church for thee is the priest who will tell thee how to please god and the holy mother if thou wilt hearken but the priests a man sister and gods book is a great deal better than that the priest is in gods stead and conveys his commands but ive got the commands sister mary in the book and god hasnt written a new one has he silly child the church is above any book oh no it cant be sister please what father bade me do his own self must be better than what other people bid me and so what god says in his own book must be better than what other people say and the church is only people cicely be silent thou art a very silly perverse child i dare say i am sister but i am sure thats true sister joan was on the point of bidding cissy hold her tongue in a still more authoritative manner when one of the lay sisters entered the room to say that a woman asked permission to speak with one of the teaching sisters what is her name she says her name is denny denny i know nobody of that name oh please is her name dorothy asked cissy eagerly if its dorothy denny mrs wade has sent hershes mrs wades servant oh do let me silence said sister mary i will go and speak with the woman she found in the guestchamber a woman of about thirty who stood dropping courtesies as if she were very uncomfortable very uncomfortable dorothy denny was she did not know what nervous meant but she was exceedingly nervous for all that in the first place she felt extremely doubtful whether if she trusted herself inside a convent she would ever have a chance of getting out again and in the second she was deeply concerned about several things of which one was cissy what do you want good woman please you madam i cry you mercy for troubling of you but if i might speak a word with the dear child what dear child asked the nun placidly dorothys fright grew were they going to deny cissy to her or even to say that she was not there please you good sister i mean little ciscicely johnson an it like you that i was sent to with a message from my mistress the hostess of the kings head in colchester cicely johnson is not now at liberty you can give the message to me may i wait till i can see her plainly dorothy was no unfaithful messenger when her own comfort only was to be sacrificed sister mary considered a moment and then said she would see if cicely could be allowed to have an interview with her visitor bidding dorothy sit down she left the room for quite an hour dorothy sat waiting until she began to think the nuns must have forgotten her existence and to look about for some means of reminding them of it there were no bells in sittingrooms at that time except in the form of a little handbell on a table and for this last dorothy searched in vain then she tried to go out into the passage in the hope of seeing somebody but she was terrified to find herself locked in she did not know what to do the window was barred with an iron grating there was no escape that way poor dorothy began to wonder whether if she found herself a prisoner she could contrive to climb the chimney and what would become of her after doing so when she heard at last the welcome sound of approaching steps and the key was turned in the lock the next minute cissy was in dorothys arms o dorothy dear dorothy tell me quickfather cissy could get no further he is at rest my dear heart and shall die no more cissy was not able to answer for the sobs that choked her voice and dorothy smoothed her hair and petted her nay grieve not thus sweet heart she said oh no it is so wicked of me sobbed poor cissy i thought i should have been so glad for father and i can only think of me and the children weve got no father now nay my dear heart thou hast as much as ever thou hadst he is only gone upstairs and left you down he isnt dead little cissy hes alive in a way he never was before and he shall live for ever and ever neither dorothy nor cissy had noticed that a nun had entered with her and they were rather startled to hear a voice out of the dark corner by the door take heed good woman how thou learn the child such errors that is only true of great saints and the man of whom you speak was a wicked heretic i know not what sort of folks your saints are said dorothy bravely but my saints are folks that love god and desire to please him and that john johnson was if ever a man were in this evil world an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit the nun crossed herself but she did not answer it would be as well if folks would be content to set the bad folks in prison and let the good ones be said dorothy cissy our mistress is up to london to the bishop will they do somewhat to her god knoweth said dorothy shaking her head sorrowfully i shall be fain if i may see her back oh i shall oh i hope they wont said cissy her eyes filling again with tears i love mistress wade chapter thirty five nobody left for cissy please dorothy whats become of rose allen and bessy foulkes and mistress mount and all of them all gone my dear heartall with thy father are they all gone said cissy with another sob isnt there one left not one of them then if we came out we shouldnt find nobody prithee reckon not cicely said the nun that thou art likely to come out there is no such likelihood at all whilst our good queen reigneth and if it please god she shall have a son after her that shall be true to the catholic faith as she is and not suffer evil courses and naughty heretics to be any more in the realm ye will abide here till it be plainly seen whether god shall grant to thee and thy sister the grace of a vocation and if not it shall be well seen to that ye be in care of good catholic folk that shall look to it ye go in the right way so prithee suffer not thy fancy to deceive thee with any thought of going forth of this house of religion when matters be somewhat better established and the lands whereof the church hath been robbed are given back to her and all the religious put back in their houses or new ones built then will england be an isle of saints as in olden time and men may rejoice thereat cissy listened to this long speech which she only understood in part but she gathered that the nuns meant to keep her a prisoner as long as they could but sister joan said she you dont know do you what god is going to do perhaps he will give us another good king or queen like king edward i ask him to do every day but please what is a vocation thou dost thou wicked maid i never heard thee but i dont ask you sister joan i ask god and i think hell do it too what is a vocation please what im afeared thou wilt never have thou sinful heretic childthe call to become a holy sister who is to call me i am a sister now im wills and babys sister nobody cant call me to be a sister to nobody else said cissy getting very negative in her earnestness sister joan rose from her seat the time is up said she say farewell to thy friend farewell dorothy dear said cissy clinging to the one person she knew who seemed to belong to her past as she never would have thought of doing to dorothy denny in bygone days please give mistress wade my duty when she comes home and say im trying to

have a proper bill to pay in the next world if they dont get it in this poor little pretty dear you will drink a cup of ale and eat a manchet asked sister joan of dorothy a manchet was a cake of the best bread no i thank you sister i am not ahungered was the answer but dolly you did not come all the way from colchester said cissy ay i did so my dear in the millers cart and im journeying back in the same i covenanted to meet him down at the end of yonder lane at three oclock and methinks i had best be on my way ay you have no time to lose responded sister joan dorothy found mr ewring waiting for her at the end of the lane have you had to eat dorothy was his first question when she had climbed up beside him never a bite or sup in that house master i thank you was dorothys rejoinder if id been starving o hunger i wouldnt have touched a thing have you seen the children ive seen cissy that was enough and to spare what do they with her they are working hard with both hands to make an angel of her at the soonestthats what they are doing its not what they mean to do they want to make her a devil or one of the devils children which comes to the same thing but the lord ll not suffer that or im a mistaken woman they are trying to bend her and they never will shell break first so theyll break her and then therell be no more they can do thats about where it is master ewring why dorothy i never saw you thus stirred aforetime maybe not it takes a bit to stir me but ive got it this even i can tell you i could wellnigh mistake you for mistress wade said mr ewring with a smile eh poor mistress but if she could see that poor little dear it would grieve her to her heart master ewring how long will the lord bear with these sons of satan ah dorothy thats more than you or i can tell many shall be purified and made white and tried that is all we know how much is many asked dorothy almost bitterly not one too many said the miller gravely and not one too few we are called to wait until our brethren be accomplished that shall suffer it may be shorter than we think but dorothy who set you among the prophets i rather thought you had not over much care for such things master ewring ive heard say that when a soldiers killed in battle another steppeth up behind without delay to fill his place theres some places wants filling at colchester where the firings been fierce of late and when most of the old warriors be killed theyll be like to fill the ranks up with new recruits and if they be a bit awkward and dont step just up to pace maybe theyll learn by and by and meantime the others must have patience the lord perfect that which concerneth thee said the miller with much feeling dorothy was your mistress not desirous to have brought up these little ones herself she was so master ewring and i would with all my heart she could poor little dears i would have taken the lad if it might have been compassed when he was a bit older and have bred him up to my own trade the maids should have done better with good mistress wade eh master little cicelys like to dwell in other keeping than either and thats with her good father and mother above the lords will be done responded mr ewring if so be she at least will have little sorrow chapter thirty six into the lions mouth give you good den master hiltoft may a man have speech of your prisoner mistress bongeor youre a bold man master ewring wherefore wherefore sotting your head in the lions mouth i should have thought youd keep as far from moot hall as you could compass yourself not unsuspected and had one burned already from your housei marvel at you that you hide not yourself behind your cornmeasures and floursacks and have a care not to show your face in the street and here up you march as bold as hector and desire to have speech of a prisoner wellits your business not mine friend mine hearth is desolate and i have only god to my friend do you marvel that i haste to do his work whilst it is day or that i desire to be approved of him you go a queer way about it i reckon you think with the old saw proverb the nearer the church the further from heaven that is true but in some sense verily the nearer some churches and some priests so it is may i see mistress bongeor ay you would fain not commit yourself i see more than may be come you have a bit of prudence left so much the better for you come in and ill see if wastborowes in a reasonable temper and that hangs somewhat on the one that audreys in the porter shut the gate behind mr ewring and went to seek wastborowe just then jane hiltoft coming to her door saw him waiting and invited him to take a seat fine morning master ay it is jane have you yet here poor johnsons little maid i havent master and i feel fair lost without the dear babe a rare good child she wasnever see a better the black ladies of hedingham has got her and im all to pieces afeard theyll not tend her right way how should nuns saving their holy presences know aught about babes and such like eh dear theyd better have left her with me id have taken to her altogether if simond have let meand i think he would after a bit and shed have done well with me too ay jane youd have cared her well for the body i cast no doubt dear heart but its sore pity master ewring such a good man as you cannot be a good catholic like every body else youd save yourself ever so much trouble and sorrow i cannot think why you dont we should save ourselves a little sorrow jane but we should have a deal more than we lost but how so master its only giving up an opinion maybe so with some but not with us they that have been taught this way by others and never knew christ for themselveswith them as you say it were but the yielding of opinion but to us that know him and have heard his voice it would be the betraying of the best friend in earth or heaven and we cannot do that jane hiltoftnot even for life nay that stands to reason if it were so master ewring but trust me i know not what you mean no more than if you spake latin read gods book and pray for his spirit and you shall find out janewell hiltoft wastborowe says you may see mistress bongeor if youll give him a royal farthing but he wont let you for a penny less hes had words with their audrey and hes as savage as denis of siccarus who was he hiltoft answered mr ewring with a smile as he felt in his purse for the halfcrown which was to be the price of his visit to agnes bongeor eh i dont know i heard master doctor say the other day that his dog was as fierce as him art sure he said not syracuse dare say he might syracuse or siccarus alls one to me at the door of the dungeon stood the redoubtable wastborowe his keys hanging from his girdle and looking to put it mildly not particularly amiable want letting out again by and by he inquired with grim satire as mr ewring put the coin in his hand if you please wastborowe youve no writ to keep me have you haventworse luck only wish i had ill set a match to the lot of you with as much pleasure as id drink a pot of ale itll never be good world till were rid of heretics therell be satan left then methinks and maybe a few rogues and murderers to boot never a one as bad as you lutherans and gospellers get you in youll have to wait my time to come out very well said mr ewring quietly and went in he found agnes bongeor seated in a corner of the window recess with her bible on her knee but it was closed and she looked very miserable well my sister and how is it with you as tis like to be master ewring with her whom the lord hath cast forth and reckons unworthy to do him a service did he so reckon abraham then at the time of the offering up of isaac isaac was not sacrificed he was turned back from the same yet what saith the lord unto him because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thou shalt be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice see you his good will thereto is reckoned as though he had done the thing the lord looketh on the heart doubt thou not my good sister but firmly believe that to thee also faith is counted for righteousness and the will passeth for the deed with him who saith that if thou be christs then art thou abrahams seed thats comforting in truth said poor agnes but master ewring think you there is any hope that i may yet be allowed to witness for my lord before men in very deed to have come so near and be thrust back is there no hope agnes bongeor was not the only one of the sufferers in this persecution who actually coveted and longed for martyrdom if the imperial crown of all the world had been laid at their feet they would have reckoned it beneath contempt in comparison with that crown of life promised to such as are faithful unto death not faithful till death but unto it i know not what the lord holds in reserve for thee my sister i only know that whatsoever it be it is that whereby thou mayest best glorify him is that not enough if more glory should come to him by thy dying in this dungeon after fifty years imprisonment than by thy burning which wouldst thou choose speak truly agnes dropped her face upon her hands for a moment you have the right master ewring said she when she looked up again i fear i was over full of myself let the lords will be done and his glory ensured by his doing with me whatsoever he will i will strive to be patient and not grieve more than i should therein wilt thou do well my sister and now i gowhen as it shall please wastborowe added mr ewring with a slight smile of amusement and then growing graveto visit one in far sorer trouble than thyself eh master who is that it is margaret thurston who hath not been nor counted herself rejected of the lord but hath of her own will rejected him she bought life by recanting eh poor soul how miserable must she be tell her if it like you that i will pray for her maybe the lord will grant to both of us the grace yet to be his witnesses mr ewring had to pass four weary hours in the dungeon before it pleased wastborowe to let him out he spent it in conversing with the other prisonersall of whom save agnes bongeor were arrested for some crimeand trying to do them good at last the heavy door rolled back and wastborowes voice was heard inquiring in accents which did not sound particularly sober wheres yon companion that wants baking by lexden road i am here wastborowe said mr ewring rising good den friends the lord bless and comfort thee my sister and out he went into the summer evening air to meet the halftipsy gaolers farewell of there take to thy heels old shortbread afore thourt done a bit too brown thoult get it some of these days chapter thirty seven remember mr ewring only returned wastborowes uncivil farewell by a nod as he walked up high street towards east gate at the corner of tenants lane he turned to the left and went up to the castle a request to see the prisoner there brought about a little discussion between the porter and the gaoler and an appeal was apparently made to some higher authority at length the visitor was informed that permission was granted on condition that he would not mention the subject of religion the condition was rejected at once mr ewring had come to talk about that and nothing else then youd best go home said bartle cant do to have matters set acrooked again when they are but now coming straight margaret thurstons reconciled and weve hopes for john though hes been harder of the two to bring round never do to have folks coming and setting em all wrong side up do you want to see em burned my master i want to see them true was mr ewrings answer the burning doesnt much matter oh doesnt it sneered bartle youll sing another tune master ewring the day youre set alight methinks friend those you have burned sang none other but how about a thousand years hence bartholomew crane what manner of tune wilt thou be singing then time enough to say when ive got it pricked master said bartle but mr ewring saw from his uneasiness that the shot had told people were much more musical in england three hundred years ago than now nearly everybody could sing or read music at sight and a lady was thought very poorly educated if she could not setthat is write down a tune properly on hearing it played writing music they called pricking it mr ewring did not stay to talk with bartle he bade him goodbye and walked up tenants lane on his way home but before he had gone many yards an idea struck him and he turned round and went back to the castle bartle was still in the court and he peeped through the wicket to see who was there good lack youre come again im come again said mr ewring smiling bartle wilt take a message to the thurstons for me depends said bartle with a knowing nod whats it about if you want to tell em price of flour i dont mind i only want you to say one word to either of them come thats jolly whats the word remember bartle scratched his head remember what theres the rub leave that to them said mr ewring wellidontknow said bartle very slowly mayhap i shant remember mayhap that shall help you replied the miller holding up an angelet namely a gold coin value shillings pencethe smallest gold coin then made shouldnt wonder if that strengthened my wits said bartle with a grin as the little piece of gold was slipped through the wicket thats over a penny a letter baint it fivepence its good pay its none so bad im in hopes youll have a few more messages master ewring theyre easy to carry when they come in a basket o that metal ah bartle wilt thou do that for a gold angelet which thou wouldst not for the love of god or thy neighbour beware that all thy good things come not to thee in this lifewhich can only be if they be things that pertain to this life alone this lifes enough for me master its all ive got truth friend therefore cast it not away in folly in a good sooth master ewring i love your angelets better than your preachment and you paid me not to listen to a sermon but to carry a message good den good den bartle may the lord give thee good ending bartle stood looking from the wicket until the miller had turned the corner yons a good man i do believe said he to himself i marvel what they burn such men for theyre never found lying or cheating or murdering why couldnt folks let em alone we shouldnt want to hurt em if the priests would let us alone marry this would be a good land if there were no priests bartle shut the wicket and prepared to carry in supper to his prisoners john and margaret thurston were not together the priests were afraid to let them be so lest john who stood more firmly of the two should talk over margaret they occupied adjoining cells bartle opened a little wicket in the first and called john to receive his rations of brown bread onions and weak ale i promised to give you a message said he but i dont know as its like to do you much good its only one word should be a weighty one said john what is it remember ah john thurstons longdrawn exclamation which ended with a heavy sigh astonished bartle theres more in it than i reckoned seemingly said he as he turned to margarets cell and opened her wicket to pass in the supper heres a message for you meg from master ewring the miller lets see what youll say to itremember remember cried margaret in a pained tone dont i always remember isnt it misery to me to remember and cant i guess what he meansremember from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works eh then theres repentance yet for them that have fallen i will fight against thee except thou repent god bless you bartle youve given me a buffet and yet a hope thats a proper powerful word is that said bartle never knew one word do so much afore there was more power in that one word from holy writ than bartle guessed the single word sent home to their consciences by the holy ghost brought quit different messages to the two to whom it was sent to john thurston it did not say remember from whence thou hast fallen that was the message with which it was charged for margaret but to john it said call to remembrance the former days in which after that ye were illuminated ye endured a great flight of afflictions knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward that was johns message and it found him just on the brink of casting his confidence away and stopped him mr ewring had never spent an angelet better than in securing the transmission of that one word which was the instrument in gods hand to save two immortal souls as he reached the top of tenants lane he met ursula felstede carrying a large bundle with which she tried to hide her face and to slink past the miller stopped good den ursula wither away truly master to the whitsters with this bundle the whitster meant what we should now call a dyer and cleaner do you mind ursula what the prophet daniel saith that many shall be purified and made white methinks it is going on now white as no fuller on earth can white them may you and i be so cleansed friend good den ursula courtesied and escaped and mr ewring passed through the gate and went up to his desolated home he stood a moment in the milldoor looking back over the town which he had just left the night cometh when no man can work he said to himself grant me lord to be about thy business until the master cometh and he knew while he said it that in all likelihood to him that coming would be in a chariot of fire and that to be busied with that work would bring it nearer and sooner chapter thirty eight filling the ranks as mr ewring stood looking out he saw somebody coming up from the gate towards the milla girl who walked slowly as if she felt very hot or very tired the day was warm but not oppressively so and he watched her coming languidly up the road till he saw that it was amy clere what could she want at the mill mr ewring waited to see good den mistress amy said he as she came nearer amy looked up as if it startled her to be addressed good den master ewring fathers sending some corn to be ground and he desired you to know the last was ground a bit too fine for his liking would you take the pains to have it coarser ground an it please you i will see to it mistress amy a fine even methinks ay right fair replied amy in that manner which shows that the speakers thoughts are away elsewhere but she did not offer to go she lingered about the milldoor in the style of one who has something to say which she is puzzled or unwilling to bring out you seem weary said mr ewring kindly pray you sit and rest you a space in the porch amy took the seat suggested at once master clere is well i trustand mistress clere likewise they are well i thank you mr ewring noticed suddenly that amys eyes were full of tears mistress amy said he i would not by my goodwill be meddlesome in matters that concern me not but it seemeth me all is scarce well with you if so be that i can serve you any way i trust you will say so much master ewring i am the unhappiest maid in all colchester truly i am right sorry to hear it i lack one to help me and i know not to whom to turn you could if then in very deed i will pray give me to wit how amy looked up at him master ewring i set out for heaven and i have lost the way why mistress amy surely you know well enough no i dont she said cutting him short lackaday i never took no heed when i might have learned it and now have i no chance to learn and everything to hinder i dont know a soul i could ask about it the priest suggested mr ewring a little constrainedly this language astonished him from nicholas cleres daughter i dont want the priests way he isnt going himself or if he is its back foremost master ewring help me i mean it i never wist a soul going that way save bessy foulkes and shes got there and i want to go her way what am i to do mr ewring did not speak for a moment he was thinking in the first place how true it was that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church and in the second what very unlikely subjects god sometimes chooses as the recipients of his grace one of the last people in colchester whom he would have expected to fill elizabeth foulkes vacant place in the ranks was the girl who sat in the porch looking up at him with those anxious earnest eyes mistress amy he said you surely know there is peril in this path it were well you should count the cost afore you enter on it where is there not peril was the answer i may be slain of lightning tomorrow or die of some sudden malady this next month can you say surely that there is more peril of burning than of that if not come to mine help i must find the way somehow master ewring i want to be safe i want to feel that it will not matter how or when i go because i know whither it shall be and i have lost the way i thought i had but to do well and be as good as i could and i should sure come out safe and i have tried that way awhile and it serves not first i cant be good when i would and again the better i am as folks commonly reckon goodnessthe worser i feel theres somewhat inside me that wont do right and theres somewhat else that isnt satisfied when i have done right it wants something more and i dont know what it is master ewring you do tell me mistress amy what think you religion to be nay i always thought it were being good if its not that i know not what it is but being good must spring out of something that is the flower what is the seedthat which is to make you be good and find it easy and pleasant tell me said amys eyes more than her words my dear maid religion is fellowship living fellowship with the living lord it is neither being good nor doing good though both will spring out of it it is an exchange made between you and the lord christ his righteousness for your iniquity his strength for your weakness his rich grace for your bankrupt poverty of all goodness mistress amy you want christ our lord and the holy ghost which he shall give youthe new heart and the right spirit which be his gift and which he died to purchase for you thats it said amy with a light in her eyes but how come you by them you may have them for the askingif you do truly wish it whosoever will let him take the water of life know you what saint austin saith thou wouldst not now be setting forth to find god if he had not first set forth to find thee for by grace ye are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god keep fast hold of that mistress amy that ll do said amy under her breath ive got what i want now if hell hearken to me but o master ewring im not fit to keep fellowship with him dear maid you are that which the best and the worst man in the world area sinner that needeth pardon a sinner that can be saved only through grace have you the chance to get hold of a bible or no no father gave up his to the priest months agone i never cared nought about it while i had it and now ive lost the chance trust the lord to care for you he shall send you be sure either the quails or the manna hell not let you starve he has bound himself to bring all safe that trust in him andit looks not like it verily yet it may be that times of liberty shall come again master ewring ive given you a deal of trouble said amy rising suddenly and taken ever so much time but im not unthankful trust me my dear maid how can christian men spend time better than in helping a fellow soul on his way towards heaven its not time wasted be sure no its not time wasted said amy with more feeling than mr ewring had ever seen her show before farewell dear maid said he one thing i pray you to remember what you lack is the holy ghost for he only can show christ unto you i or others can talk of him but the spirit alone can reveal him to your own soul and the spirit is promised to them that ask him ill not forget master good even and god bless you mr ewring stood a moment longer to watch amy as she ran down the road with a step tenfold more light and elastic than the weary languid one with which she had come up god bless the maid he said half aloud and may he stablish strengthen settle her he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy but we on whom he has had it aforetime how unbelieving and hopeless we are apt to be verily the last recruit that i looked to see join christs standard was nicholas cleres daughter chapter thirty nine the last martyrdom goodmorrow mistress clere any placards of black velvet have you a placard with us means a large handbill for pasting on walls in queen marys time they meant by it a double stomachernamely an ornamentation for the front of a dress put on separate from it which might either be plain silk or velvet or else worked with beautiful embroidery gold twist sometimes even pearls and precious stones mrs clere came in all haste and much obsequiousness for it was no less a person than the mayoress of colchester who thus inquired for a black velvet placard we have so madam and right good ones belike amy fetch down yonder box with the bettermost placards amy ran up the little ladder needful to reach the higher shelves and brought down the box it was not often that mrs clere was asked for her superior goods for she dealt chiefly with those whose purses would not stretch so far here madam is a fine one of carnation velvetand here a black wrought in gold twist or what think you of this purple bordered in pearls that liketh me the best said the mayoress taking up the purple velvet what cost it mistress clere twentysix and eightpence madam at your pleasure tis dear nay madam pray you look on the qualityvelvet of the finest and pearls of right good colour you shall not find a better in any shop in the town and mrs clere dexterously turned the purple placard to the light in such a manner that a little spot on one side of it should not show or if this carnation please you the better no i pass not upon that said the mayoress which meant that she did not fancy it will you take fourandtwenty shillings mistress clere it was then considered almost a matter of course that a shopkeeper must be offered less than he asked and going from shop to shop to cheapen the articles they wanted was a common amusement of ladies mrs clere looked doubtful well truly madam i should gain not a penny thereby yet rather than lose your good custom seeing for whom it is very good said the mayoress put it up amy knew that the purple placard had cost her mother shillings pence and had been slightly damaged since it came into her hands she knew also that mrs clere would confess the fraud to the priest would probably be told to repeat the lords prayer three times over as a penance for it would gabble through the words as fast as possible and would then consider her sin quite done away with and her profit of shillings pence cheaply secured she knew also that the mayoress in all probability was aware that mrs cleres protestation about not gaining a single penny was a mere flourish of words not at all meant to be accepted as a fact is there aught of news stirring an it like you madam asked mrs clere as she rolled up the placard inside out and secured it with tape i know of none truly answered the mayoress save tomorrows burning the which i would were over for such spectacles like me not not that i would save evil folks from the due penalty of their sins but that i would some less displeasant manner of execution might be found truly what with the heat and the dust and the close crowds that gather tis no dainty matter to behold you say truth madam indeed the last burning we had my daughter here was so close pressed in the crowd and so near the fire she fair swooned and had to be borne thence but who shall suffer tomorrow an it like you for i heard nought thereabout mrs clere presented the little parcel as she spoke only two women said the mayoress taking her purchase not nigh so great a burning as the lastso very likely the crowd shall be less also the crowd was not much less on the waste place by the lexden road when on the th of september those two martyrs were brought forth to die agnes bongeor full of joy and triumph praising god that at length she was counted worthy to suffer for his names sake margaret thurston the disciple who had denied him and for whom therefore there could be no triumph yet even now a meek and fervent appeal from the hearts core of lord thou knowest that i love thee as the chain was being fastened around them a voice came from the crowdone of those mysterious voices never to be traced to a speaker perpetually heard at martyrdoms he remembered that they were but flesh he hath remembered his covenant forever according to thy mercy remember thou me only margaret thurston knew who spoke three times that word never to be forgotten once a terrible rebuke now and evermore a benediction so went home the last of the colchester martyrs as mr ewring turned back he caught sight of dorothy denny and made his way back to her you come to behold do you dorothy said he when they had turned into a quiet side street safe from hostile ears ay master it strengthens me she said thourt of the right stuff then he answered it weakens such as be not eh im as weak as any one replied dorothy what comforts me is to see how the good lord can put strength into the very feeblest lamb of all his flock it seems like as if the shepherd lifted the lamb into his arms so that it had no labour to carry itself ay tis easy to bear a burden when you and it be borne together said mr ewring dorothy have you strength for that burden master ewring ive given up thinking that ive any strength for any thing and then i just go and ask for it for everything and methinks i get along best that way ay so you are coming on fast dorothy many christian folks miss that lesson half their lives well i dont know but they do the best that are weak said dorothy look you they know it and know they must fetch better strength than their own so they dont get thinking they can manage the little things themselves and only need ask the lord to see to the greet ones its true dorothy i cant keep from thinking of poor jack thurston he must be either very hard or very miserable let us pray for him dorothy im afeared its a bad sign that he isnt with them this morrow you think hes given in master ewring im doubtful of it dorothy they walked on for a few minutes without speaking ill try to see jack again or pass in a word to him said mr ewring reflectively eh master ewring dont you go into peril the lords cause cant afford to lose you dont ee now dorothy said mr ewring with a smile if the lords cause cant afford to lose me you may be very sure it wont lose me the lord reigneth be the people never so impatient he is on the throne not the priests but in truth dorothy the lord can afford anything he is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham he himself knew what he would do touching the miracle of the loaves andrew didnt know and philip hadnt a notion let us trust him dorothy and just go forward and do our duty we shall not die one moment before the master calleth us chapter forty god save the queen come and sit a bit with me will i scarce ever see you now will johnson a year older and bigger scrambled up on the garden seat and cissy put her arm round him from having been very small of her age cissy was suddenly shooting up into a tall slim lilylike girl nearly as white as a lily and as delicatelooking how are you getting on with the ladies will oh middling you know you must learn as much as you can will of aught they teach you that is good were being better learned than father could have learned us in booklearning and such and we must mind and pay heed the rather because maybe we shant have it long i wish you wouldnt talk so aboutfather youre for ever talking about him said will uneasily trying to wriggle himself out of his sisters clasp not talk about father exclaimed cissy indignantly will whatever do you mean i couldnt bear not to talk about father it would seem like as wed forgotten him and you must never forget himnever i dont like talking about dead folks andwell its no use biding it look here cissyim going to give up give up what cissys voice was very low there might be pain and disappointment in it but there was no weakness oh all this standing out against the nuns you can go on if you like being starved and beaten and made to kneel on the chapel floor and so forth but ive stood it as long as i can andwait a bit cis let me have my say outi cant see what it signifies not one bit what can it matter whether i say my prayers looking at yon image or not if i said them looking at the moon or at you you wouldnt say i was praying to you or the moon im not praying to it only if they think i am i shant get thrashed and sent to bed hungred dont you see that cant be idolatry cissy was silent till she had felt her way through the mist raised by wills subterfuge into the clear daylight of truth shall i tell you what it would be will well some of your queer notions i reckon idolatry with lying and cheating on the top of it do you think they make it better cis dont say such ugly words isnt it best to call ugly things by their right names well any way it wont be my fault itll be theirs who made me do it theirs and yours too will if you let them make you i tell you cissy i cant stand it father stood more than that said cissy in that low firm voice oh dont be always talking about father he was a man and could bear things ive had enough of it god almighty wont be hard on me if i do give in hard will do you call it hard when people are grieved to the heart because you do something which theyd lay down their lives you shouldnt do the lord did lay down his life for you and yet you say that you cant bear a little hunger and a few stripes for him cis you dont know what it is youre a maid and i dare say they dont lay on so hard on you its more than a little i can tell you cissy knew what it was far better than will for he was a strong boy on whom hardships fell lightly while she had to bear the blows and the hunger with a delicate and enfeebled frame but she only said will dont you care for me of course i do cis i think the only thing in the world that could break my heart would be to see you or nell giving in as you call it i couldnt stand that will i can stand anything else i hoped you cared for god and father but if you wont heed them i must see if you will listen to me it would kill me will oh come cis dont talk so wont you go on trying a bit longer will

wills coming to oh wellcome ill try a bit longer cis if youbut i say i do hope it wont be long or i cant stand it that night or rather in the early hours of the following morning a horseman came spurring up to the head gate of colchester he alighted from his panting horse and threw the reins on its neck gate ho nothing but silence came in answer gate ho cried the horseman in a louder voice somebody there asked the gatekeeper in a very sleepy voice tarry a minute will you ill be with you anon tarry repeated the horseman with a contemptuous laugh thoud not want me to tarry if thou knewest what news i bring good tidings eh lets have em said the gatekeeper in a brisker voice take them god save the queen call that tidings weve sung that this five year nay youve never sung it yetnot as you will how if it be god save queen elizabeth the gate was dashed open in the unsleepiest way that ever gate was moved you never meanis the queen departed queen mary is gone to her reward replied the horseman gravely god save queen elizabeth god be thanked and praised ay england is free now a man may speak his mind and not die for it no more burnings friend no more prison for reading of gods word no more hiding of mens heads in dens and caves of the earth god save the queen long live the queen may the queen live for ever it is not often that the old british lion is so moved by anything as to roar and dance in his inexpressible delight but now and then he does it and never did he dance and roar as he did on that eighteenth of november all over england men went wild with joy the terrible weight of the chains in which she had been held was never truly felt until they were thus suddenly knocked from the shackled limbs old calm soberminded peoplenay grave and stern precise and rigid every manner of man and womanall fairly lost their heads and were like children in their frantic glee that day men who were perfect strangers were seen in the streets shaking hands with each other as though they were the dearest friends women who ordinarily would not of thought of speaking to one another were kissing each other and calling on each other to rejoice nobody calmed down until he was so wornout that wearied nature absolutely forced him to repose it was seen that day that however she had been oppressed compelled to silence or tortured into apparent submission england was protestant the prophets had prophesied falsely and the priests borne rule but the people had not loved to have it so as they very plainly showed colchester had declared for mary five years before because she was the true heir who had the right to reign and rebellion was not right because her religion was wrong but now that god delivered them from her awful tyranny colchester was not behind the rest of england in giving thanks to him we are worse off now the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means it has not reached to the point it did then but how soon will it do sofor last and worst of all the people love to have it so may god awake the people of england for his mercies sake let us not have to say england flung off the chains of bondage and the sin of idolatry under queen elizabeth but she bound them tight again of her own will under queen victoria chapter forty one a blessed day dorothy dorothy denny wherever can the woman have got to mr ewring had already tapped several times with his stick on the brick floor of the kings head kitchen and had not heard a sound in answer the clock ticked to and fro and the tabby cat purred softly as she sat before the fire and the wood now and then gave a little crackle as it burned gently away and those were all the signs of life to be seen on the premises getting tired at last mr ewring went out into the courtyard and called in his loudest tonesdorothy he thought he heard a faint answer of coming which sounded high up and a long way off so he went back to the kitchen and took a seat on the hearth opposite the cat in a few minutes the sound of running down stairs was audible and at last dorothy appearedher gown pinned up behind her sleeves rolled up to the elbows and her entire aspect that of a woman who had just come off hard and dirty work eh master ewring but im sorry to have kept you awaiting look you i was mopping out thedear heart but what is come to you has the resurrection happened for your face looks nigh too glad for aught else the gladness died suddenly away as those words brought to mr ewring the thought of something which could not happenthe memory of the beloved face which for thirty years had been the light of his home and which he should behold in this world never any more nay dorothynay not that yet it will be one day thank god and we have much this morrow to thank god for whereof i came to tell thee why what has come trow the glad light rose again to mr ewrings eyes gideon has come and hath subdued the midianites he answered with a ring of triumph in his voice king david is come and the philistines will take flight and israel shall sit in peace under his vine and figtree may god save elizabeth our queen good lack but you never mean that cried dorothy in a voice as delighted as his own why then mistress ll be back to her own and them poor little dears ll be delivered from them black snakes and there ll be biblereading and sermons again ay every one of them i trust and a man may say what he will that is right without looking first round to see if a spy be within hearing we are free dorothy once more eh but it do feel like a dream i shall have to pinch myself to make sure im awake but master do you think it is sure she havent changed think you mr ewring shook his head the lady elizabeth suffered with us he said and she will not forsake us now no dorothy she has not changed she is not one to change let us not distrust either her or the lord ah he knew what he would do it was to be a sharp short hour of tribulation through which his church was to pass to purify and try and make her white and now the land shall have rest forty years that she may sing to him a new song on the sea of glass those five years have lit the candle of englands church and as our good old bishop said in dying by gods grace it shall never be put out well sure its a blessed day dorothy can you compass to drive with me to hedingham again i think long till those poor children be rescued and the nuns will be ready and glad to give them up theyll not want to be found with protestant children in their keepingchildren too of a martyred man master ewring give me but time to get me tidied and my hood and ill go with you this minute if you will i was mopping out the loft when mistress do come back she shall find her house as clean as shed have had it if shed been here and thats clean enough i can tell you right friend faithful in a little faithful also in much dorothy youd have made a good martyr me master mr ewring smiled well whether shall it be tomorrow or leave over sunday if it liked you master i would say tomorrow poor little dears theyll be so pleased to come back to their friends i can be ready for themill work early and late but i will did you think of taking the little lad yourself or are they all to bide with me ill take him the minute hes old enough and no more needs a womans hand about him you know dorothy there be no woman in mine house now well hell scarce be that yet i reckon howbeit the first thing is to fetch em master when think you mistress shall be let go it is hard to say dorothy for weve heard so little but if she be in the bishop of londons keeping as she was i cast no doubt she shall be delivered early doubtless all the bishops that refuse to conform shall be deprived and he will not conform without he be a greater rogue than i think there was something of the spirit of the earliest christians when they had all things common in the matterofcourse way in which it was understood on both sides that each was ready to take charge at any sacrifice of time money or ease of children who had been left fatherless by martyrdom early the next morning the millers cart drew up before the door of the kings head and dorothy hooded and cloaked with a round basket on her arm was quite ready to get in the drive to hedingham was pleasant enough cold as the weather was and at last they reached the barred gate of the convent dorothy alighted from the cart ill see you let in dorothy ere i leave you said he if indeed i have to leave you at all i should never marvel if they brought the children forth and were earnest to be rid of them at once it did not seem like it however for several knocks were necessary before the wicket unclosed the portress looked relieved when she saw who was there what would you asked she mr ewring had given dorothy advice how to proceed an it like you might i see the children cicely johnson and the little ones come within said the portress and i will inquire this appeared more promising dorothy was led to the guestchamber and was not kept waiting only a few minutes had elapsed when the prioress herself appeared you wish to see the children she said i wish to take them with me if you please answered dorothy audaciously i look for my mistress back shortly and she was aforetime desirous to bring them up i will take the full charge of them with your leave truly and my leave you shall have we shall be right glad to be rid of the charge for a heavy one it has been and a wearisome a more obstinate perverse ungovernable maid than cicely never came in my hands thank the lord said dorothy poor creatures said the prioress i suppose you will do your best to undo our teaching and their souls will be lost howbeit we were little like to have saved them and it will be well now for the community that they should go wait and i will send them to you dorothy waited halfanhour at the end of that time a door opened in the wainscot which she had not known was there and a tall pale slender girl of eleven looking older than she was came forward dorothy denny said cissys unchanged voice in tones of unmistakable delight oh they didnt tell me who it was are we to go with youback to colchester has something happened do tell me what is going to become of us my dear heart peace and happiness if it please the lord master ewring and i have come to fetch you all the queen is departed to god and the lady elizabeth is now queen and the nuns are ready enough to be rid of you if my dear mistress come home safeas please god she shallyou shall be all her children and master ewring hath offered to take will when he be old enough and learn him his trade your troubles be over i trust the lord for some while its just in time said cissy with a gasp of relief oh how wicked i have been not to trust god better and he was getting this ready for us all the while chapter forty two what they found at the kings head mr ewring had stayed at the gate guessing that dorothy would not be long in fulfilling her errand he cast the reins on the neck of his old bay horse and allowed it to crop the grass while he waited many a short prayer for the success of the journey went up as he sat there at last the gate was opened and a boy of seven years old bounded out of it and ran up to the cart master ewring is that you im glad to see you were all coming is that old tim thats old tim be sure said the miller pat him will and then give me your hand and make a long jump will obeyed just as the gate opened again and dorothy came out of it with the two little girls little nellno longer babycould walk now and chatter too though few except cissy understood what she said she talked away in a very lively manner until dorothy lifted her into the cart when the sight of mr ewring seemed to exert a paralysing effect upon her nor was she reassured at once by his smile dear heart but it ll be a close fit said dorothy how be we to pack ourselves cissy must sit betwixt us answered the miller shes not quite so fat as a sack of flour take the little one on your knees dorothy and will shall come in front of me and take his first lesson in driving tim they settled themselves accordingly will being highly delighted at his promotion well i reckon you are not sorry to be forth of that place suggested mr ewring oh so glad said cissy under her breath and how hath will stood out was the next question which produced profound silence for a few seconds then will broke forth i havent master ewringat least its cissys doing and shes had hard work to make me stick i should have given up ever so many times if shed have let me i didnt think i could stand it much longer and it was only last night i told her so and she begged and prayed me to hold on thats an honest lad said mr ewring and thats a dear maid added dorothy then cissy stood out did she cissy eh theyd never have got her to kneel down to their ugly images not if theyd cut her head off for it shes just like a stone wall nell did till cissy got hold of her and told her not but she didnt know what it meant so i hope it wasnt wicked you see shes so little and she forgets what is said to her ay ay poor little dear said dorothy and what did they to you my poor dears when you wouldnt oh lots of things said will beat us sometimes and shut us in dark cupboards and sent us to bed without supper one night they made cissy never mind will said cissy blushing but theyd better know said will stoutly they made cissy kneel all night on the floor of the dormitory tied to a bedpost they said if she wouldnt kneel to the saint she should kneel without it and sister mary asked her how she liked saying her prayers to the moon cruel hardhearted wretches exclaimed dorothy then they used to keep us several hours without anything to eat and at the end of it they would hold out something uncommon good and just when we were going to take it theyd snatch it away ill tell you what if i had known that a bit sooner theyd have had a piece of my mind said dorothy with some thorns on it i guess commented the miller eh dear but i marvel if i could have kept my fingers off em and they beat thee will hard said will and thee cissy yessometimes said cissy quietly but i did not care for that if theyd have left alone harassing will you see hes younger than me and he doesnt remember father as well if there hadnt been any right and wrong about it i could not have done what would vex father tim trotted on for a while and will was deeply interested in his driving lesson about a mile from colchester mr ewring rather suddenly pulled up love is that you he said john love who was partly hidden by some bushes came out and showed himself ay and i wellnigh marvel it is either you or me said he significantly truly you may say so i believe we were aforetime the best noted heretics in all colchester and yet here we be on the further side of these five bitter years left to rejoice together love i would your agnes would look in on me a time or two said dorothy i have proper little wit touching babes and she might help me to a thing or twain youll have as much as the nuns shouldnt marvel said love smiling but ill bid agnes look in youre about to care for the little ones then ay till they get better care said dorothy simply youll win the lords blessing with them good den by the way have you heard that jack thurstons still staunch is he so im right glad ay they saybartle it was told a neighbour of minehes held firm till the priests were fair astonied at him they thought theyd have brought him round and that was why they never burned him hell come forth now i guess not a doubt of it there shall be some right happy deliverances all over the realm and many an happy meeting said mr ewring with a faint sigh at the thought that no such blessedness was in store for him until he should reach the gate of the celestial city good den jack they drove in at the north gate down balcon lane with a passing greeting to amy clere who was taking down mantles at the shop door and whose whole face lighted up at the sight and turned through the great archway into the courtyard of the kings head the cat came out to meet them with arched back and erect tail and began to mew and rub herself against dorothy having evidently some deeply interesting communication to make in cat language but what it was they could not even guess until they reached the kitchen sure said dorothy theres somebody here beside barbara run in my dears she added to the children methinks there must be company in the kitchen and if bab be all alone to cook and serve for a dozen shell be fain to see me returned tell her im come and will be there in a minute only id fain not wake the babe for shes weary with unwonted sights little helen had fallen asleep in dorothys arms cissy and will went forward into the kitchen barbara was there but instead of company only one person was seated in the big carved chair before the fire furnished with red cushions that was the only sort of easy chair then known ah here they are said an unexpected voice the lord be praised ive all my family safe at last dorothy coming in with little helen nearly dropped her in astonished delight mistress wade cried mr ewring following her truly you are a pleasant sight and i am full fain to welcome you back i trusted we should so do ere long but i looked not to behold you thus soon well and you are a pleasant sight master ewring to her eyes that for fourteen months hath seen little beside the seacoals note in the bishop of londons coalhouse thats where he sets his prisoners that

each other ive heard much news from bab touching many folks and things and thee not least doll trust me i never guessed into how faithful hands all my goods should fall nor how thou shouldst keep matters going as well as if i had been here mine own self thou shalt find in time to come that i know a true friend and an honest servant and account of her as much worth so you are to be my children now and henceforthonly i hear master ewring you mean to share the little lad with me thats right good what hast thou to say little cicely please mistress wade i think god has taken good care of us and i only hope hes told father dear child thy father shall lack no telling said mr ewring he is where no shade of mistrust can come betwixt him and god and he knows with certainty as the angels do that

flow praise him all creatures here below praise him above ye heavenly host praise father son and holy ghost dear heart but thats sweet said dorothy wiping her eyes truth but they sing it better there
