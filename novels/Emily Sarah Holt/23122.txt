the well in the desert an old legend of the house of arundel by emily sarah holt the action takes place at the end of the fourteenth century and the start of the fifteenth it deals largely with a family connected with arundel in sussex they seem to have been rather nasty people highly motivated by greed and desire for even higher stations in life they were fairly wellplaced by todays standards being closely related to various of the kings of england of the day some of the women in the story are quite as bad as many of the men when these wicked people had done their wicked deeds there were often unfortunate children dispossessed or forgotten in some attic of the castle one of these is the heroine of this story she had never been told who or where her mother was by a series of coincidences she comes across the name of a person who may know the answers to these questions i will not spoil the story for you by telling you any more throughout the book there is constant reference to christ as the well the supplier of the vital water of life christianity was in a terrible mess at the time with numerous sects and with the members of any one sect feeling free to execute by any means the members of any other sect theres plainly a modern parallel here on the whole the story is based on fact and on valuable contemporary records when miss holt wrote the story it seemed likely that philippa the central figure was accurately represented unfortunately after the book was complete it was found that she could never have existed so the poor authoress had to present her book as it stands with an apology at the end the well in the desert an old legend of the house of arundel by emily sarah holt preface it is said that only travellers in the arid lands of the east really know the value of water to them the well in the desert is a treasure and a blessing unspeakably so when the water is pure and sweet yet even though it be salt and brackish it may still save life was it less so in a figurative sense to the travellers through that great desert of the middle ages wherein the wells were so few and far between true the water was brackish man had denied the streams and filled up the wells with stones yet for all this it was godgiven and to those who came and dug for the old spring and drank it was the water of eternal life the cry was still sounding down the ages if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink and no less blessed are the souls that come now but for us the wells are so numerous and so pure that we too often pass them by and go on our way thirsting strange blindnessyet not strange for until the angel of the lord shall open the eyes of hagar she must needs go mourning through the wilderness not seeing the well lord that we may receive our sightand may come unto thee and drink and thirst no more chapter one my ladys bower is swept i am too low for scorn to lower me and all too sorrowstricken to feel grief edwin arnold soft and balmy was the air and the sunlight radiant at an early hour of a beautiful june morning and fair was the landscape that met the eyes of the persons who were gathered a few feet from the portcullis of a grand stately old castle crowning a wooded height near the sussex coast there were two persons seated on horseback the one a youth of some twenty years in a pages dress the other a woman who sat behind him on the pillion standing about were two men and a woman the last holding a child in her arms the woman on the pillion was closely veiled and much muffled in her wrappings considering the season of the year and the warmth of the weather nor did she lift her veil when she spoke the child alina she said in a tone so soft and low that the words seemed rather breathed than spoken the woman who stood beside the horse answered the appeal by placing the child in the arms of the speaker it was a pretty engaging little girl of three years old the lady on the pillion lifting the child underneath her veil strained it to her bosom and bowed her head low upon its light soft hair meanwhile the horse stood still as a statue and the page sat as still before her in respectful silence the other three stood round they knew every one of them that in that embrace to one of the two the bitterness of death was passing and that when it was ended she would have nothing left to fearonly because she would have nothing left to hope at length suddenly the lady lifted her head and held forth the child to alina turning her head away toward the sea from the old castle from the child she made her farewell in one word depart the three standing there watched her departurenever lifting her veil nor turning her headuntil she was hidden from their sight among the abundant green foliage around they lingered a minute longer but only a minutefor a shrill harsh voice from the portcullis summoned them to return ralph thou lither hilding alina thou jade come hither at once and get you to work my ladys bower yet unswept by the seven sleepers and ye lingering yonder as ye had leaden heels by the holy bones of saint benedict our master shall con you light thanks when he cometh that may be said alina under her breath get you in ralph and jocelyn or she shall be after again and she turned and walked quickly into the castle still carrying the child eleven hours later a very different procession climbed the castlehill and passed in at the portcullis it was headed by a sumptuous litter beside which rode a gentleman magnificently attired behind came a hundred horsemen in livery and the line was closed by a crowd of archers in lincoln green bearing crossbows from the litter assisted by the gentleman descended a young lady of some threeandtwenty years upon whose lips hovered a smile of pleasure and whose fair hair flowed in natural ringlets from beneath a golden fillet the gentleman was her senior by about fifteen years he was a tall active handsome man with a dark face stern set lips and a pair of dark quick eaglelike eyes beneath which the group of servants manifestly quailed is the ladys bower ready he asked addressing the foremost of the womenthe one who had so roughly insisted on alinas return it is so ant like your noble lordship answered she with a low reverence it shall be found as well appointed as our poor labours might compass he made no answer but offering his hand to the young lady who had alighted from the litter he led her up the stairs from the banquetinghall into a suite of fair stately apartments according to the taste of that period rich tapestry decorated the walls fresh green rushes were strewn upon the floor all the painting had been renewed and above the fireplace stood two armorial shields newly chiselled lady he said in a soft courtly tone here is the bower doth it like the bird it is beauteous answered the lady with a bright smile it hath been anew swept and garnished replied the master bowing low as he took his leave yonder silver bell shall summon your women the lady moved to the casement on his departure it stood open and the lovely seaview was to be seen from it in good sooth tis a fair spot she said half aloud and all new swept and garnished there was no mocking echo in the chamber if there had been the words might have been borne back to the ear of the royal alianoranot only garnished but swept my lady touched the silver bell and a crowd of damsels answered her call among them came alina and she held by the hand the little flaxenhaired child who had played so prominent a part in the events of the morning do you all speak french asked the countess in that languagewhich be it remembered was in the reign of edward the third the mothertongue of the english nobles she received an affirmative reply from all that is well see to my sumptermules being unladen and the gear brought up hitherwhat a pretty child whose is it alina brought the little girl forward and answered for her the lady philippa fitzalan my lords daughter my lords daughter and a visible frown clouded the countesss brow i knew not he had a daughteroh that child take her awayi do not want her mistress philippa for the future that is my pleasure and with a decided pout on her previously smiling lips the lady of arundel seated herself at her tiringglass alina caught up the child and took her away to a distant chamber in a turret of the castle where she set her on her knee and shed a torrent of tears on the little flaxen head poor little babe fatherless and motherless she cried would to our dear lady that thou wert no worse the blessed saints help thee for none other be like to do it save them and me and suddenly rising she slipped down on her knees holding the child before her beside a niche where a lamp made of pottery burned before a blackened wooden doll lady of pity hast thou none for this little child mother of mercy for thee to deceive me this whole month have i been on my knees to thee many times in the day praying thee to incline the ladys heart when she should come to show a mothers pity to this motherless one and thou hast not heard methou hast not heard me holy virgin what doest thou have i not offered candles at thy shrine have i not deprived myself of needful things to pay for thy litanies what could i have done more is this thy pity lady of pitythis thy compassion mother and maiden but the passionate appeal was lost on the lifeless image to which it was made as of old so now there was neither voice not any to answer nor any that regarded nineteen years after that summer day a girl of twentytwo sat gazing from the casement in that turretchambera girl whose face even a flatterer would have praised but little and philippa fitzalan had no flatterers the pretty childas pretty children often dohad grown into a very ordinary commonplace woman her hair indeed was glossy and luxuriant and had deepened from its early flaxen into the darkest shade to which it was possible for flaxen to change her eyes were dark with a sad tired wistful look in thema look of a dumb creature who had been beaten once and never since was easy with the world her face was white and thin her figure tall slender angular and rather awkward none had ever cared to amend her awkwardness it signified to nobody whether she looked well or ill in a word she signified to nobody the tears might burn under her eyelids or overflow and fallshe would never be asked what was the matter she might fail under her burdens and faint in the midst of themand if it occurred to any one to prevent material injury to her that was the very utmost she could expect not that the lady alianora was unkind to her stepdaughter that is not actively unkind she simply ignored her existence philippa was provided as a matter of course with necessary clothes just as the men who served in the hall were provided with livery but anything not absolutely necessary had never been given to her in her life there were no loving words no looks of pleasure no affectionate caresses lavished upon her if the lady joan lost her temper no rare occurrence or the lady alesia her appetite or the lady mary her sleep the whole household was disturbed but what philippa suffered never disturbed nor concerned any one but herself to these her halfsisters she formed a kind of humble companion a superior maidofallwork all day long she heard and obeyed the commands of the three young ladies all day long she was bidden come here go there do this fetch that and philippa came and went and fetched and did as she was told just now she was off duty their ladyships were gone out hawking with the earl and countess and would not in all probability return for some hours and what was philippa doing as she sat gazing dreamily from the casement of her turretchamberhers only because nobody else liked the room her eyes were fixed earnestly on one little spot of ground a few feet from the castle gate and her soul was wandering backward nineteen years recalling the one scene which stood out vividly the earliest of memorys picturesa picture without text to explain itbefore which and after which came blanks with no recollection to fill them she saw herself lifted underneath a womans veilclasped earnestly in a womans armsgazing in baby wonder up into a womans facea wan white face with dark expressive fervent eyes in which a whole volume of agony and love was written she never knew who that woman was indeed she sometimes wondered whether it were really a remembrance or only a picture drawn by her own imagination but there it was always deep down in the hearts recesses only waiting to be called on and to come whoever this mysterious woman were it was some one who had loved her her philippa whom no one ever loved for alina who had died in her childhood she scarcely recollected at all and at the very core of the unseen unknown heart of this quiet undemonstrative girl there lay one intense earnest passionate longing for love if but one of her fathers hawks or hounds would have looked brighter at her coming she thought it would have satisfied her for she had learned long years ere this that to her father himself or to the lady alianora or to her halfbrothers and sisters she must never look for any shadow of love the motherwant about the world which pressed on her so heavily they would never fill the dull blank uniformity of simple apathy was all she ever received from any of them her very place was filled the lady joan was the eldest daughter of the housenot mistress philippa for the pleasure of the countess had been fulfilled and mistress philippa the girl was called and when joan was married and went away from the castle in a splendid litter hung with crimson velvet her sister alesia stepped into her place as a matter of course philippa did not indeed see the drawbacks to joans lot they were not apparent on the surface that the stately young noble who rode on a beautiful barbary horse beside the litter actually hated the girl whom he had been forced to marry did not enter into her calculations but as joan cared very little for that herself it was the less necessary that philippa should do so and philippa only missed joan from the house by the fact that her work was so much the lighter and her life a trifle less disagreeable than before more considerations than one were troubling philippa just now blanche one of the countesss tirewomen had just visited her turretchamber to inform her that the lady alesia was betrothed and would be married six months thence it did not however trouble her that she had heard of this through a servant she never looked for anything else had she been addicted which fortunately for her she was not to that most profitless of all manufactures grievancemakingshe might have wept over this little incident but except for one reason the news of her sisters approaching marriage was rather agreeable to philippa she would have another tyrant the less though it was true that alesia had always been the least unkind to her of the three and she would have welcomed marys marriage with far greater satisfaction but that one terrible consideration which blanche had forced on her notice i marvel indeed that my gracious lord hath not thought of your disposal mistress philippa ere this suppose he should think of it for to philippas apprehension love was so far from being synonymous with marriage that she held the two barely compatible marriage to her would be merely another phase of egyptian bondage under a different pharaoh and she knew this was her probable lot that unless her fathers neglect on this subject should continue which she devoutly hoped it might she would some day be informed by blancheor possibly the lady alianora herself might condescend to make the communicationthat on the following wednesday she was to be married to sir robert le poer or sir john de mountchenesey probably a man whom she had never seen possibly one whom she just knew by sight philippa scarcely knew how from such thoughts as these her memory slowly travelled back and stayed outside the castle gate at that june morning of nineteen years ago who was it that had parted with her so unwillingly it could not of course be the mother of whom she had never heard so much as the name she must have died long ago on her side so far as philippa knew she had no relations and her aunts on the fathers side the lady latimer the lady de lestrange and the lady de lisle never took the least notice of her when they visited the castle and then came up the thoughtwho am i how is it that nobody cares to own me there must be a reason what is the reason mistress philippa look you here the lady mary left with me this piece of arras and commanded me to give it unto you to be amended and beshrew me but i clean forgot this green is to come forth and this blue to be set instead thereof and clean sleasilk for the yellow haste for the holy virgins love or i shall be well swinged when she cometh home chapter two hidden treasure who hears the falling of the forest leaf or who takes note of every flower that dies longfellow the morning after blanche and the arras had thus roughly dispelled philippas dream the lady alianora sat in her bower looking over a quantity of jewellery she put some articles aside to be reset dismissed others as past amendment or not worth it and ordered some to be restored to the coffer whence they had been taken the lady alesia was looking on and philippa stood behind with the maids at last only one ornament was left this is worth nothing said the countess lifting from the table an old bracelet partly broken put it with the othersor stay whence came it out of an ancient coffer ant like your ladyship said blanche that hath been longer in the castle than i i should think so returned the countess it must have belonged to my lords grandmother or some yet more ancient dame tis worth nothing philippa you may have it not a very gracious manner of presenting a gift it must be confessed but philippa well knew that nothing of any value was likely to be handed to her moreover this was the first present that had ever been made to her and lastly a dim notion floated through her mind that it might have belonged to her mother and anything connected with that dead and unknown mother had a sacred charm in her eyes her thanks therefore were readily forthcoming she put the despised bracelet in her pocket and as soon as she received her dismissal ran with a lighter step than usual to her turretchamber without any distinct reason for doing so she drew the bolt and sitting down by the window proceeded to examine her treasure it was a plain treasure enough a band of black enamel set at intervals with seedpearl and beryls certainly was not worth much especially since the snap was gone one of the beryls and several pearls were missing and from the centre ornament an enamelled rose a portrait had apparently been torn away did the rose open philippa tried it for she was anxious to reach the device if there were one to reach the rose opened with some effort and the device lay before her written in small characters with faded ink on a scrap of parchment fitting into the bracelet philippas one accomplishment which she owed to her old friend alina was the rare power of reading it was very seldom that she found any opportunity of exercising it yet she had not lost the art alina had been a priests sister who in teaching her to read had taught her all that he knew himself and alina in her turn had thus given to philippa all that she had to give but the characters of the device were so small and faint that philippa consumed half an hour ere she could decipher them at length she succeeded in making out a rude rhyme or measure in the normanfrench which was to her more familiar than english quy de cette eaw boyra ancor soyf aura mais quy de cette eaw boyra que moy luy donneray jamais soif naura a leternite devices of the mediaeval period were parted into two divisions religious and amatory philippa had no difficulty in deciding that this belonged to the former category and she guessed in a moment that the meaning was a moral one for she was accustomed to such hidden allegorical allusions and already she had advanced one step on the road to that well she knew that whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again ay from her that weary thirst was never absent but where was this well from which it might be quenched and who was it that could give her this living water philippas memory was a perfect storehouse of legends of the saints and above all of the virgin who stood foremost in her pantheon of gods she searched her repertory over and over but in vain no saint and in particular not saint mary had ever in any legend that she knew spoken words like these and what tremendous words they were whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst there were long and earnest prayers offered that night in the little turretchamber misdirected prayersentreaties to be prayed for addressed to ears that could not hear to hands that could not help but perhaps they reached another ear that could hear another hand that was almighty the unclosing of the door is promised to them that ask thanks be to god that while it is not promised it does sometimes in his sovereign mercy unclose to them that know not how to ask the morning after this as philippa opened her door one of the castle lavenders of washerwomen passed it on her way down the stairs she was a woman of about fifty years of age who had filled her present place longer than philippa could recollect throughout the whole of the middle agesfor a period of many centuries closing only about the time of the accession of the house of hanover laundress was a name of evil repute and the position was rarely assumed by any woman who had a character to lose the daughters of the lady alianora were strictly forbidden to speak to any lavender but no one had cared enough about philippa to warn her and she was therefore free to converse with whom she pleased and a sudden thought had struck her she called back the lavender agnes the woman stopped came to philippas door and loutedthe oldfashioned reverence which preceded the french courtesy agnes how long hast thou been lavender here long ere you were born lady canst thou remember my mother philippa was amazed at the look of abject terror which suddenly took possession of the lavenders face hush lady lady she whispered her voice trembling with fear philippa laid her hand on the womans arm wilt thou suffer aught if thou tarry agnes shook her head then come in hither and she pulled her into her own room and shut the door agnes there is some strange thing i cannot understand and i will understand it what letteth hinders thee to speak to me of my mother agnes looked astonished at philippas tone as well she might it hath been forbidden lady who forbade it the lavenders compressed lips sufficiently intimated that she did not mean to answer that question why was it forbidden the continued silence replied when died she thou mayest surely tell me so much i dare not lady replied agnes in a scarcely audible whisper how died she lady i dare not answeri must not you weary yourself to no good but i will know said philippa doggedly not from me lady answered the lavender with equal determination what does it all mean moaned poor philippa to her baffled self look here agnes hast thou ever seen this bracelet ay lady the lady alianora never deigns to speak to such as we poor lavenders be but she did not think it would soil her lips to comfort us when our hearts were sad i have seen her wear that jewel a terrible fancy all at once occurred to philippa agnes was she an evil woman that thou wilt not speak of her the lavenders heart was reached and her tongue loosed no no lady no she cried with a fervour of which philippa had not imagined her capable the snow was no whiter than her life the honey no sweeter than her soul then what does it all mean said philippa again in a tone of more bewilderment than ever but the momentary fervour had died away and silence once more settled on the lavenders tongue agnes louted and walked away and philippa knew only one thing morethat the broken bracelet had been her mothers but who was she and what was she this mysterious mother of whom none would speak to herthe very date of whose death her child was not allowed to know that is too poor for you alesia said the lady alianora tis but thin in good sooth observed that young lady i suppose philippa must have a gown for the wedding resumed the countess carelessly it will do for her it was cloth of silver philippa had never had such a dress in her life she listened in mute surprise could it be possible that she was intended to appear as a daughter of the house at alesias marriage you may choose your hoodstuff from chose velvets said the countess condescendingly to philippa i trow you will have to choose your own gowns after you are wedded so you may as well begin now will philippa be wed when i am yawned alesia the same day said the lady alianora the day was about sixty hours off and this was the first word that philippa had heard of her destiny to whom was she to be handed over after this summary fashion would the countess of her unspeakable goodness let her know that but the countess could not tell her she had not yet heard she thought there were two knights in treaty for her and the last time he had mentioned it the earl had not decided between them as soon as alesias wardrobe was settled and philippa was no longer wanted to unfold silks and exhibit velvets she fled like a hunted deer to her turretchamber kneeling down by her bed she buried her face in the coverlet and the longrepressed cry of the sold slave broke forth at last o mother mother mother the door opened but philippa did not hear it lady i cry you mercy said the voice of agnes in a compassionate tone i meant not indeed to pry into your privacy but as i was coming up the stairs i thought i heard a scream i feared you were sick philippa looked up with a white woebegone face and tearless eyes i wish i were agnes she said in a hopeless tone i would i were out of this weary and wicked world ah i have wished that ere now responded the lavender tis an ill wish lady i have heard one say so one that never felt it i trow said philippa no did lady ay one whose lot was far bitterer than yours verily i would give something to see one whose lot were so answered the girl bitterly enough i have no mother and as good as no father and none would care were i out of the world this night not a soul loveth me nor ever did she used to say one did love us said agnes in a low voice even he that died on the rood i would i could mind what she told us but it is long long ago and mine heart is hard and my remembrance dim yet i do mind that last time she spake only the very day beforenever mind what but that which came after stamped it on mine heart for ever it was the last time i heard her voice and i knewwe all knewwhat was coming though she did not it was about water she spake and he that drank should thirst again and there was another well some whither whereof he that should drink should never thirst and he that died on the rood would give us that better water if we asked him but how shall i get at him to ask him cried philippa she said he could hear if we asked replied the lavender who said shethat you wot of our lady that used to be my mother agnes nodded and the water that he should give should bring life and peace it was a sweet story and a fair as she told it but there never was a voice like hersnever philippa rose and opened her cherished bracelet she could guess what that bracelet had been the ornament was less common in the middle ages than in the periods which preceded and followed them and it was usually a lovetoken but where was the love which had given and received this was it broken too like the bracelet she read the device to agnes it was something like that said agnes but she read the story touching it out of a book what was she like asked philippa in a low tone look in the mirror lady answered agnes philippa began to wonder whether this were the mysterious reason for her bitter lot dost thou know i am to be wed ay lady so the very lavenders had known it before herself but finding agnes as she thought more communicative than before philippa returned to her former subject what was her name agnes shook her head thou knowest it the lavender nodded in answer then why not tell it me surely i may know what they christened her at the fontphilippa or margaret or blanche agnes hesitated a moment but seemed to decide on replying she sank her voice so low that philippa could barely hear her but she just caught the words the lady isabel philippa sat a minute in silence but agnes made no motion to go agnes thou saidst her lot was more bitter than mine how was it more bitter agnes pointed to the window of the opposite turret where the tiringwomen slept and outside of which was hung a luckless lark in a small wicker cage is his lot sweet lady i trow not in good sooth said philippa but his is like mine i cry you mercy answered the lavender shaking her head he hath known freedom and light and air and song that was her lotnot yours lady philippa continued to watch the lark his poor caged wings were beating vainly against the wickerwork until he wearily gave up the attempt and sat quietly on the perch drooping his tired head he is not satisfied resumed agnes in a low tone he is only weary he is not happyonly too wornout to care for happiness ah holy virgin how many of us women are so and she was wont to say that there was happiness in this life yet not in this world it lay she said in that other world above where god sitteth and if we would ask for him that was meant by the better water it would come and dwell in our hearts along with him our sweet lady help us we seem to have missed it somehow i have at any rate whispered philippa her eyes fixed dreamily on the weary lark chapter three guy of ashridge for merit lives from man to man and not from man o lord to thee tennyson not until the evening before her marriage did philippa learn the name of her new master the earls choice she was then informed had fallen on sir richard sergeaux a knight of cornwall who would receive divers manors with the hand of the eldest daughter of arundel philippa was however not told that sir richard was expected to pay for the grants and the alliance in extremely hard cash for to the lofty position of eldest daughter of arundel for that morning only philippa to her intense surprise found herself suddenly lifted she was robed in cloth of silver her hair flowed from beneath a jewelled golden fillet her neck was encircled by rubies and a ruby and pearl girdle clasped her waist she felt all the time as though she were dreaming especially when the lady alianora herself superintended her arraying and even condescended to remark that the lady philippa did not look so very unseemly after all not least among the points which astonished her was the resumption of her title she did not know that this had formed a part of the bargain with sir richard who had proved impracticable on harder terms he did not mind purchasing the eldest daughter of arundel at the high price set upon her but he gave the earl distinctly to understand that if he were merely selling a mistress philippa there must be a considerable discount when the ceremony and the wedding festivities were over and her palfrey was standing ready at the door philippa timidly entered the banquetinghall to askfor the first and last timeher fathers blessing he was conversing with the earl of kent the bridegroom of alesia concerning the merits of certain hawks recently purchased and near him at her embroideryframe sat the countess alianora philippa knelt first to her farewell philippa said the countess in a rather kinder tone than usual the saints be with thee then she turned to the only relative she had earl richard just permitted his jewelled fingers to touch philippas velvet hood saying carelesslyour lady keep theei cry you mercy fair son the lesser tercel is far stronger on the wing as philippa rose sir richard sergeaux took her hand and led her away so she mounted her palfrey and rode away from arundel castle there were only two things she was sorry to leaveagnes because she might have told her more about her motherand the grave in the priory churchyard below of the baby lady alianorathe little sister who never grew up to tyrannise over her it was a long journey ere they reached kilquyt manor and philippa had time to make the acquaintance of her new owner he was about her own age and so far as she could at first judge a reasonably goodtempered man the first discovery she made was that he was rather proud of her of philippa the daughter of arundel of course not of philippa the woman but it was so new to be reckoned anything or anybodyso strange to think that somebody was proud of herthat philippa enjoyed the knowledge as to his loving her or her loving him these were ideas that never entered the minds of either so at first philippa found her married life a pleasant change she was now at the head instead of being under the feet of every one else and her experience of sir richard gave her the impression at the outset that he would not prove a hard master nor did he strictly speaking but on further acquaintance he proved a very trying one his temper was not of the stormy kind that reigned at arundel which had hitherto been philippas only idea of a bad temper but he was a perpetual grumbler and the slightest temporary discomfort or vexation would overcast her sky with conjugal clouds for the rest of the day the least stone in his path was treated as a gigantic mountain the narrowest brooklet as an unfathomable sea and graduallyshe scarcely knew how or whenthe old weary discomfort crept back over philippas heart the old unsatisfied longing for the love that no one gave her bower at kilquyt was no more strewn with roses than her turretchamber at arundel she found that on change du ciellon ne change point de soi the damask robes and caparisoned palfreys which her husband did not grudge to her as her father had done proved utterly unsatisfying to the misunderstood cravings of her immortal soul she did not herself comprehend why she was not happier she knew not the nature of the thirst which was upon her which she was trying in vain to quench at the broken cisterns within her reach drinking of this water she thirsted again and she had not yet found the way to the well of the living water about seven years after her marriage philippa stood one day at the gate of her manor it was a beautiful june morningjust such another as that one which had failed her hope at the gate of arundel castle thirty years before sir richard had ridden away on his road to london whence he was summoned to join his feudal lord the earl and lady sergeaux stood looking after him in her old dreamy fashion though halfanhour had almost passed since she had caught sight of the last waving of his nodding plume through the trees he had left her a legacy of discomfort for his spurs had been regilded not at all to his mind and he had been growling over them ever since the occurrence dame have you a draught of cold water to bestow on a weary brother philippa started suddenly when the question reached her ear he who asked it was a monk in the habit of the dominican order and very worn and weary he looked lady sergeaux called for one of her women and supplied him with the water which he sorely needed as was manifest from the eager avidity with which he drank when he had given back the goblet and the woman was gone the monk turned towards philippa and uttered words which astonished her no little quy de cette eaw boyra ancor soyf aura mays quy de leaw boyra que moy luy donneray jamays soyf naura a leternite you know that brother she said breathlessly do you lady asked the monkas philippa felt with a deeper than the merely literal meaning i know the ancor soyf aura she said mournfully i have not reached beyond that then did you ask and he did not give inquired the stranger noi never asked for she was going on to add i never knew where to ask then tis little marvel you never had lady answered the monk but how to askwhom to ask there may be the well but where is the way how to ask lady as i asked you but now for that lower poorer water whereof whosoever drinketh shall thirst again whom to ask be there more gods in heaven than one ask the master not the servants and where is the way it was made on the red rood thirteen hundred years ago when one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came thereout blood and water over that stream of blood is the way to the well of living water i do not fully understand you returned philippa you look weary lady said the monk changing his tone i am weary she answered wearier than youin one sense ay wearier than i he replied for i have been to the well and have found rest are you a priest asked philippa suddenly the monk nodded then come in hither and rest and let me confess to you i fancy you might tell me what would help me the monk silently obeyed and followed her to the house an hour later he sat in philippas bower and she knelt before him father she said at the close of her tale i have never known rest nor love all my life i have been a lonely neglected woman is there any balmtree by your well for such wounds as mineany healing virtue in its waters that could comfort me have you never injured or neglected any daughter asked the monk quietly never she said almost indignantly i cannot hold with you there he replied whom have i ever injured exclaimed philippa half angrily half amazed listen said he and i will tell you of one whom all your life you have injured and neglectedgod philippas protestations died on her lips she had not expected to hear such words as these nay heed not my words he pursued gently your own lips shall bring you in guilty have you loved god with all your mind and heart and soul and strength hath he been in all your thoughts philippa felt instinctively that the monk spoke truly she had not loved god she had not even wished to love him her conscience cried to her unclean yet she was too proud to acknowledge it she felt angry not with herself but with him she thought he rubbed the sore when he should bring the plaster comfort she had asked and condemnation he was giving her instead father she said in mingled sadness and vexation you deal me hard measure my daughter answered the monk very gently the pitcher must be voided ere it can be filled if you go to the well with your vessel full of the water of earth there will be no room there for the living water is it only for saints then she asked in a disappointed tone it is only for sinners answered he and according to your own belief you are not a sinner the living water is not wasted on pitchers that have been filled already at other cisterns i will give unto him that is athirstbut to him onlyof the fountain of the water of life freely but tell me in plain words what is that water of life the holy spirit of god philippas next question was not so wide of the mark as it seemed are you a true dominican i am one of the order of predicant friars from what house from ashridge who sent you forth to preach god ah yes but i mean what bishop or abbot is the seal of the servant worth more than that of the master i would know father urged philippa the monk smiled archbishop bradwardine he said then ashridge is a dominican house i know not that vicinage men give us another name responded the monk slowly which i see you would know be it so they call usbonihomines but i thought said philippa looking bewilderedly into his face i thought those were very evil men and archbishop bradwardine was a very holy manalmost a saint a faint ironical smile flitted for a moment over the monks grave lips the gravity was again unbroken the next instant a very holy man he repeated he walked with god and he is not for god took him ay took him away from the evil to come where he should vex his righteous soul no more by unlawful deedswhere the alloyed gold of worldly greatness which men would needs braid over the pure ermine of his life should soil and crush it no more he spoke rather to himself than to philippa and his eyes had a faraway look in them as he lifted his head and gazed from the window over the moorland then what are the bonihomines inquired lady sergeaux a few sinners answered the monk whose hearts god hath touched that they have sought and found that well of the living water but father explain it to me she cried anxiously perhaps even a little querulously put it in plain words that i can understand it what is it to drink this living water to come to christ my daughter replies the monk but i cannot understand you she objected in the same tone how can i come what mean you by coming he is not here in this chamber that i can rise and go to him can you not use words more intelligible to me in the first place my daughter softly replied the monk you are under a great mistake christ is here in this chamber and hath heard every word that we have said and in the second place i cannot use words that shall be plainer to you how can the dead understand the living how shall a man born blind be brought to know the difference of colour between green and blue yet the hardship lieth not in the inaptness of the teacher but in the inability of the taught but i am not blind nor dead cried philippa both answered the monk so by nature be we all philippa made no reply she was too vexed to make any the monk laid his hand gently upon her head take the best wish that i can make for yougod show you how blind you are god put life within you that you may awake and arise from the dead and see the light of christ may he grant you that thirst which shall be satisfied with nothing short of the living waterwhich shall lead you to disregard all the roughnesses of the way and the storms of the journey so that you may win christ and be found in him god strip you of your own goodnessfor i fear you are overwell satisfied therewith and no goodness shall ever have admittance into heaven save the goodness which is of god but surely exclaimed philippa looking up in surprise there is grace of congruity grace of congruity grace of condignity see note cried the monk fervently grace of sin and gracelessness it is not all worth so much as one of these rushes upon your floor if you carry grace of congruity to the gates of heaven i warn you it shall never bear you one step beyond lay down those miserable rushstaffs wherein is no pith and take gods golden staff held out to you which is the full and perfected obedience of the lord jesus christ that staff shall not fail you all the angels at the gate of paradise know it and the doors shall fly wide open to whoso smiteth on them with that staff of god lord open her eyes that she may see the prayer was answered but not then what shall i call you asked philippa when the monk rose to depart men call me guy of ashridge he said i hope to see you again father responded philippa so do i my daughter answered the monk in that other land whereinto nothing shall enter that defileth nothing but christ and christsthe head and the body the master and the meynie household servant may the master make you one of the meynie farewell and in five minutes more guy of ashridge was gone note condignity implies merit and of course claims reward on the score of justice congruity pretends only to a sort of imperfect qualification for the gifts and reception of gods gracemanets church history iv chapter four mother joan she hears old footsteps wandering slow through the lone chambers of her heart lowell when guy of ashridge was fairly gone philippa felt at once relieved and vexed to lose him she had called in a new physician to prescribe for her disease and she was sure that he had administered a harmful medicine if he had not also given a wrong diagnosis instead of being better she felt worse and she resolved to give herself the next dose in the form of a retreat into a convent to pray and fast and make her peace with god various reasons induced her to select a convent at a distance from home after a period of indecision she fixed upon the abbey of shaftesbury and obtained the necessary permission to reside there for a time lady sergeaux arrived at shaftesbury towards the close of august she found the abbess and nuns kindlydisposed towards her and her stay was not disagreeable except for the restless dissatisfied feelings of her own heart but she found that her peace was not made for all her fastings scourgings vigils and prayers guys words came back to her with every rite god strip you of your own goodness and she could not wrap herself in its mantle as complacently as before in the abbey of shaftesbury was one nun who drew philippas attention more than the others this was a woman of about sixty years of age whom all the convent called mother joan an upright whitehaired woman with some remnant of former comeliness but mother joan was blind philippa pitied her affliction and liked her simple straightforward manner she had many old memories and tales of forgotten times which she was ready enough to tell and these philippa as well as the nuns always liked to hear how old were you mother joan when you became a nun she asked her one day during the recreationhour younger than you lady said mother joan i was but an hilding see note of twenty and wherefore was it mother inquired a giddy young nun whose name was laura wert thou disappointed in love or the scorn exhibited on the blind womans face stopped her i never was such a fool said mother joan bluntly i became a nun because my father had decreed it from my cradle and my mother willed it also there were but two of us maids andah well she would not have more than one to suffer had thy sister then a woeful story asked sister laura settling her wimple see note as she thought becomingly never woman woefuller sadly replied mother joan the next opportunity she had lady sergeaux asked one of the more discreet nuns who mother joan was eldest daughter of the great house of le despenser replied sister senicula of most excellent blood and lineage daughter unto my noble lord of gloucester that was and the royal lady alianora de clare his wife the daughter of a daughter of king edward by mary mother and maiden she is the noblest nun in all these walls and what hath been her history inquired philippa her history i think was but little replied senicula your ladyship heard her say that she had been professed at twenty years but i have known her to speak of a sister of hers who had a very sorrowful story i have often wished to know what it were but she will never tell it the next recreationtime found philippa as usual seated by mother joan the blind nun passed her hand softly over philippas dress that is a damask the figured silk made at damascus she said i used to like damask and baudekyn note baudekyn or baldekyn was the richest silk stuff then known and also of oriental manufacture i never wear baudekyn answered philippa i am but a knights wife what is the colour the blind woman wished to know red and black in stripes said philippa i remember said mother joan dreamily many years ago seeing mine aunt the lady of gloucester at the court of king edward of caernarvon arrayed in a fair baudekyn of rose colour and silver it was the loveliest stuff i ever saw and i could see then her voice fell so mournfully that philippa tried to turn her attention by asking herknew you king edward of westminster see note nay lady de sergeaux with what years do you credit me rejoined the nun laughing a little edward of westminster was dead ere i was born but i have heard of him from them that did remember him well he was a goodly man of lofty stature and royal presence a wise man and a cunning cleversaving only that he opposed our holy father the pope did he so responded philippa did he so ironically repeated mother joan did he not command that no bull should ever be brought into england and hanged he not the prior of saint john of jerusalem for reading one to his monks i can tell you to brave edward of westminster was no laughing matter he never cared what his anger cost his own children had need to think twice ere they aroused his ire why on the day of his daughter the lady elizabeths marriage with my noble lord of hereford he being angered by some word of the bride snatched her coronet from off her head and flung it behind the fire ay and a jewel or twain was lost therefrom ere the ladys grace had it back and his son king edward of caernarvonwhat like was he asked philippa smiling mother joan did not answer immediately at last she saidthe blessed virgin grant that they which have reviled him be no worse than he he had some strange notionsso had other men whom i at least am bound to hold in honour god grant all peace philippa wondered who the other men were and whether mother joan alluded to her own ancestors she knew nothing of the despensers except the remembrance that she had never heard them alluded to at arundel but in a tone of bitter scorn and loathing maybe continued the blind woman in a softer voice he was no worse for his strange opinions some were not tis a marvellous matter surely that there be that can lead lives of angels and yet hold views that holy church condemneth as utterly to be abhorred whom mean you mother i mean child replied the nun speaking slowly and painfully one whom i hope is gone to god one to whom and for whom this world was an ill place and therefore i trust she hath found her rest in a better god knoweth how and when she diedif she be dead we never knew mother joan made the sign of the cross and a very mournful expression came over her face ah holy virgin she said lifting her sightless eyes why is it that such things are permitted the wicked dwell in peace and increase their goods the holy dwell hardly and die poor couldst not thou change the lots there is at this moment one man in the world clad in cloth of gold dwelling gloriously than whom the foul fiend himself is scarcely worse and there was one woman like the angels whose queen thou art and only god and thou know what became of her blessed mary must such things always be i cannot understand it i suppose thou canst it was the old perplexityas old as asaph but he understood it when he went into the sanctuary of god and mother joan had never followed him there lady de sergeaux resumed the blind nun there is at times a tone in your voice which mindeth me strangely of hershers of whom i spake but now if i offend not in asking it i pray you tell me who were your elders philippa gave her such information as she had to give i am a daughter of my lord of arundel which lord exclaimed mother joan in a voice as of deep interest suddenly awakened they call him answered philippa earl richard the coppedhat see note ah answered mother joan in that deep bass tone which sounds almost like an execration that was the man like dives clad in purple and fine linen and faring sumptuously every day and his portion shall be with dives at the last your pardon dame i forgat for the nonce that i spake to his daughter yet i said but truth that may be responded philippa under her breath then you have not found him a saint replied the blind nun with a bitter little laugh well i might have guessed that and you then are a daughter of that proud jade alianora of lancaster for whose indwelling the fiend swept the castle of arundel clean of gods angels i do not think she made up for it philippas own interest was painfully aroused now surely mother joan knows something of that mysterious history which hitherto she had failed so sadly to discover i cry you mercy mother she said but i am not the daughter of the lady alianora whose then quick cried mother joan in accents of passionate earnestness who was my mother answered philippa i cannot tell you for i was never told myself all that i know of her i had but from a poor lavender that spake well of her and she called her the lady isabel isabel isabel philippa was deeply touched for the name twice repeated broke in a wail of tender mournful love from the lips of the blind nun mother she pleaded if you know anything of her for the holy virgins love tell it to me her child i have missed her and longed for her all my life surely i have a right to know her story who gave me that life thou shalt know responded mother joan in a choked voice but child name me mother joan no longer call me what i am to theeaunt thy mother was my sister and then philippa knew that she stood upon the threshold of all her longnursed hopes but tell me first pursued the nun how that upstart treated thee alianora she was not unkind to me answered philippa hesitatingly she did not give me precedence over her daughters but then she is of the blood royal and i am not but not royal exclaimed mother joan in extremely treble tones have they brought thee up so ignorantly as that not of the blood royal quotha child by our ladys hosen thou art fiftythree steps nearer the throne than she we were daughters of alianora whose mother was joan of acon acre where joan was born daughter of king edward of westminster and she is but the daughter of henry the son of edmund son of henry of winchester henry the third philippa was silent from astonishment go on said the nun what did she to thee she did little said philippa in a low voice she only left undone ah replied mother joan the one half of the confiteor the other commonly marcheth apace behind then said philippa my mother was isabel la despenser younger daughter of the lord hugh le despenser the younger earl of gloucester and granddaughter of hugh the elder earl of winchester thou knowest their names well if not hers i know nothing about them replied philippa shaking her head none ever told me i only remember to have heard them named at arundel as very wicked persons and rebels against the king holy virgin cried mother joan rebelsagainst which king i do not know answered philippa but i do exclaimed the blind woman bitterly rebels against a rebel traitors to a traitress god reward isabelle of france for all the shame and ruin that she brought on england was the crown that she carried with her worth the price which she cost that carried it well she is dead nowgone before god to answer all that long and black account of hers methinks it took some answering child my father did some ill things and my grandfather did more but did either ever anything to merit the shame and agony of those two gibbets at hereford and bristol gibbets for them that had sat in the kings council and aided him to rule the realmand one of them a whitehaired man over sixty years see note and what had they done save to anger the tigress god help us all we be all poor sinners but there be some at the least in mens eyes a deal blacker than others but thou wouldst know her story not theirs yet theirs is the half of hers and the tale were unfinished if i told it not what was she like asked philippa mother joan passed her hand slowly over the features of her niece like and not like she said thy features are sharper cut than hers and though in thy voice there is a sound of hers it is less soft and low hers was like the wind among the strings of an harp hanging on the wall thy colouring i cannot see but if thou be like her thine hair is glossy and of chestnut hue and thine eyes are dark and mournful tell me about her aunt i pray you said philippa joan la despenser smoothed down her monastic habit and leaned her head back against the wall there was evidently some picture of memorys bringing before her sightless eyes and her voice itself had a lower and softer tone as she spoke of the dead sister but her first words were not of her holy virgin she said when thou didst create the world wherefore didst thou make women for women have but two fates either they are blacksouled like the tigress isabelle and then they prosper and thrive as she did or else they are white snowdrops like our dead darling and then they are martyrs a few die in the cradlethose whom thou lovest best and what fools are we to weep for them ah me things be mostly crooked in this world is there another me wondereth where they grow straightwhere the blacksouled die on the gibbets and the whitesouled wear the crowns i would like to die and change to that golden land if there be methinks it is far off it was a land very far off and over the eyes of joan la despenser the blinding film of earth remained for she had not drunk of the living water the founder of our housethus mother joan began her narrativewas my grandfathers father slain above an hundred years ago at the battle of evesham he left an infant son not four years old when he died this was my grandfather hugh le despenser earl of winchester who at the age of twentyfive advanced the fortunes of his house by wedding a daughter of warwick isabel the young widow of the lord de chaworth and the mothers mother of alianora of lancaster thou and thy fathers wife therefore are near akin this isabel after whom thy mother was named was a famed beauty and brought moreover a very rich dower my grandfather and she had many children but i need only speak of onemy hapless father king edward of caernarvon loved my father dearly in truth so did edward of westminster who bestowed on him ere he was fully ten years old the hand of his granddaughter my mother alianora de clare who brought him in dower the mighty earldom of gloucester the eldest of us was hugh my brother then came i next followed my other brothers edward gilbert and philip and last of all eight years after me came isabel thy mother from her birth this child was mine especial care i was alway a thoughtful quiet maiden more meet for cloister than court and i well remember though tis fifty years ago the morrow when my babysister was put into mine arms and i was bidden to have a care of her have a care of her had she never passed into any worse care than mine welladay yet could i have looked forward into the future and have read isabels coming history i might have thought that the wisest and kindest course i could take would be to smother her in her cradle before she was three years old she passed from me my lord of arundelearl edmund that then waswas very friendly with my father and he desired that their families should be drawn closer together by the marriage of richard fitzalan his son and heira boy of twelve yearswith one of my fathers daughters my father thus appealed unto gave him our snowdrop not joan said he joan is gods she shall be the spouse of christ in shaftesbury abbey so it came that ere my darling was three years old they twined the bridewreath for her hair and let it all down flowing soft and shining from beneath her golden fillet ah holy virgin had it been thy pleasure to give me that cup of gall they mixed that day for her and to her the draught of pure fresh water thou hast held to me perchance i could have drunk it with less pain than she did and at least it would have saved the pain to her that was in the fourteenth year of edward of caernarvon so long as earl edmund of arundel lived there was little to fear he as i said loved my father and was a father to isabel the lady of arundel likewise was then living and was careful over her as a mother knowest thou that the lady griselda of such fame for her patient endurance was an ancestress of thy father it should have been of thy mother hers was a like story only that to her came no reward no happy close but ere i proceed i must speak of one woeful matter which i do believe to have been the ruin of my father he was never loved by the peoplepartly i think because he gave counsel to the king to rule as they thought with too stern a hand partly because my grandfather loved money too well nor was he over careful how he came thereby partly because the queen hated him and she was popular but far above all these for another reason which was the occasion of his fall and the ruin of all who loved him hast thou ever heard of the bonihomines they have other names albigenses waldenses cathari men of the valleys they are a sect of heretics dwelling originally in the dominions of the marquis of monferrato toward the borders betwixt france italy and spain men condemned by the church and holding certain evil opinions touching the holy doctrine of grace of condignity and freewill and the like yet some of them i must confess lead not unholy lives philippa merely answered that she had heard of these heretics well resumed the blind woman my father became entangled with these men how or wherefore i know not he might have known that their doctrines had been condemned by the holy council of lumbars two hundred years back but when the friars predicants were first set up by the blessed dominic under leave of our holy father the pope many of these sectaries crept in among them a company went forth from ashridge and another from edingdonthe two houses of this brood of serpents and one of them named giles de edingdon fell in with my father and taught him the evil doctrines of these wretches whom earl edmund of cornwall of the blood royal that wedded a daughter of our house had in his unwisdom brought into this land for he was a wicked man and an ill liver see note king edward of caernarvon likewise listened to these men and did but too often according to their counsels against my grandfather and others but especially against these men of edingdon and ashridge dame isabelle the queen set herself up king edward had himself sent her away on a certain mission touching the homage due to the king of france for guienne for he might not adventure to leave the realm at that time but now this wicked woman gathered together an army and with prince edward and the kings brother the earl of kent who were deluded by her enchantments she came back and landed at orewell and thence marched with flying colours to bristol men gathering everywhere to her standard as she came we were in bristol on that awful day my mother the king had left in charge of the tower of london but in bristol with the king were my grandfather and father my lord and lady of arundel their son richard and isabel and myself i was then a maiden of sixteen years when dame isabelles banners floated over the gates of the city and her trumpets summoned the citizens to surrender king edward who was a timid man flung himself into the castle for safety and with him all of us saving my grandfather and my lord of arundel who remained without directing the defence the citizens of bristol thus besieged for she had surrounded the town sent to ask dame isabelle her will offering to surrender the city on condition that she would spare their lives and property but she answered by her trumpeter that she would agree to nothing unless they would first surrender the earls of winchester and arundel for saith she i am come purposely to destroy them then the citizens consulted together and determined to save their lives and property by the sacrifice of the noblest blood in england and as it was shown afterwards of the blood royal they opened their gates and yielded up my grandfather and thine to her will note hilding a word derived from the anglosaxon and used indiscriminately to denote a young person of either sex note wimple the covering for the neck worn by secular women as well as nuns and either with or without a veil or hood it had been in fashion for two centuries or thereabouts but was now beginning to be generally discarded note in accordance with the custom of the time by which persons were commonly named from their birthplaces edward the first the second and the third are respectively designated edward of westminster of caernarvon and of windsor note the coppedhat was the highcrowned brimless hat then fashionable the parent of the modern one an instance of it will be found in the figure of bolingbroke plate xvi of the illustrations to cretans history of richard the second archaeologia vol xx note one historian after another has copied froissarts assertion that hugh le despenser the elder at his death was an old man of ninety and none ever took the trouble to verify the statement yet the postmortem inquisition of his father is extant certifying that he was born in the first week in march so that on october the day of his execution he was only sixtyfive note it will be understood that this was the light in which the monks regarded earl edmund chapter five the story of isabel o dumb dumb lips o crushed crushed heart o grief past pride past shame miss muloch mother joan had arrived at the point closing the last chapter when the sharp ringing of the abbess little bell announced the end of the recreationtime and convent laws being quite as rigid as those of the medes and persians philippa was obliged to defer the further gratification of her curiosity when the next recreationtime came the blind nun resumed her narrative when dame isabelle was lodged at her ease for she saw first to that she ordered her prisoners to be brought before the prince her son she had the decency not to sit as judge herself but in outrage of all womanliness she sat herself in the court near the princes seat she would have sat in the seat rather than have missed her end the prince was wholly governed by his mother he knew not her true character and he was but a lad of fourteen years so when the prisoners were brought forth the tigress rose up in her place and spake openly to the assembled barons a shameful thing for a woman to do that she and her son would see that law and justice were rendered to them according to their deeds she that was the barons place not hers she should have kept to her distaff then said my grandfather bowing his white head ah dame god grant us an upright judge and a just sentence and that if we cannot have it in this world we may find it in another the charges laid against them were then read by the marshal and the barons gave sentenceof course as dame isabelle wished the lord of arundel and surrey the premier earl of england see note and the aged whitehaired earl of winchester see note were doomed to the death of traitors saint denis daychild it gives me a shudder to name it we were within the castle and they set up the gibbet before our eyes before the eyes of the son of the one man the wife and son of the other i remember catching up isabel and running with her into an inner chamberany whither to be out of sight of that awful thing i remember too that the lady of arundel having seen all she could bear fainted away on the rushes and i laid her gently down and nursed her back into life but when she came to herself she criedis it all over o cruel joan to have made me live i might have died with my lord at last it was all over overfor that time and god had taken no notice he had not opened the heavens and thundered down his great ire i suppose that must have been on account of some high festival they had in heaven in honour of saint denis and god was too busy listening to the angels to have any time for us but that night ere the dawn my father softly entered the chamber where we maidens slept he had been closeted half the night with the king taking counsel how to escape the cruel jaws of the tigress and now he roused us and bade us farewell he and the king would set forth in a little boat and endeavour to reach wales they thought us however safer in the castle we watched them embark in the grey dawn ere men were well astir and they rowed off toward wales would god they had stayed where they werebut god had not ended the festival of saint denis twelve days that little boat rode the silver severn beaten back beaten back at every tide the waves rough and the wind contrary and at length sir henry beaumont the devil whispering to him who were in the boat set forth in pursuit see note we saw them taken the monday after saint luke edward of caernarvon sometime king of england and hugh le despenser sometime earl of gloucester were led captives into bristol and delivered to the tigress but we were not to see them die perhaps saint luke had interceded for us as it was in his octave the king was sent to berkeley castle my father they set on the smallest and poorest horse they could find in the army clad in an emblazoned surcoat such as he was used to wear from the moment that he was taken he would touch no food and when they reached hereford he was so weak and ill that dame isabelle began to fear he would escape her hands by a more merciful death than she designed for him so she stayed her course at hereford for the feast of all saints and the morrow after she had him brought forth for trial they had need to bear him into her presence he was so nearly insensible finding that they could not wake him into life by speaking to him and calling him they twined a crown of nettles and set it on his head but he was even then too near death to rouse himself so lest he should die on the spot they hurried him forth to execution he died the death of a traitor but maybe god was more merciful than they and snatched his soul away ere he had suffered all they meant he should i suppose he allowed him to suffer previously in punishment for his allying himself with the wicked men of edingdon but i trust his suffering purified his soul and that god received him her vengeance thus satiated dame isabelle set out for london the castle of arundel was forfeited and the lady and her son richard were left homeless see note we set forth with them a journey of many weary days to join my mother but when we reached london we found all changed dame isabelle on her first coming had summoned my mother to surrender the tower and she being affrighted had resigned her charge and was committed to the custody of the lord de la zouche so we homeless ones bent our steps to sempringham where were two of my fathers sisters joan and alianora and we prayed the holy nuns there to grant us shelter in their abode of peace the lord of hereford gave an asylum for young richard those were peaceful quiet days we passed at sempringham and they were the last isabel was to know meanwhile the friars predicants and in especial the men of edingdon and ashridge were spreading themselves throughout the land working well to bring back the king working too well for dame isabelle took alarm and on saint maurices day twelve months after her landing the king died at berkeley castle god knew how and i think she knew who had sat by his side on the throne and who was the mother of his children we only heard at sempringham that on that night shrieks of agony rang through the vale of the severn and men woke throughout the valley and whispered a requiem for the hapless soul which was departing in such horrible torment but that opened the eyes of the young king for the prince of wales had been made king ay and all the hour of his crowning dame isabelle stood by and made believe to weep for her lord he began to see what a serpent was his mother and i daresay brother john de gaytenby the friar predicant who was his confessor let not the matter sleep and no sooner did edward of windsor gain his full power than he shut up the wicked jezebel his mother in the castle of rising she lived there twenty years she died there fourteen years ago so the tide turned the friends of dame isabelle died on the scaffold four years later even as he had died and we heard it at sempringham and knew that god and the saints and angels had taken up our cause at last child gods mill grindeth slowly but it grindeth very small ere this hugh my brother had been granted his life by the king but not our fathers earldom see note and when my father had been dead only two years leaving such awful memoriesour mother wedded again ah well she was our mother but child i have seen a caterpillar shaken rudely from the fragrant petals of a rose crawl to the next weed that grew she was fair and welldowered and against the kings will she wedded the lord de la zouche in whose custody she was and now for the end of my woeful tale which is the story of isabel herself for one year later the castle of arundel was given back to richard fitzalan and two years thereafter the lady of arundel died listen a little longer with patience for the saddest part of the story is that yet to come when richard and isabel went back to the castle of arundel i was a young novice just admitted and considering the second marriage of our mother and the death of the lady of arundel and the extreme youth of isabel who was not yet fourteen i was permitted to reside very much with her a woeful residence it was for now began the fourteen terrible years of my darlings passion for no sooner was his mothers gentle hand removed than even on the very day of her burial earl richard threw off the mask before that time i had wonderingly doubted if he loved her i knew then that he hated her and i found one other thing sadder yetthat she loved him i confess unto thee by the blessed anklebones of saint denis that i never could make out why i never saw in him anything to love and had i so done methinks he had soon had that folly out of me at first i scarcely understood all i used to see livid blue bruises on her neck and arms and ask her wherefore they were there and she would only flush faintly and sayit is nothingi struck myself against something i never knew for months against what she struck but she never complainednot even to me she was patient as an angel of god now and then i used to notice that there came to the castle an aged man in the garb of the friars predicants unto whomand to him only isabel used to confess so changed was he from his old self that i never knew till long after that this was our fathers old confessor giles de edingdon she only said to me that he taught her good things if he taught her her saintly endurance it was good but i fear he taught her other things as well to hold in light esteem that blessed doctrine of grace of condignity whereby man can and doth merit the favour of god and what he gave her instead thereof i know not she used to tell me but i forget now only once in an awful hour she said unto me that but for the knowledge he had given her she could not have borne her life what was that hourah it was the hour when for the first time he threw aside all care even before me and struck her senseless on the rushes at my feet and i never forgave him she forgave him poor innocentnay rather i think she loved him too well to think of forgiveness i never saw love like hers it would have borne death itself and have kissed the murderers hand in dying some women do love so i never did nor could but when this awful hour came and she fell at my feet as if dead by a blow from his hand in angerthe spirit of my fathers came upon me and like a prophetess of woe child i stood forth and cursed him i think god spake by me for words seemed to come from me without my will and i said that for two generations the heir of his house should die by violence in the flower of his age see note thou mayest see if it be so but i never shall and what said hehe said bowing his head lowsister joan la despenser is a great flatterer pray accept my thanks henceforward she may perhaps find the calm glades of shaftesbury more pleasant than the bowers of arundel at least i venture to beg that she will make the trial and he went forth calling to his hounds ay went forth without another word and left her lying there at my feether to save whom one pang of pain i would have laid down my life and the portcullis was shut upon me i was powerless to save her from that man i was to see her again no more i did see her again no more for ever i waited till her sense came back when she said she was not hurt and fell to excusing him i felt as though i could have torn him limb from limb but that would have pained her and then when she was restored i went forth from the castle of arundel i had been dismissed by the master and dearly as i loved her i was too proud to be dismissed twice so we took our farewell her soft cheek pressed to minefor the last time her dear eyes looking into minefor the last time her sweet low voice blessing mefor the last time and what were her last words saidst thou i cannot repeat them tearlessly even now god grant thee the living water those were they she had spoken to me oftthough i had not much cared to listen except to her sweet voiceof something whereof this giles had told her some kind of fairy tale regarding this life as a desert and of some well of pure fresh water deep down therein i know not what i cared for all that came from her but i cared nought for what came only through her from giles de edingdon but she said god had given her a draught of that living water and she was at rest i know nothing about it but i am glad if anything gave her rest from that anguisheven a fairy tale well after that i saw her no more again but now and then when mine hunger for her could no longer be appeased i used to come to the convent of arundel and send word to alina thy nurse to come to me thither and so from time to time i had word of her the years passed on and with them he grew harder and harder he had hated her first i think from the fancy that my father had been after some manner the cause of his fathers violent end and after that he hated her for herself and as time passed and she had no child he hated her worse than ever but at last after many years god gave her onethyself i thought perchance if anything would soften him thy smiles and babyish ways might do it butsoften him it had been easier to soften a rock of stone when he knew that it was only a girl that was born he hated her worse than ever three years more then the last blow fell earl henry of lancaster bade him to his castle as they talked quoth the earli would you had not been a wedded man my lord of arundel i had gladly given you one of my daughterspure foy quoth he but that need be no hindrance nor shall long nor was it he sent to our holy father the popewith some lie i trowand received a divorce and a dispensation to wed alianora his cousin the young widow of the lord de beaumont son of that sir henry that captured the king and my father all the while he told isabel nothing the meanest of her scullions knew of the coming woe before she knew it the night ere earl richard should be rewedded he thought proper to dismiss his discarded wife dame said he to her as he rose from the suppertable i pray you give good ear for a moment to what my chaplain is about to read he was always cruelly courteous before men she stayed and listened then she grew faint and whitethen she grasped the seat to support herthen she lost hold and sense and fell down as if dead before him poor miserablycrushed heart she loved this monster so well he waited till she came to herself then he gave the last stroke i depart now said he to fetch home my bride may i beg that the lady isabel la despenser will quit the castle before she comes it would be very unpleasant to her otherwise unpleasantto alianora and to isabel what would it be little he recked of that she had received her dismissal he had said to her in effectyou are my wife and lady of arundel no more she lifted herself up a little and looked into his face she knew she was looking upon him for the last time and once more the fervent unvalued longoutraged love broke forthonce more for the last time my lord my lord she wailed leave me not so richard give me one kiss for farewell he did not lift her from the ground he did not kiss her but he was not quite silent to that last bitter cry he held forth his handthe hand which had been uplifted to strike her so often she clasped it in hers and kissed it many times and that was his farewell when he had drawn his hand from her and was gone forth she sat a season like a statue listening she hearkened till she heard him ride awayon his way to alianora then as if some prop that had held her up were suddenly withdrawn she fell forward and lay with her face to the rushes all that awful night she lay there alina came to her and strove to lift her to give her food to yield her comfort but she took no heed of anything when the dawn came she arose and wrapped herself in her mantle she took no money no jewelsnot an ouche nor a grain of gold only she wrapped in silk two locks of hairhis and thine i should have left the first behind then when she was seated on the horse to depart the page told her who mounted afore that his lord had given him command to take her to a certain place which was not to be told beforehand alina said she shivered a little at this but she only answered do my lords will then she asked for thee alina lifted thee up to her and she clasped thee close underneath her veil and kissed thee tenderly and that was thy last mothers kiss then that is what i remember broke in philippa suddenly it is impossible child answered joan thou wert but a babe of three years old but i doi am sure i do she repeated have thy way said joan if thou so thinkest i will not gainsay thee well she gave thee back in a few minutes and then she rode awaynever pausing to look backno man knew whither but what became of her god wotteth sometimes i hope he murdered her one sin more or less would matter little to the black list of sins on his guilty soul and the little pain of dying by violence would have saved isabel the greater pain of living through the desolate woe of the future but i never knew as i told thee nor shall i ever know till that last day come when the great doom shall be and he and she shall stand together before the bar of god there shall be an end to her torment then it is something to think that there shall be no end to his so in a tone of bitter passionate vindictiveness joan la despenser closed her story philippa sat silent wondering many things if guy of ashridge knew any thing of this if giles de edingdon were yet living if agnes the lavender had ever found out what became of her revered mistress and when she knelt down to tell her beads that night a very strange and terrible prayer lingered on her lips the last and most earnestly of all it was that she might never again see her fathers face she felt that had she done so the spirit of the prophetess might have seized upon her as upon joan that terrified as she had always been of him she should now have stood up before him and have cursed him to his face note edmund fitzalan was premier earl as earl of surrey which title he acquired by his marriage with alesia sister and heir of john de warrenne last earl of surrey of the original male line note probably owing to the great mortality among the nobles caused by the french war a man who survived fifty was regarded as very old in the reign of edward the third note this is froissarts account of the events and his dates have been mainly followed many writers give a varying narrative stating that the king and earl did reach wales and were taken there in a wood their dates are also about a month later the inquisitions of the despensers as is usual in the case of attainted persons do not give the date of death note the castle was granted to edmund earl of kent brother of edward the second and there on his attainder and execution four years later his widow and children were arrested note the earldom did not return to the despenser family until when it was conferred on the greatgrandson of the attainted earl note earl richard his son was beheaded in london in the spring of earl thomas his grandson fell at agincourt october chapter six elaine no has visto un nino que viene a dar un doblon que tiene porque le den una flor lope de vega philippa determined to return home by way of sempringham she could not have given any very cogent reason except that she wished to see the place where the only peaceful days of her mothers life had been passed perhaps peace might there come to her also and she was far enough from it now it would have been strange indeed if peace had dwelt in a heart where was neither glory to god nor goodwill to men and while her veneration for her mothers memory was heightened by her aunts narrative her feeling towards her father originally a shrinking timidity had changed now into active hatred had she at that moment been summoned to his deathbed she would either have refused to go near him at all or have gone with positive pleasure but beside all this philippa could not avoid the conclusion that her salvation was as far from being accomplished as it had been when she reached shaftesbury she felt further off it than ever it appeared to recede from her at every approach very uneasily she remembered guys farewell wordsgod strip you of your own goodness the living water seemed as distant as before but the thirst grew more intense and yet like hagar in the wilderness the well was beside her all the time but until the angel of the lord should open her eyes she could not see it she reached sempringham and took up her abode for the night in the convent uncertain how long she would remain there an apparently trivial incident decided that question for her as philippa stood at the convent gate in a mild winter morning she heard a soft sweet voice singing and set herself to discover whence the sound proceeded the vocalist was readily founda little girl of ten years old who was sitting on a bank a few yards from the gate with a quantity of snowdrops in her lap which she was trying with partial success to weave into a wreath philippaweary of idleness books of hours and embroiderydrew near to talk with her what is thy name she asked by way of opening negotiations elaine said the child lifting a pair of timid blue eyes to her questioners face and where dwellest thou down yonder glade lady my father is wilfred the convent woodcutter and who taught thee to speak french the holy sisters lady what wert thou singing a minute since the child drooped her head shyly do not be afraid said philippa gently i like to hear singing wilt thou sing it again to me elaine hesitated a moment but another glance at philippas smiling face seemed to reassure her and she sang in a low voice to a sweet weird tune quy de cette eaw boyra ancor soyf aura mays quy de leaw boyra que moy luy donneray jamays soyf naura a leternite this must be very widely known thought philippawho taught thee thatthe holy sisters she asked of the child no answered elaine shaking her head the grey lady and who is the grey lady the look with which elaine replied showed philippa that not to know the grey lady was to augur herself unknown at least in the vale of sempringham know you not the grey lady all in the vale know her where dwelleth she up yonderbut to philippas eyes elaine merely pointed to a cluster of leafless trees on the hillside and is she one of the holy sisters on this point elaine was evidently doubtful the grey lady did not dwell in the convent nor in any convent she lived all alone therefore it was plain that she was not a sister but she was always habited in grey wherefore men called her the grey lady noshe had no other name a recluse manifestly said philippa to herself the child does not understand but is she an anchoritess or an eremitessdoes she ever leave her cell see note lady she tendeth all the sick hereabout she is a friend of every woman in the vale my mother saith an it like you that where there is any wound to heal or heart to comfort there is the grey lady and she saith she hath a wonderful power of healing as well for mind as body when edeline our neighbour lost all her four children by fever between the two saint agneses see note nobody could comfort her till the grey lady came and when ida my playmate lay dying and very fearful of death she said even the holy priest did her not so much good as the grey lady i think ended elaine softly she must be an angel in disguise the child evidently spoke her thought literally i will wait and see this grey lady thought philippa let me see if she can teach and comfort me ever since guy of ashridge visited kilquyt i seem to have been going further from comfort every day canst thou lead me to the grey ladys cell i could but she is not now there lady when will she be there tomorrow when the shadow beginneth to lengthen replied elaine who was evidently well acquainted with the grey ladys proceedings then tomorrow when the shadow beginneth to lengthen thou shalt come to the convent gate and i will meet with thee will thy mother give thee leave ay she alway giveth me leave to visit the grey lady the appointment was made and philippa turned back to the convent i was searching you lady de sergeaux said the portress when philippa reentered the gate during your absence there came to the priory close by a messenger from arundel on his road toward hereford and hearing that the lady de sergeaux was with us he sent word through a laybrother that he would gladly have speech of you a messenger from arundel what can he want with me philippa felt that all messengers from arundel would be very unwelcome to her she added rather ungraciously that perhaps she had better see him she passed into the guestchamber whither in a few minutes the messenger came to her he was a page habited in deep mourning and philippa recognised him at once as the personal varlet attendant on the countess the thought rose to her mind that the earl might have fallen in gascony god keep thee good hubert she said be thy tidings evil as evil as they might be lady answered the page sadly two days before the feast of saint hilary our lady the countess alianora was commanded to god a tumult of conflicting feelings went surging through philippas heart and brain was thy lord at home she inwardly hoped that he was not it was only fitting said the vindictive hatred which had usurped the place of her conscience that alianora of lancaster should feel something of that to which she had helped to doom isabel la despenser lady no our lord abideth in gascony with the duke of lancaster philippa was not sorry to hear it for her heart was full of envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness when the shadow began to lengthen on the following day philippa wrapped her mantle around her and called to her damsel to follow her varlet followed also at a little distance behind she found elaine and a younger child waiting for her outside the gate elaine introduced her companion as her sister annora annora proved much less shy than elaine and far more ready with her communications but she was not asked many questions for as they turned away from the convent gate they were met by a monk in the dominican habit and philippa knew directly the face of guy of ashridge christ save you father said she and you daughter he answered are you yet seeking comfort or have you found it i am further from it than ever she replied rather petulantly no wonder said guy for comfort hath another name which is christ who is a stranger to the one shall needs be a stranger to the other i have tried hard to make my salvation responded philippa more sadly but as yet i cannot do it nor will you though you could try a thousand years answered guy that is a manufacture beyond saints and angels and how then shall you do it who then can do it god said guy solemnly god hates me replied philippa under her breath he hateth all mine house for nigh fifty years he hath sent us sorrow upon sorrow and hath crushed us down into the dust of death poor blindling is that a proof that he hateth you answered guy more gently well it is true at times when the father sendeth a varlet in haste to save the child from falling over a precipice the childwhose heart is set on some fair flower on the rock belowdoth think it cruel you are that child and your trouble is the varlet god hath sent after you he hath sent his whole meynie then said philippa bitterly then the child will not come to the father said guy softly philippa was silent is the flower so fair that you will risk life for it pursued the monk nay not riskthat is a word implying doubt and here is none so fair then that you will throw life away for it and is the father not fair and precious in your eyes that you are in so little haste to come to him daughter what shall it profit you if you gain the whole worldand lose your own soul father you are too hard upon me cried philippa in a pained tone and resisting with some difficulty a strong inclination to shed tears i would come to god but i know not how nor do you tell me god is afar off and hath no leisure nor will to think on me nor can i presume to approach him without the holy saints to intercede for me i have sought their intercession hundreds of times it is not i that am unwilling to be saved and you speak to me as if you thought it so it is god that will not save me i have done all i can o fool and slow of heart to believe earnestly answered guy can it be god when he cared so much for you that he sent his blessed son down from heaven to die for your salvation beware how you accuse the lord i tell you again it is not his will that opposeth itself to your happiness but your own you have built up a wall of your own excellencies that you cannot see god and then you cry he hath hidden himself from me pull down your miserable mud walls and let the light of heaven shine in upon you christ will save you with no half nor quarter salvation he will not let you lay the foundation whereon he shall build he will not tear his fair shining robe of righteousness to patch your worthless rags with him either not at all or all in all but what would you have me do said philippa in a vexed tone believe replied guy believe what said she believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved the easiest thing in the world answered philippa a little contemptuously is it so responded the monk with a pitying smile it seems to me that you have found it since last june the hardest thing in the world whither go you now he asked suddenly changing his tone i go she rejoined with this child to the cell of an eremitess of whom she hath told me that hath quoth she great power of comforting the sorrowful all about here seem to know her they call her the grey lady guy looked on her long and earnestly an expression creeping over his face which philippa could not understand be it so he said at last i will lead the blind by a way that they know not let my voice be silent when he speaketh verilyand his voice fell to a softer tonei never passed through the deep waters wherein she has waded nor perchance where you have let god speak to you through her go your way but who is shethis grey lady philippa asked in vain guy either did not hear her or would not answer he walked rapidly down the hill with only farewell as he passed her and she went her way to meet her faterather to meet gods providencein the cell of the grey lady note anchorites never left their cells though they received visitors within them and sometimes taught children hermits wandered about freely note saint agnes day is january but the th instead of the octave of saint agnes was commonly called saint agnes the second chapter seven in the cell of the grey lady blood must be my bodys balmer while my soule like peaceful palmer travelleth toward the land of heaven other balm will not be given sir walter raleigh elaine tapped softly on the weatherbeaten door of the cell it was merely hollowed out in the rock and built up in front with a low door and a very little window who is it asked a soft voice from within elaine and annora replied the little girl come in my children motioning philippa to wait for her an instant elaine lifted the latch and entered half closing the door behind her some lowtoned conversation followed within the cell and then elaine opened the door and asked philippa to enter the grey lady stood before her what she saw was a tall slender delicate figure attired in dark grey the figure alone was visible for over the face the veil was drawn down but philippas own knowledge of aristocratic life told her in an instant that the reverence with which she was received was that of a highborn lady it was plain that the eremitess was no peasant elaine seemed to know that she was no longer wanted and she drew annora away the children went dancing through the wood and philippa desiring lena and oliver to await her pleasure shut the door of the cell mother she beganfor recluses were addressed as professed nuns and were indeed regarded as the holiest of all celibatesi desire your help for body or soul was the reply for the soulfor the life said philippa ay replied the eremitess the soul is the life know you guy of ashridge asked philippa the grey lady bowed her head i have confessed to him and he hath dealt hardly with me he saith i will not be saved and i wish to be saved he tells me to come to christ and i know not how to come and he saith he cannot make me understand how he saith god loveth me because he hath given me a very desolate and unhappy life and i think he hateth me by that token in short father guy tells me to do what i cannot do and then he saith i will not do it will you teach me and comfort me if you can the monk only makes me more unhappy and i do not want to be unhappy i want comforti want resti want peace tell me how to obtain it no one wishes to be unhappy said the eremitess in her gentle accents but sometimes we mistake the medicine we need before i can give you medicine i must know your disease my disease is weariness and sorrow answered philippa i love none and none loveth me none hath ever loved me i hate all men and god i do not know god she said her voice sinking he is afar off and will come no nearer or you are afar off and will go no nearer which is it i think it is the first she answered guy of ashridge will have it to be the second i cannot get at godthat is all i know and it is not for want of praying i have begged the intercession of my patron the holy apostle saint philip hundreds of times do you know why you cannot get at god no if you can guess tell me why it is because you have gone the wrong way you have not found the door you are trying to break through over the wall and he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber explain to me what you mean mother an it like you you know how adam sinned in paradise asked the grey lady when he and eva disobeyed god and ate of the fruit of the forbidden tree yes i have heard that he built up a terrible wall between him and god every man as born into this world is on the hither side of that wall he knoweth not god he loveth not god he careth not for god but that is not the case with me objected philippa for i do wish for him i want some one to love me and i should not mind if it were god even he were better than none the grey ladys veil trembled a little as philippa thought but she sat meditating for an instant before i answer your last remark she said will you tell me a little of your life i might know better how to reply you are a married woman of course for your dress is not that of a nun nor of a widow have you children are your parents living i have no child said philippa and the grey ladys penetration must have been obtuse if she were unable to detect a tone of deep sadness underlying the words and parentslivingdid you ask me by mary mother and maiden i have but one living and i hatei hate him the passionate energy with which the last words were spoken told its own tale then it is no marvel answered the grey lady in a very different tone from philippas that you come to me with a tale of sorrow where there is hatred there can be no peace and without peace there can be no hope hope exclaimed philippa bitterly what is there for me to hope who ever cared for me who ever asked me if i were happy nobody loves mewhy should i love anybody god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us the words fell like cooling water on the hot fire of philippas bitterness but she made no answer had god waited for us to love him resumed the eremitess where had we been now we love him because he first loved us he never loved me answered philippa mournfully he loved me so much said the grey lady softly that he made the way rough that he might help me over it he made the waters deep that he might carry me through them he caused the rain to fall heavily that i might run to him for shelter he made mine earthly house of this tabernacle dreary and cold that i might find the rest and light and warmth of his home above so much the sweeter yea he made me friendless that i might seek and find in jesu christ the one friend who would never forsake me the one love that would never weary nor wax cold philippa shook her head she had never looked at her troubles in this light but if the way be thus rough and yet you will walk in it alone though your feet be bleeding if the waters be deep and yet you will strive to ford them unaided if the house be drear and lonely and yet you will not rise up and go homeis it any wonder that you are sorrowful or that you do not know him whose love you put thus away from you and you tell me that gods love were better to you than none better than nonebetter than any better than all mans love can save from some afflictions i grant but from how many it can not can human love keep you from sicknessfrom sorrowfrom povertyfrom death yet the love of christ can take the sting from all thesecan keep you calm and peaceful through them all they will remain and you will feel them but the sting will be gone there will be an underlying calm the wind may ruffle the surface but it cannot reach beneath the lamb is safe in the arms of the shepherd but it does not hold itself there he who shed his blood for us on the rood keepeth us safe and none shall be able to pluck us out of his hand o lady if thou knewest the gift of god thou wouldst have asked of him and he would have given thee living water they tell me of that living water one and all and i would fain drink thereof but i am in the desert and the well is afar off and i know not where to find it philippa spoke not angrily now but very sorrowfully and thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep that is just what i feel said philippa earnestly yet it is close beside you answered the grey lady the water is drawn and ready all that is needed is your outstretched hand to take it christ giveth the living water christ is the door by which if any man enter in he shall be saved christ is our peace with god you have not to make peace for them that take christs salvation peace is made you can never make peace it took christ to make it your salvation if you be saved at allwas finished thirteen hundred years ago god hath provided this salvation for you and all your life he hath been holding it forth to youhath been calling you by all these your sorrows to come and take it so many years as you have lived in this world so many years you have grieved him by turning a deaf ear and a cold heart towards his great heart and open hand held forth to youtowards his loving voice bidding you come to him oh grieve him no longer let your own works your own goodness your own sufferings drop from you as the castoff rags of a beggar and wrap yourself in the fair white robe of righteousness which the king giveth youwhich he hath wrought himself on purpose for youfor which he asks no price from you for he paid the price himself in his own blood he came not to live and work and suffer for himself but for you you complain that none loveth you all these years there hath been love unutterable waiting for you and you will not take it it seemed to philippa a very fair picture never before had the garden of god looked so beautiful to her who stood waiting without the gate but there appeared to be barriers between it and her which she could not pass and in especial one loomed up before her dark and insuperable butmust i forgive my father you must come to christ ere you do any thing after thatwhen he hath given you his forgiving spirit and his strength to forgivecertainly you must forgive your father whatever he hath done whatever he hath done i can never do that replied philippa yet rather regretfully than angrily what he did to me i might but i know said the grey lady quietly when philippa paused it is easier to forgive ones own wrongs than those of others i think your heart is not quite so loveless as you would persuade yourself to the deadno said philippa huskily but to any who could love me in return and she paused again leaving her sentence unended as before no i never could forgive him never of yourself was the answer but whoso taketh christ for his priest to atone taketh christ also for his king to govern in him god worketh bringing forth from his soul graces which he himself hath first put theregraces which the natural heart never can bring forth faith is the first of these then love and then obedience and both love and obedience teach forgiveness if ye forgive not men their trespasses how then shall your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses then said philippa after a minutes silence during which she was deeply meditating what we give to god is these graces of which you speakwe give him faith and love and obedience assuredlywhen he hath first implanted all within us but what do we give of ourselves asked philippa in a puzzled tone we give ourselves this giving of ourselves then pursued philippa slowly maketh the grace of condignity we give to god replied the low voice of the eremitess ourselves and our sins the last he purgeth away and casteth them into the depths of the sea is there grace of condignity in them and for us when our sins are forgiven and our souls cleansed we are for ever committing further sin for ever needing fresh cleansing and renewed pardon is there grace of condignity then in us but where do you allow the grace of condignity i allow it not at all philippa shrank back a little in her eyes this was heresy you love not that said the grey lady gently but can you find any other way of salvation that will stand with the dignity of god if man save himself then is christ no saviour if man take the first step towards god then is christ no author but only the finisher of faith it seems to me answered philippa rather coldly that such a view as yours detracts from the dignity of man she could not see the smile that crossed the lips of the eremitess most certainly it does said she and god made man objected philippa to injure the dignity of man therefore is to affront the dignity of god dignity fell with adam said the grey lady satan fatally injured the dignity of man when he crept into eden man hath none left now but only as he returneth unto god and do you think there be any grace of condignity in a beggar when he holdeth forth his hand to receive a garment in the convent dole is it such a condescension in him to accept the coat given to him that he thereby earneth it of merit yet this and less than this is all that man can do toward god are you one of the bonihomines asked philippa suddenly she was beginning to recognise their doctrines now the family of god are one answered the grey lady rather evasively he teacheth not different things to divers of his people though he lead them by varying ways to the knowledge of the one truth but are you one of the bonihomines philippa repeated by birthno no echoed philippa i should think not by birth your accent and your manners show you highborn and they are lowborn varletscommon people the common people answered the grey lady are usually those who hear christ the most gladly not many noble are called yet thank god a few but do you then count archbishop bradwardine or bishop grosteste or william de edingdon bishop of winchester and chancellor of englandamong the common people they were not among them exclaimed philippa in contemptuous surprise trust me but they weretwo of them at least and the third preached their doctrines though he went not out from them i could not have believed it the wind bloweth where it listeth said the grey lady softly but she hardly spoke to her visitor philippa rose i thank you for your counsel she said and you mean not to follow it was the gentle response i do not know what i mean to do she said honestly i want to do right but i cannot believe it right to deny the grace of condignity it is so blessed a doctrine how else shall men merit the favour of god and i do not perceive by your view how men approach god at all by god approaching them said the eremitess whosoever will let him take the water of life freely but god provideth the water man only receiveth it and the will to receive it is of god not of mans own deed and effort it is god that worketh in us salvation is not of works lest any man should boast that is not the doctrine of holy church answered philippa somewhat offended it is the doctrine of saint paul was the quiet rejoinder for the words i have just spoken are not mine but his are you certain of that mother quite certain who told you them the grey lady turned and took from a rough shelf or ledge scooped out in the rocky wall of the little cavern a small browncovered volume i know not if you can read she said offering the book to lady sergeaux but there are the words the little volume was no continuous book of scripture but consisted of passages extracted almost at random of varying lengths apparently just as certain paragraphs had attracted her when she heard or read them yes i can read my nurse taught me said philippa taking the little book from her hand but her eyes lighted the first thing upon a passage which enchained them and she read no further whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst chapter eight the veil uplifted household names that used to flutter through your laughter unawares gods divine name ye can utter with less trembling in your prayers elizabeth b browning philippa sat down again with the book in her hand her mood had changed suddenly at the sight of the text which she instantly guessed to be the original of her wellremembered device i need not go yet she said unless i weary you mother i am never wearied of the masters work answered the low voice lady sergeaux opened the door of the cell lena and oliver she called you can return to the convent and come hither for me again ere the dusk falleth i shall abide a season with this holy mother but your ladyship will ere that be faint for hunger objected lena noi will take care of that replied the grey lady ere philippa could answer lena louted and departed with oliver and her mistress again closed the door of the cell the grey lady set bread before her and honey with a cup of milk bidding her eat thank you mother but i am not hungry yet said philippa you ought to be you had better eat was the quiet answer and quiet as the voice was it had a tone of authority which philippa involuntarily and unconsciously obeyed and while she ate her hostess in her turn became the questioner are you a knights wife i am the wife of sir richard sergeaux a knight of cornwall said philippa my lord is away in gascony in the train of the earl of arundel who accompanies the duke of lancaster at present governor of those parts while he is absent i hope to be able to make my salvation in retreat and to quiet my conscience the grey lady made no reply philippa almost expected her to ask if her conscience were quiet or how much of her salvation she had made guy of ashridge she thought would have preached a sermon on that text but no answer came from the veiled figure only her head drooped upon her hand as if she were tired now i am wearying you said philippa reproachfully i ought to have gone when i first thought thereof no said the grey lady her voice if possible was even softer than before but philippa could not avoid detecting in it a cadence of pain so intense that she began to wonder if she were ill or what portion of her speech could possibly have caused it are you ill mother she asked compassionately the eremitess lifted her head and her voice was again calm i thank youno let us not speak of ourselves but of god mother i wish to ask you something said philippa rather doubtfully for she did not wish to pain her again yet she deemed her coming question necessary ask what you will lady de sergeaux there was no sad cadence now in the gentle voice i desire to knowfor so only can you really help meif you know yourself what it is to be unloved once more philippa saw the grey veil tremble i know itwell but the words were uttered scarcely above a whisper i meant to ask you that at first and we name upon another subject but i am satisfied if you know it and now tell me how may any be content under such a trial how may a weary thirsting heart come to drink of that water which he that drinketh shall thirst no more mother all my life i have been drinking of many wells but i never yet came to this well ancor soyf jay tell me how i must labour where i must go to find that well whereof the drinker jamays soyf naura a leternite who taught you those lines asked the eremitess quickly i found them in the device of a jewel replied philippa strange said the recluse but she did not explain why she thought it so lady the living water is the gift of god or rather it is god and the heart of man was never meant to be satisfied with anything beneath god but the heart of woman at least said philippa for i am not a man is often satisfied with things beneath god it often rests in them said the grey lady but i doubt whether it is satisfied that is a strong word are you i am most unsatisfied answered philippa otherwise i had not come to you i want rest and yet christ hath been saying all your life to you as to otherscome unto me all ye that travail and are weary laden and i will give you rest he never gave it me because you never came for it i wonder if he can give it said philippa sighing trust me that he can i never knew it till i came to him but are you at rest you scarcely looked so just now at rest said the grey lady except when a breeze of earth stirs the soul which should be soaring above earthwhen the dreams of earth come like a thick curtain between that soul and the hope of that heavenas it was just now then you are not exempt from that in coming to christ for rest we do not leave our human hearts and our human infirmities behind usassuredly not then do you think it wrong to desire to beloved not wrong to desire christs love but to desire the love of some human being or of any human being the eremitess paused an instant before she answered i should condemn myself if i said so she replied in a low tone the sad cadence returning to her voice i must leave that with god he hath undertaken to purge me from sin and he knows what is sin if that be so he will purge me from it i have put myself in his hands to be dealt with as pleaseth him and my physician will give me the medicines which he seeth me to need let me counsel you to do the same yet what pleaseth him might not please me it would be strange if it did why said philippa because it is your nature to love sin and it is his nature to love holiness and what we love we become he that loveth sin must needs be a sinner i do not think i love sin rejoined philippa rather offended that is because you cannot see yourself just what guy of ashridge had told her but not more palatable now than it had been then what is sin asked the grey lady philippa was ready with a listof sins which she felt certain she had not committed give me leave to add one said the eremitess pride is sin nay it is the abominable sin which god hateth and is there no pride in you lady de sergeaux you tell me you cannot forgive your own father now i know nothing of you nor of him but if you could see yourself as you stand in gods sightwhatever it be that he hath doneyou would know yourself to be as black a sinner as he where then is your superiority you have as much need to be forgiven but i have not cried philippa in no dulcet tones her annoyance getting the better of her civility i never was a murderer i never turned coldly away from one that loved mefor none ever did love me i never crushed a loving faithful heart down into the dust i never brought a child up like a stranger i neverstay i will go no further into the catalogue but i know i am not such a sinner as henay i am not to be compared to him and have you asked the grey lady very gently turned no cold ear to the loving voice of christ have you not kept far away from the heavenly father have you not grieved the holy spirit of god may it not be said to you as our lord said to the jews of old timeye will not come to me that ye might have life it was only what guy of ashridge had said before but this time there seemed to be a power with the words which had not gone with his philippa was silent she had no answer to make you are right she said after a long pause i have done all this but i never saw it before mother the next time you are at the holy mass will you pray for me why wait till then was the rejoinder let us tell him so now and surprised as she was at the proposal philippa knelt down thank you and the holy saints bless you she said as she rose now i must go and i hear lenas voice without but ere i depart may i ask you one thing anything what could i possibly have said that pained you for that something did pain you i am sure i am sorry for it whatever it may have been the soft voice resumed its troubled tone it was only said the grey lady that you uttered a name which has not been named in mine hearing for twentyseven years you told me where and doing what was one of whom and of whose doings i had thought never to hear any more one of whom i try never to think save when i am praying for him or in the night when i am alone with god and can ask him to pardon me if i sin but whom did i name said philippa in an astonished tone have i spoken of any but of my husband do you know him i have never heard of him before today nor of you i think i did mention the duke of lancaster a shake of the head negatived this suggestion well i named none else pursued philippa saving the earl of arundel and you cannot know him even then she felt an intense repugnance to saying my father but much to her surprise the grey lady slowly bowed her head and in what manner began philippa can you know but before she uttered another word a suspicion which almost terrified her began to steal over her she threw herself on her knees at the feet of the grey lady and grasped her arm tightly all the holy saints have mercy upon usare you isabel la despenser it seemed an hour to philippa ere the answer came and it came in a tone so low and quivering that she only just heard it i was and then a great cry of mingled joy and anguish rang through the lonely cell mother mine own mother i am philippa fitzalan there was no cry from isabel she only held out her arms and in an embrace as close and tender as that with which they had parted the longseparated mother and daughter met chapter nine together woe to the eye that sheds no tears no tears for god to wipe away gem and is it so hard to forgive asked the soft voice of isabel i will try but it seems impossible responded philippa how can any forgive injuries that reach down to the very root of the heart and life my child said isabel he that injureth followeth after satan but he that forgiveth followeth after god it is because our great debt to god is too mighty for our bounded sight and we cannot reach to the ends thereof that we are so ready to require of our fellowdebtors the small and sorry sum owed to ourselves he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen and can any love and yet not forgive it is sometimes easier to love one ere he be seen than after said philippa sarcastically isabel smiled rather sadly for the latent thought in her daughters mind was only too apparent to her had philippa known as little of her father as of her mother her feeling towards him would have been far less bitter but there was no other answer even though twentyseven years lay between that day and the june morning on which she had quitted arundel isabel could not trust herself to speak of richard fitzalan she dared not run the risk of reopening the wound by looking to see whether it had healed mother said philippa suddenly thou wilt come with me to kilquyt for a time answered isabel if thine husband assent thereto i shall not ask him said philippa with a slight pout then i shall not go replied isabel quietly i will not enter his house without his permission philippas surprise and disappointment were legible in her face but mother thou knowest not my lord she interposed there is not in all the world a man more wearisome to dwell withal every thing i do he dislikes and every thing i wish to do he forbids i am thankful for his absence for when he is at home from dawn to dusk he doth nought save to find fault with me but notwithstanding her remonstrance philippa had fathomed her mothers motive in thus answering sir richard possessed little of his own he was almost wholly dependent on the earl her father and had it pleased that gentleman to revoke his grant of manors to herself and her husband they would have been almost ruined and philippa knew quite enough of earl richard the coppedhat to be aware that few tidings would be so unwelcome at arundel as those which conveyed the fact of isabels presence at kilquyt her mothers uplifted hand stopped her from saying more hush my daughter said the low voice repay not thou by finding fault in return what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god i am not so patient as you mother answered philippa shaking her head perhaps it were better for me if i were but dost thou mean that i must really ask my lords leave ere thou wilt come with me i do mean it and thou sayest for a timewilt thou not dwell with me the vows of the lord are upon me replied isabel gravely i cannot forsake the place wherein he hath set me the work which he hath given me to do i will visit thee and my sister also but that done i must return hither but dost thou mean to live and die in yonder cell it was in the recreationroom of the convent that they were conversing even so my daughter see note philippas countenance fell it seemed very hard to part again when they had but just found each other if this were religion it must be difficult work to be religious yet she was more disappointed than surprised especially when the first momentary annoyance was past my child said isabel softly seeing her disappointment if i err in thus speaking i pray god to pardon me i can but follow what i see right and to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean how can i forsake the hearts that look to me for help throughout this valley and if thou have need of me thou canst always come or send for me this gentle apologetic explanation touched philippa the more because she felt that in the like case she could not herself have condescended to make it the next thing to be done was to write to sir richard this philippa was unable to do personally since the art of handling the pen had formed no part of her education her mother did it for her for isabel had been solidly and elaborately instructed by giles de edingdon under the superintendence of the kings confessor luke de wodeford also a predicant friar the letter had to be directed very much at randomto sir richard sergeaux of the duke of lancasters following at bordeaux or wherever he may be found fortunately for philippa the prior of the neighbouring monastery was just despatching his cellarer to london on conventual business and he undertook to convey her letter to the savoy palace whence it would be forwarded with the next despatches sent to john of gaunt philippa in whose name the letter was written requested her husband to reply to her at shaftesbury whither she and isabel meant to proceed at once the spring was in its full beauty when they reached shaftesbury philippa had not found an opportunity to let the abbess know of her coming but she was very cordially welcomed by that goodnatured dame the recreationbell sounded while they were conversing and at philippas desire the abbess sent for mother joan to the guestchamber sister senicula led her in how is it with you aunt said philippa affectionately i have returned hither as you may hear ah is it thou child said the blind nun in answer i fare reasonably well as a blind woman may i am glad thou hast come hither again it evidently cost isabel much to make herself known to the sister from whom she had parted in such painful circumstances thirtyseven years before for a few moments longer she did not speak and philippa waited for her at last isabel said in a choked voicesister joan holy virgin exclaimed the blind woman who called me that one that thou knewest once answered isabels quivering voice from heaven cried joan almost wildly can the dead come back again and she stretched forth her hands in the direction from which the sound of her sisters voice had come no but the living may said isabel kneeling down by her and clasping her arms around her isabel and joans trembling hands were passed over her face as if to assure herself that her ears had not deceived her it can be no voice but thine holy virgin i thank thee the abbess broke in in a manner which though wellmeant was exceedingly illtimed and in bad taste she was kindlydisposed but had not the faintest trace of that delicate perception of others feelings and consideration for them which constitutes the real difference between natures ladies and such as are not ladies verily to think that this holy mother and our mother joan be sisters cried she i remember somewhat of your history my holy sister are you not she that was sometime countess of arundel philippa saw how isabel trembled from head to foot but she knew not what to say joan la despenser was equal to the emergency holy mother she said quietly would it please you of your great goodness to permit me to remain here during the recreationhour with my sister i am assured we shall have much to say each to other if we may have your blessed allowance to speak freely after this manner be it so sister said the abbess smiling genially i will see to our sisters in the recreationchamber a long conversation followed the departure of the abbess joan took up the history where she had parted from isabel and told what had been her own lot since then and isabel in her turn recounted her storyneither a long nor an eventful one for it told only how she had been taken to sempringham by the page and had there settled herself in the hermits cell which happened to be vacant when philippa was lying awake that night her thoughts were troublous ones not only did she very much doubt sir richards consent to her mothers visit to kilquyt but another question was puzzling her exceedingly how far was it desirable to inform isabel of the death of alianora she had noticed how the unfortunate remark of the abbess had agitated her mother and she also observed that when joan came to speak to isabel herself she was totally silent concerning earl richard the uncomplimentary adjectives which she had not spared in speaking to philippa were utterly discarded now would it not do at least as much harm as good to revive the old memories of pain by telling her this philippa decided to remain silent the summer was passing away and the autumn hues were slowly creeping over the forest when sir richards answer arrived at shaftesbury it was not a pleasing missive but it would have cost philippa more tears if it had made her less angry that gentleman had not written in a good temper but he was not without excuse for he had suffered something himself he had not dared to reply to philippas entreaty without seeking in his turn the permission of the earl of arundel in whose hands his fortune lay to make or mar and by one of those uncomfortable coincidences which have led to the proverb that misfortunes never come single it so happened that the news of the countesss death had reached the earl on the very morning whereon sir richard laid philippas letter before him the result was that there broke on the devoted head of sir richard a tempest of ungovernable rage so extremely unpleasant in character that he might be excused for his anxiety to avoid provoking a second edition of it the earl was grievedso far as a nature like his could entertain griefto lose his second wife but to find that the first wife had been discovered and by her daughter possessed the additional character of insult that the occurrence was accidental did not alter matters words would not content the aggrieved mourner his hand sought the hilt of his sword and sir richard thinking discretion the better part of valour made his way as quickly as the laws of matter and space allowed him out of the terrible presence whereinto he had rashly ventured feeling himself wholly innocent of any provocation it was not surprising that he should proceed to dictate a letter to his wife scarcely calculated to gratify her feelings thus ran the offending document dameyour epistle hath reached mine hands see note wherein it hath pleased you to give me to know of your finding of the lady isabel la despenser your fair mother see note and likewise of your desire that she should visit you at my manor of kilquyt know therefore that i can in no wise assent to the same for i am assured that it should provoke and that in no small degree the wrath of your fair father my gracious lord of arundel and i hereby charge you on your obedience so soon as you shall receive this my letter that you return home and tarry no longer at shaftesbury nor sempringham know that i fare reasonably well and eustace my squire and your fair father likewise saving that he hath showed much anger towards you and me and thus praying god and our blessed lady and saint peter and saint paul to keep you i rest r sergeaux the entire epistle was written by a scribe for sir richard was as innocent of the art of calligraphy as philippa herself and the appending of his seal was the only part of the letter achieved by his own hand philippa read the note three times before she communicated its contents to any one the first time it was with feelings of bitter anger towards both her father and her husband the second her view of her fathers conduct remained unchanged but she began to see that sir richard from his own point of view was not without reasonable excuse for his refusal and that considering the annoyance he had himself suffered his letter was moderate and even tolerably kindkind that is for him after the third perusal philippa carried the letter to joan and read it to hernot in isabels presence what a fool wert thou child said joan with her usual bluntness to send to thy lord concerning this matter well what is done is done i had looked for no better had i known of it philippa did not read the letter to her mother she merely told her the substance that sir richard would not permit her to receive her at kilquyt and that he had ordered her home without delay isabels lip quivered a moment but the next instant she smiled i am not surprised my child she said take heed and obey it was hard work to obey hard to part with joan harder yet to leave isabel in her lonely cell at sempringham and to go forward on the as lonely journey to kilquyt perhaps hardest of all was the last night in the recreationroom at sempringham isabel and philippa sat by themselves in a corner the hand of the eremitess clasped in that of her daughter but how do you account for all the sorrow that is in the world philippa had been saying take my life for instance or your own mother god could have given us very pleasant lives if it had pleased him why did he not do so how can it augur love to take out of our way all things loved or loving my daughter answered isabel i am assuredand the longer i live the more assured i amthat the way which god marketh out for each one of his chosen is the right way the best way and for that one the only way every pang given to us if we be christs is a pang that could not be spared as he was so are we in this world and with us as with him thus it must be all our lords followers wear his crown of thorns but theirs under his loving hand bud and flower which his never did till he could cry upon the rood it is finished but could not god said philippa a little timidly have given us more grace to avoid sinning rather than have needed thus to burn our sins out of us with hot irons thou art soaring up into the seventh heaven of gods purposes my child answered isabel with a smile i have no wings to follow thee so far thou thinkest then mother replied philippa with a sigh that we cannot understand the matter at all we can understand only what is revealed to us replied isabel and that i grant is but little yet it is enough as many as i love i rebuke and chasten what son is he whom the father chasteneth not how could it be otherwise he were no wise father nor loving who should teach his son nothing or should forbear to rebuke him for such folly as might hereafter be his ruin isabel was silent and philippas memory went back to those old loveless days at arundel when for her there had been no chastening no rebuke only cold lifeless apathy that was not love and she thought also of her halfsister alesia whom she had visited once since her marriage and who brought up her children on the principle of no contradiction and unlimited indulgence and remembering how discontented and hard to please this discipline had made them she began to see that was not love either thou hast wrought arras my daughter said isabel again thou knowest therefore that to turn the arras the backward way showeth not the pattern the colours are all mixed out of proportion as the fastenings run in and out so our life is in this world the arras shall only be turned the right way above when the angels of god shall see it and marvel at the fair proportions and beauteous colours of that which looked so rough and misshapen here below moreover we are thus tried methinks not only for our own good we are sent into this world to serve to serve god first and after to serve man for gods sake and every blow of the chisel on the stone doth but dress it for its place gods chisel never falleth on the wrong place and never giveth a stroke too much every pang fitteth us for more service and i think thou shouldst find in most instances that the higher and greater the service to which the varlet is called the deeper the previous suffering which fitteth him therefor and gods greatnesses are not ours in his eyes a poor servingmaiden may have a loftier and more difficult task than a lord of the kings council or a marshal of the army and after all every sorrow and perplexity be it large or small doth but give gods child an errand to his father nothing is too little to bear to his ear if it be not too little to distress and perplex his servant to him all things pertaining to this life are smallthe cloth of estate no less than the blade of grass and all things pertaining to that other and better life in his blessed home are great and mighty yet we think the first great and the last little and therefore things become great that belong to the first life just in proportion as they bear upon the second nothing is small that becomes to thee an occasion of sin nothing that can be made an incentive to holiness o mother mother said philippa with a sudden sharp shoot of pain tomorrow i shall be far away from you and none will teach me any more god will teach thee himself my child said isabel tenderly he can teach far better than i only be thou not weary of his lessons nor refuse to learn them maybe thou canst not see the use of many of them till they are learned but thou shalt know hereafter thou shalt find many a thorn in the way but remember it is not set there in anger if thou be christs and many a flower shall spring up under thy feet when thou art not looking for it only do thou never loose thine hold on him who has promised never to loose his on thee not that thou shouldst be lost in so doing he will have a care of that but thou mightest find thyself in the dark and so far as thou couldst see alone it is sin that hides god from man but nothing can hide man from god and philippa drawing closer to her whisperedmother pray for me a very loving smile broke over isabels lips as she pressed them fondly upon philippas cheek mine own philippa she said in the softest accent of her soft voice dost thou think i have waited thirty years for that note i am aware that this resolution will appear inconsistent with isabels character yet any other would have been inconsistent with her times the vows of recluses were held very sacred and the opinions of the bonihomines on the monastic question were little in advance of those of the church of rome note had sir richard been a peer he would have said our hands this style now exclusively royal was in employed by all the nobles note this adjective also was peculiar to the peerage and the royal family it was given to every relation except between husband and wife and the french beaupirt for fatherinlaw is doubtless derived from it nay it was conferred on the deity and fair father jesu christ was by no means an uncommon title used in prayer in like manner saint louis when he prayed said sire dieu the title of knighthood quaint and almost profane as this usage sounds to modern ears i think their instinct was right they addressed god in the highest and most reverential terms they knew chapter ten four years later when the shore is won at last who will count the billows past keble it was winter again and the winds blew harshly and wailingly around the castle of arundel in the stateliest chamber of that castle where the hangings were of cramoisie paned with cloth of gold the evening tapers were burning low and a blackrobed priest knelt beside the bed where an old man lay dying i can think of nothing more father faintly whispered the penitent i have confessed every sin that i have ever sinned so far as my memory serveth and many men have been worse sinners than i i never robbed a church in all my wars i have bequeathed rents and lands to the priory of god and saint pancras at lewes for two monks to celebrate day by day masses of our lady and of the holy ghosttwo hundred pounds and for matins and requiem masses in my chapel here a thousand marks and four hundred marks to purchase rent lands for the poor and all my debts i have had a care to pay can i perform any other good work will that do father thou canst do nought else my son answered the priest thou hast right nobly purchased the favour of god and thine own salvation thy soul shall pass white and pure through the flames of purgatory to be triumphantly acquitted at the bar of god and lifting his hands in blessing he pronounced the unholy incantationabsolvo te thank the saints and our dear lady feebly responded the dying man i am clean and sinless before the morrow dawned on the conversion of saint paul that old man knew as he had never known on earth whether he stood clean and sinless before god or not there were no bands in that death the river did not look dark to him it did not feel cold as his feet touched it but on the other side what angels met him and what entrance was accorded to that sindefiled and uncleansed soul into that land wherein there shall in no wise enter anything that defileth and so richard fitzalan earl of arundel passed away two months laterby a scribes letter written in the name of her halfbrother the young brave joyous man upon whose head the old coronet had descendedthe news of the earls death reached philippa sergeaux at kilquyt very differently it affected her from the manner in which she would have received it four years before and very differently from the manner in which it was received by the daughters of alianora to whom though they did not put it into audible words the real thought of the heart wasis the old man really gone at last well it was time he should now i shall receive the coronet he left to me and the two or three thousand marks for thus he had remembered joan and alesia and thus they remembered him to mary he left nothing a sure sign of offence but how incurred history remains silent but to the eldest daughter whose name was equally unnamed with herswhose ears heard the news so far awaywhose head had never known the fall of his hand in blessingwhose cheek had never been touched by loving lips of histo philippa sergeaux the black serge for which she exchanged her damask robes was real mourning she did not say now i can never forgive my father it is not when we are lying low in the dust before the feet of the great king oppressed with the intolerable burden of our ten thousand talents that we feel disposed to rise and take our fellowservant by the throat with the pitiless pay me that thou owest the offensive stand byi am holier than thou falls only from unholy lips when the woman that was a sinner went out washed and forgiven from that sinless presence with the shards of the broken alabaster box in her hand she was less likely than at any previous time in her life to reproach the fellowsinners whom she met on her journey home so when philippa sergeauxs eyes were opened and she came to see how much god had forgiven her the little that she had to forgive her father seemed less than nothing in comparison she could distinguish now as previously she could notbut as god does alwaysbetween the sin and the sinner she was able to keep her hatred and loathing for the first and to regard the second with the deepest pity and when she thought of the sleep into which she could have little doubt that his soul had been lulledof the black awakening on the brink of the pitthere was no room in her heart for any feeling but that of unutterable anguish they had not sent for her to arundel until she heard that the end was reached she never knew he was near the end at all it is not christianity but pharisaism which would shut up the kingdom of heaven against all but itself to those who have tasted that the lord is gracious it is something more than mere privilege to summon him that is athirst to come necessity is upon themyea woe is unto them if they preach not the gospel though no christian is a priest every christian must be a preacher ay and that whether he will or not he may impose silence upon his lips but his life must be eloquent in spite of himself and what a terrible thought is this when we look on our poor unworthy miserable lives rendered unto the lord for all his benefits toward us when the world sees us vacillating between right and wrongquestioning how near we may go to the edge of the precipice and yet be safecan it realise that we believe that right and wrong to be a matter of life and death or when it hears us murmuring continually over trifling vexations can it believe that we honestly think ourselves those to whom it is promised that all shall work for goodthat all things are oursthat we are heirs of god and jointheirs with christ o lord pardon the iniquities of our holy things verily without thee we can do nothing on the morning that this news reached kilquyt an old man in the garb of the dominican order was slowly mounting the ascent which led from the vale of sempringham the valley was just waking into spring life in the trees above his head the thrushes and chaffinches were singing and just before him diminished to a mere speck in the boundless blue a lark poured forth his flood of delirious music the dominican paused and rested on his staff while he listened sing happy birds he said when at length the larks song was over and the bird had come down to earth again for you there are no vain regrets over yesterday no woeful anticipations of tomorrow but what kind of song can she sing when she hath heard the news i bring her father guy said a voice beside him it was a child of ten years old who stood in his patha copy of elaine four years before ah maid art thou there answered guy run on annora and say to the grey lady that i will be at her cell in less than an hour thy feet are swifter than mine annora ran blithely forward guy of ashridge pursued his weary road for he was manifestly very weary at length he rather suddenly halted and sat down on a bank where primroses grew by the wayside i can go no further without resting said he ten is one thing and threescore and ten is another if i could turn back and go no furtheris the child here again already father guy said annora running up and throwing herself down on the primrose bank i have been to the cell but i have not given your message is the lady not there asked guy a sudden feeling of relief coming over him oh yes she is there replied the child but she was kneeling at prayer and i thought you would not have me disturb her right answered the monk but lest she should leave the cell ere i reach it go back annora and keep watch tell her if she come forth that i must speak with her today once more away fled the lightfooted annora and guy rising resumed his journey if it must be it may as well be now he said to himself with a sigh so plodding and resting by turns he at length arrived at the door of the cell the door was closed and the child sat on the step before it singing softly to herself and playing with a lapful of wild flowers just as her sister had been doing when philippa sergeaux first made her acquaintance is she come forth yet asked guy annora shook her flaxen curls guy went to the little window and glanced within the grey figure was plainly visible kneeling in prayer with the head bent low and resting against a ledge of the rock which formed the walls of the little dwelling the monk sat down on a piece of rock outside the cell and soon so completely lost himself in thought that annora grew weary of her amusement before he spoke again she did not however leave him but when she had thrown away her flowers and had spent some minutes in a vain search for a fourleaved clover fairly tired out she came and stood before him the shadow is nearly straight father guy will she be much longer do you think guy started suddenly when annora spoke there is something amiss he replied in a tone of apprehension i never knew her so long before has she heard my news already he looked in again the grey veiled figure had not changed its position after a moments irresolution guy laid his hand upon the latch the monk and the child entered togetherguy with a face of resolute endurance as though something which would cost him much pain must nevertheless be done annora with one of innocent wonder not unmixed with awe guy took one step forward and stopped suddenly o father guy said annora in a whisper the grey lady is not prayingshe is asleep yes she is asleep replied guy in a constrained voice so he giveth his beloved sleep he knew how terribly the news would pain her and he would let none tell it to her but himself i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth but how strangely she sleeps cried annora still under her breath how white she is and she looks so cold father guy wont you awake her she is not having nice dreams i am afraid the angels must awake her said guy solemnly sweeter dreams than hers could no man have for far above in the holy land she seeth the kings face child this is not sleepit is death ay in the attitude of prayer her head pillowed in its last sleep on that ledge of the rock knelt all that was mortal of isabel la despenser with her had been no priest to absolvesave the high priest no hand had smoothed her pathway to the grave but the lords own hand who had carried her so tenderly through the valley of the shadow of death painlessly the dark river was forded silently the pearlgates were thrown open and now she stood within the veil in the innermost sanctuary of the temple of god the arras of her life wrought with such hard labour and bitter tears was complete now all the strange chequerings of the pattern were made plain the fair proportions no longer hidden the perfected work shone out in its finished beauty and she grudged neither the labour nor the tears now guy of ashridge could see this but to annora it was incomprehensible she had been told by her mother that the grey lady had passed a life of much suffering before she came to sempringham for silent as she was concerning the details of that life isabel had never tried to conceal the fact that it had been one of suffering and the childs childish idea was the old notion of poetical justiceof the good being rewarded and the evil punished openly and unmistakably in this world a state of affairs frequently to be found in novels but only now and then in reality had some splendid litter been borne to the door of the little cell and had noblemen decked in velvet robes shining with jewels and riding on richly caparisoned horses told her that they were come to make the grey lady a queen annora would have been fully satisfied but here the heavenly chariot was invisible and had come noiselessly the white and glistering raiment of the angels had shone with no perceptible lustre had swept by with no audible sound the child wept bitterly what troubleth thee annora said guy of ashridge laying his hand gently upon her head oh sobbed annora god hath given her nothing after all hath he given her nothing responded guy i would thou couldst ask her and see what she would answer but i thought said the child vainly endeavouring to stop crying i thought he had such beautiful things to give to people he loved she used to say so but he gave her nothing beautifulonly this cell and those grey garments i thought he would have clad her in golden baudekyn see note and set gems in her hair and given her a horse to ridelike the lady de chartreux had when she came to the convent last year to visit her daughter sister egidia her fingers were all sparkling with rings and her gown had beautiful strings of pearl down the front with perrywork see note at the wrists why did not god give the grey lady such fair things as these was she not quite as good as the lady de chartreux because he loved her too well said guy softly he had better and fairer things than such poor gauds for her the lady de chartreux must die one day and leave all her pearls and perrywork behind her but to the lady isabel that here lieth dead he gave length of days for ever and ever he gave her to drink of the living water after which she never thirsted any more oh but i wish he would have given her something that i could see sobbed annora again little maid said guy his hand again falling lightly on the little flaxen head god grant that when thy few and evil days of this lower life be over thou mayest both see and share what he hath given her and slowly he turned back to her who lay so silent farewell isabel countess of arundel he said almost tenderly for the corruptible coronet whereof man deprived

readers of this tale may desire to know on what historical foundation it rests and in what points the fiction departs from truth the order of predicant friars was instituted by dominic in with the avowed object of maintaining roman doctrine and supremacy and of opposing and superseding the wandering preachers sent out by the waldensian church into all parts of europe and known chiefly as bonihomines or poor men of lyons but the waldensian church was acute enough to take advantage of this movement and no sooner had the order been founded than an army of gospellers as even thus early they were called issued forth under its shelter it appears probable that at an early period of their preaching a very large percentage of the predicant friars were gospellers it is moreover an historical fact that during the struggle between edward the second and his wretched queen the predicant friars ranged themselves on the side of the king who had always been their friend and whose own confessor luke de wodeford was of their order rot ex pasc ed iii that the despensers also patronised them is rather an inference founded upon fact yet on such facts as very decidedly point to this conclusion it should not be forgotten that all accounts of the reign and character of edward the second which have come down to us were written by monks or by persons educated in the opinions of the monks and the church of rome has never at any period of her history hesitated to accuse of the vilest crimes any who endeavoured to escape from her toils into the pure light of the gospel of christ that hugh le despenser the elder was an unprincipled and avaricious man there can be little question with him if he embraced the principles of the bonihomines at all it was evidently a mere matter of intellectual opinion much less evidence can be found against his son whose chief crime seems to have been that he aroused the hatred of the shewolf of france joan la despenser the ladies of the family are always distinguished as la despenser in contemporary records lived to a good age for she was probably born about and she died in her nunnery of shaftesbury november ipm ric ii richard earl of

brother thomas and under his evil influence entered upon a treasonable conspiracy for which he paid the penalty on tower hill in the spring of john is chiefly remarkable for having married the heiress of maltravers and becoming eventually the root of the familythomas became bishop of ely and archbishop of canterburythe persecuting archbishop arundel who will perhaps be remembered by the readers of mistress margeryand after suffering for his treasonable practices a richlydeserved banishment was at once recalled and restored by his friend and fellowconspirator henry the fourth he died in that the house of arundel had no gospel sympathies is shown by more evidences than one though the archbishop himself had at one time pretended friendship towards the lollards it did not last long he would scarcely have been a true arundel had it done sojoan fitzalan was a woman of intense energy and terrible passions she did not live happily with her husband humphrey earl of hereford as appears from a curious and unique entry on the patent rolls ed iii pt providing that humphrey should not divorce joan on any pretence of precontract the earl however died at the early age of thirtyone and joan whose two daughters were married to princes alianora to thomas duke of gloucester mary to henry the fourth became a very powerful and wealthy widow one anecdote will show what her character was better than volumes of description she presided in person at the execution of john duke of exeter brother of her sister alesias husband he being loyal to his halfbrother king richard while joan was a vehement partisan of her soninlaw henry the fourth when no one came forward in answer to her appeal as the dukes executioner joan exclaimed cursed be you villains are none of you bold enough to kill a man a squire volunteered to officiate but when he had seen and heard the man whom he was to slay he shrank from the terrible task madam was his remonstrance to the countess for all the gold in the world i cannot kill such a lord thou shalt do what thou hast promised said joan or i will cut thy head off and probably knowing that she was likely to do what she had promised the squire preferred the fall of the dukes head to his own lystoire de la traison et mort du roy richart pp this strongminded woman died april and was buried at walden having previously been admitted a sister of the grey friars in her brothers cathedral of canterbury ipm hv arundel ms fol ib fol b of alesia countess of kent little personal is known she left no mark on her time though the members of her numerous family were very prominent characters she died march ipm hv by all genealogists who have hitherto written on the arundel family two more daughters are ascribed to earl richard the coppedhat these are philippa sergeaux the heroine of the tale and mary lestrange at the time when this story was written i was misled to follow this supposition though i had already seen that in that case isabel and not alianora must have been the mother of philippa some months after the story was first published i began to suspect that this was also the case with regard to mary lestrange but i was not prepared for the discovery made only last may that philippa sergeaux was not the daughter of earl richard at all in two charters recorded on a close roll for ric ii she distinctly styles herself daughter of sir edmund of arundel knight this was a younger brother of earl richard and his wife was sybil montacute a daughter of the lollard house of salisbury it is probable though no certainty has yet been found that mary lestrange was also a daughter of sir edmund since dates conclusively show that she cannot have been the daughter of alianora of lancaster she died august leaving an only child ankaretta talbot ipm r ii as early therefore as i have the opportunity of doing it i make the amende honorable to my readers for having unwittingly misled them on this point it is scarcely a discredit not to have known a fact which was known to none the tale must therefore be regarded as pure fiction so far as philippa is concerned for isabel la despenser apparently had no child the facts remain the same as regards other persons where their history is not affected by the discovery philippa sergeaux is represented in the opening of the story as a child of three years old it is more than probable that she was about ten years younger the date of her marriage is not on record she was eventually the mother of five children though all were born subsequent to the period at which my story closes they wererichard born december and died issueless june elizabeth born wife of sir william marny philippa born wife of robert passele alice born at kilquyt september wife of guy de saint albino joan born died february philippa became a widow september and died september ipm ric ii ric ii h iv some of the christian names may strike the reader as having a very modern sound i may therefore note that not one name occurs in the story which is not authenticated by its appearance in the state papers of the time it only remains to be added that the fictitious characters of the tale are giles de edingdon and guy of ashridge the nurse alina agnes the lavender the nuns laura and senicula and the woodcutters children elaine and annora the details given of earl richards will are true but the presence of the earl and sir richard sergeaux in the train of john of gaunt in guienne has been assumed for the purposes of the story
