the maidens lodge none of self and all of thee in the reign of queen anne by emily sarah holt the story opens in and is a story of the habits customs loves and hates of a gentle family of those days we pay particular attention to two young women rhoda and phoebe of course your reviewer never did live in those days but the style of life of these minor grandees seems to ring true as one would expect of this skilled author as with her other historical novels the reader seems to feel pulled into the contemporary scene of those days and that class their foolish airs and graces their ambition in most cases to marry at or above their station amid a welter of other minor grandees appears one mr welles who is said to be well placed with an income of three thousand pounds a year to be compared with one of the players in the story a curate with pounds a year with which to bring up his large brood but he turns out to be greedy and makes a bid for one of the two young women who he imagines is to inherit a large and valuable estate but he has made a mistake and much of the latter part of the book deals with the way in which he tries to recover his position and is of course rebuffed nh the maidens lodge none of self and all of thee in the reign of queen anne by emily sarah holt chapter one phoebe arrives at whiteladies the sailing of a cloud hath providence to its pilot martin farquhar tupper in the handsome parlour of cressingham abbey commonly called whiteladies on a dull afternoon in january sat madam and her granddaughter rhoda sipping tea madamand nothing else her dependants would have thought it an impertinence to call her mrs furnival never was empress of all the russias more despotic in her wide domain than madam in her narrow one as to mr furnivalfor there had been such a person though it was a good while sincehe was a mere appendage to madams greatnessuseful in the way of collecting rents and seeing to repairs and capable of being put away when done with he was a little meek unobtrusive man fully and happily convinced of his own insignificance and ready to sink himself in his superb wife as he might receive orders he had been required to change his name as a condition of alliance with the heiress of cressingham and had done so with as much readiness as he would in similar circumstances have changed his coat it was about fourteen years since this humble individual had ceased to be the head servant of madam and it was madams wont to hint when she condescended to refer to him at all that her marriage with him had been the one occasion in her life wherein she had failed to act with her usual infallibility it had been a supreme disappointment to madam that both her children were of the inferior sex mrs catherine to some extent resembled her father having no thoughts nor opinions of her own but being capable of moulding like wax and like wax her mother moulded her she married under madams orders at the age of twenty the heir of the neighbouring estatea young gentleman of blood and fortune with few brains and fewer principlesand died two years thereafter leaving behind her a baby daughter only a week old whom her careless father was glad enough to resign to madam in order to get her out of his way the younger of madams daughters despite her sisters passive obedience had been the mothers favourite her obedience was by no means passive she inherited all her mothers selfwill and more than her mothers impulsiveness much the handsomer of the two she was dressed up flattered indulged and petted in every way nothing was too good for anne until one winter day shortly after catherines marriage when the family assembled round the breakfast table and anne was found missing a note was brought to madam that evening by one of mr peverils undergardeners in which anne gaily confessed that she had taken her destiny into her own hands and had that morning been married to the reverend charles latrobe family chaplain to her brotherinlaw mr peveril she hoped that her mother would not be annoyed and would receive her and her bridegroom with the usual cordiality exhibited at weddings madams face was a study for a painter had anne furnival searched through her whole acquaintance and selected that one man who would be least acceptable at cressingham she could not have succeeded better a chaplain the son of a french huguenot refugee concerned in trade every item in madams eyes was a lower deep beyond the previous one it was considered in those days that the natural wife for a family chaplain was the ladys maid that so mean a creature should presume to lift his eyes to the sister of his patroness was monstrous beyond endurance and a frenchmanwhen madam looked upon all foreigners as nuisances whose removal served for practice to the british fleet and boasted that she could not speak a word of french with as much complacency as would have answered for laying claim to a perfect knowledge of all the european tongues and a tradesmans son a tradesman and a gentleman in her eyes were terms as incompatible as a blue rose or a vermilion cat for a man to soil his fingers with sale barter or manufacture was destructive of all pretension not only to birth but to manners on the head of her innocent spouse madams fury had been outpoured in no measured terms receive the hussy she vehemently declared she would not she should never set foot in that house again from this moment she had but one daughter two years afterwards on the evening of catherines funeral and of the transference of baby rhoda to the care of her grandmother a young woman shabbily dressed carrying an infant and looking tired and careworn made her way to the back door of the abbey she asked for an interview with madam i cannot disturb madam said the greyhaired servant not unkindly her daughter was buried this morning you must come again my good woman must i so baxter replied the applicant tell her she has one daughter left surely if ever she will see me it were tonight eh mrs anne exclaimed the man who remembered her as a baby in arms your pardon madam that i knew you not sooner well i cannot tell but come what will it shall never be said that i turned my young mistress from her mothers door if i lose my place by it ill take in your name to madam the answer he received was short and stern my daughter was buried this morning i will not see the woman baxter softened it a little in repeating it to mrs latrobe but he could not soften the hard fact that her mother refused to see her she was turning away when suddenly she lifted her head and held out her child to him take it to her tis a boy mrs latrobe knew madam if a grandchild of the nobler sex produced no effect upon her no more could be hoped baxter carried the child in but he shook his grey head when he brought it back he did not repeat the message this time ill have nought to do with that beggar tradesfellows brats said madam in a fury mrs anne theres one bit of comfort said old baxter in a whisper master slipped out as soon as i told of you and i saw him cross the field towards the church go you that way and meet him she did not speak another word but she clasped the child tight to her bosom and hurried away as she passed a narrow outlet at the end of the abbey church close to the road mr furnival shambled out and met her eh nancy poor soul god bless thee faltered the poor father who was nearly as much to be pitied as his child shell not see thee my girl and shell blow me up for coming but thats nothingit comes every day for something look here child and mr furnival emptied all his pockets and poured gold and silver into annes thin hand i can do no more poor child poor child but if thou art in trouble my girl send to me at any time and ill pawn my coat for thee if i can do no better father said mrs latrobe in an unsteady voice i am sorry i was ever an undutiful child to you the emphasis was terribly significant so they parted with much admiration of the grandson and mr furnival trotted back to his penance for madam kept him very short of money and required from him an account of every shilling the storm which he anticipated broke even a little more severely than he expected but he bore it quietly and went to bed when it was over since that night nothing whatever had been heard of mrs latrobe until four months before the story opens when mr furnival was on his deathbed he braved his wifes anger by naming the disowned daughter his last words were perpetua seek out anne madam sat listening to him with lips firmly set and without words it was not till he was past speech that she gave him any answer jack she said at last to the pleading eyes which were more eloquent than the hushed voice had been look you here i will not seek the girl out she has made her bed and let her lie on it but i will do this for youand i should never have done that without your asking and praying me now if she comes or sends to me i will not refuse her some help i shall please myself what sort but i wont turn her quite away for your sake the pleading eyes turned to grateful ones an hour later and madam was a widow fourteen years passed during which rhoda grew up into a maiden of nineteen years always in the custody of her grandmother her father had fallen in one of the duke of marlboroughs battles and before his death had been compelled to sell peveril manor to liquidate his gambling debts he left nothing for rhoda beyond his exquisite wardrobe and jewellery a service of gold plate and a number of unpaid bills which madam flatly refused to take upon herself and defied the unhappy tradesmen to impose upon rhoda she did however keep the plate and jewels and by way of a sop to cerberus allowed the beggarly craftsmen whom she so heartily despised to sell and divide the proceeds of the wardrobe when the fourteen years were at an end on an afternoon in september a letter was brought to the abbey for madam its bearer was a respectable looking middleaged woman madam ordered her to have some refreshment while she read the letter rhoda noticed that her hand shook as she held it and wondered what it could be about letters were unusual and important documents in those days but it was the signature that had startled madamanne latrobe mrs latrobe wrote in a strain of suffering penitence and entreaty she was in sore trouble her husband was dead of her five children only one was living she herself was capable of taking a situation as ladys maida higher position then than nowand she knew of one lady who was willing to engage her if she could provide otherwise for phoebe phoebe was the second of her children and was now seventeen she expressed her sorrow for the undutiful behaviour of which she had been guilty towards both parents and she besought in all ignorance the father who had been dead for fourteen years to plead with madam to help her in any way she pleased to put phoebe into some respectable place where she could earn her own living mrs latrobe described her as a quiet meek good girlfar better than ever i wasand said that she would be satisfied with any arrangement which would effect the end proposed for some minutes madam sat gazing out of the window yet seeing nothing with the letter lying open before her her promise to her dead husband bound her to answer favourably what should she do with phoebe after some time of absolute silence she startled rhoda with the question child how old are you nineteen madam answered rhoda in much surprise two years responded madamwhich words were an enigma to her granddaughter but as rhoda was of a romantic temperament and the central luminary of her sphere was rhoda peveril visions began to dance before her of some eligible suitor whom madam was going to put off for two years she was more perplexed than ever with the next question would you like a companion child very much madam anything which was a change was welcome to rhoda i think i will said madam ring the bell i have already stated that madam was impulsive when her old butler came ina man who looked the embodiment of awful respectabilityshe said send that woman here the woman appeared accordingly and stood courtesying just within the door your name my good woman asked madam condescendingly ant please you molly bell madam whence come you molly ant please you from bristol madam how came you ant please you on foot madam but i got a lift in a carriers cart for a matter of ten miles do you know the gentlewoman that writ the letter you brought oh ay mistress latrobe the lord be thanked madam that ever i did know her and her good master the reverend thats gone to the good place you are sure of that demanded madam but the covert satire was lost on molly bell sure exclaimed she adding very innocently you can never have known mr latrobe madam to ask that not of late years leastwise i never did said madam rather grimly and do you know mrs phoebe dear heart madam said molly laughing softly but how queer it do sound for sure to hear you say mrs phoebe shes always been miss phoebe with us all these years and we hadnt begun like to think she was growing up oh dear yes madam i knew them allmaster charles and miss phoebe and master jack and miss perry and miss kitty miss perry said madam in an interrogative tone miss perpetua madamwe always called her miss perry for short a dear little blessed child she was rhoda saw the kind which held the letter tremble again and they are all dead but miss phoebe its a mercy miss phoebe wasnt taken too said molly shaking her head they died of the fever in one fortnights timemiss perry went the first and then master jack and then master charles and the reverend himself and miss kitty last of all miss phoebe was down like all of em and the doctor did say he couldnt ha pulled her through but for her dear good mother she never had her gown off madam night nor day just agoing from one sick bed to another and they all died in her arms i wonder she didnt lie down and die herself at last i do think it was miss phoebe beginning to get better as kept her in life poor anne if anything could have startled rhoda it was those two words she recognised her aunts name and knew now of whom they were speaking had molly been retained as counsel for mrs latrobe she could hardly have spoken more judiciously than she did she went on now and o madam when all was done and the five coffins carried out she says to me mrs latrobe says molly she says id ought to be very thankful i havent been a good child she says to my father and mother but theyll never pay me back my bitter ways she says and im right sure madam as miss phoebe never will for shes that sweet and good she is so you see madam mrs latrobe shes had her troubles and if so be shes sent to you for comfort madam i take the liberty to hope as youll give her a bit you can go back to the kitchen molly said madam in what was for her a very gracious tone i will order you a nights lodging here and tomorrow one of my carters who is going to gloucester shall take you so far on your way i will give you a letter to carry thank you kindly madam and with half a dozen courtesies one for rhoda and the rest for madam molly retreated well pleased madam sat down and wrote her letter this was madams letter written in an amiable frame of mind daughteri have yowr

whear els you will bee a foole to say noe p furnival lett the girle come when you goe to your place there is a carrer goes from bristoll to teukesburry and a mann with an horse shal mete her at the bell be not horrified accomplished modern reader at madams orthography she spelt fairly wellfor a lady in an interval of about two months followed and then came another letter from mrs latrobe she wrote in a most grateful strain she was evidently even more surprised than pleased with the offer for phoebe there was a reference of penitent love to her father a promise that phoebe should be at cressingham on or as near as possible to the twentyninth of january and warm thanks for her mothers undeserved kindness more especially for the consideration which had prompted the promise that phoebe should be met at tewkesbury instead of being left to find her way alone in the dark through the two miles which lay between that town and cressingham so on the afternoon of that twentyninth of january an hour after the man and horses had started madam and rhoda sat in the abbey parlour sipping their tea and both meditating on the subject of phoebe madam as became a widow was attired in black a stiff black bombazine petticoat was surmounted by a black silk gown adorned with flowers in raised embroidery and the train of the gown was pulled through the pockethole of the petticoat at that time ladies of all ages wore their dresses low and square at the neck edged with a tucker of nett or lace the sleeves ended at the elbows with a little white ruffle of similar material to the tucker in london the low headdress was coming into fashion but country ladies still wore the high commode a superb erection of lace and muslin from one to three feet in height long black silk mittens were drawn up to meet the sleeves the shoes reached nearly to the ankles and were finished with large silver buckles rhoda was much smarter she wore a cotton gownfor when all cotton gowns were imported from india they were rare and costly articlesof an involved shawllike pattern in which the prevailing colour was red underneath was a petticoat of dark blue quilted silk her commode was brightened by blue ribbons she wore no mittens and her shoebuckles rivalled those of her grandmother rhodas figure was good but her face was commonplace she was neither pretty nor ugly neither intellectual nor stupidlooking of course she wore powder as also did madam but if her hair had been released from its influence it would have been perceived that there was about it a slight very slight tinge of red the coming of her cousin was an event of the deepest interest to rhoda for she had been ever since her birth absolutely without any society of her own age never having had an opportunity of measuring herself by other girls rhoda imagined herself a most learned and accomplished young person it would be such a triumph to see phoebe find it out and such a pleasure to receivewith a becoming deprecation which meant nothingthe admiration of one so far her inferior rhoda had dipped into a score or two of her grandfathers books had picked up sundry fine words and technical phrases with a smattering of knowledge or what would pass for it and she sat radiant in the contemplation of the delightful future which was to exalt herself and overawe phoebe so lost was she in her own imaginations that she neither heard madam ring her little handbell nor was conscious that the horses had trotted past the window until sukey one of madams maids came in answer to the bell and courtesying said an it please you madam mrs phoebe latrobe rhoda lifted her eyes eagerly and saw her cousin the first item which she noticed was that phoebes figure was by no means so good as her own her shoulders being so high as almost to reach deformity the next point was that the expression of phoebes face was remarkably sweet the third was that phoebes dress was particularly shabby it was a brown stuff worn threadbare too short for the fashion and without any of the flounces and furbelows then common over it was tied a plain white linen apronaprons were then worn both in and out of doorsand phoebes walking costume consisted of a worn black mantua or pelisse and a hood brown like the dress which was the shabbiest of all the manner of the wearer however while extremely modest and void of selfassertion was not at all awkward nor disconcerted she courtesied first to her grandmother then to her cousin and stood waiting within the door till she was called forward come hither child said madam phoebe walked forward to her and dropped another courtesy madam put two fingers under phoebes chin and lifting up the young face studied it intently what she saw there seemed to please her youll do child she said letting phoebe go be a good maid and obedient and you shall find me your friend sit down and loose your hood rhode pour her a dish of tea and this was madams welcome to her granddaughter phoebe obeyed her instructions with no words but thank you madam her voice was gentle and low if the tears burned under her eyelids no one knew it but herself take phoebe upstairs rhoda to your chamber said madam when the newcomer had finished her tea i see child your new clothes had better not be long acoming i have a better gown than this madam in my trunk she answered well i am glad of it said madam shortly rhoda led her cousin up the wide stone staircase and into a pretty room low but comfortable fitted with a large bed a washstand a wardrobe and a dressingtable the two girls were to occupy it together and here rhodas tongue always restrained in her grandmothers presence felt itself at liberty and behaved accordingly a new cousin to catechise was a happiness that did not occur every day have you no black gown was the first thing which rhoda demanded of phoebe oh yes said phoebe i wear black for my father and all of them heedless of what she might have noticedthe tremor of phoebes voice rhoda went on with her catechism how long has your father been dead eight months did you like him like him phoebe seemed to have no words to answer i never knew anything about mine went on rhoda he lived till i was thirteen and i never saw him only think phoebe gave a little shake of her head as if her thoughts were too much for her and my mother died when i was a week old and i never had any brother or sister pursued rhoda then you never had any one to love poor cousin said phoebe looking at rhoda with deep compassion love oh i dont know that i want it said rhoda lightly how is aunt anne and where is she mother phoebes voice shook again she is going to live with a gentlewoman at the bath she stayed till i was gone well you know was the next remark of rhoda whose ideas were not at all neatly put in order youll have to wear a black gown tomorrow it is king charles yes i know said phoebe was your father a dissenter queried rhoda no said phoebe looking rather surprised because i can tell you madam hates dissenters said rhoda she would as soon have a crocodile to dinner why didnt you come in your black gown it is my best answered phoebe i cannot afford to spoil it what do you think of madam phoebe shrank from this question i can hardly think anything yet oh dear i wish tomorrow were over said rhoda with an artificial shiver i do hate the thirtieth of january i wish it never came we have to go to church and there is only tea and bread and butter for dinner and we must not divert ourselves with anything ill show you the ruins and read you some of my poetry did you not know i writ poetry no replied phoebe but will that not be diverting ourselves oh but we cant always be miserable said rhoda besides what good does it do it is none to king charles and im sure it never does me good oh and we will go and see the maidens lodge and make acquaintance with the old gentlewomen the maidens lodge what is that why about ten years ago madam built six little houses and called it the maidens lodge a sort of bettermost kind of almshouses you know for six old gentlewomenat least i dare say they are not all old but some of them are mrs vane does not think she is at any rate you cant see them from this window they are on the other side of the church and are they all filled all but one just now i protest i dont know why madam built them i guess she thought it was good works i should have thought it would have been better works to have sent for aunt anne as well as you but dont you tell her i said so dont be afraid said phoebe smiling i trust i am not a pickthank but dont you think when you would not have a thing said again it were better not to say it at the first note a meddlesome mischiefmaker oh stuff i cant always be such a prig as that phoebe was unpacking a trunk of very modest dimensions and rhoda perched on a corner of the bed sat and watched her is that your best gown yes said phoebe lifting it carefully out how many have you this and that only two how poor aunt anne must be we have always been poor have you always lived in bristol no we used to live at the bath when i was a child father was curate at the abbey church how much did he get twentyfive pounds a year that wasnt much for seven of you it was not returned phoebe significantly what can you do asked rhoda suddenly can you write poetry i never tried so i cannot tell said phoebe can you sing yes and play on anything no i cannot do much i can sew pretty well and knit in four different ways i dont cook muchi mean i dont know how to make many things but i always try to be nice in all i can do i can read and write and keep accounts can you dance a jigand embroider and work tapestry no i dont know anything of that cant work tapestry why phoebe you see there never was any time said phoebe apologetically of course i helped mother with the cooking and sewing and then there were the children to see to and i learned perry and kitty to read and sew then there were all the salves and physic for the poor folk we could not afford much in that way but we did what we could well i wouldnt marry a parson thats flat said rhoda fancy spending all your days amaking salves and boluses fiddlefaddle phoebe gave a little laugh i was not always making salves she said had you any pets we have a parrot i believe shes near as old as madam i want a monkey but madam wont hear of it we never had but one said phoebe the quiver coming again into her voice andit died what was it a little dog i dont much care for dogs said rhoda mrs vane is the one for pets that is whenever they are modish she carries dormice in her pocket and keeps a lapdog and a squirrel when the mode goes out she gives the thing away and gets something newer oh dear said phoebe i could never give my friends away oh it is not always to friends said rhoda misunderstanding her she gave one of her cats to a tailor at tewkesbury but the creatures are your friends said phoebe how can you bear to give them away cats and dogs and squirrelsfriends answered rhoda laughing why phoebe what a droll creature you are they would be my friends responded phoebe i vow id like to see you make a friend of mrs vanes cupid exclaimed rhoda laughing he is the most spiteful little brute i ever set eyes on he thinks his teeth were made to bite everybody and his tail wasnt made to wag poor little thing i dont wonder if he has a mistress who would give him away because it was not the mode to keep him i never saw a maid so droll said rhoda still laughing twill never serve to be so mighty nice that i can tell you why you talk as if those creatures had feelings like we have and so they have said phoebe warming up a little you are mightily mistaken returned rhoda why do they bark and bite and wag their tails then said phoebe unanswerably it means something why what does it signify if they have demanded rhoda not very consistently i say phoebe is that your best hood how shabby you go yes answered phoebe quietly how much pinmoney do you mean to stand for was rhodas next startling question how much what said astonished phoebe dropping the gloves she was taking out of her trunk how much pinmoney will you make your husband give you ive not got one was phoebes very innocent response well youll have one some day of course said rhoda i mean to have five hundred at least pounds gasped phoebe of course laughed rhoda i tell you i mean to be a modish gentlewoman as good as ever mrs vane and ill have a knight at least oh youll see one of these days i can manage madam when i determine on it phoebe theres the supper bell come on and quite regardless of the treasonable language in which she had just been indulging rhoda danced down into the parlour becoming suddenly sober as she crossed the threshold phoebe followed and unless her face much belied her thoughts she was a good deal puzzled by her new cousin chapter two making acquaintances ah be not sad although thy lot be cast far from the flock and in a distant waste no shepherds tents within thy view appear yet the chief shepherd is for ever near cowper the abbey church of whiteladies to which allusion has already been made was not in any condition for divine service being only a beautiful ruin when madam went to church therefore she drove two miles to tewkesbury at nine oclock punctually the great lumbering coach was drawn to the door by the two heavy flanders mares with long black tails which almost touched the ground madam in a superb costume of black satin trimmed with dark fur and white lace took her seat in the place of honour rhoda in a satin gown and hood with a silk petticoat all black as became the day sat on the small seat at one side of the door but rhoda sat with her face to the horses while the yet lower place opposite was reserved for phoebe in her unpretending mourning the great coach rumbled off out of the grand gates always opened when madam was present past the ruins of the abbey church and drew up before a row of six little houses fronted by six little gardens they were built on a very minute scale exactly alike each containing four small roomskitchen parlour and two bedrooms over with a little leanto scullery at the back on the midmost copingstone appeared a lofty inscription to the effect that the maidens lodge was built to the praise and glory of god by the pious care of mistress perpetua furnival widow for the lodging of six decayed gentlewomen spinsters of good birth and qualityad it occurred to phoebe as she sat reading the inscription that it might have been pleasanter to the decayed gentlewomen in question not to have their indigence quite so openly proclaimed to the world even though coupled with good birth and quality and redounding to the fame of mistress perpetua furnival but phoebe had not much time to meditate for the door of the first little house opened and down the gravel walk towards the carriage came the neatest and nicest of little old ladies attired like everybody that day in black and carrying a silverheaded cane on which she leaned as if it really were needed to support her she was one of those rare persons a pretty old woman her complexion was still as fair and delicate as a painting on china her blue eyes clear and expressive of course in days when everyone wore powder hair was of one colourwhite this is mrs dolly jennings whispered rhoda to phoebe she is the eldest of the maidens and she is about seventy i believe she is some manner of cousin to the dukenot very near you know the duke in of course meant the duke of marlborough good morning madam said mrs jennings in a cheerful yet gentle voice when she reached the carriage good morning mrs dorothy i am glad i see you well enough to accompany me to church you are very good madam was the reply as mrs dorothy clambered up into the lumbering vehicle i thank god my rheumatic pains are as few and easy today as an old woman of threescore and ten need look for you are a great age mrs dorothy observed madam yes madam i thank god returned mrs dorothy as cheerfully as before while phoebe was meditating on this last answer the second maiden appeared from number two she was an entire contrast to the first being tall sharp featured florid highnosed and generally angular mrs jane talbot whispered rhoda mrs jane having offered her civilities to madam climbed also into the coach and placed herself beside mrs dorothy marcella begs you will allow her excuses madam for she is indisposed this morning said mrs jane in a quick sharp voice which made phoebe doubt if all her angularity were outside while madam was expressing her regret at this news the doors of numbers five and six opened simultaneously and two ladies emerged who were in their way as much a contrast as mrs jane and mrs dorothy number six reached the carriage first she was a pleasant comfortable looking woman of about fifty years of age with a round face and healthy complexion and a manner which while kindly was dignified and selfpossessed good morning my lady betty said the three voices phoebe then perceived that the seat of honour beside madam had been reserved for lady betty but number five followed and she was so singular a figure that phoebes attention was at once diverted to her she looked about the age of lady betty but having evidently been a beauty in her younger days she was greatly indisposed to resign that character though it was a sharp january morning her neck was unprotected by the warm tippet which all the other ladies wore there was nothing to keep her warm in that quarter except a necklace large earrings depended from her ears half a dozen rings were worn outside her gloves a long chatelaine hung from her neck to her waist to which were attached a bunch of trinkets of all shapes and sizes she was laced very tight and her poor nose was conscious of it as it showed by blushing at the enormity under her left arm was a very small very fat very bluntnosed dutch pug phoebe at once guessed that the lady was mrs vane and that the pug was cupid well clarissa said mrs jane as the newcomer took her seat at the door opposite rhoda pity you hadnt a nosering mrs vane made no answer beyond an affected smile but cupid growled at mrs jane whom he did not seem to hold in high esteem the coach with a good effort on the part of the horses got under way and rumbled off towards tewkesbury and how does sir richard my lady betty inquired madam with much cordiality oh extremely well i thank you answered lady betty so well indeed now that he talks of a journey to london and a month at the bath on his way thence what takes him to london asked mrs jane tis for the maids he thinks to go he would have betty and gatty have a seasons polishing and for mollypoor little soulhe is wishful to have her touched is she as ill for the evil as ever poor child oh indeed yes tis a thousand pities and such sprightly parts as she discovers note so clever as she is tis a mercy for such as she that the queen doth touch said mrs jane king william never did is that no mistake gently suggested lady betty never dared came rather grimly from madam well maybe said mrs jane but i protest i cannot see why queen mary should not have done it as well as her sister i own i cannot but very much doubt returned madam severely that any good consequence should follow by which it will be perceived that madam was an uncompromising jacobite mrs jane had no particular convictions but she liked to talk whig because all around were tories lady betty was a hanoverian torythat is what would be termed an extreme tory in the present day but attached to the protestant succession mrs clarissa was whatever she found it the fashion to be as to mrs dorothy she held private opinions but she never allowed them to appear well knowing that they would be far from acceptable to madam and since mrs dorothy was sometimes constrained unwillingly to differ from madam on points which she deemed essential she was careful not to vex her on subjects which she considered indifferent rhoda was rather disappointed to find that phoebe showed no astonished admiration of tewkesbury abbey she forgot that the abbey church at bath and saint mary redcliffe at bristol had been familiar to phoebe from her infancy the porch was lined with beggars who showered blessings upon madam in grateful anticipation of shillings to come but madam passed grandly on and paid no attention to them the church and the service were about equally chilly being a fastday the organ was silent but all the responding was left to the choir the congregation seemingly supposing it as little their concern as cupid thought it hiswho curled himself up comfortably and went to sleep the gentlemen appeared to be amusing themselves by staring at the ladies the ladies either returned the compliment slily behind their fans or exchanged courtesies with each other there was a long long bidding prayer and a sermon which might have been fitly prefaced by the announcement let us talk to the praise and glory of charles the first it was over at last the gentlemen put down their eyeglasses the ladies yawned and furled their fans there was a great deal of bowing and courtesying and complimentingmr william informing mrs betty that the sun had come out solely to do her honour and mrs betty retorting with a delicate blow from her fan and what a mad fellow are you at last these also were over and the ladies from cressingham remounted the family coach nearly in the same order as they camethe variation being that phoebe found herself seated opposite mrs clarissa vane might i pat him said phoebe diffidently if you want to be bit do snapped mrs jane oh deah yes languishingly responded mrs clarissa he neveh bites does e the pwetty deah heyday doesnt e the pwetty deah observed mrs jane in such exact imitation of her friends affected tones as sorely to try phoebes gravity lady betty laughed openly but added mind what you are about child poor doggie softly said phoebe cupids response was the slightest oscillation of the extreme point of his tail but when phoebe attempted to stroke him to the surprise of all parties instead of snapping at her as he was expected to do cupid only wagged rather more decidedly and when phoebe proceeded to rub his head and ears he actually gave her not a bite of resentment but a lick of friendliness deah the sweet little deah es vewy good said his mistress the gentle reader is requested not to suppose that the elision of mrs clarissas poor letter h as well as r proceeded either from ignorance or vulgarityexcept so far as vulgarity lies in blindly following fashion mrs clarissas only mistake was that like most country ladies she was rather behind the age the dropping of h and other letters had been fashionable in the metropolis some eight years before clarissa what a goose are you said mrs jane come jenny dont you bite put in lady betty cupid has set you a better example than so ill not bite clarissa i thank you was mrs janes rather spiteful answer it would want more than one fastday to bring me to that couldnt fancy the paint and dont think i could digest the patches lady betty appeared to enjoy mrs janes very uncivil speeches while cupids mistress remained untouched by them being one of those persons who affect not to hear anything to which they do not choose to respond well rhoda child said lady betty as the coach neared home tis no good i guess to bid you drink tea on a fastday oh but i am coming my lady betty answered rhoda briskly i mean to drink a dish with every one of you i shant give you anything to eat interpolated mrs jane never do to be guzzling on a fastday you wont get any sugar from me neither never mind mrs jane said rhoda mrs dolly will give me something i know and i shall visit her first mrs dorothy assented by a benevolent smile i hope child you will not forget it is a fastday said madam gravely and not go about to divert yourself in an improper manner oh no madam said rhoda drawing in her horns no sooner was dinner overand as rhoda had predicted there was nothing except boiled potatoes and bread and butterthan rhoda pounced on phoebe and somewhat authoritatively bade her come upstairs madam had composed herself in her easy chair with the eikon basilike in her hand will madam not be lonely asked phoebe timidly as she followed rhoda lonely oh no shell be asleep in a minute said rhoda i thought she was going to read suggested phoebe she fancies so said rhoda laughing i never knew her try yet but she went to sleep directly unlocking a closet door which stood in their bedroom and climbing on a chair to reach the top shelf rhoda produced a small volume bound in red sheepskin which she introduced to phoebes notice with a rather grandiloquent air now phoebe theres my book of poems phoebe opened the book and her eye fell on a few lines of faint delicate writing on the flyleaf to rhoda peveril with her aunt margarets love oh you have an aunt said phoebe i have two somewhere said rhoda they are good for nothing they never give me anything phoebe looked up with a rather surprised air they seem to do sometimes she observed pointing to the book well that one did answered rhoda one or two little things like that but she is dead the others are just a pair of spiteful old cats phoebes look of astonishment deepened they must be very different from my aunt then i have only one but i would not call her names for the world she loves me and i love her why what are aunts good for but to be called names was the amiable response but now listen phoebe i am going to read you a piece of my poetry you see our old church is dedicated to saint ursula and there is an image in the church which they say is saint ursulait has such a charming face madam doesnt think tis charming but i do so you see this poem is to that image phoebe looked rather puzzled but did not answer now i would have you criticise phoebe said rhoda condescendingly using a word she had picked up from one of her grandfathers books i dont know what that is said phoebe well it means if you hear anything you dont like say so very well replied phoebe quietly and rhoda began to read with the style of a rhetoricianas she supposed step softly nearer as ye tread to this shrine of the royal dead this abbeys hallowed unto one daughter of britains ancient throne history names her one sole thing the daughter of a british king rhoda paused and looked at her cousinostensibly for criticism really for admiration if phoebe had said exactly what she thought it would have been that her ear was cruelly outraged but phoebe was not accustomed to the sharp speeches which passed for wit with rhoda she fell back on a matter of fact does history say nothing more about her of course it does it says the vandals martyred her phoebe you cant criticise poetry as if it were prose it struck phoebe that rhodas poetry was very like prose but she said meekly please go on i ask your pardon so rhoda went on her glorious line has passed away the wild dream of a bygone day we know not from what throne she sprang britain is silent in her song whats the matter asked rhoda interrupting herself i ask your pardon said phoebe again butwill song do with sprang and if ursula was a real person as i thought she had been she wasnt a wild dream was she phoebe i do believe you havent a bit of taste said rhoda ill try you with one more verse and then o wake her not ages have passed since her fair eyelids closed at last i should think then you would find it difficult to wake her remarked phoebe but rhoda went on as if she had not heard it for twice six hundred years tis said hath rested neath yon tomb her head that head which soft reposed of old on couch of satin and of gold dear was phoebes comment i didnt know they had satin sofas twelve hundred years ago tis no earthly use reading poetry to you exclaimed rhoda throwing down the book you havent one bit of feeling for it no more than if it were a sermon i was reading tie your hood on and make haste and well go and see the maidens phoebe seemed rather troubled to have annoyed her cousin though she evidently did not perceive how it had been effected the girls tied on their hoods and rhoda who was not really illnatured soon recovered herself when she got into the fresh air now while we are going across the park she said i will tell you something about the old gentlewomen i couldnt this morning you know more than their names because there was madam listening but now hark mrs dolly jenningsthe one who came in first you know and sat over against lady bettyi dont know what kin she is but there is some kin between her and the duchess of marlborough she is the oldest of the maidens and the best one to tell a storyexcept she falls to preaching and then tis tiresome do you like sermons phoebe it all depends who preaches them said phoebe well of course it does said rhoda i dont like anyone but dr harrishe has such white hands he does not preach about them does he said phoebe apparently puzzled as to the connection oh he nourishes them about and discovers so many elegancies answered rhoda but how does that make him preach better why phoebe how stupid you are but you must not interrupt me in that way or i shall never be done mrs dolly you see is seventy or more and in her youth she was in the great world so she has all manner of stories and shell always tell them when you ask her i only wish she did not preach well then mrs jane talbotthat one with the high nose that sat next mrs dolly in the coachshe has lively parts enough and that turn makes her very agreeable i dont care for her sister mrs marcella that lives next hershes always having some distemper and i dont like sick people mrs clarissa vane is the least wellborn of all of them but shes been a toast you see and she fancies herself charming poor old thing as for lady bettywerent you surprised i believe madam pays her a good lot to live there it gives the place an air you know she is sir richard delawarrs aunt and he is the great man all about hereall the land that way belongs to him as far as you can see he is of very good familyan old norman house they are thought a great deal of you know but isnt that strange said phoebe meditatively if sir richard is thought more of because his forefathers came from france six hundred years ago why is my grandfather thought less of because he came from france thirty years ago o phoebe it is not the same thing at all but why is it not the same thing gently persisted phoebe oh nonsense said rhoda cutting the knot peremptorily phoebe can you speak french yes have a care you dont let madam hear you who taught youyour father yes he said it was our own language why you dont mean to say he was proud of being a frenchman cried rhoda in amazement i think he was if he was proud of anything answered phoebe he loved france very dearly he thought it the grandest country in the world and phoebes voice trembled a little evidently her father was in her eyes a hero and all that he had loved was sacred but phoebe not greater than england he couldnt cried rhoda to whom such an idea seemed an impossibility he was fond of england too said phoebe he said she had sheltered us when our own country cast us off and we should love her and be very thankful to her but he loved france the best rhoda tried to accept this incredible proposition well tis queer she said at last proud of being a frenchman what would madam say tis only like sir richard delawarr is it phoebe youve no sense well perhaps i havent said phoebe meekly as they turned in at the gate of number one mrs dolly jennings was ready for her guests in her little parlour with the most delicate and transparent china set out upon the little teatable and the smallest and brightest of copper kettles singing on the hob well you thought i meant it mrs dolly exclaimed rhoda laughingly as the girls entered i always think people mean what they say child until i find they dont said mrs dorothy welcome miss phoebe my dear oh would you please to call me phoebe said the owner of that name blushing so i will my dear replied mrs dorothy who was busy now pouring out the tea mrs rhoda take a chair child and help yourself to bread and butter rhoda obeyed and did not pass the plate to phoebe mrs dolly she said interspersing her words with occasional bites i am really concerned about phoebe she hasnt the least bit of sense indeed child quietly responded mrs dorothy while phoebe coloured painfully how doth she show it why she doesnt care a straw for poetry is it poetry you engaged her with what do you mean said rhoda rather pettishly it was my poetry eh dear said mrs dorothy but there was a little indication of fun about her mouth perhaps my dear you write lyrics and your cousin hath more fancy for epical poetry she doesnt care for any sort im sure said rhoda what say you to this heavy charge phoebe inquired little mrs dorothy with a cheery smile i like some poetry replied phoebe bashfully what kind blurted out rhoda apparently rather affronted phoebe coloured and hesitated i like the old hymns the huguenots used to sing she said such us dear father taught me hymns arent poetry said rhoda contemptuously that is true enough of some hymns child answered mrs dorothy but phoebe my dear will you let us hear one of your hymns they are in french whispered phoebe they will do for me in french my dear replied mrs dorothy rhoda stared in manifest astonishment phoebe struggled for a moment with her natural shyness and then she began mon sort nest pas a plaindre il est a desirer je nai plus rien a craindre car dieu est mon berger my lot asks no complaining but joy and confidence i have no fear remaining for god is my defence but the familiar words evidently brought with them a rush of associations which was too much for phoebe she burst in tears and covered her face with her hands what on earth are you crying for asked rhoda thank you my dear said mrs dorothy the verse is enough for a day and the truth which is in it is enough for a life i ask your pardon sobbed phoebe when she could speak at all but i used to sing itto dear father and when he was gone i said it to poor mother and they are all gone now oh dont bother said rhoda my papas dead and my mamma too but youll not see me crying over it rhoda pronounced the words pappa and mamma as is done in america to this day you never knew your parents mrs rhoda said the little old lady ever ready to cast oil on the troubled waters phoebe dear child wouldst thou wish them all back again no oh no i could not be so unkind said phoebe wiping her eyes but only a year ago there were seven of us it seems so hard i say phoebe if you mean to cry and take on said rhoda springing up and drinking off her tea youll give me the spleen i hate to be hipped i shall be off to mrs jane come along go yourself mrs rhoda my dear and leave your cousin to recover if tears be your aversion why arent they all our aversions said rhoda outraging grammar you dont need to pretend mrs dolly i never saw you cry in my life ah child said mrs dorothy as if she meant to indicate that there had been more of her life than could be seen from rhodas standingpoint but youll do well to take an old womans counsel my dear run off to mrs jane and divert yourself half an hour and when you return your cousin will have passed her trouble and i will have a story to tell you both i know you like stories come ill go for a story when i came back said rhoda but i meant to take phoebe cant she wipe her eyes and come then i shall not tell you a story responded mrs dorothy rhoda laughed and ran off mrs dorothy let phoebe have her cry out for a short time she moved softly about putting things in order and then came and sat down by phoebe on the settle the world is too great for thee poor child she said tenderly taking phoebes hands in hers it is a long way from thy fathers grave but bethink thee tis no long way from himself if he is gone to him that is our father i know he is whispered phoebe and is the lord thy shepherd dear child i know he is said phoebe again mon sort nest pas a plaindre softly repeated mrs dorothy oh it is wrong of me sobbed phoebe but it does seem so hard nobody cares for me any more nay my child he careth for thee oh i know it is so was the answer but i cant feel it it all looks so dark and cold i cant feel it poor little child lost in the dark said mrs dorothy gently dear the lord must know how very much easier it would be to see but his especial blessing is spoken on them that have not seen and yet have believed tis an honour to thy father little phoebe to put thine hand in his and let him lead thee where he will thine earthly father would have liked thee to trust him canst thou not trust the heavenly father phoebes tears were falling more softly now phoebe little maiden shall i love thee thank you mrs dorothy but people dont love me said phoebe as if it were a fact sad indeed but incontrovertible only dear father and perry and thy mother suggested mrs dorothy in a soothing tone wellyesi suppose so doubtfully admitted phoebe but you see poor motheri had better not talk about it mrs dorothy if you please mrs dorothy let the point pass making a note of it in her own mind she noticed too that phoebe said dear father and poor mother yet it was the father who was dead and the mother was living the terms thought mrs dorothy must have some reference to character little phoebe she said if it should comfort thee betimes to pour out thine heart to some human creature come across the park and tell thy troubles to me thou art but a young traveller and such mostly long for some company yet bethink thee my dear i can but be sorry for thee while the lord can help thee he is the best to trust child yes i know whispered phoebe you are so good mrs dorothy now for the story said rhoda dancing into the little parlour youve had oceans of time to dry your eyes i have been to mrs jane and mrs clarissa and my lady betty and ive had a dish of tea with each one i shall turn into a teaplant presently now im ready mrs dorothy go on what fashion of tale should you like mrs rhoda oh you had better begin at the beginning said rhoda i dont think i ever heard you tell about when you were a child you always begin with the revolution go back a little earlier and let us have your whole history mrs dorothy paused thoughtfully it wont do me any harm added rhoda and i cant see why you should care youre nearly seventy arent you phoebes shy glance at her cousin might have been interpreted to mean that she did not think her very civil but mrs dorothy did not resent the question yes my dear i am over seventy she said quietly and i dont know that it would do you any harm you have to face the world too one of these days please god you may have a more guarded entrance into it than i had here is a cushion for your back mrs rhoda and phoebe my dear here is one for you let me reach my knitting and then you shall hear my story but it will be a long one so much the better if tis agreeable answered rhoda i dont care for stories that are over in a minute this will not be over in a day said mrs dorothy all right responded rhoda settling herself as comfortably as she could i say phoebe change cushions with me im sure youve got the softer and phoebe obeyed in an instant chapter three little mrs dorothy and the thousands come and go all along the crowded street but they give no ear to the things we know and they pass with careless feet for some hearts are hard with gold and some are crushed in the throng and some with the pleasures of life are cold how long o lord how long if i am to begin at the beginning my dears said little mrs dorothy i must tell you that i was born in a farmhouse about a mile from saint albans on the last day of the year of our lord that my father was the reverend william jennings brother to sir edward and that my mother was mrs frances daughter to sir jeremy charlton whatever made your father take up with a parsons life said rhoda i wouldnt be one for an apron full of money surely he was married first wasnt he he was married first answered mrs dorothy and both his father and my mothers kindred took it extreme ill that he should propose such views to himselfthe rather because he was of an easy fortune his grandmother having left him some money would i have been a parson exclaimed rhoda im too fond of jellies and conservesnobody better well my dear mrs rhoda if you will have me say what i think resumed mrs dorothy you can if you like interjected rhoda it does seem to me and hath ever done so that the common custom amongst us which will have the chaplain to rise and withdraw when dessert is served must be a relique of barbarous times dessert at that time included pies puddings and jellies o mrs dorothy you have the drollest notions and rhoda went off in a long peal of laughter the idea of any other arrangement struck her as very comical indeed well my dear said mrs dorothy i hope some day to see it otherwise oh how droll it would be said rhoda but go on please mrs dolly through those troublous times that followed on my birth resumed the old lady i was left for better safety with the farmer at whose house i was born for my father had shortly after been made parson of a church in london and twas not thought well that so young a child as i then was should be bred up in all the city tumults my fosterfathers name was lawrence ingham and he and his good wife were as father and mother to me but what fashion of breeding could you get at a farmhouse demanded rhoda with a scornful pout why twas not there i learned french child answered mrs dorothy smiling but i learned to read write and cast accounts to cook and distil to conserve and pickle with all manner of handiworkssewing knitting broidery and such like and i can tell you my dear that in all the great world whereunto i afterwards entered i never saw better manners than in that farmhouse i saw more ceremonies sure but not more courtesy and kindly thought for others why i thought folks like that had no manners at all said rhoda then you were mightily mistaken my dear farmer ingham had two daughters who were like sisters to me but they were both older than i their names were grace and faith twas a very quiet peaceful household we rose with the sun in summer and before it in winter catch me interpolated rhoda and before any other thing might be done there was reading and prayer in the farmhouse kitchen all the farm servants trooped in and took their places in order the men on the right hand of the master and the women on the left of the mistress then the farmer read a chapter and afterwards prayed all joining in our father at the end buthe wasnt a parson demanded rhoda with a perplexed look oh no my dear then how could he pray said rhoda hed no business to read the prayerbook and of course he couldnt pray without it ah then he made a mistake replied mrs dorothy very quietly he fancied he could but who ever heard of such a thing said rhoda we heard a good deal of it in those days my dear why child the common prayer was forbid even in the churches nobody used it save a few here and there that chose to run the risk of being found out and punished how queer cried rhoda well go on mrs dolly i hope the prayers werent long i should have wanted my breakfast they were usually about three parts of an hour ugh with a manufactured shudder came from rhoda after prayers for an hour each went to her calling commonly we took it turn about the girls and ione with the mistress in the kitchen one with the maids in the chambers and the third if the weather was fine aweeding the posies in the garden or if wet at her sewing in the parlour then the great bell was rung for breakfast and we all gathered again in the kitchen for breakfast were furmety eggs and butter and milk for the women cold bakemeats and ale for the men no tea asked rhoda i was near ten years old child ere coffee came into england and tea was some years later the first coffeehouse that ever was in this realm was set up at oxford of one jacobs a jew and about two years after was the first in london for tea twas said queen catherine brought it hither from portingale but in truth i believe twas known among us somewhat sooner but when it came in for a long time none knew how to use it except at the coffeehouses i could tell you a droll tale of a neighbour of farmer inghams that had a parcel of tea sent her as a great present from london with a letter that said twas all the mode with the quality and what did she think you but boiled it like cabbage and bade all her neighbours come taste the new greens did they like them asked rhoda as well as she could speak for laughing i heard they all thought with their hostess who said if those were quality greens the quality were welcome to keep em country folk would rather have cabbage and spinach any day well said rhoda bridling a little when her amusement had subsided tis very silly for mean people to ape the quality it is so my dear replied mrs dorothy with that extreme quietness which was the nearest her gentle spirit could come to irony tis silly for any to ape another be he less or more why there can be no communication between them observed rhoda with a toss of her head communication my dear said mrs dolly yonders a new word where did you pick it up o mrs dolly you cant be in the mode if you dont pick up all the new words answered rhoda more affectedly than ever she was showing off now and was entirely in her element and pray what are the other new words my dear inquired mrs dorothy goodnaturedly and not without a little amusement that one sounds very much like the oldfashioned commerce well i dont know them all said rhoda with an assumption of humility but nowodays when you speak of any ones direction you must say adresse from the french and if one is out of spirits you say he is hippedthats from hypochondriacal and a crowd of people is a mobthats short for mobile and when a man goes about and doesnt want to be known you say he is incogthat means incognito which is the spanish for unknown then you say mr suchanone spends to the tune of five hundred a year and there are a lot of men of his kidney and i bantered them well about it oh there are lots of new words mrs dolly so it seems my dear but are you sure incognito is spanish oh yes william knight told me so said rhoda with another toss of her head i imagined it was latin observed mrs dorothy but tis true i know nought of either tongue oh william knight knows everything said rhoda hyperbolically he must be a very ingenious young man quietly observed mrs dorothy well he is said rhoda scarcely perceiving the satire latent in mrs dorothys calm tones i am glad to hear it my dear returned the old lady but hes very uppishthats pos resumed the young one really my dear you are full of new words said mrs dorothy goodnaturedly what means pos pray you why positive said rhoda laughing and rep means reputation and fire means spirit and smart means sharp and a concert means a lot of people singing and playing on instruments of music and an operation means anything you do and a speculation meanswell it meansit means a speculation you know dear dear cried little mrs dorothy holding up her hands i protest my dear i shall be drove to learn the english tongue anew if this mode go on well mrs dolly suppose your tale should go on suggested rhoda heyday do you know what everybody is sayingeverybody that is anybody you understand i thought that everybody was somebody remarked mrs dorothy with a comical set of the lips oh dear no said rhoda there are ever so many people who are nobody indeed said mrs dorothy well child what is everybody saying why they say the duke is not so well with the queen as he has been tis thought i assure you by many above people is that one of the new words inquired mrs dorothy with a little laugh dear child what mean youthe angels oh mrs dorothy you are the oddest creature cried rhoda why you know very well what i mean should you be sorry mrs dolly if the duke became inconsiderable no my dear why should i well i thought but rhodas thought went no further you thought quietly continued the old lady that i had not had enow of town vanities and would fain climb a few rungs up the ladder holding on to folks skirts was that it child well i dont know said rhoda uneasily for mrs dorothy had translated her thought into rather too plain language ah my dear that is because you would love to climb a little yourself said mrs dorothy smilingly and you apprehend no inconveniency from it but child tis the weariest work in all the worldexcept it be climbing from earth to heaven to climb on mens ladders is mostly as a squirrel climbs in its cageround and round you think yourself going vastly higher but those that stand on the firm ground and watch you see that you do but go round but to climb up jacobs ladder whereof the lord stands at the top it will be other eyes that behold you climbing up when in your own eyes you have not bettered yourself by a step climb as high as you will there dear maidsbut never mind the ladders that go round they are infinitely disappointing i know it for i have climbed them well mrs dolly do go on now and tell us all about it theres a good soul said rhoda little mrs dorothy was executing some elaborate knitting she went on with it for a few seconds in silence i was but sixteen she said quietly when my mother came to visit me i could not remember seeing her before and very frighted was i of the grand gentlewoman for so she seemed to me that rustled into the farmhouse kitchen in silken brocade and a velvet tippet on her neck she was evenly disappointed with me she thought me stiff and gloomy and i thought her strange and full of vanities in three years time dolly quoth she thou wilt be nineteen and i will then have thee up to town and thou shalt see somewhat of the world thou art not illfavoured quoth shetwas my mother that said this my dears modestly interpolated mrs dorothyand i dare say thou wilt be the town talk in a week tis pity there is no better world to have thee intoand thy father as sour and puritanical as any till of late save the markbut there we must swim with the tide saith she tis a long lane that has no turning ah me but the lane had turned ere i was nineteen why mrs dolly the restoration must have been that very year observed rhoda that very year repeated mrs dorothy twas in april i quitted farmer inghams house and was fetched up to london and in may came the king in and was shortly thereafter crowned if it please you asked phoebe speaking for the first time of her own accord were you glad to go madam well my dear i was partly glad and partly sorry i was sorrowful to take leave of mine old friends little knowing if i should ever see them again or no yet like an untried maid i was mightily set up with the thought of seeing london and the lions and whitehall and the like silly maid that i was i had better have shed tears for the last than for the first what thought you the finest thing in london said rhoda but tell us what thought you of london altogether why the first thing i thought of was the size and the noise answered mrs dorothy it seemed to me such a great overgrown town so different from saint albans and so many carts and wheelbarrows always rattling over the stones and so many folks in the streets and all the strange cries of a morning i thought my father a very strange cold man of whom i was no little afraid and my mother was sadly disappointed that i did not roll my eyes and had not been taught to dance why did they ever leave you at a farmhouse inquired rhoda rather scornfully i cannot entirely say my dear but i think that was mainly my fathers doing my poor father and mrs dorothys handkerchief was hastily passed across her eyes the first night i came she said my mother had a large assembly in her withdrawingchamber there were smartdressed ladies fluttering of their fans and gentlemen in all the colours of the rainbow and i foolish maid right well pleased when one and another commended my country complexion or told me something about my fine eyes when all at once came a heavy hand on my shoulder and my father saith dorothy i would speak with you i followed him forth not a little trembling lest he should be about to chide me but he led me into his own closet and shut the door he bade me sit and leaning over the fire himself he said nought for a moment then saith he dorothy you heard mr debenham speak to you yes sir quoth i and what said he child goes on my father gently i was something loth to repeat what he had said for it was what i in my foolish heart thought a very fine speech about mrs dolls fine eyes that glistered like stars howbeit my father waited quiet enough and having been well bred to obey by farmer ingham i brought it out at last did you believe it dorothy saith my father did you think he meant it i did but whisper yes sir for i could not but feel very much ashamed then dorothy saith he the first lesson you will do well to learn in london is that men and women do not always mean it when they flatter you and he does not ah saith my father fetching a great sightis easy work for fathers to say such things but not so for maidens to believe them there is one other thing i would have you learn dorothy yes sir quoth i when he stayed he turned him around and looked in my face with his dark eyes that seemed to burn into me and he saith learn this dorothythat tis the easiest thing in all the world for a man to drift away from god ay or a woman either you may do it and never know that you have done itfor a while at least david was two full years ere he found it out oh dorothy take warning i was once as innocent as you are i have drifted from god oh my child how far the lord keep you from a like fate i was fairly affrighted for his face was terrible an hour after i saw him dealing the cards at ombre with a look as bright and mirthful as though he knew not grief but by name phoebe looked up with eyes full of meaning did he never come back dear child said mrs dorothy turning to her hast thou forgot that the good shepherd goeth after that which was lost until he find it he came back my dear but it was through the great plague and the great fire it was evident for a few minutes that mrs dorothy was wrestling with painful memories well and what then said rhoda who wanted the story to go on and was afraid of what she called preaching well resumed the old lady more lightly then for three days in the week i had a dancingmaster come to teach me and twice in the week a musicmaster and all manner of new gowns and my hair dressed in a multitude of curls and my mothers maid to teach me french and see that i carried myself well and when this had gone on a while my mother began to carry me avisiting when she went to see her friends for above a year she used a hackney coach but then my father was made doctor and had a great church given him that was then all the mode and my lady jennings came up to town and finding he had parts she began to take note of him and would carry him in her coach to the court and my mother would then set up her own coach the which she did and at length the summer before i was oneandtwenty my lady jennings without the privity of my father offered my mother to have me a maid to one of the ladies in waiting on the queen from this place said she if i played my cards well and was liked of them above me i might come in time to be a maid of honour o rare exclaimed rhoda and did you mrs dolly yes child slowly answered mrs dorothy i did so rhodas face was sparkling with interest and pleasure phoebes was shadowed with forebodings of a sad end to come the night ere i left home for the court pursued the old lady my mother held long converse with me thou art mightily improved dolly saith she since thy coming to london but there is yet a stiff soberness about thee that thou wilt do well to be rid of thou shouldst have more ease child do but look at thy cousin jenny that is three years younger than thou and yet how will she rattle to every man that hath a word of compliment to pay her but after she had made an end my father called me into his closet poor dorothy he said the bloom is not all off the peach yet but tis going childtis fast going i feared this poor dorothy oh dear said rhoda you were not going to a funeral mrs dolly ah child maybe if i had it had been the better for me the wise man saith it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting but pray what harm came to you mrs dorothy no outward bodily harm at all my dear yet even that was no thanks to me it was of the lords compassion seeing he had a purpose of mercy toward me but ah me what inward and spiritual harm mrs rhoda my dear i saw sights and heard sayings those two years i dwelt in the court which i would give the world so to speak only to forget them now what were they mrs dorothy asked rhoda eagerly sitting up think you i am likely to tell you child no indeed but what sort of harm did they to you mrs dolly child i learned to think lightly of sin people did not talk of sin there at all the words they used were crime and vice every wrong doing was looked on as it affected other men if it touched your neighbours purse or person it was ill if it only grieved his heart then twas a little matter but how it touched god was never so much as thought on there might have been no god in heaven so little account was taken of him there now do tell us mrs dolly what the queen was like and the king said rhoda yawning and how many maids of honour were there just tell us all about it there were six replied the old lady taking up her knitting which she had dropped in her earnestness a minute before and mrs sanderson was their mother i reckon you will scarce know that always a married gentlewoman goeth about with these young damsels called the mother of the maids whose work it is to see after them and keep them from everything jolly exclaimed rhoda now thats a shame wouldnt it be fun to bamboozle that creature i protest i should enjoy it o mrs rhoda mrs rhoda i should of all things mrs dolly but now what were the king and queen like was she very beautiful note charles the second and catherine of braganza no said mrs dorothy she was not she had pretty feet fine eyes and very lovely hair twas rich brown on the top of her head and descending downward it grew into jet black for the rest she was but tolerable in truth her teeth wronged her by sticking too far out of her mouth but for that she would have been lovelier by much horrid said rhoda i forget where she came from mrs dolly she came from portingale my dear being daughter to the king of that country and her name was catherine and what was the king like when he was little my dear his mother queen mary used to say he was so ugly a baby that she was quite ashamed of him he was betterfavoured when he grew a man he had good eyes but a large mouth note queen mary was henrietta maria always termed queen mary during her own reign he was a black man was he not by which term rhoda meant what we now call a dark man yes very black and swarthy where did he commonly live mostly at whitehall or saint jamess at times he went to hampton court and often for a change of sir to newmarket now and then to tunbridge wells he was but little at windsor did you like him mrs dorothy phoebe looked up when no answer came the expression of mrs dorothys face was a curious mixture of fear repulsion and yet amusement no she said at length why not demanded rhoda well there were some that did was the reply in a rather constrained tone and the one that he behaved the worst to loved him the best of all how droll said rhoda and who were your friends then mrs dorothy that depends my dear on what you mean by friends if you mean them that flattered me and joked with me and the likewhy i had very many or if you mean them that would take some trouble to push me in the worldwell there were several of those but if you mean such as are only true friends that would have cast one thought to my real welfare whether i should go to heaven or helli had but one of that sort and who was your one friend mrs dolly asked rhoda pursing up her lips a little the kings scots cook my dear quietly replied mrs dorothy the what shrieked rhoda going into convulsions of laughter ah you may laugh mrs rhoda you know theres an old saying let them laugh that win if ever an old sinner like me enters the gates of heaven so far as the human means are concerned i shall owe it first of all to old david armstrong will you please to tell us about him madam rather timidly asked phoebe with all my heart my dear dear old davie methinks i see him now picture to yourselves my dears a short man something stooping in the shoulders with sharp features and irongrey hair always dressed in his white cooking garb and a white cap over his frizzled locks but before i tell you what i knew of old davie methinks i had better tell you a tale of him that will give you some diversion without i mistake oh do mrs dolly cried rhoda who feared nothing so much as too great seriousness in her friends stones well said mrs dorothy then you must know my dears that once upon a time the king and queen were at dinner and with them amongst others my lord rochester who was at that time a very wild gallant he died indeed very penitent and i trust a saved man but let that be they were sat after dinner and my lord rochester passes the bottle about to his next neighbour come man saith the king in his rollicksome way take a glass of that which cheereth god and man as scripture saith my lord rochester at once bets the king forty pound that there was no such saying in scripture the king referreth all to the queens chaplain that happened to be the only parson then present but saith again that though he could not name the place yet he was as certain to have read it in scripture as that his name was charles what thinks your majesty quoth my lord rochester turning to the queen she very modestly but mrs dolly was not the queen a papist what would she know about the bible so she was my dear but they have a bible of their own that they allow the reading of to certain persons and i dare say she was one however my lord rochester asked her for i heard him and she said very womanly that she was unfit to decide such matters but she could not think there to be any such passage in the bible why there isnt rashly interpolated rhoda mrs dorothy smiled but did not contradict her then up spoke the queens chaplain and gave his voice like his mistress that there was no such passage and several others of them at the table said they thought the like so the king swearing his wonted oath cried out for some to bring a bible that he might search and see o mrs dolly what was his favourite oath i do not see my dear that it would do you any good to know it well the bible as matters went was not to be had king queen chaplain and courtiers there was not a man nor woman at the table that owned to possessing a bible how shocking said phoebe under her breath very shocking my dear assented mrs dorothy but all at once my lord rochester cries out please your majesty ill lay you forty shillings theres one man in this palace that has a bible he cut me short for swearing in the yard a month since thats old david your majestys scots cook if youll send for him done says the king killigrew root out old davie and tell him to come here and bring his bible with him so away went mr killigrew the kings favourite page and ere long back he comes and old davie with him and under davies arm a great brown book here he is sire bible and all says mr killigrew come forward davie and be hanged says the king ill come forward sire at your majestys bidding says davie and gin ye order it and i hae deservit it i can be hangit saith he mighty dry but under your majestys pleasure ill just tak the liberty to ask sire what are ye wantin wi the buik oh how queer you talk mrs dolly as david talked my dear he was a scot you know well the king gave a hearty laugh and says he oh come forward davie and fear nothing well not hang you and we want no hurt to your darling book atweel sire says davie and id hae been gey sorry gin ye had meant to hurt my buik seein it was my mithers and i set store by it for her sake but trust me sire id hae been a hantle sorrier gin ye had meant onie disrespect to the lords buik ill no stand by wi a honour to your majesty an see i lichtlied what does that mean mrs dolly set light by my dear well the king laughed again but i think davies words a little sobered him for he spoke kindly enough that no harm should be done nor was any disrespect intended but saith he my lord rochester and i fell adisputing if certain words were in the bible or no and as you are the only man here like to have one i sent for you davie looks quiet enough round all the table and he says under his breath the only man here like to have a bible ay your majesty i ken weel eneuch that i hae my habitation among the tents o kedar atweel sire an ill be pleasit to answer onie sic question gin ye please to tell me the words my lord rochester saith wine which cheereth god and man are such words as those in the bible david neither yea nor nay said old davie but he turned over the leaves of his bible for a moment and then clearing his voice and first doffing his cooks cap which he had but lifted a minute for the king he read from the book of judges jothams parable of the trees twas a little while ere any spoke then said the queens chaplain swearing a great oath that he could not but be infinitely surprised to find there to be such words in the bible o mrs dolly a parson to swear there are different sorts of parsons my dear but old david thought it shocking for he turns round to the chaplain and saith he your pardon mr howard but gin yed give me leave id be pleasit to swear the neist oath for ye it would sound rather better ye ken for a cook than a chaplain hurrah says the king swearing himself the sprightliest humour i heard of a long time pray you silence and hear old davie swear i see nothing to swear anent the now an it please your majesty says davie mighty dry again when i do your majestyll be sure to hear it the king laughed heartily for he took davie right enough though i saw some look puzzled of course he never would see reason to do a sinful thing but a new thought had come into the kings head and he turns quick to mr howard and desires that he would give exposition of the words that davie had read you ought to know what they mean if we dont poor sinners saith the king i protest sire saith the chaplain that i cannot so much as guess what they mean now then david the divine cries my lord rochester your exposition if you please and some of the courtiers that by this time were not too sober drummed on the table with glasses and shouted for davids sermon i think mrs dolly that was scarce proper in the kings and queens presence so i think my dear but king charless court was liberty hall and every man did that which was right in his own eyes but davie stood very quiet with the bible yet open in his hands he waited his masters bidding if they did not oh ay go on davie saith the king leaning back in his chair and laughing silence for mr david armstrongs sermon cries my lord rochester in a voice of a master of ceremonies but davie took no note of any voice but the kings though twas to my lord rochester he addressed him when he spoke that wine cheereth man your lordship very well knows quoth davie in his dry way and seeing his lordship had drank a bottle and a half since he sat down i should think he did my dears but this that wine cheereth god is referable to the drinkoffering commanded by god of the jews wherein the wine doth seem to typify the precious blood of christ and the thankfulness of him that hath his iniquity thereby purged away for in the fifteenth chapter of the book of numbers you shall find this drinkoffering termed a sweet savour unto the lord and since nothing but christ is a sweet savour unto god therefore we judge that the wine of the drinkoffering like to that of the sacrament did denote the blood of christ whereby we are redeemed the one prefiguring that whereto it looked forward as the other doth likewise figure that whereunto it looketh back this therefore that wine cheereth god is to be understood by an emblem of the blood of christ our mediator for through this means god is well pleased in the way of salvation that he hath appointed whereby his justice is satisfied his law fulfilled his mercy reigneth his grace doth triumph all his perfections do agree together the sinner is saved and god in christ glorified now sire i have done your bidding and i humbly ask your majestys leave to withdraw the king said naught but cast him a nod of consent my dears you never saw such a change as had come over that table every man seemed sobered and awed the queen was weeping the king silent and thoughtful my lord rochester whom at that time nothing could sober long was the only one to speak and rising with makebelieve gravity as though in his place in the house of lords he offered a motion that the king should please to send mr howard into the kitchen to make kail and raise the reverend mr david armstrong to the place of chaplain what is kail mrs dolly asked rhoda laughing tis scots broth my dear whereof king charles was very fond and old david had been fetched from scotland on purpose to make it for him what a droll old man exclaimed rhoda ah he was one of the best men ever i knew said mrs dorothy but my dear look at the clock i declare cried rhoda phoebe we have but just time to run home ere supper if so much as that good evening mrs dolly and thank you what will madam say note david armstrong is a historical person and this anecdote is true the surname given to him only is fictitious as history does not record any name but david chapter four through thorny paths i do repent me now too late of each impatient thought that would not let me tarry out gods leisure as i ought caroline bowles is it long since madam woke baxter cried rhoda in a breathless whisper as she came in at the side door but this minute mrs rhoda answered he thats good said rhoda aside to phoebe and slipping off her shoes she ran lightly and silently upstairs beckoning her cousin to follow phoebe having no idea of the course of rhodas thoughts obeyed and followed her example in doffing her hood and smoothing her hair be quick said rhoda her own rapid movements over and putting on her shoes again they found madam looking barely awake and staring hard at her book as if wishful to persuade herself that she had been reading i hope child you were not out all this time said she to rhoda oh no madam glibly answered that trustworthy young lady we only had a dish of tea with mrs dolly and i made my compliments to the other gentlewomen and where were you since child we have been upstairs madam said rhoda unblushingly not diverting yourselves i hope was madams next question oh no not at all madam we were not doing anything particular talking i suppose as maids will responded madam phoebe tomorrow after breakfast bring all your clothes to my chamber i must have you new apparelled oh madam give me leave to come also exclaimed rhoda with as much eagerness as she ever dared to show in her grandmothers presence i would so dearly like to hear what phoebe is to have only please not a muskcoloured damaskyou promised me that my dear answered madam you forget yourself i cannot talk of such things today you may come if you like supper was finished in silence after supper a palefaced tiredlooking young man who had been previously invisible came into the parlour and made a low reverence to madam which she returned with a queenly bend of her head his black cassock and scarf showed him to be in holy orders madam rang the handbell the servants filed in and evening prayers were read by the young chaplain in a thin monotonous voice with a manner which indicated that he was not interested himself and did not expect interest in any one else then the servants filed out again the chaplain kissed madams hand and wished her goodnight bowed distantly to rhoda half bowed to phoebe instantly drew himself up as if he thought he was making a mistake and finally disappeared tis time you were abed maids said madam rhoda somewhat slowly rose knelt before her grandmother and kissed her hand goodnight my dear god bless thee and make thee a good maid was madams response phoebe had risen and stood rather hesitatingly behind her cousin she was doubtful whether madam would be pleased or displeased if she followed rhodas example in her new life it seemed probable that she would not be short of opportunities for the exercise of meekness forbearance and humility madams quick eyes detected phoebes difficulty in an instant goodnight phoebe she said rising goodnight madam replied phoebe in a low voice as she followed rhoda it was evident that no relationship was to be recognised here you carry the candle said rhoda nodding towards the hall table on which the candlesticks stood thats what you are here for i supposeto save me trouble dear i forgot my cloaksee where it is bring it with you phoebe demurely enough rhoda preceded phoebe upstairs but no sooner was the bedroom door closed behind them than rhoda threw herself into the large invalid chair and laughed with hearty amusement oh didnt i take her in wasnt it neatly done now didnt you admire me phoebe you told her a lie retorted phoebe indignantly shthats not a pretty word said rhoda pursing her lips say a fib next timenonsense not a bit of it phoebe we had been upstairs since we came in only a minute answered phoebe you made her think what was not true father called that a liei dont know what you call it now phoebe said rhoda severely dont you be a little puritan if you set up for a saint at whiteladies i can just tell you youll pull your own nest about your ears you are mightily mistaken if you think madam has any turn for saints she reckons them designing persons every soul of em youll just get into a scrape if you dont have a care phoebe made no reply she was standing by the window looking up into the darkened sky there were no blinds at whiteladies it was well for rhodaor was it wellthat she could not just then see into phoebes heart the cry that shivered to the tingling stars was unheard by her o father father said the cry why did you die and leave your poor little phoebe whom nobody loves whose love nobody wants with whom nobody here has one feeling in common and then all at once came as it were a vision before her eyes of a scene whereof she had heard very frequently from her fathera midnight meeting of the desert church in a hollow of the cevennes mountains guarded by sentinels posted on the summita meeting which to attend was to brave the gallows or the galleysand phoebe fancied she could hear the words of the opening hymn as the familiar tune floated past her mon sort nest pas a plaindre il est a desirer je nai plus rien a craindre car dieu est mon berger it was a quiet peaceful face which was turned back to rhoda did you hear rather sharply demanded that young lady yes i heard what you said calmly replied phoebe but i have been a good way since a good waywhere rejoined her cousin to france and back said phoebe with a smile what are you talking about stared rhoda i said nothing about france i was telling you not to be a prig and a saint and make madam angry i wont vex her if i can help it answered phoebe well but you will if you set up to be better than your neighbours thats pos take the pins out of my commode why should not i be better than my neighbours asked phoebe as she pulled out the pins because theyll all hate youthats why i must have clean ruffles they are in that top drawer arent you better than your neighbours innocently suggested phoebe coming back with the clean ruffles rhoda paused to consider how she should deal with the subject the question was not an easy one to answer she believed herself very much better in every respect to say no therefore would belie her wishes and convictions yet to say yes would spoil the effect of her lecture there was moreover a dim impression on her mind that phoebe was incapable of perceiving the delicate distinction between them which made it inevitable that rhoda should be better than phoebe and highly indecorous that phoebe should attempt to be better than rhoda on the whole it seemed desirable to turn the conversation oh not these ruffles phoebe these are some of my best bring a pair of common onesthose with the box plaitswhat were you thinking about france oh nothing particular i was only never mind if you dont want to tell said rhoda graciously now that her object was attained i wonder what new clothes madam will give you a camlet for best i dare say and duffel for every day dont you want to know no not very much i should if i were you i like to go fine not that shell give you fine things you knownot likely there put my shoes out to clean and tuck me up nicely and then if you like you can go to bed i shant want anything more phoebe did as she was requested and then knelt down i vow exclaimed her cousin when she rose do you say your prayers on sunday nights i never do why weve only just been at it downstairs and what a time you are im never more than five minutes with mine i couldnt say all i want in five minutes replied phoebe want why what do you want said rhoda i want nothing ive got to do itthats all well i dare say five minutes is enough for that was the quiet reply from phoebe but when people get into trouble then they do want things trouble oh you dont know said rhoda loftily ive had heaps of trouble have you innocently demanded phoebe in an interested tone well i should think so more than ever you had what were they said phoebe in the same manner why first my mother died when i was only a week old explained rhoda i suppose you call that a trouble not when you were a week old said phoebe it would be afterwards with some people but i should not think it was much with you you have had madam well then my father went off to london and spent all his estate that i should have had and there was nothing left for me that was a trouble i suppose if you had plenty beside i should not think it was plenty beside phoebe you are the silliest creature why dont you see that i should have been a great fortune if i had had peveril as well as whiteladies i should have set my cap at a lord i can tell you only think phoebe i should have had sixty thousand pounds what do you say to that sixty thousand pounds i should think it is more than you could ever spend oh i dont know about that said rhoda when whiteladies is mine i shall have a ridinghorse and a glass coach and i will have a splendid set of diamonds and pearls too they cost something i can tell you oh tis easy spending money youll see when it comes to me are you sure it will come to you why of course it will exclaimed rhoda sitting up and leaning on her elbow to whom else would madam leave it i should like to know why you never expect her to give it to you poor little whitefaced thing i vow but that is a good jest rhodas laugh had more bitterness than mirth in it phoebes smile was one of more unmixed amusement pray make yourself easy said phoebe i never expect anything and then i am not disappointed well ill just tell you what rejoined her cousin if i catch you making up to madam trying to please all her whims and chime in with her vapours and thatfancying shell leave you whiteladiesi tell you phoebe latrobe ill never forgive you as long as i live there rhoda was very nearly if not quite in a passion phoebe turned and looked at her cousin she said gently you will see me try to please madam since tis my duty but if you suppose tis with any further object such as what she might give me you very ill know phoebe latrobe well mind your business said rhoda rather fiercely a few minutes later she was asleep but sleep did not visit phoebes eyes that night when the morning came rhoda seemed quite to have forgotten her vexation she chattered away while she was dressing on various topics but chiefly respecting the new clothes which madam had promised to phoebe if words might be considered a criterion rhoda appeared to take far more interest in these than phoebe herself breakfast was a solemn and silent ceremony when it was over madam desired phoebe to attend her in her own chamber and to bring her wardrobe with her rhoda followed unasked and sat down on the form at the foot of the bed to await her cousin phoebe came in with her arms full of dresses and cloaks she was haunted by a secret apprehension which she would not on any account have put into wordsthat she might no longer be allowed to wear mourning for her dead father but phoebes fears were superfluous madam thought far too much of the proprieties of life to commit such an indecorum however little she had liked or respected the rev charles latrobe she would never have thought of requiring his child to lay aside her mourning until the conventional two years had elapsed from the period of his decease phoebes common attire was very quickly discarded as past further wear and she was desired to wear her best clothes every day until new ones were ready for her this decided rhoda was ordered to ring for betty madams own maid and betty was in her turn required to fetch those stuffs which she had been bidden to lay aside till needed betty accordingly brought a piece of black camlet another of black bombazine and a third of black satin with various trimmings the two girls alike watched in silence while betty measured lengths and cut off pieces of camlet and bombazine from which it appeared that phoebe was to have two new dresses and a mantua and hood of the camlet but when rhoda heard betty desired to cut off satin for another mantua her hitherto concealed chagrin broke forth why madamshell be as fine as me my dear she will be as i choose answered madam in a tone which would have silenced any one but rhoda and now satin for a hood betty tis a shame said rhoda under her breath which was as much as she dared venture but madam took no notice you will line the hoods and mantuas warm betty pursued madam in her most amiable tone guard the satin with fur and the camlet with that strong gimp and a muff she must have betty a muff came in a vexed whisper from rhoda and when the time comes one of the broidered india scarves that were had of staveley for summer wear but that anon then but madam put in rhoda in a troubled voice you have never given me one of those scarves yet i asked you for one a year ago to judge from her tone rhoda was very near tears my dear replied madam tis becoming in maids to wait till they are spoken to had you listened with proper respect you would have heard me bid betty lay out one also for you you cannot use them at this season rhoda subsided somewhat discontentedly two pairs of black spanish gloves betty and a black fan and black velvet stays when the year is out she must have a silver lace and bid dobbins send up shoes to fit on with black bucklestwo pairs and lay out black stockingstwo pairs of silk and two of worsted and plain cambric apronsthey may be laced when the year is out i think that is all oha fur tippet betty and with this last order madam marched away oh shocking cried rhoda the instant she thought her grandmother out of hearing i vow but shes going to have you as fine as me every bit of it betty isnt it a shame well no mrs rhoda i dont see as how tis returned betty bluntly mrs phoebe shes just the same to madam as you are but she isnt exclaimed rhoda blazing up im her eldest daughters child and shes only the youngest and she hasnt done it before neither last night she didnt let her kiss her hand i say betty tis a crying shame maybe madam thought better of it this morning suggested betty speaking with a pin in her mouth well tis a burning shame growled rhoda perhaps mrs betty said phoebes low voice you could leave the satin things for a little while mrs phoebe i durstnt my dear rejoined betty nay not if twas ever so madam shes used to have folk do as she bids em and shell make em too never you lay mrs rhodas black looks to heart my dear shell have forgot all about it by this time tomorrow rhoda had walked away but i shall not answered phoebe softly deary me child said betty turning to look at her dont you go for to fret over that why if a bit of a thing like thatll trouble you youll have plenty to fret about at whiteladies mrs rhoda shes on and off with you twenty times a day and youd best take no notice she dont mean anything ill my dear tis only her phantasies oh mrs betty i wish phoebe came up from below fetch my cloak and hood and bring your ownquick now we are about to drive out with madam come dry your eyes child and ill fetch the things said betty soothingly youll be the better of a drive rhodas annoyance seemed to have vanished from her mind as well as from her countenance and madam took no notice of phoebes disturbed looks the maidens lodge was first visited and a messenger sent in to ask lady betty if she were inclined to take the air lady betty accepted the offer and was so considerate as not to keep madam wailing more than ten minutes no further invitation was offered and the coach rumbled away in the direction of gloucester for a time phoebe heard little of the conversation between the elder ladies and rhoda as usual in her grandmothers presence was almost silent at length she woke up to a remark made by lady betty then you think madam to send for gatty and molly that is my design my lady betty twill be a diversion for rhoda and sir richard was so good as to say they should come if i would indeed i think he would be easy to have them from home madam till they may see if bettys disorder be the smallpox or no when did betty return home my lady but last tuesday tis not possible that her sisters have taken aught of her for she had been ailing some days ere she set forth and they have bidden at home all the time you will be quite safe madam so i think my lady betty replied madam rhoda have you been listening no madam answered rhoda demurely then tis time you should my dear said madam graciously i will acquaint you of the affair i think to write to lady delawarr and ask the favour of mrs gatty and mrs molly to visit me their sister mrs betty as i hear is come home from the bath extreme distempered and tis therefore wise to send away mrs gatty and little mrs molly until mrs betty be recovered of her disorder i would have you be very nice toward them that they shall find their visit agreeable how long will they stay madam inquired rhoda why child that must hang somewhat on mrs bettys recovering i take it it shall be about a month but should her distemper be tardy of disappearing it shall then be something longer jolly was the sound which seemed to phoebe to issue in an undertone from the lips of rhoda but the answer which reached her grandmothers ears was merely a sedate yes madam i take it my lady betty observed madam turning to her companion that the sooner the young gentlewomen are away the better shall it be oh surely madam answered lady betty tis truly very good of you to ask it but you are always a general undertaker for your friends we were sent into this world to do good my lady betty returned madam sententiously unless phoebes ears were deceived a whisper very like fudge came from rhoda the somewhat solemn drive was finished at last lady betty was set down at the maidens lodge inquiries were made as to the health of mrs marcella who returned a reply intimating that she was a suffering martyr and rhoda and phoebe at last found themselves free from superveillance and safe in their bedroom now thats just jolly was rhodas first remark with nothing in particular to precede it molly delawarrs a darling i dont much care for gatty and betty i just hate shes a prig and a fidfad both but mollyoh phoebe shes as smart as can be such parts she has you know shes reallynot quite you understandbut really shes almost as clever as i am phoebe did not seem overwhelmed by this information she only said is she well nearly said rhoda she knows fourteen latin words molly does and she always brings them in into what asked phoebe with the little amused laugh which was very rare with her into her discourse to be sure child said rhoda loftily you dont know fourteen latin words how should you how should i indeed rejoined phoebe meekly if father had not taught me taught youtaught you latin gasped rhoda just a little latin and greek there wasnt time for much humbly responded phoebe greek shrieked rhoda very little please deprecated phoebe phoebe you dear sweet darling love of a phoebe cried rhoda kissing her cousin to the intense astonishment of the latter now wont you like a dear as you are just tell me one or two greek words i would give anything to outshine molly and make her look foolish i would she doesnt know one word of greekonly latin do for pitys sake tell me if tis only one greek word and i wont say another syllable not if madam gives you a diamond necklace phoebe was laughing more than she had yet ever done at whiteladies she was far too innocent and amiable to think of playing rhoda the trick of which melanies father was guilty in contes a ma fille when under the impression that she was saying in latin knowledge gives the right to laugh at everything he cruelly caused her to remark in public i am a very ridiculous donkey phoebe bore no malice she only said still smiling i dont know what words to tell you oh any answered rhoda accommodatingly whats the greek for ugly i dont know said phoebe dubiously kakos means bad and what is good and pretty agathos is good replied phoebe laughing and beautiful is kallios thatll do said rhoda triumphantly tis plentyi couldnt remember more let me seekaks and agathos and kalliusis that right phoebe laughingly offered the necessary corrections all right said rhoda ive no more to wish for ill take the shine out of molly at supper that evening madam announced that she had sent her note to lady delawarr by a mounted messenger and had received an answer according to which gatty and molly might be expected to arrive at whiteladies on wednesday evening madam appeared to be in one of her most gracious moods for she even condescended to inform phoebe that mrs gatty was two months older than rhoda and mrs molly four years her juniortwo years younger than you my dear said madam very affably now phoebe ill tell you what well do asserted rhoda as she sat down before the glass that night to have her hair undressed by her cousin im not going to have molly teasing about the old gentlewomen down yonder ill soon shut her mouth if she begins and if gatty wants to go down there well she can go by herself so ill tell you what you and i will drink a dish of tea with mrs dolly tomorrow and well make her finish her story i only do wish the dear old tiresome thing wouldnt preach then ill take you in to see mrs marcella and well get that done then in the morning you must just set out all my gowns on the bed and ill have both you and betty to sew awhile i must have some lace on that blue ill make madam give me a pair of new silver buckles too i cant do unless i cut out those creatures somehow and the only way to cut out gatty is by dress because she hasnt anything in hertis all on her i cut out molly in brains but my lady delawarr likes to dress gatty up because she fancies the awkward things pretty she isnt you knownot a speck but she thinks so whether the last pronoun referred to lady delawarr or to gatty rhoda was not sufficiently perspicuous to indicate phoebe went on disentangling her hair in silence and rhoda likewise fell into a brown study of the nature of her thoughts that young lady gave but two intimations the first as she tied up her hair in the loose bag which then served for a nightcap i cannot abide that betty the second came a long while afterwards just as phoebe was dropping to sleep i say phoebe yes did you say kakios phoebe had to collect her thoughts kakos she said oh all right they wont know but wont i take the shine out of that molly phoebes arrested sleep came back to her as she was reflecting on the curious idea which her cousin seemed to have of friendship come along phoebe this is the shortest way oh couldnt we go by the road asked phoebe drawing back apprehensively as rhoda sprang lightly from the top of the stile which led into the meadow of course we could but tis ever so much further round and not half so pleasant why there arecows said phoebe under her breath rhoda laughed more decidedly than civilly cows did you never see cows before i say phoebe come along dont be so silly phoebe obeyed but in evident trepidation and casting many nervous glances at the dreaded cows until the girls had passed the next stile cows dont bite silly phoebe said rhoda rather patronisingly from the height of her two years superiority in age but they toss sometimes dont they tremblingly demanded phoebe what nonsense said rhoda as they rounded the maidens lodge little mrs dorothy sat sewing at her window and she nodded cheerily to her young guests as they came in what do you think mrs dollygood evening said rhoda parenthetically if this foolish phoebe isnt frighted of a cow sure my dear that is no wonder for one bred in in the town gently deprecated mrs dorothy so stupid and nonsensical said rhoda i say mrs dolly are you afraid of anything yes my dear was the quiet answer oh said rhoda cows no not cows returned mrs dorothy smiling frogs beetles suggested rhoda i do not think i am afraid of any animal at least in this country without it be vipers said mrs dorothy butwell i dare say i am but a foolish old woman in many regards i oft fear things which i note others not to fear at all but what sort of things mrs dolly inquired rhoda who had made herself extremely comfortable with a large chair and sundry cushions i will tell you of three things my dear of which i have always felt afraid at the least since i came to years of discretion and most folks are not afraid of any of them i am afraid of getting rich i am afraid of being married and i am afraid of judging my neighbours oh cried rhoda in genuine amazement why mrs dolly what do you mean as to judging ones neighbourswell i suppose the bible says something against that but we all do it you know we do my dear mores the pity but getting rich and being married oh mrs dolly everybody wants those no my dear asking your pardon replied the old lady in a tone of decision unusual with her i trust every christian does not want to be rich when the lord hath given him so many warnings against it and every man does not want to marry nor every woman neither well not every man perhaps admitted rhoda but every woman does mrs dolly my dear i am sorry to hear a woman say it answered mrs dorothy with as much warmth as was consonant with her nature i hoped that was a mans delusion why mrs dolly i do said rhoda with great candour then i wish you more wisdom child well upon my word exclaimed rhoda didnt you when you were young mrs dolly no i thank god nor when i was old neither replied mrs dorothy in the same tone but mrs dolly a maid has no station in society said rhoda using a phrase which she had picked up from one of her grandfathers books my dear your station is where god puts you a maid has just as good a station as a wife and a much pleasanter to my thinking pleasanter exclaimed rhoda why mrs dolly nobody thinks anything of an old maid except to pity her they may keep their pity to themselves said mrs dorothy with a little laugh we old maids can pity them back again and with more reason mrs dolly would you have all the world hermits no my dear nor do i at all see why people should always leap to the conclusion that an old maid must be an illtempered lonely disappointed creature sure there are other relatives in this world beside husbands and children and if she choose her own lot what cause hath she for disappointment tis but a few day since mr leighton said in my hearing of course we know when a gentlewoman is unwed tis her misfortune rather than her faultand i do believe the poor man thought he paid us women a compliment in so speaking for me i felt it an insult why so mrs dolly why think what it meant my dear of course a woman cannot be so insensible to the virtues and attractions of men that she should wish to remain unwed therefore if this calamity overtake her it shows that she hath no virtues nor attractions herself you dont think mr leighton meant that mrs dolly asked rhoda laughing no my dear i think he did not see the meaning of his own words but tell me if it is not a piece of great vanity on the part of men that while they never think to condole with a man who is unmarried but take it undoubted that he prefers that life they take it as equally undoubted that a woman doth not prefer it and lament over her being left at ease and liberty as though she had suffered some great misfortune i never did see such queer notions as you have mrs dolly i cant think where you get them said rhoda however you may say what you will i mean to marry and i am going to be rich too and i expect i shall like both of them my dear and mrs dorothy laid down her work and looked earnestly at rhoda how do you know you are going to be rich why i shall have whiteladies answered rhoda and of course aunt harriet will leave me everything have madam and mrs harriet told you so my dear no said rhoda rather impatiently but who else should they leave it to mrs dorothy let that part of the matter drop quietly they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare she said taking up her work again what snare said rhoda bluntly they get their hearts choked up said the old lady with what mrs dolly cares and riches and pleasures of this life o my dear may the lord make your heart soft yet i am afraidi am very sore afraid that the only way of making some hearts soft isto break them well i dont want my heart breaking thank you laughed rhoda and i dont think anything would break it unless i lost all my money and was left an old maid o mrs dolly i cant think how you bear it to come down now and live in one of these little houses and have people looking down on you instead of looking up to youif anything of the sort would kill me i think that would well it hasnt killed me child said mrs dorothy calmly but then you see i chose it that makes a difference but you didnt choose to be poor mrs dolly well yes in one sense i did answered the old lady a little tinge of colour rising in her pale cheek how so demanded rhoda who was not deterred from gaining information by any delicacy in asking questions there was a time once my dear that i might have married a gentleman of title with a rentroll of six thousand a year mrs dolly you dont mean that cried rhoda and why on earth didnt you well my dear i had two reasons answered mrs dorothy one was with a little laughthat as you see i preferred to be one of these same illconditioned lonely disappointed old maids and the other wasand mrs dorothys voice sank to a softer and graver tonei could not have taken my master with me into that house i saw no track of his footsteps along that road and his sheep follow him but god means us to be happy mrs dolly surely my dear but he knows better than we how empty and fleeting is all happiness other than is found in him tis only because the lord is our shepherd that we shall not want mrs dolly that is what good people say but it always sounds so gloomy and melancholy what sounds melancholy my dear inquired mrs dorothy with slight surprise in her tone why that one must find all ones happiness in reading sermons and chanting psalms and thinking how soon one is going to die said rhoda with an uncomfortable shrug my dear exclaimed mrs dorothy when did you ever hear me say anything of the kind why that was what you meant wasnt it answered rhoda when you talked about finding happiness in piety and when did i do that just now this minute back said rhoda in surprise my dear child you strangely misapprehend me i never spoke a word of finding happiness in piety i spoke of finding it in god and god is not sermons nor chanting nor death he is life and light and love i never think how soon i shall die i often think how soon the lord may come but there is a vast difference between looking for the coming of a thing that you dread and looking for the coming of a person whom you long to see but you will die mrs dolly perhaps my dear the lord may come first i hope so oh dear said rhoda but that means the world may come to an end yes the sooner the better replied the old lady but you dont want the world to end mrs dolly i do my clear i want the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness oh dear cried rhoda again why mrs dolly i cant bear to think of it it would be an end of everything i care about my dear said the old lady gravely and yet tenderly if the lords coming will put an end to everything you care about that must be because you dont care much for him i dont know anything about him except what we hear in church answered rhoda uneasily and dont care for that softly responded her old friend rhoda fidgeted for a moment and then let the truth out well no mrs dolly i dont i know it sounds very wicked and shocking but how can i when tis all so far off it doesnt feel real as you do and madam and all the other people i know i cant tell how you make it real he makes it real my child tis faith which sees god how can you see him without it but i am not shocked my dear you have only told me what i knew before i dont see how you knew said rhoda uncomfortably and i dont know how people get faith by asking the lord for it said mrs dolly phoebe my child is it a sorrowful thing to thee to think on christ and his coming again oh no was phoebes warm answer you see madam i havent anything else dear child thank god for it replied mrs dorothy softly ton sort nest pas a plaindre i declare if tis not four oclock cried rhoda springing up and perhaps not sorry for the diversion there now i meant you to finish your story and we havent time left come along phoebe we are going to look in a minute on mrs marcella and then we must hurry home chapter five gattys troubles and i come down no more to chilling praise to sneers to wearing out of empty days but rest rejoicing in the power ive won to go on learning though my cryings done isabella fyvie mayo as the two girls turned into the little garden of number three the latch of the door was lifted and mrs jane came out good evening said she come to see my sister are you i and my deb are doing for her today for her nell has got a holidaygone to see her motherlazy slut which is the lazy slut mrs jane asked rhoda laughing heyday theyre all a parcel together answered mrs jane nell and her mother and her grandmother before them and marcella too shes no better go in if you want a string of complaints you can come out when youve had plenty how many complaints are plenty mrs jane one said mrs jane marching off plenty for me rhoda lifted the latch and walked in phoebe following her she tapped at the inner door oh come in whoever it is said a querulous plaintive voice well mrs rhoda i thought you would have been to see me before a poor lonely creature that nobody cares for and never has any comfort nor pleasure and who have you with you im sure shes in a deep consumption from the looks of her coltsfoot my dear and horehound with plenty of sugar boiled together and a little mallow wont hurt but theyll not do you much good i should say youre too far gone still tis a duty to do all one can and some strange things do happen like betty collinsthe doctors all gave her up and there she is walking about as well as anybody and so may you my dear though you dont look like it still you are youngtheres no telling and coltsfoot is a very good thing and makes wonderful cures oh that careless jane to leave me all alone just when i wanted my pillows shaking and so inconsiderate of nell to go home just today of all days when she knew i was sure to be worse i always am after a fastday fastdays dont suit me at all they are very bad for sick people they make ones spirits so low and are sure to give me the vapours oh dear that jane whats the matter with that jane demanded the bearer of the name stalking in as phoebe was trying to brace up her courage to the point of offering to shake the pillows want another dose of castor oil ive got it a faint shriek of deprecation was the answer oh dear and you know how i hate it jane do shake up my pillows they feel as if there were stones instead of flocks in them or nutmegs no doubt suggested mrs jane shake them up oh yes and you toodo you both good oh dont jane have you an orange for me sit down my dears said mrs jane parenthetically cant afford them marcella plenty of black currant tea better for you i dont like it said mrs marcella plaintively oranges are eightpence apiece and currants may be had for the gathering observed mrs jane sententiously they give me a pain in my side moaned the invalid well the oranges would give you a pain in your purse id rather have one in my side if i were you you dont know what it is to be ill said mrs marcella closing her eyes dont i ive had both smallpox and spotted fever so long ago bless you child im not methuselah said mrs jane well i think you might be jane for really the way in which you can sit up all night and look as fresh as a daisy in the morning when you have not had a wink of sleep and i am perfectly wornout with sufferingjust skin and bone and no more theres a little tongue left i reckon said mrs jane the way she will get up and go to market my dears after such a night as that pursued mrs marcella who always ran on her own line of rails and never shunted to avoid collision you never saw anything like herthe amount she can bear shes as tough as a rhinoceros and as strong as an elephant and as wanting in feeling asas a sensitive plant popped in mrs jane now marcella open your mouth and shut your eyes and take this is it castor oil faintly screamed the invalid endeavouring to protect herself stuff tis good tent wine take it and be thankful where did you get it jane ask me no questions and ill tell you no lies said mrs jane it was honestly come by well i think we must be going mrs marcella said rhoda rising oh my dear must you really and so seldom as you come to see a poor thing like me who hasnt a living creature to care for herexcept jane of course and she doesnt not one bit dear and to think that i was once a pretty young maid with a little fortune of my own and there was many a young gentleman my dear that would have given his right hand for no more than a smile from me heyday how this world is given to lying interpolated mrs jane and we were a large family theneight of us my dear and now they are all dead and i am left quite alone except jane you know oh dear dear but to think of it but there is no thankfulness in the world nor kindness neither the people i have been good to and now that i have come down a little to see how they treat me jane doesnt mind it she has no tender feelings at all she can stand all things and never say a word i am sure i dont know how she does it i am all feeling these things touch me so keenly but janes just like a stone well good evening my dear if you must go i think you might have come a little sooner and you might come oftener if you would but that is always my lot to be neglected and despiseda poor lonely ugly old maid that nobody cares for and it wasnt my fault i am sure i never chose such a fate i cannot think why such afflictions have been sent me i am sure i am no worse than other people clarissa is a great deal vainer than i am and jane is ever so much harder and as to dorothy why tis misery to see hershe is so cheerful and full of mirth and she has not a thing to be content withit quite hurts me to see anyone like that but people are so wanting in feeling i am sure go if you want said mrs jane shortly holding the door open oh yes go of course you want to go lamented mrs marcella what pleasure can there be to a bright young maid like you to sit with a poor sick miserable creature like me dear dear and only to think rhoda escaped phoebe followed more slowly mrs jane came out after them and shut the door behind them shes in pain this evening said the lastnamed person in her usual blunt style some folks can bear pain and some cant and those that can must beat with those that cant shell be better of letting it out a bit good evening oh isnt it dreadful said rhoda when they were out of the gate i just hate going to see mrs marcella especially when she takes one of her complaining fits if i were mrs jane i should let her have it out by herself but she is hard rathershe doesnt care as i should but phoebe thought that a mistake she had noticed the drawn brow of the silent sister while the sufferer was detailing her string of troubles and the sudden quiver of the under lip when allusion was made to the eight of whom the family had once consisted and phoebes deduction was not that jane talbot bore no burden but that she kept it out of sight perhaps that very characteristic bluntness of her manner denoted a tight curb kept upon her spirit rhoda had noticed nothing of all this herself a surface character she could not see below the surface in another the wednesday evening came and with it sir richard delawarrs coach conveying his two younger daughters they were extremely unlike in person gatty was tall calm and deliberate molly was rather diminutive for her years and exceedingly lively while gatty came forward in a stately courteous manner courtesying to madam and kindly answering her inquiries after betty molly linked her arm in rhodas with how goes it old jade and when mr onslow who happened to be crossing the hall stopped and inquired in a rather timid manner if mrs bettys health were improving molly at once favoured him with a slap on the back and the counter query whats that to you you old thief phoebe was horrified if these were aristocratic manners she preferred those of inferior quality but noticing that gattys manners were quiet and correct phoebe concluded that molly must be an exceptional eccentricity she contemplated the prospect of a month in that young ladys company with unmitigated repugnance well mrs molly my dearas smart as ever remarked madam turning to molly with a smile all right old witch said molly and to phoebes astonishment madam smiled on and did not resent the impertinence wellhow do you like gatty and molly said rhoda to phoebe when they were safe in their own room pretty well mrs gatty replied phoebe leaving the question of molly undecided dont you like molly demanded rhoda laughing ah i see shes rather too clever to please you i ask your pardon but i dont see any cleverness in downright rudeness timidly suggested phoebe oh nobody cares what molly says answered rhoda they put up with all thatshes so smart you see shes very very ingenious and everybody thinks so and she knows people think so shes a rep you see and she has to keep it up i ask your pardon said phoebe again a what if you please a rep child answered rhoda in her patronising style a reputationa character for smartness you know dont you see well i would rather have a character for something better said phoebe you may make yourself easy youll never get a character for smartness responded her cousin with an unpleasant laugh well i say phoebe while they are here i shall have molly in my room and you must sleep with gatty you can come in and dress me of a morning you know and help me into bed at night but we cant do with three in one room phoebe was inwardly thankful for it what little she had seen of gatty was rather negative than positive but at least it had not as in the case of molly revealed anything actively disagreeable rhoda was heartily welcome to mollys society so far as phoebe was concerned but it surprised and rather perplexed phoebe to find that rhoda actually liked this very objectionable maiden panem asked molly the next morning at breakfast her latin such as it was was entirely unburdened with cases and declensions thank you i will take kakos fiddlededee whats that said molly rhoda had completely forgotten what the word meant oh tis the greek for biscuit said she daringly phoebe contrived to hide a portion of her face in her teacup but gatty saw her eyes and read their meaning the greek cried molly who has taught you greek neerdowell a very learned person said rhoda to whom it was delight to mystify molly old onslow demanded irreverent molly quite undeterred by the consideration that the chaplain sat at the table with her you can ask him said rhoda did you old cassock inquired molly who appeared to apply that adjective in a most impartial manner indeed mrs molly i did noti never knew stammered the startled chaplain quite shaken out of his propriety never knew any greek i thought so responded audacious molly thereby evoking laughter all round the table in which even madam joined phoebe who had recovered herself sat lost in wonder where the cleverness of all this was to be found it simply disgusted her rhoda was not always pleasant to put up with but rhoda was sweetness and grace compared with molly gatty sat quietly neither rebuking her sisters sallies nor apparently amused by them and rhoda liked this girl it was a mystery to phoebe when night came phoebe found her belongings transferred to gattys room she assisted rhoda to undress herself silent but a perpetual chatter being kept up between rhoda and molly on subjects not by any means interesting to phoebe the latter was at length dismissed and with a sense of relief she went slowly along the passage to the room in which she and gatty were to sleep though it was getting very late the clock being on the stroke of ten yet gatty was not in bed she seemed to have half undressed herself and then to have thrown a scarf over her shoulders and sat down by the window it was a beautiful night and a flood of silvery moonlight threw the trees into deep shadow and lit up the open spaces almost like day phoebe came and stood at the window beside gatty perhaps each was a little shy of the other for some seconds passed in silence and phoebe was the first to speak you like it she said timidly oh yes tis so quiet was gattys answer phoebe was thinking what she should say next when gatty rose took off her scarf which she folded neatly and put away in the wardrobe finished her undressing and got into bed without another word beyond goodnight for three weeks of the month which the visit was to last this proved to be the usual state of matters gatty and phoebe regularly exchanged greetings night and morning but beyond this their conversation was limited to remarks upon the weather and an occasional request that phoebe would inspect the neat and proper condition of some part of gattys dress which she could not conveniently see and phoebe began to come to the conclusion that rhoda had judged rightlygatty had nothing in her but one evening when molly had been surpassingly clever keeping rhoda in peals of laughter and phoebe in a state of annoyed disgust on reaching their bedroom phoebe found gatty still dressed and sitting by the bed with her face bowed upon her hands i ask your pardon but are you not well said phoebe in a sympathising tone oh yes quite well was gattys reply in a constrained voice but as she rose and moved her hands from her face phoebe saw that she had been crying you are in trouble said phoebe gently dont tell me anything unless you like but i know what trouble is and if i could help you you cant said gatty shortly phoebe was silent her sympathy had been repulsedit was not wanted the undressing was as usual without a word but when the girls had lain down in bed phoebe was a little surprised to hear gatty say suddenly phoebe latrobedoes anybody love you god loves me said phoebe simply i am not sure that any one else does i like you said gatty you let me be thats what nobody ever does i am not sure that i understand you responded phoebe ill tell you replied gatty for i think you can hold your tongue and not be always chatter chatter chatter likelike some people you think theres only one gatty delawarr and ill be bound you think her a very dull stupid creature well youre about right there but there are two theres me and theres the thing people want to make me now you havent seen meyouve only seen the woman into whom i am being pinched and pulled this is me that talks to you tonight and perhaps youll never see me againonly that other girlso you had better make the most of me now that you have me im sure if you dislike her as much as i do you see phoebe there are three of us betty and me and molly and mothers set her heart on our all making a noise in the world well perhaps we could have managed better if we might have made our own noise but we have to make it to order and we dont do it well at all bettys the best off because mother hit on something that went with her natureshes the notable housewife so she plays her play well but when she set up molly for a wit and me for a beauty she made a great blunder molly hasnt a bit of wit so she falls back on rude speeches and they go through me just as if she ran a knife into me you did not think so did you no said phoebe wonderingly i thought you did not seem to care thats the other gatty she does not care shes been toldoh a hundred times overto compose herself and keep her features calm and not let her voice be ruffled and move slowly so that her elbows are not square and all on in that way and she has about learned it by this time i know how to sit still and look unconcerned if my heart be breaking and it is breaking phoebe dear mrs gatty what can i do for you you cant do anything but listen to me let me pour it out this once and dont scold me i dont mean anything wrong phoebe i dont wish to complain of mother or molly or any one i only want to tell somebody what i have to bear and then ill compose myself again to my part in the worlds big theatre and go away and bear it like other girls do and you are the only person i have acquaintance with that i feel as if i could tell pray go on mrs gatty i can feel sorry if i can do nothing else wellat home somebody is at me from morning to night theres a posturemaster comes once a week and mothers maid looks to my carriage at all times tis an endless round ofgatty hold your head upgatty put that plate down and take it up with your arm roundedgatty you must not laughgatty you must not sneezegatty walk slowercome thats enough then theres molly on the top of it and theres betty on the top of mollywho cant conceive why anybody should ruffle her mind about anything and theres mother above all for ever telling me she looks to have me cut a dash and make a good match and if i had played my cards rightly i ought to have caught a husband ere i was seventeentis disgraceful that i should thus throw away my advantages and phoebe i want nothing but to creep into some little faraway corner and be me and throw away my patches and lovelocks and powder and pomatum and never see that other gatty any more thats how it was up to last month gatty paused a moment and drew a long sigh and then there came another on the scene and i suppose the play grew more entertaining to mother and betty and molly in the boxes people dont think you know when they look down at the prima donna painted and smiling and decked with flowersthey dont think if she has a husband who illuses her or a child dying at home she has come there to make them sport well there came an old lorda man of sixty or seventywho has led a wild rakish life all these years and now he thinks tis time to settle down and he wants me to help him to make people think hes become respectable and they say i shall marry him phoebe they say i mustthere is to be no help for it and i cant bear him to look at me if he touches my glove i want to fling it into the fire when it comes off and this one month here at whiteladies is my last quiet time when i go homeif betty be recovered of her distemperi am to be married to this old man in a weeks time i am tied hand and foot like a captive or a slave and i have not even the poor relief of tears they make my eyes red and i must not make my eyes red if it would save my life but nothing will save me the lambs that used to be led to the altar are not more helpless than i the rope is round my neck and i must trot on beside the executioner and find what comfort i can in the garland of roses on my head there was a silence of a few seconds after gatty finished her miserable tale and then phoebes voice asked softly dear mrs gatty have you asked god to save you whats the use answered gatty in a hopeless tone because he would do it said phoebe i dont know how it might be by changing my lady delawarrs mind or the old lords or yours or many another way i dont know how but i do know that he has promised to bring no temptation on those that fear him beyond what they shall be able to bear oh i dont know said gatty in that tone which makes the word sound like a cry of pain have you tried entreating my lady delawarr tried i should think so and what do you think i get by it gatty my dear tis so unmodish to be thus warm over anything compose yourself and control your feelings loveno of course you do not love my lord polesworth while you are yet a maid twould be highly indecorous for you to do any such thing but when you are his wife youll be perfectly content and that is all you can expect my dear do compose yourself or your face will be quite wrinkled and let me hear no more of this nonsense i beg of you maids cannot look to choose for themselves tis not reasonable that is what i get phoebe and your father mrs gatty my father oh really gatty i cant interferetis your mothers affair you must make up your mind to it we cant have always what we likeand then he whistles to his hounds and goes out ahunting well mrs gatty suppose you try god suppose i have done phoebe and got no answer at all forgive me i cannot suppose it is he so good to you phoebe the question was asked in a very very mournful tone mrs gatty said phoebe softly he has given me himself i do not think he has given me anything else of what my heart longs for but that is enough in him i have all things what do you mean came in accents of perplexity from the bed in the opposite corner i am afraid said phoebe i cannot tell you i mean i could not make you understand it given you himself repeated gatty i can fancy how he could reward you or make you happy but give you himself well i cannot explain it said phoebe yes it means giving happiness but it means a great deal more i can feel it but i cannot put it in words i dont understand you the least bit will you talk awhile with mrs dolly jennings and see if she can explain it to you i do not think any one can in words but i guess she would come nearer to it than i could i like mrs dolly said gatty thoughtfully she is very kind very assented phoebe i think i should not mind talking to her said gatty we will walk down there tomorrow if we can get leave and now had we not better go to sleep suggested phoebe well we can try sighed gatty but phoebe tis no good telling me to pray because i have done it i said over every collect in the prayerbookten a day and the very morning after i had finished them that horrid man came and mother madei had to go down and sit half an hour listening to him praying does no good i am not sure that you have tried it said phoebe didnt i tell you this minute i said every i ask your pardon for interrupting you but saying is not praying did you really pray them phoebe i do not understand you how could i pray them and not say them well i did not quite mean that said phoebe but please mrs gatty did you feel them did you really ask god all the collects say or did you only repeat the words over you see if i felt cold in bed i might ask mrs betty to give me leave to have another blanket but if i only kept saying that i was cold to myself over and over and did not tell mrs betty i should be long enough before i got the blanket did you say the collects to yourself mrs gatty or did you say them to the lord there was a pause before gatty said in rather an awed voice phoebe when you pray is god there yes said phoebe readily he is not with me replied gatty he feels a long long way off and i feel as if my collects might drop and be lost before they can get up to him dont you never answered phoebe but i dont send my prayers up by themselves i give them to jesus christ to carry he never drops one mrs gatty tis all something i dont understand one bit said gatty wearily go to sleep phoebe i wont keep you awake but well go and see mrs dolly the next afternoon when rhoda and molly had disappeared on their private affairs gatty dropped a courtesy to madam and requested her permission to visit mrs dolly jennings by all means my dear answered madam affably if rhoda has no occasion for her let phoebe wait on you the second request which had been on gattys lips being thus forestalled the girls set forthwithout consulting rhoda which gatty was disinclined to do and which phoebe fancied that she had doneand reached the maidens lodge without falling in with any disturbing element such as either rhoda or molly would unquestionably have been mrs dorothy received them in her usual kindly manner and gave them tea before they entered on the subject of which both the young minds were full then gatty told her story if very much the same terms as she had given it to phoebe and i cant understand phoebe mrs dolly she ended she says god has given her himself and i cannot make it out and she says she gives her prayers to jesus christ to carry i dont know what she means it sounds good but i dont understand itnot one bit mrs dorothy came up to where gatty was sitting and took the girls head between her small thin hands it was not a beautiful face but it was pleasant enough to look on and would have been more so but for the discipline which had crushed out of it all natural interest and youthful anticipation and had left that strange strained look of care and forced calm upon the white brow dear child she said gently you want rest dont you gattys grey eyes filled with tears that is just what i do want mrs dolly she said somewhere where i could be quiet and be let alone and just be myself and not somebody else ah my dear said mrs dorothy shaking her head you never get let alone in this world satan wont let you alone if men do but to be yourselfthat is what god wants of you at least tis one half of what he would have the other half is that you should give yourself to him tis no good praying said gatty as before did the lord tell you that my dear no said gatty looking up in surprise well i would not say it till he does child but what did you pray for i said all the collects over very good things my dear but were they what you wanted i thought you had a special trouble at this time but what could i do asked gatty apparently rather bewildered dear child thou couldst sure ask thy father to help thee without more ado but bide a wee as my old friend scots davie was wont to say there is a great deal about prayer in the word of god let us look at a little of it little mrs dorothy trotted to her small worktable which generally stood at her side and came back with a wellworn brown bible gatty watched her with a rather frightened look as if she thought that something was going to be done to her and was not sure whether it might hurt her now hearken be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god again whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do these are grand words my dear but they cant mean that mrs dorothy why only thinkif i were to ask for a fortune should i get it i must have two questions answered my dear ere i can tell that who are the you in these verses i thought it meant everybody not so listen again if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you tis not everybody doth that but i dont know what that means mrs dorothy then my dear you have answered my second questionare you one of these for if you know not even what the thing is tis but reasonable to conclude you have never known it in your own person i suppose not said gatty sorrowfully you see my dear tis to certain persons these words are said if you are not one of these persons then they are not said to you i am not and gatty shook her head sadly but mrs dorothy what does it mean dear said the old lady when we do truly abide in christ we desire first of all that his will be done we wish for this or that but we wish more than all that he choose all things for usthat he have his own way our wills are become his will it follows as a certainty that they shall be done we must have what we wish when it is what he wishes who rules all things ye shall ask what ye will he guides us what to ask if we beg him to do so is any one thus much perfect inquired gatty doubtfully many are trying for it said mrs dolly there may be but few that have fully reached it but that makes us like machines mrs dolly moved about at anothers will what my dear love makes us machines never the very last thing that could be child i dont know much about love said gatty drearily about love or about being loved responded mrs dolly both answered the girl in the same tone will you try it my dear tis the sweetener of all human life gatty looked up with a surprised expression i cant make people love me she said nor can you make yourself love others added mrs dorothy but you can ask the lord for that fairest of all his gifts saving jesus christ ask god for a beau o mrs dorothy exclaimed gatty in a shocked tone my dear i never so much as named one responded mrs dorothy with a little laugh sure you are not one of those foolish maids that think they must be loveless and forlorn without they have a husband gatty had always been taught to think so and she looked bewildered and mystified a more eligible husband than old lord polesworth was the only idea that associated itself in her mind with the word love but what else did you mean she asked ay me said mrs dorothy as if to herself how do men misunderstand god child wert thou never taught the first and great commandment thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy mind and with all thy soul and with all thy strength oh of course said gatty as if she were listening to some scientific formula about a matter wherein she was not at all concerned have you done that my dear done what demanded gatty in a startled tone have you loved god with all your heart gatty looked as if she had been suddenly roused from sleep and was unable to take in the circumstances i dont know ii suppose so you suppose so dear child how can you love any and not know it but that is quite another sort of love cried gatty there is no sort but one my dear love is love oh but we cant love god said gatty as if the idea quite shocked her that meansit means reverence you know and duty and so on it cant mean anything else mrs dorothy mrs dorothy knitted very fast for a moment phoebe saw that her eyes were filled with tears poor lost sheep she said in a grieved voice poor straying lamb whom the wolf hath taught to be frightened of the shepherd you did not find that in the bible my dear oh but words dont mean the same in the bible urged gatty surely mrs dorothy twould be quite unreverent to think so surely my dear it were more unreverent to think that god does not mean what he saith when he saith i will punish you seven times for your sins he means it mrs gatty and when he saith i will be a father unto you shall we say he doth not mean it o my dear dont do him such an injury as that do god an injury said gatty in an awed whisper ay a cruel injury was the answer men are always injuring god either they try to persuade themselves that he means not what he says when he threatens or else they shut their hearts up close and then fancy that his heart is shut up too my dear he did not tarry to offer to be your father until you came and asked him for it he first loved you child what dost thou know of the lord jesus christ ah what did she know for gatty lived in a dreary time when religion was at one of its lowest ebbtides and had sunk almost to the level of heathen morality if gatty had been required to give definitions of the greatest words in the language and had really done it from the bottom of her heart according to her own honest belief the list would have run much in this way godthe great first cause of all things who has nothing to do with anything now but will at some remote period punish murderers thieves and very wicked people christa supernaturally good man who was crucified seventeen hundred years ago heavena delightful place where everybody is happy to which all respectable people will go when they cant help it any longer biblea good book read in church intensely dry as good books always are no concern of mine salvation peace holiness and the likewords in the prayerbook faith hope love etceteraduties which of course we all perform and therefore dont need to trouble ourselves about them prayeran incantation to be repeated morning and evening if you wish to avert ill luck during the day these were gattys viewsif she could be said to have any how different from those of mrs dorothy jennings to her god was the creator from whom and by whom and to whom were all things the fountain of mercy who had so loved the world as to give his onlybegotten son for its salvation the father who having loved her before the world was cared for everything however insignificant which concerned her welfare christ was the friend who sticketh closer than a brotherthe lamb who had been slain for her the high priest who was touched with every feeling of human infirmity heaven was the home which her father had prepared for her the bible was the means whereby her father talked with her and prayer the means whereby she talked with him salvation was her condition holiness her aim faith love peace the very breath she drew while in gattys eyes all this was unknown and unreal to mrs dorothy it was the most real thing in all the world gatty answered her friends query by a puzzled look it comes in church she said he is in the creed and at the end of the prayers i dont know child replied mrs dorothy you dont know him and mrs gatty my dear you must know him if you are ever to be a happy woman o poor child poor child to think that the man who loved you and gave his life for you is no more to you than one of a row of figures a name set to the end of a prayer gatty was taken by surprise she looked up with both unwonted emotion and astonishment in her eyes mrs dolly she said with feeling i cannot tell but i think twould be pleasant to feel like you it sounds all real as if you had a live friend that is just what it is my dear mrs gatty a friend that loves me enough to count the very hairs of my headto whom nothing is a little matter that can concern me and he is just as ready to be your friend too what makes you think so mrs dolly my dear he died on purpose to save you the world not me said gatty if there had been no world but you was the answer he would have thought it worth while gattys answer was not immediate when it came it was what does he want me to do he wants you to give him your heart said the old lady do that first and you will very soon find out how to give him your hands and your head and will he keep away my lord polesworth asked the girl earnestly he will keep away everything that can hurt you not maybe everything you dont like sometimes tis just the contrary the sweet cake that you like might harm you and the physic you hate might heal you if so he will give you the physic but child if you are his own he will put the cup into your had with a smite which will make it easy to take i should like that said gatty wistfully but could it be right to wed with my lord polesworth when i could not love nor honour him in my heart at all it can never be right to lie ask god to make you a way of escape if so it be what way leave that to him mrs dorothys little clock struck four i think if you please mrs gatty said phoebes hitherto silent voice that madam will be looking for us yes i guess she will answered gatty rising and courtesying i thank you mrs dolly you have given me a ray of hopeif twill not die away mrs dorothy drew the girl to her and kissed her cheek christ cannot die my child she replied and christs love is deathless as himself death hath no more dominion over him and he saith to his own because i live ye shall live also it should be a better life than this said gatty with a sigh this is not the christians life my dear his life is hid with christ in god tis not left in his own hands to keep he would soon lose it if it were farewell dear child and may the lord keep thee gatty looked up suddenly tell me what to say to him mrs dorothy scarcely hesitated a moment teach me to do thy will she answered that holds everything you cannot do his will unless you are one of his redeemed he must save you and hold you up and guide you to glory if you do his willnot because you do it for the salvation cometh first but without the one there cannot be the other and he that doeth the will of god soon learns to love it better than any mortal thing oh how love i thy law saith david there is nothing on earth that i desire in comparison of thee she kissed both the girls again and they went away chapter six traps laid for rhoda la souveraine habilite consiste a bien connoitre le prix des choses la rochefoucauld there was an earnest wistful faraway look in gattys eyes as though some treasurehouse had been opened to her the existence of which she had never previously suspected but neither she nor phoebe said a word to each other as they crossed the park and went up the wide white steps of the abbey where on earth have you been you gadabouts came in rhodas voice from the interior of the hall oh but ive such a jolly piece of news for you molly and me heard it from madam guess what it is rhodas grammar was more free and easy than correct at all times and phoebe could not help thinking that in that respect as in others she had perceptibly deteriorated by contact with molly i dont care to hear it thank you said gatty rather hastily walking straight upstairs oh dont you mrs prim demanded rhoda well it doesnt concern you much now phoebe guess phoebe felt very little in tune for the sort of amusement usually patronised by rhoda but she set herself to gratify that rather exacting young lady i dont guess things well she said is one of your aunts coming my aunts repeated rhoda in supreme scorn not if i know it thank you i said it was jolly why phoebe to guess such a thing as that well i should be pleased enough if mine were coming to see me said phoebe goodtemperedly i dont know what else to guess has some one given you a present wish they had ejaculated rhoda no im sorry to say nobodys had so much good sense but theres somebodyi shall have to tell you sooner or later you stupid goose so i may as well do it now somebodys coming to number four mrs eleanor darcy a cousin of my lord polesworthonly thinkand thats best of all shes got a nephew how is that best of all asked phoebe mr marcus wellesisnt it a pretty nameand he will come with her to settle her in her new house why oh what a silly phoebe you are he has three thousand a year then i should think he might take better care of his aunt than let her be an indigent gentlewoman said phoebe rather warmly as if he would want to be pothered with an old aunt cried rhoda but ill tell you what you are so silly you want telling everythingi mean to set my cap at him wont you have some cleaner lace on it first suggested phoebe with the exceedingly quiet dry fun which was one of her characteristics you stupid literal thing said rhoda i might as well talk to the cat oh here you come molly now for tea if tis ready and then madam was already at the teatable and baxter was just bringing in the kettle i trust you have had a pleasant walk my dears said she kindly as the four girls filed inmolly first phoebe last middling said molly taking the initiative as usual robbed seventeen birds nests climbed twentyfour trees and jumped over a dozen fivebarred gates oh did you murmured phoebe in a shocked tone too horrified for silence rhoda went into convulsions behind her handkerchief innocent little darling exclaimed molly she thinks we did you said so answered phoebe reproachfully you are so smart my dear mrs molly said madam smilingly did you all walk together no i thank you responded molly gatty and the innocent little dear went to a quakers meeting had madam taken the assertion literally she would have been alarmed and horrified indeed for at that time all dissenters were considered dangerous characters and quakers the worst of all but recognising it as one of mollys flights of intellect she smiled placidly and said no more my dear i think you will be acquainted with mrs eleanor darcy asked madam addressing herself to gatty she has visited my mother but only once answered gatty oh the pootsybootsy broke in molly isnt she a sweet charming handsome creaturethe precious dear i fear she doth not please you mrs molly asked madam interpreting mollys exclamation by the rule of contrary shes the ugliest old baboon that ever grinned was mollys complimentary reply what say you mrs gatty she is certainly not handsome answered gatty apparently with some reluctance but i have heard her well spoken of as very kind and good have you met with mr welles her nephew my dear molly had clasped her hands leaned back lifted her eyes with an expression of sentimental rapture and was executing an effective tableau vivant yes i have seen him two or three times said gatty is he a young man of an agreeable turn inquired madam he is very handsome replied gatty rather doubtfully as if she hardly knew what to say pleasant as a companion pursued madam people generally think so i believe answered gatty with studied vagueness you dear old concatenation youll get nothing out of my wretch of a sister impetuously cried molly ill tell you all about marcus hes the brightest eyes that ever shone and the sweetest voice that praised your fine eyes and the most delightful manners white hands and a capital leg and never treads on your corns oh theres nobody like him i mean to marry him molly said gatty it was the first time she had offered anything like a reproof to her sister now you hold your tongue mrs prude responded molly youre not a bit better than i am gatty made no reply dont you set up to be either a prig or a saint continued molly angrily bettys enough she isnt a saint but shes a prig if ever youre either ill lead you a life and there could be little doubt of mollys fulfilling her threat the next day gatty and molly delawarr went home betty had quite recovered and was gone to stay with a friend near bristol the house had been thoroughly disinfected and was pronounced free from all danger and lady delawarr thought there was no longer need for the girls to remain away i wonder what will become of me without you molly said rhoda dolefully oh youll have plenty to do old gatepost observed molly apparently in allusion to rhodas uneventful life youve got to fall in love with marcus ill cut you into slices if you do and make buttered toast of you goodbye said rhoda laughing vale responded molly goodbye dear little phoebe was gattys farewell i wonder what would have become of me if i had not met you and mrs dorothy for i have asked him to be my friendyou knowand i think i think he will i am sure of it goodbye and so gatty and molly passed out of the life at whiteladies on returning to the old order of things phoebe found rhoda as she expected considerably changed for the worse what had been a sort of goodhumoured condescension was altered into absolute snappishness and phoebe was sorely tried but the influence of molly bad as it had been proved temporary rhoda sank by degreesor shall i say rose into her old self and phoebe presently had no more to bear than before the visit from delawarr court about a fortnight after the departure of gatty and molly as phoebe was sitting at the parlour window with her work she perceived mrs jane talbot hooded cloaked and pattenedfor the afternoon was damp marching up to the side door the fact was communicated to madam who rose and glanced at herself in the chimneyglass and ringing her little handbell desired baxter to show mrs jane into the parlour good afternoon mrs jane tis a pleasure i did not look for said madam as she rose your servant madam returned mrs jane who had divested herself of cloak and pattens in the hall pray be seated mrs jane and what brings you hitherfor methinks some matter of import will have called you out on so rainy a day as this easy to guess answered mrs jane taking a seat as requested and delivering her communication in short blunt sentences like small shot a whim of marcellas got a fancy for port o port sent me to beg a sup of you madam fancies it will cure her fiftieth time she has thought so of something all nonsense cant help it indeed my dear mrs jane i am happy to be capable of helping mrs marcella to her fancy and trust it may be of the advantage she thinksphoebe tell betty to bid baxter bring hither a bottle of the best port o portthat from the little ark in the further cellarand how does mrs marcella this afternoon as cross as two sticks said mrs jane she is a great sufferer observed madam in her kindest manner mrs jane made no reply unless her next remark could properly be called one mrs darcy came last night last night answered madam in accents of surprise dear i quite understood she was not to arrive before this evening you have seen her mrs jane seen her oh dear yes ive seen her we were schoolfellows were you indeed that i did not know twill be a pleasure to you mrs jane to have an old schoolfellow so near depends said mrs jane sententiously no doubt answered madam were you and mrs eleanor friends at school mrs jane no madam not perhaps you were not near enough of an age only six months between no that wasnt it i was a silly scapegrace and she was a decent good maid too good for me i havent got any better and she hasnt got any handsomer pray forgive me replied madam with a smile but i cannot think that name applies to you now mrs jane and was her nephew with mrs eleanor as he engaged large as life said mrs jane and how large is that in his case inquired madam asking him or me retorted mrs jane i should say about as big as a field mouse he thinks himself big enough to overtop all the elephants in creation marcus welles oh yes ill mark him well you trust me it was tolerably evident that mr welles had not succeeded in fascinating mrs jane whatever he might do to other people i was told he was extreme handsome remarked madam in a tone of inquiry mrs janes exclamation in response sounded very likepish you think not mrs jane folks eyes are so different madam answered mrs jane chinamens beauties wouldnt go for much in england i guess hes a silly whimsical finnicking piecethats what he is pink velvet coat laced with silver buff breeches white silk stockings with silver clocks no cloak and raining cats and dogs and pitchforks reckon eleanor got all the sense that was going in that family none left for mr markmewell missed it anyhow from that day forward behind his back markmewell was the only name bestowed by mrs jane on the young man in question to his face she gave him nonean uncivil proceeding in but mrs jane being allowedly an eccentric character no one expected her to conform to conventional rules on all occasions it would seem that mr welles wished to lose no time in paying his court to madam for that very evening as soon as callinghours began he put in an appearance at whiteladies callinghours and visitingdays were as common then as now but the hours were not the same from five to eight oclock in the evening was the proper time for a visit of ceremony candles were always lighted there was a special form of knock and the guests sat round the room in a prim circle perhaps the cats dogs and pitchforks alluded to before had spoiled the pink and buff suit which had roused the scorn of mrs jane the colours in which mr welles chose to make his debut at whiteladies were violet and white a violet velvet coat trimmed with silver lace was fastened with little silver hasps white satin breeches led downwards to violet silk stockings with silver clocks girt below the knee with silver garters a threecornered hat of violet silk and silver lace was heavily adorned with white plumes and buttoned up at one side with a diamond he wore shoes with silver buckles and very high red heels whitesilver fringed gloves a small muff of violet velvet and carried in his hand a slender amberheaded cane being a london beau of fashion he was afflicted with a slight limp and also with intense shortsightedness which caused him to wear a gold eyeglass constantly in useexcept when alone on which occasions mr welles became suddenly restored to the full use of his faculties he certainly was very handsome and his taste was good his wig was always suited to his complexion and he rarely wore more than two colours of which one was frequently black or white mr welles was highly accomplished and highly fashionable he played ombre and basset the spinnet and the violin he sang and danced well composed anagrams and acrostics was a good rider hunted fearlessly and gamed high interlarded his conversation with puns and was a thorough adept at small talk he was personally acquainted with every actor on the london stage and by sight with every politician in the cabinet his manners were of the new school then just risingwhich means that they were very free and easy removed from all the minute and often cumbersome ceremonies which had distinguished the old school he generally rose about noon dined at three pm spent the evening at the opera or theatre and went to bed towards morning add to this that he collected old china took much snuff combed his wig in public and was unable to write legibly or spell correctlyand a finished portrait is presented of mr marcus welles and through him of a fashionable london gentleman of his day the impression made by mr welles on the ladies at the abbey was of varied character madam commended him but with that faint praise which is nearly akin to censure he was well favoured she allowed and seemed to be a man of parts but in her young days it was considered courteous to lead a lady to a chair before a gentleman seated himself and it was not considered courteous to omit the madam in addressing her rhoda said very little in her grandmothers presence reserving her opinion for phoebes private ear but as soon as they were alone the girls stated their ideas explicitly isnt he a love of a dear cried rhoda in ecstasy no i dont think he is responded phoebe in a tone of unmistakable disgust why phoebe are you not sensible of the merit of such a man as that no i am sure i did not see any said phoebe as before oh phoebe such taste as he has and his discourse i never saw so quick a wit i am sure he is a man of great reach and a man of figure too i shall think the time long till i see him again dear me i shant exclaimed phoebe taste well i suppose you may dress a doll with taste his clothes are well enough only they are too fine for anything but visiting well wasnt he visiting you silly phoebe and he may be a man of figurei dont know but as to reach i wonder what you saw in his discourse to admire it seemed to me all about nothing why thats just his parts said rhoda any man can talk about something but to be able to talk in a clever sprightly way about nothingthat takes a man of reach well he may take his reach out of my reach answered phoebe in a disgusted tone i shall think the time uncommonly short i can promise you till i see him again for i never wish to do it phoebe i do believe you havent one bit of discernment but phoebe held her peace madam called in due form on her new guest at the maidens lodge and mrs darcy returned the visit next day she proved to be a short stout little woman with a face which while undeniably and excessively plain was so beaming with good humour that it was difficult to remember her uncomeliness after the first coup doeil mr welles accompanied her on the return visit what had induced him to take up his quarters at the bear at tewkesbury was an enigma to the inhabitants of whiteladies of course he could not live at the maidens lodge madam being rigidly particular with respect to the intrusion of what betty called he creeturs into that enchanted valley and not tolerating the habitual presence even of a servant of the obnoxious sex according to the representations of mr welles himself he was fascinated by the converse and character of madam and was also completely devoted to his dear aunt eleanor but mr welles had not favoured the bear with very much of his attention before it dawned upon one person at least that neither madam nor mrs eleanor had much to do with his frequent visits to cressingham mrs dorothy jennings quickly noticed that mr welles was quite clever enough to discover what pleased different persons and to adapt himself accordingly with surprising facility and she soon perceived that the attraction was rhoda or rather rhodas prospects as the understood heiress of whiteladies mr welles accommodated himself skilfully to the prejudices of madam his manners assumed a graver and more courtly air his conversation a calm and sensible tone and madam at length remarked to her granddaughters how very much that young man had improved since his first arrival at cressingham with rhoda in the absence of her grandmother he was an entirely different being a great deal of apparent interest in herself and deference to her opinions a very little skilful flattery too delicately administered for its hollowness to be perceived a quick apprehension of what pleased and amused her and a ready adaptation to her mood of the momentthese were mr welles tactics with the heiress for whom he was angling as to phoebe he simply let her alone he soon saw that she was of no account in rhodas eyes and was not her chosen confidante but simply the person to whom she talked for want of any other listener there was not therefore in his opinion any reason why he should trouble himself to propitiate phoebe ever since the visit of the delawarrs rhoda had seemed disinclined for another call on mrs dorothy jennings now and then she went to see mrs clarissa when the conversation usually turned on the fashions and cognate topics sometimes she drank tea with lady betty whose discourse was of rather a more sensible character rarely she looked in on mrs marcella mrs jane had thoroughly estranged her by persisting in her sarcastic nickname for rhodas chosen hero and letting off little shafts against him more smart than nattering on mrs darcy she called perpetually perhaps with a view to meet him at her house but all mr welles alleged devotion to his dear aunt eleanor scarcely ever seemed to result in his going to see her at the maidens lodge when rhoda met him which she very often did it was either by his calling at the abbey or by an accidental rencontreif accidental it werein some secluded glade of the park at length one day without any warning a horse cantered up to the side door and molly delawarrs voice in its loudest tones and very loud they were demanded where all those stupid creatures were who ought to be there to take her horse then miss molly having been helped off came marching in and greeted her friends with a recitative lucy locket lost her pocket kitty fisher found it my dear mrs molly i am quite rejoiced to see you no you arent are you facetiously responded molly rhodai vow child youre uglier than evermother wants you for a while theres that jade betty going to come of age and she means to make the biggest fuss over it ever was heard she said she would send wilson over but i jumped on my tit and came to tell you myself youll come wont you old hag rhoda looked at her grandmother my dear of course you will go responded madam since my lady delawarr is so good tis so kind in mrs molly to take thus much trouble on herself fiddlededee ejaculated molly im no more kind than shes good she wants a fuss and a lot of folks to make it and i wanted a ride and some fun with rhoda wheres the goodness eh shall i take phoebe asked rhoda doubtfully youd better returned molly before madam could speak youll want somebody to curl your lovelocks and stitch your fallals and im not going to do itdont you fancy so oh i say rhoda you may have marcus welles if you want him theres another fellow turned up with a thousand a year more that will suit me better indeed i thank you said rhoda with a little toss of her head my dear mrs molly you are so diverting smiled madam you dont say so rejoined that fascinating young person youll put on your sunday bombazine rhoda were all going to be as fine as fiddlers as for youand mollys bold eyes surveyed phoebe seeming to take in the whole at a glanceit wont matter you arent an heiress so you can come in rags phoebe said nothing i dont think went on molly in a reflective tone that you can make a catch but you can try there is the chaplainhorrid old centipede and theres old walfordmolly never favoured any man with a mr to his namean ugly spiteful old bear that nobodyll have hes rich enough and he might look your way if you play your cards well any way youll not have much chance else so youd better keep your eyes pretty well open now rhoda come along and well have some fun and away went molly and rhoda with a smiling assent from madam what a very repulsive vulgar disagreeable girl this molly delawarr is true my gentle reader and yetdoes she do much more than say in plain language what a great number of mollys are not ashamed to think phoebes sensations in view of the coming visit to the court were far removed from pleasure must she go she braced up her courage and ventured to ask if you please madam well child was the answer in a sufficiently gracious tone to encourage phoebe to proceed must i go with mrs rhoda to delawarr court if you please madam why of course child madams tone expressed surprise though not displeasure phoebe swallowed her regret with a sigh and tried to comfort herself with the thought of meeting gatty which was the only bright spot in the darkness but would gatty be there rhoda and molly came in to tea arminarm and how has my lady delawarr her health mrs molly inquired madam as she poured out the refreshing fluid molly had allowed no time for inquiries on her first appearance oh shes well enough said molly carelessly and mrs betty is now fully recovered of her distemper shes come out of the smallpox and tumbled into the vapours said molly the vapours was a most convenient term of that day it covered everything which had no other name from a pain in the toe to a pain in the temper and was very frequently descriptive of the latter ailment bettys condition therefore as subject to this malady excited little regret and how goes it with mrs gatty is she now my lady polesworth my lady fiddlestrings responded molly not shenever will old polesworth wanted a pretty face and after gattys smallpox why you couldnt smallpox cried madam and rhoda in concert what didnt you know answered molly to be suretook it the minute she got home but that wasnt all neither old polesworth told mumwhich meant lady delawarrthat he might have stood smallpox but he couldnt saintship so saint gatty lost her chance and much shell ever see of such another dad and mum were as mad as hornets dad said hed have horsewhipped her if shed been out of bed couldnt in bed you seewouldnt have looked well but my dear she could not help taking the smallpox maybe not but she might have helped taking the saintpox said molly i believe she caught it from you nodding at phoebe but what vexed mum most was that the grey goose actually made believe to be pleased when she lost her chance of the tinsel trust me but mum blew her up a little all leather and prunella you know of course pleased to be an old maidjust think what nonsense she will be an old maid now sure as eggs are eggs unless she marries some conventicle preacher that would be the best end of her i should think phoebe sat wondering why molly paid so poor a compliment to her own denomination as to suppose that the natural gravitation of piety was towards dissent but mollys volatile nature passed to a different subject the next moment i say old roadside bring a white gown the queens coming to the bath and a lot of folks are trying to make her come on to berkeley and if she do a whole parcel of young gentlewomen are to be there to courtesy to her and give her a posy and all that sort of flummery and mum says shell send us down if they do it whos to give the posy eagerly asked rhoda dont know not you you wont have a chance old fidfad no more shant i itll be some thing of quality ill tread on her tail thoughsee if i dont whose whispered rhoda for mollys last remark had been confidential you dont mean the queen of course i dowho better her grandmother was a baronets daughter what else am i ill have a snip of her gown if i can o molly exclaimed rhoda in unfeigned horror why not ive scissors in my pocket molly you never could dont you lay much on those odds my red currant bush i can do pretty near anything ive a mindwhen i have a mind rhoda was not pleased by mollys last vocative which she took as an uncomplimentary allusion to the faint shade of red in her haira subject on which she was peculiarly sensitive this bit of confidence had been exchanged out of the hearing of madam who had gone to a cabinet at the other end of the long room but within that of phoebe who grew more uncomfortable every moment well tis getting time to say tata said molly rising shortly after tea was over wheres that tit of mine my dear i will send to fetch your horse round said madam pray make my compliments to my lady delawarr and tell her that i cannot but be very sensible of her kindness in offering rhoda so considerable a pleasure madam was about to add more but molly broke in come now cant carry all that flummery my horse would fall lame under the weight ill say you did the pretty thing tata see you on monday old gentlewoman she turned to rhoda threw a nod without words to phoebe and five minutes afterwards was trotting across the park on her way home to delawarr court chapter seven delawarr court le coeur humain a beaucoup de plis et de replis madame de motteville and how goes it my dear with madam and mrs rhoda inquired little mrs dorothy as she handed a cup to phoebe they are well i thank you mrs dolly i have come to ask your counsel surely dear child thou shalt have the best i can give what is thy trouble i have two or three troubles said phoebe sighing you know rhoda is going tomorrow to delawarr court and i am to go with her i wish i need not why dear child well i am afraid it must sound silly answered phoebe with a little laugh at herself but really i can scarce tell why do you never feel thus unwilling to do a thing mrs dorothy almost without reason ah there is a reason said the old lady and it comes either from your body or your mind phoebe if tis from your body let your mind govern it in any matter you must do if it come from your mind either you see a clear cause for it or you do not i do not mrs dolly i reckon tis but the spleen everything we call nervous then fell under the head of spleen there is an older name for that phoebe without it arise from some disorder of the body what mrs dorothy discontent my child but that is sin said phoebe looking up as if startled ay whatsoever is not of faith is sin then should i be willing to go mrs dolly what hast thou asked my dear should gods child be willing to do her fathers will phoebes face became grave dear phoebe when the people murmured it displeased the lord have a carewell what is your next trouble i have had a letter from mother said phoebe colouring and looking uncomfortable is that a trouble child nonot that oh no but but a trouble sticks to it wellwhat she says i ought toto get married mrs dorothy and she looks for me to do it while i tarry at whiteladies for she reckons that will be the best chance mrs dorothy was silent if her thoughts were not complimentary to mrs latrobe she gave no hint of it to phoebe i dont think i should like it please mrs dorothy said phoebe uneasily and ought i i suppose somebody had better ask you first was mrs dorothys dry answer i would rather live with mother continued phoebe and suddenly a cry broke out which had been repressed till then i wishoh i wish mother loved me she never seemed to do it but once when i was ill of the fever i do so wish mother could love me mrs dorothy busied herself for a moment in putting the cups together on her little teatray then she came over to phoebe little maid she said lovingly there are some of us women for whom no love is safe saving the love of him that died for us if we have it otherwise we go wrong and set up idols in our hearts art thou one of those phoebe i dont know sobbed phoebe how can i know dear child he knows canst thou not trust him dieu est ton berger the shepherd takes more care of the sheep phoebe than the sheep take care of themselves poor blundering creatures that we are always apt to think in the depth of our hearts that god would rather not save us and that we shall have to take a great deal of trouble to persuade him to do it nay it is the shepherd that longs to have the lamb safe folded and the poor silly lamb that is always straying away phoebe the father himself loveth thee oh i know but i cant see him mrs dorothy i suppose he knows that too answered her old friend softly he knows how much easier it would be to believe if we could see and feel maybe tis therefore he hath pronounced so special a blessing upon such as have not seen and yet have believed mrs dorothyand phoebe looked up earnestlydont you think living is hard work i did once my maid but i am beyond the burden and the heat of the day now my tools are gathered together and put away and i am waiting for the master to call me in home to my rest thou too wilt come to that child if thy life be long enough and to some even hereto all afterwardit is given to see where the turns were taken in the path and whereto the road should have led that we took not ah child one day thy heaviest cause of thankfulness may be that in this or that matterperchance in the matter that most closely engaged thee in this lifethy father did not give thee the desire of thine heart yet that is promised as a blessing said phoebe interrogatively looking up as a blessing dear child when thy will is gods will can it be any blessing when thy will and his run contrary the one to the other then you think i should not wish to be loved said phoebe with a heavy sigh i think gods child will do well to leave the choice of all things to her father i must leave it he will have it he will have it repeated mrs dorothy solemnly but phoebe you can leave it in loving submission or you can have it wrenched from you in judgment though it may be that you must loose your hold on a gem yet you please yourself whether you yield it as a gift or wait to have it torn away i see said phoebe was there any further trouble my dear only that replied phoebe life seems hard i get so tired thou art young to know that child said mrs dorothy with a rather sad smile well i dont know answered phoebe doubtfully i think i have always been tired and dont you know some people rest you and some people dont when there is nobody that rests one father used but mrs dorothy thought there was not much difficulty in reading the story hidden behind phoebes broken sentences so life is hard she echoed poor child dear it was harder to him that sat on the well at sychar wearied with his journey he has not forgotten it phoebe couldst thou not go and remind him of it and ask him to bless and rest thee mrs dolly do you feel tired like that a little amused laugh was mrs dollys answer thou hast not all the sorrows of life in thine own portion little phoebe i have felt it i do not often now the journey is too near at an end to fret much over the hard fare or the rough road when there be only a few days to pass ere you leave school your mind is more set on the coming holidays than on the length or hardness of the lessons that lie betwixt i wish i hadnt to go to delawarr court sighed phoebe there will be a great parcel of people and not one i know but rhoda and mrs gatty and mrs molly and rhoda always snubs me when mrs mollys there molly is trying admitted the old lady but i think dear child you might make a friend of gatty perhaps said phoebe and phoebe strive against discontent said mrs dorothy adding with a smile and call it discontent and not vapours there is a great deal in giving names to things so long as you call your pride selfrespect and high spirit you will reckon yourself much better than you are and so long as you call your discontent low spirits or vapours you will reckon yourself worse used than you are dont split on that rock phoebe the worst thing you can do with wounds is to keep pulling off the bandage to see how they are getting on and the worst thing you can do with griefs and wrongs is to nurse them and brood over them carry them to the lord and show them to him and ask his help to bear them or right them as he chooses and then forget all about them as fast as you can dear old scots davie gave me that counsel and through fifty years i have proved how good it was you never finished your story mrs dolly suggested phoebe i did not my dear yet there was little to finish i did but tarry at court till the great plaguetime when all was broke up and i went home to nurse my mother who took the plague and died of it after that i continued to dwell with my father for a while after my mothers death he was very low and melancholical saying that god had now met with him and was visiting his old sins upon him and then the very next year came the fire and we were burned out and left homeless then he was worse than ever twas like the curse pronounced on david said he that the sword should never depart from his house he could never look to know rest nor peace any more god hated him and pursued him to the death no word of mine though i strove to find many from the word of god seemed to bring him any comfort at all they were not for him he said but for them toward whom god had purposes of mercy and there was none for him he had sinned against light and knowledge and god would none of him any more one morning about a week after the fire as i was coming back from my marketing to the little mean lodging where we had took shelter and was just going in at the door i was sorely started to feel a great warm hand on my shoulder and a loud cheery voice saith dolly jennings whither away so fast thou canst not see an old friend i looked up and there was dear old farmer ingham in his thick boots and country homespun but i declare to you child that in my trouble his face was to me as that of an angel of god i brake down and sobbed aloud come come now saith he comfortably not so bad as that is it ive been seeking thee these four days dolly child i knew i could find thee if i came myself though the missis said i never should and ive asked at one and asked at another and looked up streets and down streets till this morning i saw a young maid with her back to me agoing down an alley and says i right out loud thats dollys back or else im a dutchman so i ran after thee and only just catched thee up im not so lissome as thou nay nor so lissome as i was at thy years however here i am and here thou art so thats all right and theres a good bed and a warm welcome for everyone of you at ingle nookthat was the name of his farm my dearand ive brought up a cart and the old tit to drag it and well see if we cant make thee laugh and be rosy again dear old man no nay would he take nor suffer so much as a word from father about our being any cost and trouble to him stuff and nonsense said he ive got money saved and the farms doing well and only my two bits of maids to leave it to and who should i desire to help in this big trouble if not my own fosterchild and hers so father yielded and we went down to ingle nook farmer ingham very soon found what was wrong with father eh poor soul said he to me hes the hundredth sheep thats got lost out on the moor and he reckons the shepherdll bide warm in the fold with the ninety and nine and never give a thought to him poor starved straying thing dear dearand as if id do such a thing sinner that i amas if i could eat a crust in peace till id been after my sheep poor wretchand to think the good lordd do itand the poor thing ableating out there and wanting to get home dear dear how we poor sinners do wrong the good lord i said wont you say a word to him daddy that was what i had always called him my dear since i was a little child eh child says he what canst thou be thinking on the like of me to preach to a parson all regular done up bands and cassock and shovel hat and all but ill tell thee whattheres dr bates acoming to bide with me a night this next week on his way from the north into sussex and ill ask him to edge in a word hes a grand man dolly silvertongued bates thoult hear well i knew for i had heard talk of it at the time that dr bates was one of them that gave up their livings when the act of uniformity came in so that he was regarded as no better than a conventicler and i wondered how father should like to be spoke to by dr bates any more than by farmer ingham because to him they would both be laymen alike but at that time i was learning to tarry the lords leisureah thats a grand word phoebe for his leisure runs side by side with our profit and hell be at leisure to attend to you the minute that you really need attending to so i waited quietly to see what would come dr bates came and he proved to be no common hedgepreacher but a learned man that had been to the university and had greek and hebrew pat at his tongues end i could see that it was pleasant to father to talk with such a man and maybe he took to him the rather because he had the look of one that had known sorrow when a man is suffering he will converse more readily with a fellowsufferer than with a hale man so they talked away of their young days when they were at school and college and father was much pleased as i could see to find that dr bates and he were of the same college though not there at the same time and a deal they had to say about this and that man that both knew but of course all strangers to me i thought i had never seen father seem to talk with the like interest and pleasure since my mothers death but time went on and their talk and not a word from dr bates of the fashion i desired i went to bed somewhat heavy the next morning however as i was sat at my sewing by the parlour windowwhich was open the weather being very sultrycame dr bates and father and stood just beyond the window the horse was then saddling for dr bates to be gone all at once they standing silent a moment he laid his hand on fathers shoulder and saith very softly i will hearken what the lord god will say concerning me father turns and stares at him as started but he goes on and saith for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him i hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart i have seen his ways and will heal him i will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far offhe said it twicepeace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him he did not add one word but went and mounted his horse and when he had bid farewell to all else just as he was turning away from the door he calls out in a cheerful voice good morning brother jennings then as it were father seemed to awake and he runs after and puts his hand in dr batess who drew bridle and for a minute they were busy in earnest discourse then they clasped hands again and father saith god bless you and away rode dr bates but after that father was different he said to meit was some weeks laterdolly if it please god i shall never speak another word against the men that turned out in sixtytwo they may have made blunders but some at least of them were holy men of god for all that i was always sorry for them said phoebe and father said so too true my dear yet tis not well we should forget that the parsons were turned out the first and the conventiclers afterward there were faults on both sides but mrs dolly why cant good men agree ah child they shall see eye to eye when the lord shall bring again zion no sooner thank god that he looketh on the heart i believe there may be two men in arms against each other bitter opposers of each other and yet each of them acting with a single eye to the honour of their lord he knows it and he only now but how sorry they will be for their hard thoughts and speeches when they come to understand each other in the clear light of heaven it always seems to me said phoebe diffidently that there are a great many things we shall be sorry for then but can anybody be sorry in heaven mrs dorothy smiled we know very little about heaven my dear less than madams parrot or mrs clarissas dog understands about anyone writing a letter dogs do understand a great deal remarked phoebe our flossie did my dear i have learned no end of lessons from dogs i only wish we christians minded the word of our master half as well as they do theirs i wish men would take pattern from them instead of starving and kicking them or tormenting them with a view to win knowledge we may be the higher creatures but we are far from being the better you may take note too that your dog will often resist an unpleasant thinga dose of medicine sayjust because he does not understand why you want to give it to him and does not know the worse thing that would otherwise befall him didst thou never serve thy master like that dear i am afraid so said phoebe softly we dont trust him enough phoebe it does seem as if the hardest thing in all the world was for man to trust god you would not think i paid you much of a compliment if you heard me say ill trust phoebe latrobe as far as i can see her yet that is what we are always doing to god the minute we lose sight of his footsteps we begin to murmur and question where he is taking us but my dear i must not let you tarry longer tis nigh sundown oh dear and phoebe looked up and rose hurriedly i trust madam will not be angry tis much later than i thought she found madam too busy to notice what time she returned rhodas wardrobe was being packed for her visit under the supervision of her grandmother by the careful hands of betty the muskcoloured damask which she had coveted was the first article provided and a cherrycoloured velvet mantle lined with squirrelskins was to be worn with it a blue satin hood completed this rather showy costume a wadded calico wrapper for morning wear a hoop petticoat wider than rhoda had ever worn before the white dress stipulated by molly small lace headdresses instead of the oldfashioned commode aprons of various colours silk and satin muslin and lace ruffles a blue camlet ridinghabit laced with silver ladies rode at this time dressed exactly like gentlemen with the addition of a long skirt and an evening dress of cinnamoncolour brocaded with large green leaves and silver stems with a white and gold petticoat under itwere the chief items of rhodas wardrobe a new set of bodylinen was also added made of striped muslin since our fair ancestresses made their nightdresses of muslin it would appear that they extended the term to some stouter material than the thin and flimsy manufacture to which we restrict it rhodas boots were of white kid goloshed with black velvet there were also jessamy glovesnamely kid gloves perfumed with jessamine a black velvet mask a superb painted fan a box of patches another of violet powder another of rouge and a fourth of pomatum one of the india scarves before alluded to a stomacher set with garnet a pearl necklace and a silver box full of cachou and canaway comfits to be taken to church for amusement during long sermons the enamelled picture on the lid rhoda would have done well to lay to heart as it represented cupid fishing for human beings with a golden guinea on his hook rhoda was determined to be the finest dressed girl at delawarr court and madam had allowed her to order very much what she pleased phoebes quiet mourning new though it was looked very mean in comparisonin her cousins eyes no definite time was fixed for rhodas return home she was to stay as long as lady delawarr wished to keep her phoebe my dear said madam madam responded phoebe with a courtesy come into my chamber i would have a few words with you phoebe followed her heart feeling as if it would jump into her mouth madam shut the door and took her seat on the cushioned settle which stretched along the foot of her bed child she said to phoebe who stood modestly before her i think myself obliged to tell you that i expect rhoda to settle in life on the occasion of this visit i apprehend that she will meet with divers young gentlemen with any of whom she might make a good match and she can then make selection of him that will be most agreeable to her phoebe privately wondered how the gentleman whom rhoda selected was to be induced to select rhoda then pursued madam when she returns she will tell me her design and if on seeing the young man and making inquiries of such as are acquainted with him i approve of the match myself i shall endeavour the favour of his friends and doubt not to obtain it rhoda will have an excellent fortune and she is of an agreeable turn enough now my dear at the same time i wish you to look round you and see if you can light on some decent man fit for your station that would not be disagreeable to you i have apprised myself that sir richards chaplain hath entered into no engagements and if he were to your taste i would do my best to settle you in that quarter i cannot think he would prove uneasy to me should i do him the honour at the same time if you find him unpleasant to you i do not press the affair but tis high time you should look out for you have no fortune but yourself and what i may choose to give with you and if you order yourself after my wish i engage myself to undertake for youin reason my dear of course the chaplain is very well paid for sir richard finds him in board and a horse and gives him beside thirtyfive pound by the year which is more than many have he is i learn a good easy man that would not be likely to give his wife any trouble not very smart but that can well be got over and of good family but indigentotherwise it may well be reckoned he would not be a chaplain so i bid you consider him well my dear and let me know your thoughts when you return hither phoebes thoughts just then were chasing each other in wild confusion the principal one being that she was a victim led to the sacrifice with a rope round her neck i ask your pardon madam but well my dear if you have something you wish to say i am ready to listen to it said madam with an air of extreme benignity phoebe felt her position the more difficult because of her grandmothers graciousness she so evidently thought herself conferring a favour on a portionless and unattractive girl that it became hard to say an opposing word if you please madam and asking your pardon must i be married must you be married child repeated madam in astonished tones why of course you must the woman is created for the man you would not die a maid i would rather if you would allow me madam faltered phoebe but my dear i cannot allow it i should not be doing my duty by you if i did the woman is made for the man repeated madam sententiously butwas every woman made for some man if you please madam asked poor phoebe struggling against destiny in the person of her grandmother of course childno doubt of it said madam then if you please madam might i not wait till i find the man i was made for entreated phoebe with unconscious humour when you marry a man my dear he is the man you were made for oracularly replied madam phoebe was silenced but not at all convinced which is a very different thing she could remember a good many husbands and wives with whom she had met who so far as she could judge did not appear to have been created for the benefit of one another and i trust you will find him at delawarr court at all events you will look out as to waiting my dear at your age and in your station you cannot afford to wait one or two years is no matter for rhoda but twill not serve for you i was married before i was your age phoebe phoebe sighed but did not venture to speak she felt more than ever as if she were being led to the slaughter there was just this uncomfortable difference that the sacrificed sheep or goat did not feel anything when once it was over and the parallel would not hold good there she felt utterly helpless phoebe knew her mother too well to venture on any appeal to her even had she fondly imagined that representations from mrs latrobe would have weight with madam mrs latrobe would have been totally unable to comprehend her so phoebe did what was bettercarried her trial and perplexity to her father in heaven and asked him to undertake for her naturally shy and timid it was a terrible idea to phoebe that she was to be handed over bodily in this style to some stranger rhoda would not have cared a change was always welcome to her and she thought a great deal about the superior position of a matron but in phoebes eyes the position presented superior responsibility a thing she dreaded and superior notoriety a thing she detested she was a violet born to blush unseen yet believing that perfume shed upon the desert air is not necessarily wasted here you are old rattletrap cried molly from the head of the stairs as rhoda and phoebe were mounting them brought that white rag were going mum says so turn your toes outheres betty rhodas hand was clasped and her cheek kissed by a pleasantspoken rather goodlooking girl very little scarred from her recent illness phoebe latrobe said betty turning kindly to her i know your name you see i trust you will be happy here your chamber is this way rhoda it was a long narrow room with a low whitewashed ceiling across which ran two beams a potpourri stood on the little table in the centre and there were two beds one single and one double whos to be here beside me inquired rhoda oh mother would have given you and phoebe a chamber to yourselves replied betty but we are so full of company she felt herself obliged to put in some one so gatty is coming to you cant it be molly rather uncivilly suggested rhoda phoebe privately hoped it could not will i think not answered betty smiling lady diana middleham wants molly shes in great request who isme demanded molly appearing as if by magic in the doorway of course im not going to sleep with you pugnose not going to sleep at all spend the night in tickling the people i like and running pins into those i dont fair warning i wonder whether it is better to be one you like molly or one you dont like said rhoda laughing i hope you dont like me in that regard said betty laughing too well i dont particularly was mollys frank answer so youll get the pins right about face standatease here comes mum a very gorgeously dressed woman all flounces and feathers as it seemed to phoebe sailed into the room kissed rhoda told her that she was welcome in a languishing voice desired betty to see her made comfortable informed molly that her hair was out of curl took no notice of phoebe and sailed away again im off molly announced to the world theres mr whatdoyoucallhim downstairs go and have some fun with him and molly vanished accordingly then rhodas unpacking had to be seen to by herself and phoebe that is to say phoebe did it and rhoda sat and watched her betty flitted about talking to rhoda and helping phoebe till her name was called from below and away she went to respond to it phoebe at least missed her and thought her pleasant company whatever else she might be she was goodnatured when the unpacking was finished to her satisfaction rhoda declared that she was perishing for hunger and must have something before she could dress before she could make up her mind what to do a rap came on the door and a neat maidservant entered with a tray ant please you madam mrs betty bade me bring you a dish of tea said she for she said twas yet two good hours ere supper and you should be the better of a snack after your journey here is both tea and chocolate bread and butter and shortcake and setting down the tray she left them to enjoy its contents long life to betty said rhoda here phoebe pour me a dish of chocolate i never get any at home madam has a notion it makes people fat but does she not like you to take it asked phoebe pausing with the silver chocolatiere in her hand oh pother go on exclaimed rhoda give it me if your tender conscience wont let you i say phoebe youll be a regular prig and prude if you dont mind i dont know what those are replied phoebe furtively engaged in rubbing her hand where rhoda had pinched it as she seized the handle of the chocolate pot oh dont you answered rhoda i do for ive got you to look at a prig is a stuckup silly creature and a prude is always thinking everything wicked and thats what you are phoebe wisely made no reply tea finished rhoda condescended to be dressed and have her hair curled and powdered gave phoebe very few minutes for changing her own dress and then followed by her cousin and handmaid she descended to the drawingroom to phoebes consternation it seemed full of young ladies and gentlemen in fashionable array and the consternation was not relieved by a glimpse of mr marcus welles radiant in blue and gold through a vista of plumes lace lappets and fans betty was there making herself generally useful and agreeable and molly making herself the reverse of both phoebe scanned the brilliant crowd earnestly for gatty but gatty was nowhere to be seen rhoda went forward and plunged into the crowd kissing and courtesying to all the girls she recognised she was soon the gayest of the gay among them no one noticed phoebe but betty and she gave her a kindly nod in passing and said pray divert yourself phoebes diversion was to retire into a corner and from her loophole of retreat to peep at such a world a very young world it was whose oldest inhabitant at that moment was under twentyfive but the boys and girlsfor they were little more put on the most courtierlike and grownup airs the ladies sat round the room fluttering their fans or laughing behind them in some cases gliding about with long trains sweeping the waxed oak floor the gentlemen stood before them paying compliments cracking jokes and uttering airy nothings both parties took occasional pinches of snuff for a few minutes the scene struck phoebe as pretty and amusing but this impression was quickly followed by a sensation of sadness a number of rational and immortal beings were gathered together and all they could find to do was to look pretty and be amusing why a bird a dog or a monkey could have done as much and more and a few words came into phoebes mind practically denied by the mass of mankind then as now thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are how apt man is to think that every creature and thing around him was created for his pleasure or at least for his use and benefit the natural result is that he considers himself at liberty to use them just as he pleases quite regardless of their feelings especially when any particular advantage may be expected to accrue to himself but the lord hath made all things for himself and he cometh to judge the earth chapter eight rhoda is taken in the trap that busy hive the world and all its thousand stings phoebe sat still for a while in her corner watching the various members of the party as they flitted in and out for the scene was now becoming diversified by the addition of elder persons ere long two gentlemen in evening costume engaged in conversation came and stood close by her one of them as she soon discovered was sir richard delawarr tis really true then demanded the othera roundfaced man with brilliant eyes who was attired as a dignitary of the churchtis really true sir that the queen did forbid the visit of the elector i had it from an excellent hand i assure you returned sir richard nor only that but the princess sophia so laid it to heart that twas the main cause of her sudden death it really was so upon honour my lord my lady delawarr had it from mrs rosamond harley ha then tis like to be true you heard i doubt not sir of durfeys jest on the princess sophiaha ha ha and the bishop laughed as if the recollection amused him exceedingly no i scarce think i did my lord not ah then give me leave to tell it you i hear it gave the queen extreme diversion the crown is too weighty for shoulders of eighty she could not sustain such a trophy her hand too already has grown so unsteady she cant hold a sceptre so providence kept her awaypoor old dowager sophy sir richard threw his head back and indulged in unfeigned merriment phoebe in her corner felt rather indignant why should the princess sophia or any other woman be laughed at solely for growing old capital good jest said the baronet his amusement over i heard from a friend that i met at the bath that the queen is looking vastly well this summerquite rid of her gout so do i hear returned the bishop what think you of the price set on the pretenders head sir richard whistled the queens own sole act without any concurrence of her ministers continued the bishop dear dear exclaimed sir richard five thousand i was told five thousand an excellent notion i take it wellidontknow slowly answered sir richard i cannot but feel very doubtful of the mischievous consequence that may ensue a price on the head of the prince of wales sounds bad my lordsounds bad though indeed he be not truly the queens brother yet tis unnatural for his sister to set a price on his head by which remark it will be seen that sir richards intellect was not of the first order the intellect of bishop atterbury was and a slightly contemptuous smile played on his lips for a moment the prince of wales repeated he surely sir you have more wit than to credit that baseless tale why not set a price on the pretender be it known to the reader though it was not to sir richard that on that very morning bishop atterbury had forwarded a long letter to the palace of saint germain in which he addressed the aforesaid pretender as your majesty and assured him of his entire devotion to his interests oh come i leave the whys and wherefores to yon gentlemen of the black robe answered sir richard laughing by the way talking of prices have you heard the prodigious price sir nathaniel fowler hath given for his seat in the commons six thousand pounds pon my honour surely sir you have been misinformed six thousand tis amazing your lordship may well say so why i gave but eight hundred for mine by the way there is another point i intended to acquaint you of my lord did you hear ever that there should be a little illhumour with my lord oxford on account ofyou know on account oh and the bishops right hand was elevated to his lips in the attitude of a person drinking yes yes well i cannot say i am entirely ignorant of that affair sir jeremys lady assured me she knew beyond contradiction that my lord oxford once waited on her somewhat foxed of course she was the queen but why a fox usually as sober a beast as others should have been compelled to lend its name to the vocabulary of intoxication is not so apparent absolutely drunk i heard responded sir richard and she was prodigiously angered said to my lady masham that if it were ever repeated she would take his stick from him that moment odd if the ministry were to fall for such a nothing as that well twas not altogether reverential to the sovereign said the bishop and the queen is extreme nice you know the threat of taking the stick from a minister was less figurative in queen annes days than now the white wand of office was carried before every cabinet minister not only in his public life but even in private at this point a third gentleman joined the others and they moved away leaving phoebe in her corner phoebe sat meditating for nobody had spoken to her when she felt a soft gloved hand laid upon her arm she turned suddenly to look up into a face which she thought at first was the face of a stranger then in a moment she knew gatty delawarr the smallpox had changed her terriblyfar more than her sister no one could think of setting her up for a beauty now the soft peachlike complexion which had been gattys best point was replaced by a sickly white pitifully seamed with the scars of the dread disease you did not know me at first said gatty quietly as if stating a fact not making an inquiry i do now answered phoebe returning gattys smile well you see the lord made a way for me but it is rather a rough one phoebe i am afraid you must have suffered very much mrs gatty wont you drop the mistress i would rather well yes i suffered phoebe but it was worse since than just then phoebes face not her tongue said in what manner tis not very pleasant phoebe to have everybody bewailing you and telling all their neighbours how cruelly you are changed but i could have stood that nor is it delightful to have molly for ever at ones elbow calling one mrs baboon and my lady venus and such like but i could have stood that though i dont like it but tis hard to be told i have disappointed my mothers dearest hopes and that she will never take any more pleasure in me that she would to heaven i had died in my cradle that stings sometimes then to know that if one makes the least slip it will be directly oh your saints are no better than other folks phoebe i wish sometimes that i had not recovered oh but you must not do that mrs gattywell gatty then as you are so kind the lord wanted you for something i suppose i wonder for what said gatty well we cant tell yet you see replied phoebe simply i suppose you will find out by and bye i wish i could find out said gatty sighing i think he will show you when he is ready said phoebe father used to say that it took a good deal longer to make a fine microscope than it did to make a common chisel or hammer and he thought it was the same with us i mean you know that if the lord intends us to do very nice work he will be nice in getting us ready for it and it may take a good while and father used to say that we seldom know what god is doing with us while he does it but only when he has finished nice at that time had not the sense of pleasant but only that of delicately particular i am glad you have told me that phoebe i wish your father had been living now oh very deepdrawn from phoebe echoed the wish phoebe i want you to tell me where you get your patience my patience repeated astonished phoebe yes i think you are the most patient maid i know i cant tell you i am sure answered phoebe in a rather puzzled tone i didnt know i was patient i dont think i have often asked for that specially very often i ask god to give me what he sees i need and if that be as you say i suppose he saw i wanted it and gave it me the admiring look in gattys eyes was happily unintelligible to phoebe now then said mollys not particularly welcome voice close by them heres old edmundson clasp your hands in ecstasy phoebe mum says you and he have got to fall in love and marry one another so make haste about it hes not an ill piece only youll find he wont get up before noon unless you squirt water in his face now then fall to and say some pretty things to one another of course molly had taken the most effectual way possible to prevent any such occurrence phoebe did not dare to lift her eyes and the chaplain was if possible the shyer of the two and had been dragged there against his will by invincible molly neither would have known what to do if gatty had not kindly come to the rescue pray sit down mr edmundson she said in a quiet natural way as if nothing had happened i thought i had seen you riding forth half an hour ago i suppose it must have been some one else iahyesno i have not been riding today stammered the perturbed divine twas a very pleasant morning for a ride said mediating gatty very pleasant madam answered the chaplain have you quite lost your catarrh mr edmundson quite i thank you madam i believe my mother wishes to talk with you of jack flint mr edmundson yes madam the lad hath been well spoken of to her for the undergardeners boys place i think she wished to have your opinion of him yes madam is the boy of a choleric disposition possibly madam but what think you mr edmundson madam iahi cannot say madam i think i see mr lamb beckoning to you observed gatty wishful to relieve the poor gauche chaplain from his uncomfortable position madam i thank youahvery much madam and mr edmundson made a dive into the throng and disappeared behind a quantity of silk brocade and brussels lace phoebe ventured to steal a glance at him as he departed she found that the person to whom she had been so unceremoniously handed over alike by madam lady delawarr and molly was a thickset man of fifty years partially bald with small expressionless features he was not more fascinating to look at than to talk to and phoebe could only entertain a faint hope that his preaching might be an improvement upon both looks and conversation a little later in the evening as phoebe sat alone in her corner looking on i say came from behind her her heart fluttered for the voice was mollys i say repeated molly you look here im not all bad you know i didnt want old edmundson to have you and i knew the way to keep him from it was to tell him he must i think tis a burning shame to treat a maid like that they were all set on itthe old woman and mum and everybody hes an old block of firewood youre fit for something better i tease folks but im not quite a black witch tata hell not tease you now and molly disappeared as suddenly as she had appeared there was no opportunity for phoebe to edge in a word but for once in her life she felt obliged to molly the next invader of phoebes peace was lady delawarr herself she sat down on an ottoman fanned herself languidly and hoped dear mrs rhoda was enjoying herself phoebe innocently replied that she hoped so too twill be a pretty sight all the young maids in white to meet the queen at berkeley resumed lady delawarr there are fourteen going from this house my three daughters of course and lady dianashe is to hand the nosegayand mrs rhoda and mrs kitty mainwaring and mrs sophia rich and several more those that do not go must have some little pleasure to engage them whilst the others are away i thought they might drink a dish of chocolate in yon little ivycovered tower in the park and have the young gentlemen to wait on them and divert them the four gentlemen of the best families and fortunes will wait on the gentlewomen to berkeley that is mr otway mr seymour my nephew mr george merton and mr welles i shall charge mr derwent yonder to wait specially on you mrs phoebe while mrs rhoda is away phoebe perceived that she was not one of the fourteen favoured ones a little flutter of anxiety disturbed her anticipations what would go on with rhoda and mr welles lady delawarr sat for a few minutes talking of nothing in particular and then rose and sailed away it was evident that the main object of her coming had been to give phoebe a hint that she must not expect to join the expedition to berkeley as phoebe went upstairs that evening feeling rather heavyhearted she saw something gleam and fall and discovered on investigation that a tassel had dropped from rhodas purse which that young lady had desired her to carry up for her she set to work to hunt for it but for some seconds in vain she had almost given up the search in despair when a strange voice said behind her le voici mademoiselle phoebe turned and faced her countrywomanfor so she considered her with an exclamation of delight ah you speak french mademoiselle said the girl it is a pleasure a pleasure to hear it i am french responded phoebe warmly my father was a frenchman my name is phoebe latrobe what is yours louise dupret i am lady delawarrs woman i have been here two long long years and nobody speaks french but madame and mesdemoiselles her daughters and mademoiselle marie will not though she can she will talk to me in english and laughs at me when i understand her not ah it is dreadful from what part of france do you come from the mountains of the cevennes and you the same then you are of the religion this was the huguenot form of inquiry whether a stranger belonged to them louises eyes lighted up we are daughters of the church of the desert she said and we are sisters in jesus christ from that hour phoebe was not quite friendless at delawarr court it was well for her since the preparations for berkeley absorbed gatty and of rhoda she saw nothing except during the processes of dressing and undressing very elaborate processes they became for lady delawarr kept a private hairdresser who came round every morning to curl friz puff and powder each young lady in turn and the unfortunate maiden who kept him waiting an instant was relegated to the last and certain to be late for breakfast following in the footsteps of his superiors he did not notice phoebe nor count her as one of the group but after the meeting on the stairs as soon as lady delawarr released her louise was at hand with a beaming face entreating permission to arrange mademoiselle and she sent her downstairs looking very fresh and stylish almost enough to provoke the envy of rhoda ah mademoiselleif you were but a rich rich lady and i might be your maid sighed louise this is a dreary world and a dreary country this england and a dreary house this cour de la warre madame isisah well she is my mistress and it is not right to chatter all one thinks still one cannot help thinking mademoiselle bettiif she were in my country we should call her elise which is prettyit is ugly bettiwell mademoiselle betti is very goodnaturedvery indeed and mademoiselle henrietteah this droll country her name is henriette and they call her gattishe is very good very good and pleasant mademoiselle henriette and since she had the smallpox she is nicer than before it had spoiled her face to beautify her heart ah that poor demoiselle how she suffers perhaps mademoiselle it is not right that i should tell you even you but she suffers so much this good demoiselle and she is so patient but for mademoiselle marieah there again the droll name mollidoes not mademoiselle think this a strange very strange country the great expedition was ready to set out at last all the girls were dressed exactly alike in white and all the gentlemen in blue turned up with white they were to travel in two coaches to bristol where all were to sleep at the house of mrs merton sisterinlaw to lady delawarr the next day the bouquet was to be presented at berkeley and on the third day they were to return by way of chaperone the housekeeper at the court was to travel with them to and from bristol out mrs merton herself undertook to conduct them to berkeley rhoda was in the highest spirits and phoebe saw her assisted into the coach by mr marcus welles with no little misgiving molly as she brushed past phoebe allowed the point of a steel scissorssheath to peep from her pocket for an instant accompanying it with the mysterious intimationyoull see what will she see molly asked lady diana who was close beside her how to use a pair of scissors said molly whats to be cut molly sophia rich wished to know a dash said molly significantly and away rolled the coaches towards bristol phoebe turned back into the house with a rather desolate feeling for three days everybody would be gone those who were left behind were all strangers to her except mr edmundson and she wanted to get as far from him as she could true there was louise but louise could hardly be a companion for her even had her work for lady delawarr allowed it for she was not her equal in education the other girls were engaged as usual in idle chatter and fluttering of fans lady delawarr passing through the room saw phoebe sitting rather disconsolately in a corner mrs phoebe my dear come and help me to make things ready for tomorrow she said goodnaturedly and phoebe followed her very willingly the picnic was a success the weather was beautiful and the young people in good tempertwo important points lady delawarr herself in the absence of her housekeeper superintended the packing of the light van which carried the provisions to the old tower there was to be a gipsy fire to boil the kettle with three poles tied together over it from which the kettle was slung in the orthodox manner phoebe who was trying to make herself useful stretched out her hand for the kettle when lady delawarrs voice said behind her my dear mrs phoebe you may be relieved of that task mr osmund derwentmrs phoebe latrobe mrs latrobemr derwent there was one advantage now lost in this double introduction if the name were not distinctly heard in the first instance it might be caught in the second phoebe looked up and saw a rather goodlooking young man whose good looks however lay more in a pleasant expression than in any special beauty of feature a little shy yet without being awkward and a little grave and silent but not at all morose he was one with whom phoebe felt readily at home his shyness which arose from diffidence not pride wore off when the first strangeness was over it was evident that lady delawarr had given him as she had said a hint to wait on phoebe the peculiarity of lady delawarrs conduct rather puzzled phoebe at times she was particularly gracious whilst at others she utterly neglected her simple unworldly phoebe did not guess that while rhoda peveril and phoebe latrobe were of no consequence in the eyes of her hostess the future possessor of whiteladies was of very much lady delawarr never felt quite certain who that was to be she expected it to be rhoda yet at times the conviction smote her that after all there was no certainty that it might not be phoebe madam was impulsive she had already surprised people by taking up with phoebe at all and rhoda might displease her in consequence of these reflections though phoebe was generally left unnoticed yet occasionally lady delawarr warmed into affability and cultivated the girl who might after all come to be the heiress of madams untold wealth for lady delawarrs mind was essentially of the earth earthy gold had for her a value far beyond goodness and pleasantness of disposition or purity of mind were not for a moment to be set in comparison with a suite of pearls mr derwent took upon himself the responsibility of the kettle and chatted pleasantly enough with phoebe to whom the other damsels were only too glad to leave all trouble he walked home with her insisting with playful persistence upon carrying her scarf and the little basket which she had brought for wild flowers talked to her about his mother and sisters his own future prospects as a younger son who must make his way in the world for himself and took pains to make himself generally agreeable and interesting under his kindly notice phoebe opened like a flower to the sun it was something new to her to find a sensible grownup person who really seemed to take pleasure in talking with her except mrs dorothy jennings and she and phoebe were not on a level in conversation with mrs dorothy she felt herself being taught and counselled in conversation with mr derwent she was entertained and gratified judging from his conduct mr derwent was as much pleased with phoebe as she was with him during the whole time she remained at delawarr court he constituted himself her cavalier he was always at hand when she wanted anything at times supplying the need even before she had discovered its existence phoebe tasted for the first time in her life the flattering ease of being waited on instead of waiting on others the delicate pleasure of being listened to instead of snubbed and disregarded the intellectual treat of finding one who was willing to exchange ideas with her rather than only to impart ideas to her was it any wonder if osmund derwent began to form a nucleus in her thoughts round which gathered a floating island of fair fancies and golden visions all the more beautiful because they were vague and all the while phoebe never realised what was happening to her she let herself drift onwards in a pleasant dream and never thought of pausing to analyse her sensations the absentees returned home in the afternoon of the third day and beyond the roll of the coaches and the noise and bustle inseparable from the arrival of eighteen persons the first intimation of it which was given in the drawingroom was caused by the entrance of molly who swept into the room with tragicomic dignity and mounting a chair cleared her voice and held forth as if it had been a sceptre a minute bow of black gauze ribbon ladies and gentlewomen said molly with solemnity the gentlemen dont count ladies and gentlewomen i engaged myself before leaving the court to bring back to you in triumph a snip from the queens gown behold it never mind how i got ithere it is upon honour as sure as my name is marytisnti was christened mariabut as sure as there is one rent and two spots of mud on this white gown which decorates my charming personthe places whereof are best known to myselfthis bow of gauze on which all your eyes are fixednow theres a shame sophy rich isnt looking a bitthis bow was on the gown of her majesty queen anne yesterday morning plaudite vobis and down came miss molly if i might be excused mrs maria hesitatingly began mr edmundson who seemed almost afraid of the sound of his own voice vobis is as i cannot but be sensible not precisely theahnot quite the word ah you shut up old bandbox said molly dropping her heroics none of your business cant you but be sensible first time you ever were i ask your pardon mrs maria i trust indeedahi am notah insensible to the manyahmany things which the youthful company were convulsed with laughter they were all aware that molly was intentionally talking at cross purposes with her pastor and that while he clung to the old signification of sensible namely to be aware of or sensitive to a thing she was using it in the new now universally accepted sense of sagacious the fun of course was enhanced by the fact that poor mr edmundson was totally unacquainted with the change of meaning i dont believe she cut it off a bit whispered kitty mainwaring she gave a guinea to some orangegirl who was cousin to some other maid in the queens laundrysome stuff of that sort cut it offhow could she just tell me that before the last word was well out of kittys lips mollys small bright scissors were snapped within an inch of kittys nose perhaps you would have the goodness to say that again mrs catherine mainwaring observed that young person in decidedly menacing tones thank you no i dont care to do replied kitty laughing but shrinking back from the scissors when i say i will do a thing i will do it madam retorted molly if you can i suppose said kitty defending herself from another threatening snap say i cant at your peril and molly and her scissors marched away in dudgeon you are very tired i fear mrs gatty said phoebe when gatty came up to the room they shared for the night rather answered gatty with a sad smile on her white face but she did not tell phoebe what had tired her it was not the journey nor the ceremony but her mothers greeting why betty you are quite blooming lady delawarr had said it hath done you good child and molly too as sprightly as ever child did you get touched i did madam answered molly with an extravagant courtesy ah said her mother in a tone of great satisfaction then we need apprehend no further trouble from the evil i am extreme glad o gatty you poor scarred wretched creature really had it not been that the absence of one of my daughters would be remarked on i vow i wish you had not gone tis such a sight to show that dreadful face of yours you will never give me any more comfortthat is certain pos echoed molly exactly in the same tone i would not mind gatty was bettys kindly remark thank you said gatty meekly i wish i did not gatty did not repeat this to phoebe but phoebe saw there was something wrong rhoda came rustling in before much more could be said she was full of details of the journey what the queen looked likea tall stout woman with such blooming cheeks that rhoda felt absolutely certain she wore rougehow she was dressedall in black with a black calash or high loose hood and adorned with diamondshow she had been receivedwith ringing cheers from the tory part of the population but ominous silence or very faint applause from such as were known to be whigs how sophia rich had told rhoda that all the whig ladies of mark had made up their minds to attend no drawingrooms the next season how it was beginning to be dimly suspected that lord mar was coquetting with the exiled members of the royal family and more than suspected that the duke and duchess of marlborough were no longer all powerful with queen anne as they had once been how the queen always dined at three pm never drank french wine held drawingrooms on sundays after service would not allow any gentleman to enter her presence without a fullbottomed periwig all these bits of information rhoda dilated on passing from one to another with little regard to method and wound up with an account of the presentation of the bouquet and how the queen had received it from lady diana with a smile and i thank you all young gentlewomen in that silver voice which was annes preeminent charm but half an hour later when gatty was asleep rhoda said to phoebe i have made up my mind phoebe have you responded phoebe what about i mean to marry marcus welles has he asked you said phoebe rather drily yes was rhodas short answer phoebe lay silent well said rhoda rather sharply i think cousin i had better be quiet answered phoebe for i am afraid i cant say what you want me what i want you echoed rhoda more sharply than ever what do i want you to say mrs prude if you please well i suppose you would like me to say i was glad and i am not so i cant i dont suppose it signifies to us whether you are glad or sorry snapped rhoda but why arent you gladyou never thought hed marry you surely phoebe said no with a little laugh as she thought how very far she was from any such expectation and how very much farther from any wish for it but rhoda was not satisfied well then whats the matter said she do you want me to say cousin of course i do should i have asked you if i didnt i am afraid he does not love you rhoda sat up on her elbow with an ejaculation of amazement if i ever heard such nonsense what do you know about it you poor little whitefaced thing i dare say i dont know much about it said phoebe calmly but i know that if a man really loves one woman with all his heart he wont laugh and whisper and play with the fan of another or else he is not worth anybodys love and i am afraid what mr welles wants is just your money and not you i beg your pardon cousin rhoda it was time rhoda was in a towering passion what could phoebe mean she demanded with terrible emphasis by telling such lies as those did she suppose that rhoda was going to believe them did phoebe know what the bible said about speaking ill of your neighbour wasnt she completely ashamed of herself and ill tell you what phoebe latrobe concluded rhoda i dont believe it and i wont im not going to believe itnot if you go down on your knees and swear it tis all silly wicked abominable nonsenseand you know it well if you wont believe it theres an end said phoebe quietly and i think if you please cousin we had better go to sleep pugh sleep if you can you falsehearted crocodile said rhoda poetically in distant imitation of the flowers of rhetoric of her friend molly i shant sleep tonight not likely yet rhoda was asleep the first chapter nine something alters everything tonight we sit together here tomorrow night shall comeah where robert lord lytton there didnt i tell you now ejaculated mrs jane talbot i am sure i dont know jane responded her sister in querulous tones you are always talking about something i never can tell how you manage to keep continually talking in the way you do i could not bear it i never was a talker i havent breath for it with my poor chestsuch a perpetual rattlei dont know how you stand it im sure and to think what a beautiful singer i was once young sir samuel dennis once said i entranced him when he had heard my singing to mrs lucys spinnetpositively entranced him and lord james morehurst an unmitigated donkey slid in mrs jane jane how you do talk one cant get in a word for you what was i saying clarissa you were speaking of lord james morehurst dear marcella tis all very well for jane to run him down said mrs vane in a languishing style fanning herself as she spoke but i am sure he was the most charming black man i ever saw he once paid me such a compliment on my fine eyes more jackanapes he came from mrs jane well i dont believe he ever paid you such an one said mrs clarissa pettishly hed have got his ears boxed if he had returned mrs jane the impudence of some of those fellows poor dear jane she never had any taste sighed mrs marcella i protest clarissa i am quite pleased to hear this news as much pleased you know as a poor suffering creature like me can be but i think mrs rhoda has done extreme well mr welles is of a good stock and an easy fortune and he has the sweetest taste in dress birds of a feather muttered mrs jane ay i knew what markmewell was after told you so from the first i marked him be sure i suppose he has three thousand a year inquired mrs clarissa guineasvery like not brainstrust me said mrs jane and an estate pursued mrs clarissa with languid interest oh dear yes chimed in the invalid i would have told you about it if jane could ever hold her tongue such a ive done observed mrs jane marching off oh my dear clarissa you can have no conception of what i suffer resumed mrs marcella sinking down to a confidential tone i love quiet above all things and janes tongue is never still ah if i could go to the wedding as i used to do i was at all the grand weddings in the county when i was a young maid i couldnt tell you how many times i was bridesmaid when sir samuel was marriedand really after all the fine things he had said and the way he used to ogle me through his glass i did thinkbut however thats neither here nor there the creature he married had plenty of money but absolutely no complexion and she paintedoh how she did paint and a turnup nosethe ugliest thing you ever saw and with all that the airs she used to give herself it really was disgusting o my dear i cant bear people that give themselves airs observed mrs clarissa with a toss of her head and grounding her fan no nor i echoed mrs marcella quite as unconscious as her friend of the covert satire in her words i wonder what mrs rhoda will be married in i always used to say i would be married in white and silver and really if my wretched health had not stood in the way i might have been my dear ever so many times i am sure it would have come to something that evening when lord james and i were sitting in the balcony after i had been singingand there that stupid jane must needs come in the way i always liked a pretty wedding i should think it would be white and silver and what do you suppose madam will give her oh a set of pearls i should say if not diamonds answered mrs clarissa she will do something handsome of course suppose you do something handsome and swallow your medicine without a lozenge suggested mrs jane walking in and presenting a glass to her sister tis time i am sure it cant be jane you are always making me swallow some nasty stuff and as to taking it without a lozenge i couldnt do such a thing stuff you could if you did said mrs jane come thenhere it is i shouldnt want one oh youyou have not my fine feelings responded mrs marcella sitting with the glass in her hand and looking askance at its reddishbrown contents come sup it up and get it over said her sister o janeyou unfeeling creature twill be no better five minutes hence im sure you see what i suffer clarissa wailed mrs marcella gulping down the medicine and pulling a terrible face jane has no feeling for me she never had i am a poor despised creature whom nobody cares for well i suppose i must bear it tis my fate but what i ever did to be afflicted in this way oh the worlds a hard place and lifes a very very dreary thing oh dear dear phoebe latrobe who had been sent by madam to tell the news at the maidens lodge sat quietly listening in a corner but when mrs marcella began thus to play her favourite tune phoebe rose and took her leave she called on lady betty who expressed her gratification in the style of measured propriety which characterised her lastly with a slow and rather tired step she entered the gate of number one she had left her friend mrs dorothy to the last just in time for a dish of tea child said little mrs dorothy with a beaming smile sit you down my dear and take off your hood and i will have the kettle boiling in another minute well and how have you enjoyed your visit you look tired child yes i feel tired answered phoebe i scarce know how i enjoyed the visit mrs dorothythere were things i liked and there were things i didnt like that is generally the case my dear yes said phoebe abstractedly mrs dorothy did you know mrs marcella talbot when she was young a little my dear not so well as i know her now was she always as discontented as she is now that is a spirit that grows on us phoebe said mrs dorothy gravely phoebe blushed i know you think i have it she replied but i should not wish to be like mrs marcella i think thy temptation lies that way dear child but thy disposition is not so light and frivolous as hers however we will not talk of our neighbours without we praise them mrs dorothy rhoda has engaged herself to mr marcus welles madam sent me down to tell all of you she has has she responded mrs dorothy as if it were quite what she expected well i trust it may be for her good arent you sorry mrs dorothy scarce my dear we hardly know what are the right things to grieve over you and i might have thought it a very mournful thing when the prodigal son was sent into the field to feed swine yetspeaking after the manner of menif that had not happened he would not have arisen and have gone to his father do you think rhoda will have to go through trouble before she can find peace mrs dorothy before she can i dont know my dear before she willi am afraid yes i am so sorry said phoebe dear child the last thing the prodigal will do is to arise and go to the father he will try every sort of swines husks first he doth not value the delicates of the fathers househe hath no taste for them the husks are better to his palate what wonder then if he tarry yet in the far country but how are you to get him to change his taste mrs dorothy neither you nor he can do that my dear most times either the husks run short or he gets cloyed with them that is if he ever go back to the father for some never do phoebethey stay on in the far country and find the husks sweet to the end that must be saddest of all said phoebe sorrowfully it is saddest of all ah childthank thy father if he have made thy husks taste bitter but all things are not husks mrs dorothy certainly not my dear delight in the lords works in nature or in the pleasures of the intellect such things as these are right enough in their place phoebe the danger is of putting them into gods place mrs dolly asked phoebe gravely do you think that when we care very much for a person or a thing we put it into gods place if you care more for it than you do for him not otherwise how is one to know that ask your own heart how you would feel if god demanded it from you how ought i to feel sorry perhaps but not resentful not as though the lord had no right to ask this at your hands grief is allowed tis murmuring that displeases him when mrs dorothy said this phoebe felt conscious of a dim conviction buried somewhere very deep down that there was something which she hoped god would not demand from her she did not know herself what it was it was not exactly that she would refuse to give it up but rather that she hoped she would never be called upon to do itthat if she were it would be a very hard thing to do phoebe left the maidens lodge and walked slowly across the park to whiteladies she was feeling for the unknown cause of this sentiment of vague soreness at her heart she had not found it when a voice broke in upon her meditations mrs latrobe phoebe came to a sudden stop and with her heart heating wildly looked up into the face of osmund derwent i am too happy to have met with you said he i was on my way to whiteladies may i presume to ask your good offices mrs phoebe to favour me so far as to present me to madam furnival phoebe courtesied her assent mrs rhoda i trust is well she is very well i thank you i am rejoiced to hear it you will not i apprehend mrs phoebe suffer any surprise if i tell you of my hopes with regard to mrs rhoda you must surely have seen when at delawarr court what was my ambition think you there is any chance for me with madam furnival it was well for osmund derwent that he had not the faintest idea of what was going on beneath the still white face of the girl who walked beside him so quietly she understood now she knew revealed as by a flash of lightning what it was which it would be hard work to resign at gods call it was rhoda for whom he carednot phoebe phoebe was interesting to him simply as being in his mind associated with rhoda and rhoda did not want him and phoebe had to tell him so so she told him i am sure madam would receive you with a welcome she said but as for mrs rhoda tis best you should know she stands promised already mr derwent thought phoebe particularly unsympathising people often do think so of those whose hands are clasped above a hidden pain and who have to speak with forced calmness as the only way in which they dare speak at all he felt a little hurt he had thought phoebe so friendly at delawarr court to whom he asked almost angrily mr marcus welles that painted fop cried derwent phoebe was silent you really mean that she is positively promised to him she is promised to him phoebe spoke in a dull low dreamy tone she felt as though she were in a dream all these events which were passing around her never could be real she heard osmund derwents bitter comments as though she heard them not she was conscious of only one wish for the futureto be left alone with god osmund derwent was extremely disappointed in phoebe he had expected much more sympathy and consideration from her he said to himself in the moments which he could spare from the main subject that phoebe did not understand him and did not feel for him in the least she had never loved anybodythat was plain and meantime simply to bear and wait until he chose to leave her taxed all phoebes powers to her uttermost she was left alone at last but instead of going back to the house where she had no certainty of privacy phoebe plunged into the shade of a clump of cedars and cypresses and sat down at the foot of one of them it was a lovely cloudless day through the bright feathery green of a syrian cypress she looked up into the clear blue sky above her love for osmund derwentfor she gave it the right name nowwas a hopeless thing his heart was gone from her beyond recall but thou remainest the words flashed on her accompanied by the wellremembered tones of her fathers voice she recollected that they had formed the text of the last sermon he had preached she heard him say again as he had said to her on his deathbed dear little phoebe remember always there is no way out of any sin or sorrow except christ the tears came now there was relief and healing in them but thou remainest can i suffice for heaven and not for earth phoebes face showed no sign when she reached home of the tempest which had swept over her heart phoebe i desire you would wait a moment said madam that evening after prayers when phoebe candle in hand was about to follow rhoda yes madam phoebe put down the candle and stood waiting madam did not continue till the last of the servants had left the room then she said child i have writ a letter to your mother i thank you madam replied phoebe and i have sent her ten guineas i thank you very much madam i will not disguise from you my dear that i cannot but be sensible of the propriety and discretion of your conduct since you came i think myself obliged to tell you child that tis on your account i have done so much as this i am sure madam i am infinitely grateful to you and now for another matter child i wish to know your opinion of mr edmundson if you please madam i did not like him said phoebe honestly nor i think he did not me that would not much matter my dear observed madam referring to the last clause but tis a pity you do not like him for while i would be sorry to force your inclinations yet you cannot hope to do better if you would allow me to say so madam answered phoebe modestly yet decidedly i cannot but think i should do better to be as i am madam shook her head but did not answer in words she occupied herself for a little while in settling her mittens to her satisfaction though she was just going to pull them off then she said tis pity well go to bed child we must talk more of it tomorrow bid betty come to me at once as you pass i am drowsy tonight i say fib said rhoda who had adopted from molly this not very complimentary diminutive for her cousins name but only used it when she was in a good humouri say fib what did madam want of you to know what i thought of mr edmundson what fun well what did you why i hoped his sermons would be better than himself and they werent did you tell madam that inquired rhoda convulsed with laughter no not exactly that i said o fib i wish you had she thinks it tiptop impertinence in any woman to presume to have an opinion about a sermon my word wouldnt you have caught it well i simply told her the truth replied phoebe that i didnt like him and i didnt think he liked me rhoda went off into another convulsion o fib you are goodnobody better what did she say to that she said his not fancying me wouldnt signify but i think it would signify a good deal to me if i had to be his wife well she wouldnt think so not a bit said rhoda still laughing shed just be thunderstruck if mr edmundson or anybody else in his place refused the honour of marrying anybody related to her shouldnt i like to see him do it it would take her down a peg i reckon this last elegant expression was caught from molly well i am sure i would rather be refused than taken unwillingly where did you get your notions fib they are not the mode at all you were born on the wrong side of fifty i do think which is the wrong side of fifty suggestively asked phoebe i wish you wouldnt murder me with laughing said rhoda look here now what shall i be married in white and silver mrs marcella said this morning this morning phoebes words came back no her was it only this morning thank you nothing so insipid for me i think ill have pink and dovecolour what do you say i dont think i would have pink said phoebe mentally comparing that colour with rhodas red and white complexion blue would suit you better well blue does become me answered rhoda contemplating herself in the glass but then would blue and dovecolour do i think it should be blue and cold or blue and silver what do you think phoebe i sayand suddenly rhoda turned round and faced phoebewhat does madam mean by having mr dawson here betty says he was here twice while we were visiting and he is coming again tomorrow what can it mean is she altering her will do you suppose i am sure i dont know cousin said phoebe i shouldnt wonder if she is i dare say shell leave you one or two hundred pounds said rhoda with extreme benignity really i wish she would youre a good little thing fib for all your whims thank you cousin said phoebe meekly and the cousins went to sleep with amiable feelings towards each other the dawn was just creeping over the earth when something awoke phoebe something like the faint tingle of a bell seemed to linger in her ears rhodadid you hear that she asked hear what demanded rhoda in a very sleepy voice i fancied i heard a bell said phoebe trying to listen oh nonsense answered rhoda rather more awake go to sleep youve been dreaming and phoebe accepting the solution took the advice she was scarcely asleep again as it seemed to her when the door was softly opened and betty came in mrs rhoda my dear youd better get up what time is it sleepily murmured rhoda youd better get up repeated betty never mind the time betty is there something the matter betty ignored phoebes question come my dear jump up she said still addressing rhoda youll be wanted byandbye who wants me inquired rhoda making no effort to rise well mr dawson the lawyer is coming presently and youll have to see him i rhodas eyes opened pretty wide why should i see him tis madam wants him not me to the astonishment of both the girls betty burst out crying betty i am sure something has happened said phoebe springing up what is the matter o my dear madams gone sobbed betty poor dear gentlewoman shell never see anybody again mrs rhoda shes died in the night there was a moment of silent horror as the eyes of the cousins met then phoebe said under her breath that bell yes poor dear madam she rang her bell said betty but she could not speak when i got to her i dont think she was above ten minutes after ive sent off sharp for dr saunders and mr dawson too but tis too lateeh poor dear gentlewoman did you send for mr leighton asked rhoda in an awestruck voice oh dear yes i sent for him too but la what can he do answered betty wiping her eyes they all came in due order dr saunders to pronounce that madam had been dead three hoursof a cardial malady said he in a professionally mysterious manner mr leighton the vicar of tewkesbury to murmur a few platitudes about the virtues and charity to the poor which had distinguished the deceased lady and to express his firm conviction that so exalted a character would be at once enrolled among the angelic host even though she had not been so happy as to receive the holy sacrament mr dawson came last and his concern appeared to be awakened rather for the living than the dead sad business this said he as he entered the parlour where the cousins sat close together drawn to one another by the fellowship of suffering in a manner they had never been before sad business was to have seen me todayimportant matter humph the girls looked at him but neither spoke do you know he pursued apparently addressing himself to both how your grandmother had arranged her affairs no said rhoda and phoebe together humph pity been a good deal better for you my dear young gentlewoman if she had lived another fourandtwenty hours neither said which for both thought they knew poor phoebe said rhoda pressing her hand but never mind dear ill give it you just right what she meant you to have well see about it before im married oh dearthat will have to be put off i suppose you are going to be married asked the lawyer yes said rhoda bridling humphgood thing for you mr dawson marched to the window with his hands in his pockets and stood there softly whistling for some seconds got any money he abruptly inquired i no said rhoda no no your intended oh yesthree thousand a year humph mr dawson whistled again then making as if he meant to leave the room he suddenly brought up before phoebe are you going to be married no sir said phoebe blushing humph ejaculated the lawyer once again silence followed for a few seconds funeral on sunday i suppose read the will on monday morningeh yes if you please said rhoda who was very much subdued good wellgood morning poor girl the last words were in an undertone i am so sorry for it phoebe dear said rhoda who was always at her best under the pressure of trial but never you mindyou shall have it ill make it up to you rhoda now naturally assumed the responsibility of mistress and gave orders that no visitor should be admitted excepting the vicar and mr welles the evening brought the latter gentleman who had apparently spent the interval in arraying himself in faultless mourning i am so grieved my charmer exclaimed mr marcus welles dropping on one knee and lifting rhodas hand to his lips words cannot paint my distress on hearing of your sorrow had i been a bird i would have flown to offer you consolation pray do not dim your bright eyes my fair tis but what happens to all and specially in old age old folks must die you know dearest madam and after all did they not young folks would find them very often troublesome but you have now no one over you and you see your slave at your feet and with a most unexceptionable bow mr marcus gently possessed himself of rhodas fan wherewith he began fanning her in the most approved manner it occurred to phoebe that if the gentlemans grief had been really genuine it was doubtful whether his periods would have been quite so polished rhodas sorrow while it might prove evanescent was honest while it lasted and had been much increased by the extreme suddenness of the calamity i thank you sir she said quietly and i am sure you will be grieved to hear that my grandmother died just too soon to make that provision she intended for my cousin so the lawyer has told us this morning you will not i cannot but think oppose my wish to give her what it was meant that she should have dearest madam and mr welles hand went to his heart you cannot have so little confidence in me as to account it possible that i could oppose any wish of yours engaged persons did not at that time call each other by the christian name it would have been considered indecorous i was sure sir you would say no less answered rhoda chapter ten mr welles does it beautifully thy virtues lost thou wouldst not look me in thy chains to hold know friend thou verily hast lost thy chiefest virtuegold nine oclock on the monday morning was the hour appointed for reading madams will when rhoda and phoebe in their deep mourning entered the parlour they were startled to find the number of persons already assembled not only all the household and outdoor servants but all the inmates of the maidens lodge excepting mrs marcella and several others stood up to receive the young ladies as they passed on to the place reserved for them mr dawson handed the girls to their places and then seated himself at the table and proceeded to unfold a large parchment it will be well that i should remark said he looking up over his spectacles that the late madam furnival had intended at the time of her death to execute a fresh will i am sorry to say it was not signed this therefore is her last will as duly executed it bears date the fourteenth of november in the year an ejaculation of dismay though under her breath came from rhoda the lawyer went on when mrs catherine peveril mother of mrs rhoda here was just married and before the marriage of mrs anne furnival mother to mrs phoebe latrobe who is also present the intended will would have made provision for both of these young gentlewomen granddaughters to madam furnival by the provisions of the present one one of them is worsened and the other bettered rhodas alarm was over the last sentence reassured her mr dawson cleared his voice and began to read the will commenced with the preamble then usual in which the testatrix declared her religious views as a member of the church of england and went on to state that she wished to be buried with her ancestors in the family vault in the nave of tewkesbury abbey one hundred pounds was bequeathed to the vicar of tewkesbury for the time being twenty pounds and a suit of mourning to every servant who should have been in her employ for five years at the date of her death six months wages to those who should have been with her for a shorter time a piece of black satin sufficient to make a gown mantua and hood and forty pounds in money to each inmate of the maidens lodge mourning rings were left to the maidens the vicar dr saunders mr dawson and several friends mentioned by name of whom sir richard delawarr was one then the testatrix gave devised and bequeathed to her dear daughter catherine wife of francis peveril esquire with remainder to the heirs of her body the sum of two thousand pounds of lawful money rhodas face grew eager as she listened for the next sentence lastly i give devise and bequeath the abbey of cressingham commonly called whiteladies and all other my real and personal estate whatsoever not hereinbefore excepted to my dear daughter anne furnival her heirs assigns administrators and executors for ever the effect was crushing that one sentence had changed everything not rhoda but phoebe was the heiress of whiteladies mr dawson calmly finished reading the signatures and attestation clause and then folded up the will and once more looked over his spectacles mrs phoebe as your mothers representative give me leave to wish you joy shall you wish to write to her i must of course the letters could go together phoebe looked up halfbewildered i scarcely understand she said there is something left to mother is there not my dear young gentlewoman there is everything left to her she is the lady of the manor just what is there for rhoda gasped phoebe apparently not at all elated by her change of position a poor beggarly two thousand pounds burst out rhoda tis a shame and i always thought i was to have whiteladies i shall just be nobody now nobody will respect me and i can never cut any figure well im glad i am engaged to be married thats safe at any rate the elevation of mr dawsons eyebrows and the pursing of his lips might have implied a query on that score im so sorry dear said phoebe gently for you of course i mean i could not be sorry that there was something for mother because she is not well off but i am very sorry you are disappointed you cant help it was rhodas rather repelling answer still through all her anger she remembered to be just certainly not my dear mrs phoebe said the lawyer tis nobodys faultnot even madam furnivals for the new will would have given whiteladies to mrs rhoda and five thousand pounds to mrs anne latrobe undoubtedly she intended mrs rhoda you should have it then why cant i demanded rhoda fiercely mr dawson shook his head with a pitying smile the law knows nothing of intentions said he only of deeds fully performed still it may be a comfort in your disappointment to remember that this was meant for you thank you for your comfort said rhoda bitterly why it makes it all the worse i wish but phoebe stopped short oh i dont blame you said rhoda impetuously tis no fault of yours if shed done it now lately i might have thought so but a will that was made before either you or me was born rhodas grammar always suffered from her excitementcant be your fault nor anybody elses but tis a shame for all that shed no business to let me go on all these years expecting to have everything and knew all the while her will wasnt right made tis too bad my lady bettymrs dorothydont you think so my dear said lady betty i am indeed grieved for your disappointment but there is decorum my dear mrs rhodathere is decorum no my dear was mrs dorothys answer i dare not call anything bad that the lord doth had it been his will you should have whiteladies be sure you would have had it well you know said rhoda in a subdued tone and folding one of her black gauze ribbons into minute plaits of course one cant complain of god ah child sighed mrs dorothy i wish one could not o my dear mrs rhoda i feel for you so dreadfully accompanied the tragically clasped hands of mrs clarissa my feelings are so keen and run away with me so then let em said mrs jane talbots voice behind mine wont my dears im sorry youve lost madam but as to the money and that ill wait ten years and then ill tell you which im sorry for well im sorry for both of you added mrs eleanor darcy i dont think mrs phoebe my dear youll lie on roses no one was more certain of that than phoebe herself she wrote a few lines to her mother which went inside mr dawsons letter mrs latrobe was in service near reading her daughter felt sure that she would lose no time in taking possession the event proved that she was right the special messenger whom mr dawson sent with the letters returned with an answer to each phoebes mother wrote to her thus childmr dawson hath advertized me of the deth of madam furnivall my mother i would have you on rect of this to lett your cousen know that shee need not lieve the house afore i come wich will be as soon as euer i can winde all upp and bee wth you i would like to make aquaintance wth her ere anything be settled i here from the layer by which mrs latrobe meant lawyer that she is to be maried and it will be soe much ye better for you i trust you may now make a good match yrself but i shal see to all yt when i com yr mother a latrobe phoebe studied every word of this letter and the more she studied it the less she liked it first it looked as if mrs latrobe did mean rhoda to leave the house though she graciously intimated her intention of making acquaintance with her before she did so secondly she was evidently in a hurry to come thirdly she congratulated herself on rhodas approaching marriage because it would get rid of her and leave the way open for phoebe and lastly she threatened phoebe with a good match phoebe thought with a sigh that the time was out of joint and heartily wished that the stars would go back into their courses mrs latrobe managed to wind all up in a surprisingly short time she reached her early home in the cool of a summer evening rhoda having sent the family coach to meet her at tewkesbury phoebe had said nothing to her cousin of any approaching change which she thought it best to leave to her mother so she contented herself by saying that mrs latrobe wished to make the acquaintance of her niece lady betty kindly came up to help the inexperienced girls in making due preparation for the arrival of the lady of the manor when the coach rolled up to the front door phoebe was standing on the steps lady betty and rhoda further back in the hall mrs latrobe was attired in new and stylish mourning ah child here you are was her first greeting to phoebe the old place is grown greyer those trees come too near the windows i shall cut some of them down where is your cousin rhoda heard the inquiry and she stepped forward let us look at you child said mrs latrobe turning to her ah you are like kittynot so goodlooking though mother said phoebe gently this is my lady betty morehurst she was so kind as to help us in getting ready for you mrs latrobe appraised lady betty by means of one rapid glance then she thanked her with an amount of effulgence which betrayed either subservience or contempt lady betty received her thanks with a quiet dignity which refused to be ruffled kissed rhoda and phoebe and took her leave declining to remain even for the customary dish of tea mrs latrobe drew off her gloves sat down in madams cushioned chair and desired phoebe to give her some tea let me see child she said looking at rhoda you are near oneandtwenty i suppose rhoda admitted the fact and what do you think of doing rhoda looked blankly first at her aunt then at her cousin phoebe came hastily to the rescue she is shortly to be married mother did you forget ah said mrs latrobe still contemplating rhoda wellif it hold you may as well be married from hence i suppose is the day fixed no aunt anne i think my dear remarked mrs latrobe sipping her tea twould be better if you said madamwhy phoebe what oldfashioned china sure it cannot have been new these forty years i shall sweep away all that rubbishwhom are you going to marry is he well offphoebe those shoebuckles of yours are quite shabby i cannot have you wear such trumpery you must remember what is due to youwell my dear rhoda had much less practice in the school of patience than phoebe and she found the virtue difficult just then but she restrained herself as well as she could i am engaged in marriage with mr marcus welles and he has an estate and spends three thousand pounds by the year welles a welles of buckinghamshire his estate is in this shire said rhoda three thousand thats not much could you have done no better he expected you would have whiteladies i suppose i suppose so i did said rhoda shortly my dear you have some bad habits said mrs latrobe which phoebe should have broken you of before i came tis very rude to answer without giving a name you told me not to give you one aunt anne you are slow at catching meanings my dear replied mrs latrobe with that calm nonchalance so provoking to an angry person i desired you to call me madam as tis proper you should phoebe doesnt burst from rhoda then she ought answered mrs latrobe coolly examining the crest on a teaspoon oh i will rhoda if mother wishes it put in phoebe anxious above all things to keep the peace rhoda vouchsafed no reply to either well said the lady of the manor rising you will carry me to my chamber child addressing rhoda you can stay here phoebe your cousin will wait on me it was something new for rhoda to wait on anyone she swallowed her pride with the best grace she could and turned to open the door i suppose you have had the best room made ready for me inquired mrs latrobe as she passed out madams chamber replied rhoda oh butnot the one in which she died yes answered rhoda adding after a momentary struggle with herself madam oh but that will never do said mrs latrobe hastily i couldnt sleep there a room in which someone died scarce a month ago where is my woman call her i must have that changed rhoda summoned betty who came courtesying her mistress was too much preoccupied in mind to notice the civility why what could you all be thinking of to put me in this chamber i must have another this is the best i know but i cannot think of sleeping here show me the next bestthat long one in the south wing that is the young gentlewomens chamber madam objected betty well what does that matter demanded mrs latrobe sharply cant they have another i suppose i come first yes of course madam said subdued betty rhoda looked dismayed but kept silence she was learning her lesson mrs latrobe looked into the girls room rapidly decided on it and ordered it to be got ready for her then which must the young gentlewomen have madam inquired betty oh any said mrs latrobe carelessly there are enough which would you like mrs rhoda incautiously asked betty before rhoda could reply her aunt said quickly ask mrs phoebe if you please and betty remembered that the cousins had changed places it was a very bitter pill to rhoda and it was not like rhoda to sayyet she said it as soon as she had the opportunity phoebe aunt anne means you to choose our room please dont have a little stuffy one dear rhoda which would you like responded phoebe at once a little sob escaped rhoda oh phoebe you are going to be the only one who is good to me i should like that other long one in the north wing that matches ours but dont choose it if you dont like it we will have that said phoebe reassuringly at least if mother leaves it to me thus early it was made evident that the old nature in anne latrobe was scotched not killed sorrow seemed to have laid merely a repressive hand upon her bad qualities and to have uprooted none but good ones the brilliance and playfulness of her early days were gone the coeur leger had turned to careless selflove the impetuosity had become peevish obstinacy old madam never spoke to me in that way said betty she liked to have her way poor dear gentlewoman as well as anybody and she wouldnt take a bit of impudence like so much barleysugar ill not say she would but she was a gentlewoman every inch of her that she was and thats more than you can say for some folks the next morning all the maidensthe invalid as usual exceptedcame trooping up one after another to pay their respects to the new lady of the manor lady betty came first then mrs dorothy and mrs eleanor together after a little while mrs clarissa and lastly mrs jane my dear mrs anne i remember you well though perhaps you can scarce recollect me said mrs dorothy for you were but nine years old the last time that i saw you may the lord bless you my dear and make you a blessing oh i dont doubt i shall do my duty was the response of mrs latrobe which very much satisfied herself and greatly dissatisfied mrs dorothy tis delightful to see you back dear madam latrobe said mrs clarissa gushingly how touching must it be to return to the home of your youth after so many years of banishment mrs latrobe had not felt in the least touched and hardly knew how to reply oh to be sure she said glad to see you said mrs jane great loss weve had in madam hope youll be as good as she was my sister desired me to make her compliments cant stir off the sofa fine morning when the maidens left the abbeywhich they did togetherthey compared notes on the new reign lady bettys sense of decorum was very much shocked mrs latrobe had not spoken a word of her late mother and had hinted at changes in matters which had existed at whiteladies from time immemorial mrs clarissa was charmed with the new ladys manners and mourning both which she thought faultless mrs eleanor thought she was a bit shy poor thing we must make allowances my dear friendswe must make allowances make fiddlestrings growled mrs jane shes anne furnival still and shell be anne furnival to the end of the chapter as if i didnt know nancy ever drive a jibbing horse mrs clarissa who was thus suddenly appealed to declared in a shocked tone that she never drove a horse of any description since she was born ah well i have resumed mrs jane ignoring the scandalised tone of her sister maiden and thats just nancy furnival shes as sleek in the coat as ever a barbary mare but youll not get her along the road to tewkesbury without you make her think you want to drive her to gloucester i heard plenty of folks pitying madam when she bolted my wordbut i pitied somebody else a vast deal more and that was charles latrobe i wouldnt have married her if shed been stuck all over with diamonds i fancy she drove him said mrs eleanor with a smile like enough poor soul responded mrs jane only chance he had of any peace he was a decent fellow enough tooif only he had kept clear of nancy what made him marry her thoughtfully asked mrs eleanor deary me exclaimed mrs jane when did you ever see a man that could fathom a woman good simple soul that he wasshe made him think black was white with holding up a finger she glistened bravely and he thought she was gold wellwe shant have much peace now take my word for it eh this worldtis a queer place as ever i saw true my dear replied mrs dorothy let us therefore be thankful there is a better but her opinion of mrs latrobe was not given the same evening as phoebe sat in the parlour with her mother betty came in with a courtesy mr marcus welles to speak with madam with mrs rhoda asked phoebe rising i will go seek her no if you please mrs phoebe mr welles said madam or yourself phoebe my dear do not be such a fidfad entreated mrs latrobe if rhoda is wanted she can be soughtgood evening sir i am truly delighted to have the pleasure of seeing you and i trust we shall be better acquainted mr welles bowed low over mrs latrobes extended hand madam the delight is mine and the honour mrs phoebe your servantyour most humble servant it was the first time that mr welles had ever addressed phoebe with more than a careless good evening ready to serve you sir said she courtesying shall i seek my cousin she has wanted your company i think this was a very audacious speech for phoebe but she thought it so extraordinary that mr welles had not paid one visit to his betrothed since the funeral that she took the liberty of reminding him of it madam said mr welles with a complacent smile toying with his gold chatelaine i really could not have visited you sooner under the circumstances in which i found myself phoebe have you lost your senses inquired mrs latrobe sharply i am sure resumed mr marcus welles with an extremely graceful wave of his hand towards mrs latrobe that madam will fully enter into my much lacerated feelings and see how very distressing twould have been both to myself and her had i forced my company on mrs rhoda as matters stand at present phoebe sat listening with a face of utter bewilderment by what means had mr welles feelings been laceratedand why should it be more distressing for him to meet rhoda now than beforebut she kept silence and mrs latrobe said i think sir i have the honour to understand you madam replied mr marcus welles with his courtliest bow i am sure that a gentlewoman of your parts and discretion can do no less i cannot but be infinitely sensible of the severe and cruel loss i am about to sustain still to my small estate any other dealing would be of such mischievous consequence that i think myself obliged to resign the views i proposed to myself phoebe tried to understand him and found it impossible this being the case continued he you will understand dear madam that i thought myself engaged to wait until i might be honoured by some discourse with you and meanwhile to abstain from any commerce of discourse in other quarters till i had permission to acquaint you of the affair i have indeed been in pain until i was able to wait upon you i shall now be something eased you i am certain dearest madam will contrive the business far better than my disordered mind would allow me and i doubt not twould be more agreeable to all parties to communicate by that canal if you wish it sir it shall certainly be so answered mrs latrobe who seemed to be under no doubt concerning mr welles meaning i am yours to serve you in the matter dearest madam you are an angel of mercy the sooner i retire then the better he kissed mrs latrobes hand and came round to phoebe mr welles you have not seen rhoda yet i do not understand said phoebe blankly as he bowed iver her hand madam i have but just now engaged myself phoebe dont be a goose burst from her mother you must be a baby if you do not understand cannot you see that mr welles in a most honourable manner which does him infinite credit withdraws all pretensions to your cousins hand leaving her free to engage herself elsewhere really i should have thought you had sense enough for that for a moment phoebe looked with a bewildered air from her mother to mr welles then shyness fear and reserve gave way before indignation she did understand now you mean to desert rhoda because she has lost the paltry money that you expected she would have for once in his life mr marcus welles seemed startled and taken at a disadvantage i was afraid you wanted her chiefly for her money but i did not believe you capable of this so you do not care for her at all and you run away afraid to face the pangs you have created and to meet the eyes of the maid you have so foully wronged shame on you phoebe you must be mad exclaimed mrs latrobe rising dont listen to her dear mr welles tis a most distressing scene for you to bear i am infinitely concerned my daughter should have so far forgotten herself as to address you with such vulgar abuse i can only excuse her on the ground dearest madam there is every excuse said mr welles with the sweetest magnanimity sweet mrs phoebe is a woodland bird untrammelled as yet by those fetters which we men and women of the world must needs bear tis truly delightful to see the charming generosity and the admirable fire with which she plays the knighterrant indeed madam such disinterested warmth and fervour of heart are seen but too seldom in this worn old world suffer me to entreat you not to chide mrs phoebe for her charming simplicity and high spirit since mr welles condescends to intercede for you phoebe notwithstanding your shocking behaviour i am willing to overlook it this time but i warn you i shall not prove thus easy another time i am sure i hope there will never be another time cried phoebe her eyes flashing phoebe go to your chamber and dont let me hear one word more said mrs latrobe severely and phoebe obeyed rushing upstairs with feet that seemed to keep pace with the whirlwind in her heart phoebe i wonder whether of these ribbons the silk or the gauze would go best with why whatever in the world is the matter said rhoda breaking off you may well ask my dear answered the voice of mrs latrobe behind phoebe your cousin has been conducting herself in a most improper manneroffering gross insults to my guests in my house phoebe cried rhoda as if she could not believe her ears yes phoebe she really has i can only fearindeed i had almost said hopethat her wits are something impaired what think you of her telling a gentleman who had acted in a most noble and honourable mannerexactly as a gentleman should dothat she could not have believed him capable of such baseness and she cried shame on him not phoebe exclaimed rhoda again looking from one to the other very much as phoebe had done why phoebe what does all this mean oh rhoda i cant tell you said phoebe sobbing for the reaction had come mother you will have to tell her i cant of course i shall tell her calmly answered mrs latrobe i came for that very thing rhoda my dear i am sure you are a maid of sense and discretion i hope so madam so do i child and therefore you will hear me calmly and not fly into passions like that silly maid yonder my dear you must have remembered i am certain that when you promised yourself to mr welles you were in a very different situation from now rhoda only bowed perhaps on that subject she was afraid to trust her voice and of course it has also occurred to you my dear that this being the case you could not in honour hold mr welles bound to you any longer if he wished to be free but we dont wish to be free said rhoda in a puzzled tone you are mistaken my dear so far as one of you is concerned perhaps it had been yet more graceful had you been the one to loose the bond yet mr welles has done it with so infinite a grace and spirit that i can scarce regret your omission my dear you are now entirely free he sets you completely at liberty and has retired from all pretension to you but what aunt annei do not understand you exclaimed rhoda in accents of bewildered amazement which had a ring of agony beneath as though she was struggling against the comprehension of a grief she was reluctant to face surely my dear you must have understood me said mrs latrobe mr welles resigns his suit to you he has given me up bursts from rhodas lips he has entirely given you up you cannot have really expected anything else i thought he was true said rhoda through her set teeth are you sure you understood him phoebe you tell medid he mean that o rhoda poor rhoda i am afraid he did said phoebe as distinctly as tears would let her but my dear interposed mrs latrobe remonstratingly surely you cannot be surprised when mr welles engaged himself to you it was as he thought to the heiress of a large estate you could not expect him to encumber himself with a wife who brought him less than one years income of his own tis not reasonable child no man in his senses would do such a thing we live in the world my dearnot in utopia we live in a hard cold wicked miserable world and the sooner we are out of it the better came in a constrained voice from rhoda i beg my dear answered mrs latrobe you will not make extravagant speeches there might be not another man in the world that you should go into such a frenzy we shall yet find you a husband never fear not one like him i hope murmured phoebe and i dont think rhoda wants anybody else phoebe said her mother i am extreme concerned at the coarseness of your speeches i had hoped you were a gentlewoman well mother said phoebe firing up again if mr welles be a gentleman i almost hope not my dear said mrs latrobe mr welles is a gentleman the style in which he announced his desire to withdraw from his suit to your cousin was perfect a prince could not have done it better i should hope a prince would not have done it at all was the blunt response from phoebe you are not a woman of the world my dear but a very foolish ignorant child that does not know properly what she is saying tis so near bedtime you need not descend again you will get over your disappointment rhoda when you have slept and i shall talk with you presently goodnight my dears and mrs latrobe closed the door and left the cousins together chapter eleven phoebe in a new character we mend broken china torn lace we repair but we sell broken hearts cheap in vanity fair did she ever love anybody came in a low voice from rhoda when mrs latrobe had withdrawn oh i dont know sobbed phoebe who was crying violently and might have seemed to a surface observer the more unhappy of the two dont weep so said rhoda im sure you dont need aunt anne will never be angry longshe does not care enough about anything to keep it up oh it is not for myself rhodapoor rhoda for me surely not phoebe i have never been so good to you as to warrant that i dont know whether you have been good to me or you have not cousin but i am so sorry for you phoebe was kneeling beside the bed rhoda came over to her and kissed her forehead and saidwhat was very much for rhoda to sayi scarce think i deserve you should weep for me phoebe but i cant help it said phoebe well i reckon i should have known it said rhoda in a rather hard tone i suppose that is what all men are like but i did think he was truei did i never did responded phoebe well sighed rhoda again let it pass perhaps mrs dorothy is righttis best to trust none of them i dont think mrs dorothy said that replied phoebe heaving a long sigh as she sat up and pushed back her ruffled hair i do hope i wasnt rude to mother nothing shell care about said rhoda i wondered he did not come phoebe so did i and i told him as much butrhoda i think perhaps we shall forgive him sooner if we dont talk about it ah i have not come to forgiving yet was rhodas answer perhaps i shall some time well i shall be an old maid now phoebe like mrs dorothy i suppose youll be the one to marry thank you id rather not said phoebe quickly i am not sure i should like it at all and i am quite sure i dont want to be married for my money or for what people expect me to have oh theres nothing else in this world answered rhoda with an air of immense experience dont you expect it every man you come across is an avaricious designing creature oh dear tis a weary weary world and tis no good living yes rhoda dear there is one good in living and tis always left to us whatever we may lose said phoebe earnestly dont you remember what the lord jesus said to his disciplesmy meat is to do the will of him that sent me there is always that rhoda ah that is something i dont know anything about said rhoda wearily and i always think tis right down shabby of people to turn religious just because they have lost the world and are disappointed and tired and i was never cut out for a saint phoebetis no use rhoda dear when people give all their days to satan and then turn religious as you say just at last when they are going to die or think they aredont you think that right down shabby the longer you keep away from god the less you have to give him when you come and as i thought you puritans always said we hadnt anything to give to god but he gave everything to us objected rhoda pettishly phoebe passed the tone by and answered the words i think there are two things we can give to god cousin our sins that he may cast them into the depths of the sea and ourselves that he may save and train us and the longer you stay away the more sin you will have to bring and the less time there will be for loving and serving him you will be sorry when you do come that you were not sooner how do you know i shall i tell you i wasnt cut out for a saint i think you will cousin because i have asked him to bring you said phoebe simply and it must be his will to hear that because he willeth not the death of a sinner so you count me a sinner i am sure im very much obliged to you said rhoda more in her old style than before yes dear cousin i count you a sinner and so do i myself and every body else said phoebe gently oh well i suppose we are all sinners admitted rhoda dont i keep telling you i am not made for a saint but you were rhoda god made you for himself said phoebe oh well tis no use talking and rhoda got up and began to pull down her elaboratelydressed hair with hasty uncareful fingers wed better go to bed perhaps it isnt much use talking said phoebe as she rose to help her but it is sure to be some praying so i shall go on it was a few days later and phoebe was crossing the park on her way to the maidens lodge carrying a basket of fruit sent by mrs latrobe to lady betty from all the maidens except lady betty mrs latrobe held aloof mrs jane was too sharp for her mrs marcella too querulous and mrs dorothy too dull mrs clarissa she denounced as poor vain flirt that could not see her time was passed and mrs eleanor she declared gave her the horrors only to look at but lady betty she diligently cultivated how much of her regard was due to her ladyships title mrs latrobe did not explain phoebe was nearing the maidens lodge and had just entered the last glade on her way thither whenvery much to her disapprobation and dismayfrom a belt of trees on her left hand mr marcus welles stepped out and stood before her your most humble servant mrs phoebe i was very desirous to have the honour of waiting on you this fine morning and thinking that i saw you at a little distance i took the great liberty of accosting you if phoebe had said just what she thought she would have informed mr welles that he had taken a wholly unwarrantable liberty in so doing for while she sagely counselled rhoda to forgive the offender she had by no means forgiven him herself but being mindful of conventionalities phoebe courtesied stiffly and left mr welles to explain himself at his leisure now mr welles had come to that glade in the park for the special purpose of making a communication which he felt rather an awkward one to make with that amount of grace which beseemed him nevertheless being a very adroit young man and much given to turning corners in a rapid and elegant manner he determined to go through with the matter if it had only been anyone but phoebe mrs phoebe he began i cannot but flatter myself that you are not wholly ignorant of the high esteem i have long had for your deep merit cannot you sir responded phoebe by no means in a promising manner mr welles felt the manner he thought his web was scarcely finespun enough he must begin again i trust that madam is in good health mrs phoebe my mother is very well i thank you sir you are yourself in good health i venture to hope madam i am sir i thank you the task which mr welles had set himself as he perceived with chagrin was proving harder than he had anticipated phoebe evidently intended to waste no more time on him than she could help the state of affairs at whiteladies is of infinite concern to me madam is it sir undoubtedly madam your health and happinessall of youare extreme dear to me really sir especially yours madam phoebe made no answer to this her silence encouraged mr welles to proceed he thought his tactics had succeeded and the creature was coming round by degrees the only point now requiring care was not to startle her away again allow me to assure you madam that your welfare is in my eyes a matter of infinite concern so you said sir was phoebes cool reply mr welles was very uncomfortable had he made any mistake was it possible that after all the creature was not coming round in an orthodox manner madam give me leave to assure you moreover that i am infinitely attached to you and desire no higher happiness than to be permitted to offer you my service it was an instant before phoebe recognised that mr marcus welles was actually making her an offer when she did her answer was immediate and unmistakable dont you mr welles said phoebe then i do madam have you misapprehended me demanded her suitor to whom the idea of any woman refusing him was an impossibility not to be entertained for a moment i should be glad if i had said phoebe you must be labouring under some mistake madam i have an estate which brings me in three thousand a year and i am my own master tis not an opportunity a maid can look to meet with every day nor is it every gentlewoman that i would ask to be my wife noonly a golden one said phoebe madam phoebe turned and their eyes met mr welles give me leave to tell you the truth you do not hear it often you do not wish to marry me you wish to obtain whiteladies tis of no consequence to you whether the woman that must needs come with it be phoebe latrobe or rhoda peveril my cousin would please you better than i but you really care not a straw for either of us you only want the estate allow me in my turn to assure you that so far as i am concerned you will not get it the man who could use my cousin as you have done may keep away from endeavouring my favour i wish you a very good morning mr welles i beg madam that you will permit me to explain stammered mr welles whose grace and tactics alike forsook him under the treatment to which he was subjected by phoebe sir there is nothing to explain and with a courtesy which could be construed into nothing but final dismissal phoebe left her astonished suitor to stand and look after her with the air of a beaten general while she turned the corner of the maidens lodge and made her way to lady bettys door lady betty was at that moment giving an at home on the very minute scale permitted by the diminutive appointments of the maidens lodge mrs jane talbot and mrs dorothy jennings were seated at her little teatable why my dear mrs phoebe what an unlookedfor pleasure exclaimed lady betty coming forward cordially if her cordiality had been a shade more distinct since phoebe became heiress of cressinghamwell she was only human the other ladies present had sustained no such change the lord bless thee dear child was the warm greeting of mrs dolly but it had been quite as warm long before evening said mrs jane with a sarcastic grin got it over has he saw you through the side window bless you child i know all about iti expected that all along hope you let him catch itthe jackanapes i did not let him catch me mrs jane answered phoebe with some dignity thats right said mrs jane decidedly that bundle of velvet and braid would never have made any way with me when i was your age my dear why any mantuamaker could cut him out of snips and have some stuff left over he is of very good family my dear mrs jane observed lady betty at least if i take you rightly in supposing you allude to mr welles more pity for the family answered mrs jane glad im not his mother ruin me to keep him in order cost a fortune in whipleather hows mrs rhoda she is very well i thank you madam is she crying out her eyes over that piece of fiddlefaddle i think she has finished for the present replied phoebe rather drily just you tell her hes been making up to you best thing you can do cure her sooner than anything else mrs phoebe my dear may i beg of you to do me the favour to let madam know that my niece my lady delawarr is much disordered in her health certainly my lady betty i am grieved to hear it very much so as tis feared and sir richard hath asked me thither to visit her and see after matters a little while she is laid by i purpose to go thither this next week but i would not do so without paying my respects to madam for which honour i trust to wait on her tomorrow indeed my dearand if you will mention it to madam you will do me a servicesir richards letter is not without some importunity that should my niece be laid aside for any time as her physician fears i would remove altogether and make my home with them indeed madam i will tell my mother all about it i thank you my dear twill be a kindness of course i would not like to leave without madams concurrence that you will have quietly said mrs dorothy indeed so i hope returned lady betty i dare say mrs phoebe here at least does not know that when my nephew sir richard was young after his mother diedmy poor sister penelopehe was bred up wholly in my care so that he looks on me rather as his mother than his aunt and tis but natural that his thoughts should turn to me in this trouble you must have been a young aunt my lady betty remarked mrs dorothy truly but twelve years elder than my nephew said lady betty with a smile clarissa would have told us that without waiting to be asked laughed mrs jane how are the girls my lady betty very well as i hear you know i guess that betty is engaged in marriage so we heard to sir charles rich is it not the same but maybe you have not heard of mollys conquest asked lady betty with an amused little laugh what is mrs molly in any bodys chains indeed i guess not mrs jane replied lady betty still laughing i expect my friend mr thomas mainwaring is in mollys chains if chains there be eh shell lead him a weary life said mrs jane let us hope she will sober down answered lady betty i am not unwilling to allow there hath of late been room for improvement yet is there some good in molly as i think phoebe remembered mollys assistance in the matter of mr edmundson and thought it might be so well and what of mrs gatty ah poor maid she at least can scarce hope to be happy her disfigurement is so unfortunate i must needs ask your pardon my lady betty but i trust that is not the case said mrs dorothy with a gentle smile sure happiness doth not depend on face nor figure the world mostly reckons so i believe answered lady betty with a responsive smile maybe we pick up such words and use them in something too heedless a manner i am mightily mistaken if mrs gatty do not prove the happiest of the three was mrs dorothys reply mrs dorothy rose to go home and phoebe took leave at the same time she felt tired and harassed and longed for the rest of a little quiet talk with her old friend and how doth mrs rhoda take this my dear was the old ladys first question when phoebe had poured out her story she seemed very much troubled at first and angry but i fancy she is getting over it now which mosttroubled or angry i thinkafter a few minutes at leastmore angry then she will quickly recover i do not think she loved him phoebe she liked him i have no doubt and she flattered herself that he loved her but if she be more angry than hurt that shows that her pride suffers rather than her love at least said mrs dorothy correcting herself i mean it looks so who am i that i should judge her i wanted it to do her some good mrs dolly it seems hard to have the suffering and not get the good tis not easy for men to tell what does good and when we cannot as concerns ourselves how then shall we judge for others i wonder what rhoda will do now suggested phoebe after a minutes silence she looked up and saw an expression which was the mixture of pity and amusement on mrs dorothys lips the amusement died away but the pity remained and grew deeper can you guess mrs dolly lord and what shall this man do you know the answer phoebe yes i know but mrs dorothy would you not like to know the future certainly not dear child i am very thankful for the mist which my father hath cast as a veil over my eyes but if you could see what would come is it not very likely that there would not be some things which you would be glad and relieved to find absent very likely the things of which we stand especially in fear often fail to come at all but there would be other things which i should be very sorry to find and much astonished too i wonder sometimes what will be in my life said phoebe dreamily that which thou needest was the quiet answer what do i need asked phoebe to have thy will moulded after gods will do you think i dont wish gods will to be done mrs dorothy mrs dorothy smiled i quite believe dear child thou art willing he should have his way with respect to all the things thou dost not care about mrs dorothy my dear that is what most folks call being resigned to the will of god mrs dolly why do people always talk as though gods will must be something dreadful if somebody die or if some accident happen they say ah tis gods will and we must submit but when something pleasant comes they never say it then dont you think the pleasant things are gods will as well as the disagreeable ones more so phoebe in all our affliction he is afflicted he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men pleasant things are what he loves to give us bitter things what he needs must then why do people talk so repeated phoebe ah why do they said mrs dorothy man is always wronging god not one of us all is so cruelly misunderstood of his fellows as all of us misunderstand him yet he forgives said phoebe softly and sometimes we dont he is always forgiving phoebe the inscription is graven not less over the throne in heaven than over the cross on earththis man receiveth sinners there was a pause of some minutes and as phoebe rose to go mrs dorothy said i will tell you one thing i have noted child as i have gone through life very often there has been something looming as it were before me that i had to do or thought i should have to bearand in the distance and the darkness it took a dread shape and i looked forward to it with terror and when it has come at last it has ofteni say not always but oftenproved to be at times a light and easy cross even at times an absolute pleasure again there hath often been something in the future that i have looked forward to as a great good and delight which on its coming hath turned out a positive pain and evil tis better we should not know the future dear phoebe our father knows every step of the way is not that enough our elder brother hath trodden every step and will go with us through the wilderness perfect wisdom and perfect love have prepared all things ah child thy fathers were wise men to sing as they sang mon sort nest pas a plaindre il est a desirer je nai plus rien a craindre car dieu est mon berger but mrs dolly i suppose it cant be so yetit does seem as if there were some things in life which the lord jesus did not go through what things my dear well we never read of his having any kind of sickness for one thing are you sure of that himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses looks very like the opposite you and i have no idea phoebe how he spent thirty out of thirtythree years of his mortal life he maymind i dont say it was so for i dont knowbut he may have spent much of them in a sick chamber he was in all points tempted like as we are my father used to tell me that the word there rendered tempted signifies not only temptations of satan but trials sent of god buthe was never a woman mrs dolly and therefore cannot feel for a woman as though he had beenis that thy meaning dear nay phoebe i believe he was the only creature that ever dwelt on earth in whom were the essential elements both of man and woman he took his flesh of the woman only the best part of each was in himthe strength and intelligence of the man the love and tenderness of the woman tis modish to say women are tender phoebe more modish than true many are soft but few are tender but he was tenderness itself i dont think women always are tender said phoebe my dear said mrs dorothy you may laugh at me but i am very much out of conceit with my own sex a good woman is a very precious thing phoebe the rather since tis so rare but an empty foolish frivolous woman is a sad sad sight to see methinks i could scarce bear with such but for four words that i see as it were graven on their browsfor whom christ died very good said mrs latrobe i will not conceal from you phoebe that i am extreme gratified with this decision of lady betty i trust she will carry it out phoebe felt a good deal surprised lady betty had been the only inmate of the lodge whose society her mother had apparently cared to cultivate and yet she expressed herself much pleased to hear of her probable departure she remembered too that mrs dorothy had expected mrs latrobes assent to herself it was a mystery mrs latrobe gave no explanation at the time she went at once to another part of the subject informing phoebe that she had asked betty and molly delawarr on a visit gatty had been invited also but had declined to leave her mother in her present condition phoebe received this news with some trepidation had it been betty alone she would not have minded for she thought her very goodnatured and could not understand rhodas expressed dislike to her but mollyphoebe tried to remember that molly had done one kind action and hoped she would be on her best behaviour at whiteladies mrs latrobe went on to say that she wished phoebe to share her room with betty and would put rhoda and molly in another but when phoebe ventured to ask if rhoda might not retain the room which she knew her to prefer and phoebe herself be the one to change mrs latrobe refused to entertain the proposition no my dear certainly not you forget your station phoebe you are the daughter of this house not your cousin you must not be thinking of how things were they have changed i could not think of allowing rhoda to have the best chamber besides she has got to come down and she had best know it at once what do you mean madam if you please what do i mean why surely you have some sense of what is proper you dont fancy she could continue to live here do you if she had married mr welles i should have said nothing against her staying here till her marriageof course if it were a reasonable time but now that is all over she must go go gasped phoebe go whither madam i shall offer her the choice of two things my clear she can either go to service in which case i will not refuse to take the trouble to look out a service for heri am wishful to let her down gently and be very good to her or if she prefer that she may have my lady bettys house as soon as she is gone have you any idea which she will choose service the maidens lodge rhoda my dear phoebe how very absurd you are what do you mean by such foolish ejaculations rhoda will be uncommonly well off you forget she has the interest of her money and she has some good jewellery she may make a decent match yet if she is wise but in the meantime she must live somehow of course i could not keep her hereit would spoil your prospects simpleton she has a better figure than you and she has more to say for herself you must not expect any body to look at you while she is here oh never mind that came from the depth of phoebes heart but my dear i do mind it i must mind it you do not understand these things phoebe why i do believe with a very little encouragementwhich i mean him to havemr welles himself would offer for you that is over madam what is over phoebe what do you mean has mr welles really spoken to you yes madam when my dear asked mrs latrobe in a tone of deep interest this afternoon madam that is right i am so pleased i was afraid he would want a good deal of management and youve no more notion how to manage a man than that parrot i should have to do it all myself i beg your pardon madam said phoebe with some dignity i gave him an answer of course you did my dear i am only afraidsometimes my dear phoebe you let your shyness get the better of you till you seem quite sillyi am afraid i say that you would hardly speak with becoming warmth still i think madam i was as warm as you would have wished me said phoebe drily oh of course there is a limit my dear said mrs latrobe bridling well i am so glad that it is settled tis just what i was wishing for you i fear madam you misconceive me said phoebe looking up and tis settled the other way from what you wished child what can you mean asked mrs latrobe with sudden sharpness you never can have refused such an excellent offer what did you say to mr welles i sent him away and told him never to come near me again phoebe spoke with warmth enough now phoebe you must be a lunatic burst from her mother i could not have believed you would be guilty of such supreme unpardonable folly sure said phoebe looking up you would never have had me marry a man whom i despised in my heart despised i protest phoebe you are worse and worse what do you mean by saying you despise mr welles a man of excellent manners and faultless taste of good family with an estate of three thousand a year and admirable prospects when his old uncle dies who is nearly seventy nowwhy phoebe you must be a perfect fool i am amazed at you beyond words there was a light in phoebes eyes which was beyond mrs latrobes comprehension mother came from the girls lips with a soft intonationfather would not have asked me to do that really my dear if you expect that i am to rule myself by your fathers notions you expect a great deal too much he was not a man of the world at all he was not not in the leastand he had not the faintest idea what would be required of you when you came to your present position dont quote him i beg of youwell really phoebei dont know what to do now i wish i had known of it still i dont see if he were determined to speak to you how i could have prevented you from making such a goose of yourself i do wish he had asked me i should have accepted him at once for you and not given you the chance to refuse what did you say to him is it quite hopeless to try and win him back quite said phoebe shortly but i want to know exactly what you said i told him i believed he wanted the estate and not me and that after behaving to my cousin as he did he did not need to expect to get either it or me phoebe what preposterous folly said mrs latrobe well child you are a foolthats as plain as a pikestaff but youre a fool came in a screech from the parrots cage followed by a burst of laughter but tis no use crying over spilt milk if we have lost mr welles we have lost him and we must try for some one else oh dear how hot it is phoebe i wonder when you will have any sense i do beseech you my dear never to play the same game with anyone else i hope mother said phoebe gravely that i shall never have occasion what a lot of geese said the parrot chapter twelve ends in the maidens lodge mother mother up in heaven stand up on the jasper sea and be witness i have given all the gifts required of me elizabeth barrett browning before these young gentlewomen come rhoda i want a word with you yes madam i am sure my dear that you have too much wit to object to what i am about to say rhoda had learned to dread this beginning as it was generally the prelude to something disagreeable but she was learning also to submit to disagreeable things she only said meekly yes madam i suppose my dear you will have felt like a maid of some parts and spirit as you are that your dwelling any longer with me and phoebe in this house would not be proper not be proper rhodas cheek blanched she had never recognised anything of the kind was she not only to lose her fortune but to be turned out of her home when would her calamities come to an end not proper aunt annewhy not this was not altogether an easy question to answer with any reason but the real one which last must not be told to rhoda mrs latrobe put on an air of injured astonishment my dearsure you would not have me tell you that no noyour own good parts i am certain must have assured you now rhoda i wish so far as is possible to spare you all mortification if you consider that it would be easier to you to support your altered fortunes elsewhere i am very willing to put myself to some trouble to obtain for you a suitable service or if on the other hand you have not this sensibility then my lady bettys cottage is at your disposal when she leaves it the time that these young gentlewomen are here will be enough to think over the matter when they go i shall expect your answer had phoebe wished to tell out to rhoda a recompense of distress equivalent to every annoyance which she had ever received from her she could have wished for no revenge superior to that of this moment for her who had all her life until lately looked forward to dispensing her favours as the queen of cressingham to be offered apartments in the maidens lodge as an indigent gentlewoman was in her eyes about the last insult and degradation which could be inflicted on her she went white and red by turns she took up the hem of her apron and began to plait it in folds with as much diligence as though it had been a matter of serious importance that there should be a given number of plaits to an inch and all of the same width to a thread still she did not speak mrs latrobe required no words to inform her of what was passing in rhodas mind but she forestalled any words which might have come by an affectation of misunderstanding her you see my dear rhoda she said in a wouldbe affectionate tone i am bound to do all i can for my only sisters only child i would not do you so much injury as to suppose you insensible to the kindness i have shown you indeed if you had been something younger and had wished to learn any trade i would willingly have paid the premium with you and tis no slight matter i can assure you eighty pounds would have been the least for which i could have put you with a milliner or mantuamaker to learn her trade but however tis no good talking of that for you are a good nine years too old so there is nothing before you but service without you marry or to take my lady bettys house now my dear you may go and divert yourself we will not talk of this matter again till the young gentlewomen have ended their visit and with a nod of dismissal mrs latrobe rose and passed out of the room evidently considering her duties exceeded by her merits and leaving rhoda too stunned for words trade indeed if there could be a deeper depth than the maidens lodge it was trade in rhodas eyes domestic service was incomparably more respectable and honourable as to matrimony which her aunt had as it were flung into the scales as she passed rhodas heart was still too sore to think of it an hour later brought betty and molly how do you rhoda dear inquired the former kindly wellgot over it red currants interrogated molly over what i beg said rhoda rather haughtily molly sang her answer i lost my looks i lost my health i lost my witmy love kept true but one fine day i lost my wealth and presto off my lover flew isnt that about it old tadpole yours hasnt retorted rhoda carrying the attack into the enemys country no i havent lost my wealth yet said molly gravely for her who told you whispered phoebe o gemini isnt that a good jest responded molly not at all in a whisper who told mejust as if three hundred and sixtyfive people hadnt told me told me more jokes than one too mrs phoebe latrobe told me how you sent off master marcus with all the starch washed out of him gotup marcus in the rough dryo gemini and molly almost shrieked with laughter poor wretch hasnt had the heart to powder himself since and she told him to his face he wanted the guineasoh how jolly wouldnt i have given a pretty penny to see his face phoebe youre tiptop what on earth are you talking about asked rhoda with something of her old sharp manner talking about your true and constant lover my charmer said molly his heart was broken to bits by losingyour money so he picked up the pieces and pasted them together and offered the pretty little thing to your cousin as the nearest person to you but she o cruel creature instead of giving him an etiquet of admission to her heart what does she but come down on the wretchs corns with a blunderbuss and crush his poor pasted heart into dust really molly my dear said betty laughing does a mans heart lie in his corns if you wish to know mrs betty delawarr the conclusions to which i have come on that subject replied molly in her gravest mock manner they are these most men havent any hearts they have pretty little ornaments made of french paste which do instead they get smashed about once in six months then they are pasted up and nobody ever knows the difference there isnt much when tis nicely done pray molly how many women have hearts not one among em present company excepted oh molly molly said betty still laughing i thank you in the name of present company added rhoda but there was a glitter in her eyes which was not mirth now red gooseberries rather sour just now you listen to me said molly if you have got a heart leave that to you dont you let it waste away for that piece of flummery theres osmund derwent breaking his for you and i believe he has one take himyoull never do better and if i tell you lies for the rest of my life ive spoken truth this timenow fib arent you going to show such distinguished visitors into the parlour oh i beg your pardon exclaimed phoebe i was listening to you madam i thank you for the compliment and with a low courtesy molly gave her sister a push before her into the presence of mrs latrobe phoebe come here cried rhoda in a hoarse whisper drawing her cousin aside into one of the deep recessed windows of the old hall once the refectory of the abbey tell me did marcus welles offer to you yes said phoebe and said no more and you refused him why rhoda dear yes of course not for my sake i hope phoebe i would not marry him now if he came with his hat full of diamonds make your mind easy dear i never would have done do you know phoebe aunt anne has offered to put me in the maidens lodge she talked of it said phoebe pitifully i am not going there responded rhoda in a decisive tone ill go to service first perhaps i can come down so much away from here but to do it here where i thought to be mistressno i could not stand that phoebe i am sorry you have to stand any of it dear rhoda you are a good little thing fib i could not bear you to pity me if you were not if aunt anne had but half your phoebe where are you really my dear i am quite shocked at your negligence carry the young gentlewomen up to their chambers and let rhoda wait on them i take it extreme ill you should have left them so long do my dear remember your position remember her position phoebe was beginning to wish heartily that she might now and then be permitted to forget it the four girls went upstairs together i say fib did you ever shoot a waterfall in a coble inquired molly phoebe felt safe in a negative because ive heard folks say who have that tis infinitely pleasant when you come alive out of it but then you see theres a little doubt about that i dont understand you mrs molly no my dear very like you dont well youll find out when youve shot em youre only a passenger no blame to you if you dont come out alive whos rowing molly asked rhoda somebody that isnt used to handling the oars said molly and if she dont get a hole stove inglad tis no concern of mine how does gatty now asked rhoda o she is very well i thank you replied betty is she promised yet dear no said betty in a pitying tone rank cruelty only to think on it said molly shell just come in as pat as vinegar to lettuce to keep you company in the maidens lodge my beloved rhoda rhodas lip trembled slightly but she asked quietly enough which is the vinegar molly stood for a moment with her head on one side contemplating rhoda been putting sugar to it fib havent you well tis mighty good stuff to cure a cough phoebe said her mother that evening when prayers were over i wish to speak with you in my chamber before you go to yours phoebe obeyed the order with a mixture of wonder and trepidation my dear i have good news for you i have chosen your husband mother pray why not my dear tis an ingenious young man reasonable handsome and very suitable for age and conditions i have not yet broke the matter to him but i cannot doubt of a favourable answer for he hath no fortune to speak of and is like to be the more manageable seeing all the money will come from you you met with him i believe at delawarr court his name is derwent i shall not write to him while these young gentlewomen are here but directly they are gone yet i wish to give you time to become used to it and i name it thus early phoebe felt any reply impossible goodnight my dear i am sure you will like mr dement phoebe went back along the gallery like one walking in a dream how was this tangled skein ever to be unravelled had she any right to speak had she any to keep silence and a cry of teach me to do thy will went up beyond the stars i dont know what is right said phoebe plaintively to her own heart lord thou knowest make thy way plain before my face it seemed to her that knowing what she did there would be one thing more terrible than a refusal from mr derwent and that would be acceptance it seemed impossible to pray for either she could only put the case into gods hands with the entreaty of hezekiah o lord i am oppressed undertake for me it did not make the matter any easier that a few days later rhoda said suddenly when she and phoebe were alone do you remember that mr derwent who was at delawarr court yes said phoebe and said no more betty tells me she thought he had a liking for me phoebe was silent would the actual question come i wonder if it was true said rhoda still phoebe went on knitting in silence with downcast eyes i almost begin phoebe to wish it had been do you know i liked him very well andi want somebody to care for me yes poor dear said phoebe rising hurriedly excuse me i must fetch more wool and she did not seem to hear rhoda call after her why phoebe heres your woola whole ball pretty kettle of fish screamed the parrot betty and molly had gone home mr onslow had read prayers the servants were filing out of the room and rhoda was lighting the candles well my dear asked mrs latrobe looking up rather suddenly is your decision taken it is madam readily answered her niece so much the better what is it my dear i should prefer to go to service if you please madam you would mrs latrobes tone showed surprise very well i promised you your choice as ladys woman i suppose if you please madam certainly my dear it shall be as you wish then tomorrow i will begin to look out for you i should think i shall hear of a place in a week or two rhoda made no answer but took up her candle and departed with merely goodnight madam but as phoebe went upstairs behind her she noted rhodas bowed head her hand tightly grasping the banisters her drowning farewell look at the family portraits as she passed them on her way up the corridor at length she paused before three which hung together in the midst stood their grandmother a handsome haughty figure taken at about the age of thirty and on either side a daughter at about eighteen years of age rhoda lifted her light first to madams face she said nothing to indicate her thoughts there but passed on and paused for another minute before the pretty sparkling face of anne latrobe then she came back and raised the light for a longer time than either to the pale regular unexpressive features of catherine peveril phoebe waited for her to speak it came at last i never knew her said rhoda in a choked voice i wonder if they know what is happening on earth i should not think so answered phoebe softly welli hope not the hand which held the lifted light came down and rhoda passed into her own room and at once knelt down to her prayers phoebe stood irresolute her heart beating like a hammer an idea had occurred to her which if it could be carried into effect would help rhoda out of all her trouble but in order to be so it was necessary that she herself must commitin her own eyesan act of unparalleled audacity could she do it the minute seemed an hour phoebe heard her mother go upstairs and shut her door a rapid prayer went to god for wisdom her resolution grew stronger she took up her candle stole softly downstairs found the silver inkstand and the box of perfumed letterpaper there were only a few words written when phoebe had done sirif you were now to come hither i thinke you woud win my cosen a verie few dayes may be too late forgive the liberty i take yours to serve you phoebe latrobe the letter was folded and directed to mr osmund derwent esquire and then for one minute human nature had its way and phoebes head was bowed over the folded note there was no one to see her and she let her heart relieve itself in tears ay there was one who took note of the selfabnegation which had been learned from him phoebe knew that osmund derwent did not love her yet was it the less hard on that account to resign him to rhoda for time and circumstances might have shown him the comparatively alloyed metal of the one and the pure gold of the other he might have loved phoebe even yet as matters stood now but phoebes love was true she was ready to secure his happiness at the cost of her own it was not of that false selfish kind which seeks merely its own happiness in the beloved one and will give him leave to be happy only in its own way yet after all phoebe was human and some very sorrowful tears were shed for a few minutes over that gift laid on the altar though the drops were salt they would not tarnish the gold it was but for a few minutes that phoebe dared to remain there she wiped her eyes and forced back her tears then she went upstairs and tapped at bettys door theres that worriting sue she heard betty say inside and then the door was opened mrs phoebe my dear i ask twenty pardons i thought twas that sukeyshe always comes aworriting what can i do for you my dear i want you to get that letter off first thing in the morning betty betty turned the letter all ways scanned the address and inspected the seal mrs phoebe youll not bear me malice i hope you know youre only young my dear are you quite certain youll never be sorry for this here letter tis not what you think betty said phoebe with a smile on her pale lips which had a good deal of sadness in it you are sorry for my cousin i know twill be a kind act towards her betty if you will send that letter betty looked into phoebes face so earnestly that she dropped her eyes i see said mrs latrobes maid im not quiet a blind bat mrs phoebe the letter shall go my dear make your mind easy yet betty did not see all there was to be seen why phoebe exclaimed rhoda when she got back to the bedroom where have you been downstairs what had you to go down for you forgot something i suppose but what is the matter with your eyes they burn a little tonight dear said phoebe quietly the days went on and there was no reply to phoebes audacious note and there was a reply to mrs latrobes situationhunting she announced to rhoda on the ninth morning at breakfast that she had heard of an excellent place for her lady kitty mainwaring the mother of molly delawarrs future husband was on the lookout for a woman she had three daughters the eldest of whom was the kitty who had been at delawarr court rhoda would have to wait on these young ladies as well as their mother it was a most eligible situation mrs latrobe on rhodas behalf had accepted it at once rhoda sat playing with her teaspoon and making careful efforts to balance it on the edge of her cup do they know who wants it she asked in a husky voice of course my dear you did not look i should make any secret of it sure rhodas colour grew deeper it was evident that she was engaged in a most severe struggle with herself she looked up at last very good aunt anne i will go to lady kitty she said my dear i accepted the place of course you will go returned mrs latrobe in a voice of some astonishment rhoda got out of the room at the earliest opportunity and phoebe followed her as soon as she could but she found her kneeling by her bed and stole away again was chastening working the peaceable fruit of righteousness in rhoda peveril phoebe wandered out into the park and bent her steps towards the ruins of the old church she sat down at the foot of saint ursulas image and tried to disentangle her bewildered thoughts had she made a mistake in sending that letter and did the lord intend rhoda to go to lady kitty mainwaring phoebe had been trying to lift her cousin out of trouble was it gods plan to plunge rhoda more deeply into it in order that she might learn her lesson the more thoroughly and be the more truly happy afterwards if so phoebe had made a stupid blunder when would she learn that god did not need her bungling help yet poor rhoda how miserable she was likely to be phoebe buried her face in her hands and did not see that some one had come in by a ruined window and was standing close beside her on the grass mrs phoebe i owe you thanks unutterable said a voice that phoebe knew only too well phoebe sprang up have you seen her mr derwent i have seen no one but you said he gravely they walked up to the house together but there phoebe left him and sought refuge in her bedchamber phoebe my dear are you here said mrs latrobe entering the room half an hour later child did you not hear me call i could not think where you were and i wished to have you come down why only thinkall is changed about rhoda and she will not go to lady kitty i am a little chagrined i confess on your account my dear however it may be all for the best tis that same mr derwent i had heard of and thought to obtain for you well i am very pleased for rhoda tis quite as good or better than any thing she could expect and i shall easily meet with something else for you so now my dear phoebe when she is married and all settledfor of course now i shall let her stay till she marriesthen child the coast will be clear for you by the way you did not care any thing for him i supposeand if you had you would soon have got over itall good girls do fetch me my knotting phoebetis above in my chamber or if you meet rhoda send her it was a subject of congratulation to phoebe that one of mrs latrobes peculiarities was to ask questions and assume without waiting for it that the answer was according to her wishes so she escaped a reply but there was one thing yet for phoebe to bear even worse than this phoebe dear dear phoebe i am so happy and rhoda twined her arms round her cousin and hid her bright face on phoebes shoulder he says he has loved me ever since we were at delawarr and i think i must have loved him just a little bit without knowing it or i could not love him so much all at once now i was trying very hard to make up my mind to lady kittys servicethat seemed to be what god had ordered for me and i did ask him phoebe to give me patience and make me willing to do his will and only thinkall the while he was preparing this for me and i dont think phoebe i should have cared for thatyou know what i meanbut for youthe patient loving way you bore with me and i havent been kind to you fibyou know i havent then i dare say the troubles ive had helped a little and mr derwent says he should not have dared to come but for a little letter that you writ him i owe you all my happinessmy dear good little fib was it all pain she had to bear phoebe gave thanks that night ten years had passed since madam furnivals death and over whiteladies was a cloudless summer day in the park under the care of a governess and nurse half a dozen children were playing and under a spreading tree on the lawn with a book in her hand sat a lady whose likeness to the children indicated her as their mother in two of the cottages of the maidens lodge that evening teaparties were the order of the day in number four mrs eleanor darcy was entertaining mrs marcella talbot and mrs clarissa vane mrs marcellas health had somewhat improved of late but her disposition had not sustained a corresponding change she was holding forth now to her two listeners on matters public and private to the great satisfaction of mrs clarissa but not altogether to that of mrs eleanor well so far as such a poor creature as i am can take any pleasure in any thing i am glad to see mrs derwent back at whiteladies mrs phoebe would never have kept up the place properly she hasnt her poor mothers spirit and working powernot a bit the place would just have gone to wreck if she had remained mistress there and i cannot but think she was sensible of it well for my part put in mrs clarissa i feel absolutely certain something must have come to light about madams will you knowwhich positively obliged mrs phoebe to give up everything to madam derwent tis monstrous to suppose that she would have done any such thing without being obliged i feel as sure as if i had seen it o my dear came in a gently deprecating tone from mrs eleanor oh i am positive repeated mrs clarissa whose mind possessed the odd power of forcing conviction on itself by simple familiarity with an idea everything discovers so many symptoms of it i cannot but be infinitely certain down pug down as cupids successor which was not a dog but a very small monkey endeavoured to jump into her lap well till i know the truth is otherwise i shall give mrs phoebe credit for all observed mrs eleanor indeed i apprehend clarissa has guessed rightly said mrs marcella fanning herself tis so unlikely you know for any one to do such a thing as this without it were either an obligation or a trick to win praise and i cant think thattis too much nay but surely there is some love and generosity left in the world urged mrs eleanor oh if you had had my experience my dear returned mrs marcella working her fan more vigorously you would know there were no such things to be looked for in this world ive looked for gratitude i can assure you till i am tired gratitude for what inquired mrs darcy rather pertinently oh for all the things one does for people you know they are never thankful for themnot one bit mrs darcy felt and looked rather puzzled during the fifty years of their acquaintance she never could remember to have seen marcella talbot do one disinterested kindness to any mortal being they take all you give them pursued the lastnamed lady and then they just go and slander you behind your back oh tis a miserable world thisfull of malice envy hatred and all uncharitableness as the prayerbook says the prayerbook does not exactly say that i think suggested mrs eleanor it asks that we ourselves may be preserved from such evil passions i am sure i wish people were preserved from them ejaculated mrs clarissa the uncharitableness and misunderstanding and unkind words that people will allow themselves to use tis perfectly heartrending to hear especially when one hears it of ones self responded mrs eleanor a little drily adding for she wished to give a turn to the conversation did you hear the news dr saunders was telling yesterday the czar of muscovy offers to treat with king george but as elector of hanover only what he has come thus far has he replied mrs marcella why tis but five or six years since he was ready to marry his daughter to the pretender could they but have come to terms sure king george will never accept of such a thing as that i should think not indeed added mrs clarissa well did he want a bit of sugar then pug held out his paw and very decidedly intimated that he did mrs leighton wants pug i shall give him to her observed his mistress tis not quite so modish to keep monkeys as it was i shall have a squirrel a bit more sugar asked mrs eleanor addressing the monkey poor pug next door but one in the cottage formerly occupied by lady betty morehurst were also seated three ladies at tea presiding at the table in mourning dress sat our old friend phoebe there was an expression of placid content upon her lips and a peaceful light in her eyes which showed that whatever else she might be she was not unhappy on her left sat mrs jane talbot a little older looking a little more sharp and angular and on the right apparently unchanged beyond a slight increase of infirmity little mrs dorothy jennings what a pure snug nice room have you here said mrs jane looking round tis very pleasant said phoebe and just what i like now my dear do you really mean to say you like thisbetter than whiteladies indeed i do mrs jane it may seem a strange thing to you but i could never feel at home at the abbey it all seemed too big and grand for a little thing like me well i dont know responded mrs jane in that tone which people use when they make that assertion as the prelude to the declaration of a very decisive opinioni dont know but i reckon theres a pretty deal about you thats big and grand my dear and im mightily mistaken if mr derwent and mrs rhoda dont think the same my dear jane said mrs dorothy with a twinkle of fun in her eyes mr and madam derwent furnival if you please oh deary me ejaculated mrs jane leave that stuff to you she can call herself madam peverilplantagenet if she likes make no difference to me mrs rhoda she was and mrs rhoda i shall call her to the end of the chapter dont mean any disrespect you knowquite the contrary well im sure im very glad to see her at whiteladies but mrs phoebe if it could have been managed i should have liked you too thank you mrs jane but you see it couldnt well i dont know there was no need for you to come down to the maidens lodge without you liked couldnt you have kept rooms in the abbey for yourself and still have given all to your cousin id rather have this said phoebe with a smile i am more independent you see and i have kept what my grandmother meant me to have so that please god i trust i shall never want and can still help my friends when they need it i can walk in the park and enjoy the gardens just as well as ever and rhoda will be glad to see me i know any time when i want a chat with her i should think so indeed cried mrs jane most thankless woman in the world if she wasnt oh dont say that you know i could not have done anything else knowing what madam intended when things came to me you did the right thing dear child said mrs dorothy quietly as gods children should he knew when to put the power in your hands if madam derwent had come to whiteladies ten years ago she wouldnt have made as good use of it as she will now she was not ready for it and im mistaken if you are not happier phoebe in the maidens lodge than you ever would have been if you had kept whiteladies i am sure of that said phoebe well but she didnt need have come down thus far reiterated mrs jane she is the servant of one who came down very far dear jane gently answered mrs dorothy that we through his poverty might be rich well it looks like it replied mrs jane with a little telltale huskiness in her voice mrs phoebe my dear do you remember my saying when madam died to you and mrs rhoda that id tell you ten years after which i was sorry for phoebe smiled an affirmative well im not over sorry for either of you but at any rate not for you the light has come back to thine eyes dear child and the peace said old mrs dorothy ah folks dont always know what is the hardest to give up and phoebe looking up with startled eyes saw that mrs dorothy had guessed her secret she went to the fire for fresh water from the kettle her face was as calm as usual when she returned softly she said mon sort nest pas a plaindre il est a desirer je nai plus rien a craindre car dieu est mon berger the end
