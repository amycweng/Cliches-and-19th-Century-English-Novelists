at picturing the after adventures of some of jane austen's characters i have made use of the references to them which she herself made and which are recorded in mr austen leigh's memoir more grateful acknowledgments than i can ever express are due to my friend edith barran without whom this book could not have been written the difficulties as well as the presumption of such an undertaking are alike evident but the fascination of the subject must be our apology to those who like ourselves owe to jane austen of the happiest hours of their lives sgb the following characters are introduced into the story from pride and prejudice elizabeth bennet now mrs darcy jane bennet now mrs bingley mr darcy mr bingley miss bingley mr and mrs hurst kitty bennet mr bennet georgiana darcy lady catherine de bourgh miss de bourgh colonel fitzwilliam mrs gardiner mrs annesley from mansfield park william price mary crawford henry crawford mrs grant mr yates mrs yates tom bertram from northanger abbey james morland eleanor tilney now lady portinscale general tilney captain tilney isabella thorpe from sense and sensibility elinor dashwood now mrs edward ferrars edward ferrars robert ferrars mrs jennings lucy steele now mrs robert ferrars anne steele mr palmer from persuasion captain wentworth anne elliot now mrs wentworth sir walter elliot miss elliot from emma emma woodhouse now mrs knightley mr knightley chapter i there is one characteristic which may be safely said to belong to nearly all happily married couples that of desiring to see equally happy marriages among their young friends and in some cases where their wishes are strong and circumstances seem favourable to the exertion of their own efforts they may even embark upon the perilous but delightful course of helping those persons whose minds are as yet not made up to form a decision respecting this important crisis in life and this done to assist in clearing the way in order that this decision may forthwith be acted upon some good intentions of this kind arising out of a very sincere affection for both the persons concerned and a real anxiety about the future of the younger and dearer of the two had actuated elizabeth and mr darcy in promoting an engagement between georgiana darcy and colonel fitzwilliam georgiana was then twenty and had lived entirely with her brother during the three and a half years of his married life reserved shy without self reliance and slow to form new attachments she had been accustomed to look upon the colonel as after her brother her eldest and best friend a feeling which the disparity of their ages served to strengthen she had therefore accepted the fact of their new relations with a kind of timid pleasure only imploring elizabeth that nothing need be said about marriage for some time to come elizabeth when i am married shall i have to go and stay at rosings without you she had asked and on being assured that such might be the terrible consequences of matrimony she had manifested a strong inclination not to look beyond the present but to enjoy for some time longer the love and protection she had always met with as an inmate of her brother's house lady catherine de bourgh had thought it necessary to go through the form of expressing displeasure at the whole proceeding in consequence of darcy's omission to ask her advice in the disposal of his sister's hand but in reality she so thoroughly approved of the match between her nephew and niece that she forgot her chagrin and talked everywhere of her satisfaction in at last seeing a prospect of a member of the darcy family being united to one who was in every respect worthy of the position mr and mrs darcy were seated in the library at pemberley one april morning when the engagement was about six months old their two children a handsome boy of two and a baby girl of a few months had just been taken upstairs after the merry games with their parents to which this hour was usually devoted and elizabeth was arranging with her husband the plans for the day what has become of georgiana and fitzwilliam inquired darcy i understand they were going to ride together but they both said they would prefer to put it off till twelve o'clock when i could go with them they have been walking on the terrace but georgiana has gone in now replied elizabeth glancing out of the window she returned to her husband's side and sitting down began to speak with great earnestness do you think that they are really happy in their engagement i have been watching them closely for some days and i am convinced that georgiana at all events is not mr darcy's manner expressed surprise and incredulity what fancy is this you have taken into your head elizabeth no certainly no such idea had ever crossed my own mind you must be mistaken i do not think so said elizabeth their relation to one another has not since he has been staying here this time its former ease and naturalness and i have noticed other indications as well which make me think that freedom would bring them mutual relief i am sorry for what you say elizabeth said darcy gravely but it is possible you lay too much stress on what may be merely a passing mood when we first consented to the engagement i thought them to be excellently suited to each other and so far i have not seen anything to modify that opinion what has georgiana been saying to you she has said nothing but knowing her so well i can see she is not happy she is nervous restless unlike herself she tries to escape being alone with robert she avoids with a painful embarrassment any reference to her future plans nay you must have noticed incidents like that of yesterday when she almost cried and begged to be excused from going with us to bath next week that is mere foolishness there is no shadow of reason why she should be more afraid of her aunt catherine now than she ever was there is more reason if she dreads to hear her marriage talked of as rapidly approaching and herself and robert referred to as a most fortunate and admirably assorted pair you know how your aunt harangues them on all occasions darcy smiled slightly then rose and began to pace the room if your conjectures are correct elizabeth and georgiana is unhappy in the prospect of this marriage of course it cannot go on but i shall be deeply grieved for all reasons and i hardly know how to ask fitzwilliam to release her excellent fellow though he is he might well resent being thrown over after half a year for what seems like a girlish caprice i do not believe that in any case he would resent it replied elizabeth there would be regret on both sides regret that they had not been able to make each other happy but i more than suspect that if we could ascertain his feelings we should find them to coincide with georgiana's in six months you know they have had time to reflect and to realize what the engagement means to both of them you assume a good deal elizabeth i cannot believe that it is so uncongenial to fitzwilliam that is because he is too good too honourable to show it and yet i am sensible that it is so that his regard for georgiana is that of a friend a brother nothing more i suppose you cannot remember the time when we were engaged darcy and bingley and jane also she added looking archly at her husband my dear i recollect it all with the deepest satisfaction but you know everyone does not display their feelings in the same way fitzwilliam is an older man than i am and was never prone to raptures and georgiana has not the liveliness of mind of my elizabeth i know they are not likely to be run away with by their feelings as mr collins would say replied elizabeth smiling but even taking fitzwilliam's age and georgiana's gravity into consideration this is not at all the same thing i am convinced that they do not find that complete joy in their engagement that people should and that these two might if they were each engaged to the right person do you mean that georgiana has seen someone whom she might prefer asked darcy sharply elizabeth gave a decided negative to this and her husband remained for some minutes wrapped in thought at length he roused himself and said you had better speak to georgiana on the subject elizabeth and if it is as you suppose we will talk it over with fitzwilliam together for my sister to dissolve her engagement is a serious step and must be well considered his wife agreed and added pray dear darcy if it should come to an end do not show any resentment in your manner towards georgiana she cannot help not caring enough for fitzwilliam and it will be painful enough for her to break with him and to know that she has disappointed you i will try not to do so elizabeth but you know how much i desire a safe and honourable settlement in life for georgiana such as this marriage would have been we both wished it so much that i am afraid we were led into mistaking the real nature of their attachment said his wife at any rate since we assisted in bringing the affair about we must share the responsibility of ending it a fact which your aunt is not likely to allow us to forget is she darcy true returned darcy it is regrettable that the engagement was so generally made known however georgiana may stay away from bath if she prefers it was a relief to elizabeth to have fairly talked her husband into accepting the possibility of such an unwelcome turn of affairs for events proved her misgivings to have been well founded she had truly gauged the feelings of georgiana and fitzwilliam with regard to each other and to their engagement georgiana confessed with deep distress and confusion that she knew it was very ungrateful and naughty but she did not seem to be able to care for her cousin in that way and would have said so before but that she was afraid her brother and her aunt would be angry fitzwilliam admitted that he had long feared his inability to make his cousin happy but showed how very great was his dread of causing her by his defection to be wounded reproached or unkindly talked about elizabeth had a difficult task to smooth away all obstacles and to bring comfort to the minds of two very troubled and scrupulous people besides her other duty of persuading her husband that the separation was the right thing and of shielding georgiana from all disagreeables but in a few days everything had been accomplished except what time alone could do darcy could not altogether conceal his regret and disappointment at this termination of his hopes and georgiana was miserable in the consciousness that he blamed her for not having known her mind at the beginning of the engagement had she really cared for fitzwilliam he was convinced that it must have gone on to a happy conclusion and naturally his cousin could hardly be the one to uphold a different opinion fitzwilliam could only assert and reassert that georgiana was undeserving of the slightest reproach and endeavour to divert his cousin's attention to himself it was arranged that he should accompany the darcys as usual to bath where they were to meet lady catherine and meanwhile georgiana accepted an invitation from jane and mr bingley which on a hint from elizabeth was warmly extended to her to go and stay with them at the same time at their house on the other side of derbyshire chapter ii lady catherine de bourgh with her daughter and mrs jenkinson had been established in her favourite lodgings in pulteney street since the middle of march it had been her custom of late years to spend six or seven weeks in bath every spring she had considered it to be good for her daughter's health she also considered that her own constitution and spirits benefited greatly by this yearly change of social environment the rosings' card parties lacked variety mr and mrs collins remained admirable listeners but their conversation like their civilities occasionally wore a little thin lady catherine would she but have admitted it thought that mr collins was too much interested in his own asparagus beds and too little in her peach houses and the ailments of the children kept mrs collins at home on several evenings when it would have been convenient to the hostess at rosings to make up a quadrille table obviously the most suitable spot in which lady catherine and her daughter could have sought change of air would have been the residence of her nephew but darcy and elizabeth had very early in their married life made it clear that they did not intend their house to be turned into a hydropathic establishment for their ailing relatives and that they would entertain their visitors at such times and for as long as they chose consequently lady catherine had been reduced to the expedient of going to bath in the season and to pemberley when she was asked she however reserved to herself the right of insisting that her relatives should visit her at bath and darcy who wished to give no occasion of offence to his mother's only sister was in the habit of taking his wife and sister down there every spring for a short stay at one of the hotels thus forming among themselves a pleasant and independent little party which was usually joined by colonel fitzwilliam this year lady catherine having been there for some weeks previously had been collecting round her a circle of acquaintances some more and some less likely to be congenial to the relatives whose visit was pending elizabeth said mr darcy to his wife as they stood together in lady catherine's drawing room at a large reception which she was giving in their honour two days after their arrival i think i see general tilney over there and unless my memory is failing me surely this is his daughter coming towards us whom we made friends with last year why so it is what a delightful surprise exclaimed elizabeth dear lady portinscale how glad i am to see you again do not say you have forgotten me or i shall find it hard to forgive you no indeed mrs darcy i was coming to introduce myself in fear that you might have forgotten me how do you do mr darcy lady catherine told me that she was expecting the whole party from pemberley this week yes we have come to put in our period of attendance as you see said elizabeth but i never dreamed of anything so pleasant as meeting you again after what you said last year the truth is that my father has not been at all well and as he felt himself obliged to come here for a short time he begged us to join him for two or three weeks your husband is here this evening yes he is in the next room i see him talking to colonel fitzwilliam and are your brother and his pretty wife in bath this spring i remember her so well no they are at home but we have a brother of hers staying with us james morland he has a curacy in a very unhealthy part of the thames valley and he has been extremely ill with a low fever so we have brought him here for a fortnight in the hope that it will do him good how very kind of you to take care of him he is fortunate to have such friends oh no it is a very small thing and he is such an excellent young fellow sensible and agreeable and so hard working my husband has the highest opinion of him and were he less amiable it would be a pleasure to be of service to anyone connected with catherine you oblige me to repeat that anyone who has you for his or her advocate is indeed fortunate lady portinscale answered elizabeth smiling but now that you know your character pray perform the same kind office for some of the people here they are nearly all strangers to me and if my husband were not listening i should say that i wonder how my aunt manages to pick them up lady portinscale will soon gauge your character elizabeth if you make such terribly outspoken comments said darcy smiling you must not mind her lady portinscale my aunt's presence has a demoralizing effect upon my wife it is a very sad thing but i have often remarked it not her presence in the ordinary way said elizabeth but to day we have been through such a stormy scene together that i may be excused for feeling that my aunt and i must go diametrically opposite ways for the rest of our lives really said eleanor portinscale with the faintest suspicion of laughter in her eyes poor lady catherine i recollect last year that you and your sister in law were continually brewing some kind of rebellious mischief against her that is just the cause of the trouble now responded elizabeth my sister in law became engaged to colonel fitzwilliam last november but i saw that they were both so extremely unhappy in their engagement that i was instrumental in breaking it off and this happened only last week so that is why robert fitzwilliam is looking ten years younger georgiana is sheltering safely at home and lady catherine is furiously angry with everyone all round especially with me i am sorry said lady portinscale with gentle sympathy these things cannot be done without regrets and heartburnings i hope it will mean real happiness for them both in the end one has to take that part of it on trust was elizabeth's answer in the meantime it has upset my husband dreadfully and i am afraid he will never be quite reconciled to it until he sees georgiana happily married to somebody who has at present not appeared on the scene i suppose she felt altogether disinclined for coming with you to bath else she might have met friends here who would have distracted her thoughts yes but of course she would not come and i could hardly persuade her even to accept an invitation to go and stay with my sister jane for part of the time that we shall be away we left her in such terribly low spirits that it is really some consolation to see colonel fitzwilliam looking as if a weight had been taken off his mind it would be a sad pity that we should all have got into hot water with lady catherine and nobody be a penny the better for it lady portinscale smiled he is a very handsome man and extraordinarily young looking he is nearly forty is he not yes one would not suspect him of it there is captain wentworth talking to him now they seem to come here every year mrs wentworth and georgiana became rather friendly and they correspond but those relatives of hers are impossible why what is going on lady catherine seems to be carrying off colonel fitzwilliam poor man he was in such a congenial group whom can she be introducing him to they are people i never saw before i do not know them myself but i have several times seen them with lady catherine replied lady portinscale they are called ferrars at least one of them is mrs ferrars i am not sure which the persons who had attracted elizabeth's attention were three in number the two ladies somewhat resembled one another being rather thin small in stature and very elaborately dressed in the height of the fashion one of them might have been considered pretty but for her sharp almost shrewish features restless eyes and the discontented irritable lines which had formed themselves in her face the other had these characteristics in a more marked degree together with a general air of much less refinement and sense it was not to be expected that lucy and anne steele would have altered very greatly for the better since the empty headed and overdressed fop who now accompanied them had exalted lucy to the honour of becoming mrs robert ferrars after four years of family quarrels with mrs ferrars and mrs john dashwood of spending more than her husband's income of scheming to obtain anne a husband of striving to push herself into fashionable society and to hold her own there she found her only happiness in visits to gay watering places where she could pick up new acquaintances and in their company forget for a time the incessant worries and vexations of her home life anne spent the greater part of the year with her sister and brother in law occasionally diversifying her programme by a visit from mrs jennings or to elinor and edward ferrars when out of kindness to lucy they would consent to receive her for a time but these visits of anne's to the rectory at delaford were a trial to all concerned and since on the death of colonel brandon edward had effected an exchange of livings with a clergyman in derbyshire elinor ventured to hope that anne would no longer find it a convenience to stay with persons who resided in such an out of the way part of the country for the present both lucy and anne were quite satisfied with their surroundings they had had the good fortune to become known to lady catherine de bourgh and by the exercise of all the tact flattery and obliging manners at their command had rendered themselves indispensable at whatever entertainments she gave large or small and were being treated by her with such marked graciousness as to rouse their hopes of receiving an invitation to rosings a mansion of the glories of which they had heard much as had all lady catherine's friends the introduction on this evening to such a handsome soldierly and aristocratic looking man as colonel fitzwilliam was a piece of good luck which exceeded anne's wildest dreams and although as soon as the proper civilities had been exchanged he seized the first opportunity of returning to his men friends anne lost no time in confiding to lucy her extreme satisfaction at the addition of such a very smart beau to lady catherine's party don't be a fool nancy was lucy's answer in somewhat discouraging tones what's the good of expecting a man like that to look at you and besides isn't he engaged to mr darcy's sister no anne answered eagerly the engagement's broke off miss de bourgh told me so to day and fancy lady catherine introducing him to us at once she must want us to be all friends together mustn't she well it's likely you'll go and spoil it in some way you never caught the doctor for all his attention lucy responded with true sisterly candour and i expect we'll find we don't see much of colonel fitzwilliam he's staying at the hotel with the darcys and from the look of mrs darcy i don't know as she'll want to do just what lady catherine tells her all day long i shall go and sit by miss de bourgh said nancy after a moment's contemplation of this dismal prospect and perhaps lady catherine will introduce me to the darcys you'd better come too lucy we can't get along without knowing them now lucy consented after some demur and in the course of the evening their hopes of an introduction were realized and their self importance greatly increased for mrs darcy curious to ascertain what kind of hangers on had found places in her aunt's cortege this year had conversed for a short time with them both and with the prudence and consideration which was characteristic of her had refrained from expressing to her husband the full extent of the unfavourable impression which they created i do not much care for those new friends of my aunt's darcy remarked to his wife when they reached home why my dear you were not even introduced to them exclaimed elizabeth robert i noticed did not escape but you did besides they are related to the ferrars at home there is no getting away from that i gathered that they were but i can hardly believe it that man brother to edward ferrars i heard him trying to argue with robert about nelson's tactics at the battle of the nile and it was enough for me i have heard far sounder sense talked at a tenants' dinner at the end of one too fitzwilliam and elizabeth laughed his views upon life in general appeared to suffer somewhat from lack of breadth said the former and i can imagine it would be possible to find him a tedious companion as for the ladies of the party i did not have much conversation with them i think the look of them rather frightened robert said elizabeth but on the whole they are tolerably unobjectionable after all one can't always pick and choose at a place like bath and anyhow we must be civil to aunt catherine's friends it is not for very long i am really going to practise what i preach so you need not look at me like that mr darcy the following evening the whole party met again at a concert in aid of a charity which had been patronized by lady catherine to the extent of several pounds' worth of tickets the morning had been spent by the darcys and fitzwilliam in their own occupations but they had been obliged to dine with their aunt and to meet at dinner the robert ferrars with miss anne steele general tilney lady portinscale's father and his son frederick made up the requisite number of gentlemen and elizabeth found much to divert her in watching during dinner the manoeuvres of miss steele who seated between the two bachelors was fully occupied in efforts to make herself equally and incessantly agreeable to both of them the dire failure of which might have aroused some compassion had she not been so completely self satisfied and confident captain tilney certainly kept up the conversation in the style that was expected of him as long as he could and then turned to miss de bourgh and devoted himself to her having been informed by his father that she was a considerable heiress and his attentions to her must be regulated accordingly colonel fitzwilliam for his part found three cornered discussion carried on with great animation between himself his aunt and general tilney who sat opposite on the military genius of the french generals considerably more interesting than miss steele's observation on the bath assemblies and her openly expressed predilection in favour of officers as partners elizabeth and her husband were no better off in their respective companions the inanities of robert ferrars and the pretensions of his wife were calculated to put a severe strain on the good intentions of lady catherine's niece and nephew towards her guests how elegantly lady catherine's dinner parties are always carried out remarked lucy to mr darcy in a kind of loud aside as they unfolded their napkins she seems to be one of those fortunate persons who always manage to have everything about them as recherche as it is at home wherever they may be staying don't you think so mr darcy no one else could have made this apartment what it is but with lady catherine's delightful appointments you could i daresay easily imagine yourself to be in one of the smaller dining parlours at rosings could you not mr darcy was rather taken aback by this speech and hastily making a mental review of his aunt's usual visitors failed entirely to connect mrs robert ferrars with the dining parlour or any other room at rosings so his reply was not very satisfactory to his questioner it seems a pleasant and convenient room my aunt i believe generally takes these lodgings and when she settles down in a place for a few weeks naturally likes to make it comfortable oh but i think it is a special gift of dear lady catherine's exclaimed lucy you cannot deny it mr darcy knowing rosings as you do now at our lodgings well i daresay the rooms are very little smaller than this but try as i will i cannot give them a home like air though i assure you i brought two large packing cases of dainty trifles from our country house indeed said darcy yes but the lavish refinement combined with substantial comfort of lady catherine's surroundings always appeals to me so strongly when i come here i am sure you understand what i mean mr darcy with a home like pemberley as a standard to judge other people's houses by i had not regarded bath lodgings from that point of view said mr darcy are you making a long stay here may i ask yes we hope to remain for some weeks i always enjoy bath so much at this time of year and so does mr ferrars i consider it infinitely preferable to the autumn season do not you mr darcy all the best people seem to come now and one is not likely to meet anyone whose acquaintance one would not wish to continue afterwards mr darcy took advantage of this pause during which his companion helped herself to fish to consider what reply he should truthfully make to such a sentiment but before mrs ferrars could insist upon his agreeing with her he was called upon by his aunt from the end of the table to support her in a flat contradiction of general tilney who was undoubtedly getting the best of a somewhat heated argument elizabeth was not more fortunate in her companion the wearisome descriptions of this or that friend's house habits achievements which were all that robert ferrars could contribute to the conversation were almost more than could be endured with patience throughout a long dinner even by one who could derive quiet amusement from almost any kind of harmless absurdity and it was with a sigh of relief that elizabeth heard her aunt's peremptory command that everyone should go and put on their coats and cloaks for she would not have her party arrive late for the beginning of the concert the ladies were distributed among various coaches while the gentlemen walked on elizabeth found that her companions were to be her cousin and miss anne steele and during the drive she had leisure to remark with great astonishment the evident intimacy which existed between the young women anne tried to draw her into their discussions but finding mrs darcy resolutely silent she turned to miss de bourgh and began to rally her on the becomingness of the gown which the latter was wearing accompanying her remarks with many giggles mysterious whispers and covert references to favourite colour and smart uniforms which made elizabeth wonder that her cousin could tolerate such treatment for an instant but poor anne de bourgh's nature only half developed by reason of her ill health and her mother's forcefulness of character had yielded entirely to the dominating influence exercised over her by a person nearer her own age and one who made an effort to understand and play upon her weakness elizabeth soon began to perceive the secret of the intimacy miss steele in her anxiety to recommend herself to the de bourgh family had discovered that by enlivening and flattering the daughter she might best become a person of value to the mother anne steele's last words before the carriage stopped were intended to be inaudible to elizabeth and put the final touch to her disgust and dislike me and lucy will be so miserable if you give us up now these grand cousins of yours are come down miss anne miss de bourgh made what was for her a vehement motion of dissent and when they had entered the room elizabeth having piloted her charges to lady catherine's side found a seat for herself as far as possible from anyone connected with the steele family her husband joined her just before the concert began and in the double pleasure of listening to the music and feeling his proximity she forgot the previous vexations of the evening well how have you been getting on inquired a voice behind her in the first pause why fitzwilliam exclaimed darcy glancing round what business have you up at this end you ought to be squiring the young ladies down there by my aunt poor robert said elizabeth he is only off duty for half an hour that is it replied colonel fitzwilliam i was exhausted and seeing this empty chair i forthwith occupied it besides i want to hear the harp solo in peace and quiet i have not heard the harp played for years and i am exceedingly fond of it that is the next one i see hush now i know this man is going to sing out of tune he looks like it we ought to have some compensation for listening to that murmured darcy when the song was done i believe mr collins would have given us a better performance he certainly is rather like mr collins remarked elizabeth reflectively here comes the harp and what a lovely girl is her name on the programme yes miss crawford mary crawford who since dr grant's death had entirely lived with her sister mrs grant at bath had lost none of the beauty and charm which had captivated the heart of edmund bertram indeed the four years which had elapsed since then had given her form and air more regal elegance the knowledge of sorrow and regret that she had so much to injure her own chances of happiness had softened her nature and now more gentle womanly and sympathetic she was in many ways a different creature from the brilliant miss crawford of former days mrs grant while loving her devotedly and rejoicing in her companionship still grieved in secret that no suitor worthy of her dear mary should ever have succeeded edmund bertram and that no second attachment should have taken place of one which though renounced without bitterness had nevertheless left a deep mark upon her sister's character in bath their lives were full of interest and they made many friends but mary always laughed at her sister's plans for her marrying and returned the same kind of answer i expect so much you know and the chosen he must expect so little that i doubt whether we should ever come to terms her sister would protest against this knowing well the real worth of the disposition which mary hid under a careless and sometimes cold manner but she also knew that mary would be more difficult to satisfy both as regards her own qualities and those of her possible husband in consequence of the better taste she had acquired at mansfield this evening miss crawford who had consented to perform solely on account of the charitable object of the concert was out of humour with herself and all the world her sister being unwell she had been obliged to accept an escort to the concert the company of sir walter and miss elliot whom as residents in bath she had known since the time of her sister's settling there miss crawford's beauty of face and figure were exactly what would recommend sir walter and while condemning her sister as dull and unfashionable nothing delighted him more than to be seen in public as squire of the charming and elegant miss crawford six months' acquaintance had caused her on her side thoroughly to weary of him and on the few occasions when she could not avoid a meeting she endeavoured to converse with his eldest daughter whom she found only a degree less tiresome and empty headed to night however there was no help for it with them she had come with them she must remain unluckily placed at a distance from any of her other bath friends her enjoyment of the music spoiled by her companions' irrelevant chatter her only pleasure to acquit herself creditably in the piece she had chosen to play this at all events was in her power she felt as she ascended the platform and shook off sensations of listlessness and ennui and she succeeded so well that the audience were roused to a display of their delight and enthusiasm and she had to return twice to acknowledge their plaudits next moment she perceived or thought she perceived that owing to an increased crowd in the lower part of the room she could not easily get back to her seat without making a little disturbance so she slipped into a chair in the front row which was allotted to the performers thankful even for a short respite when the interval came she remained where she was and a few minutes later seeing the gentleman who had been the chief promoter of the concert trying to attract her attention she rose unwillingly supposing that sir walter elliot had come to claim her what was her surprise to hear mr durand say lady catherine de bourgh particularly wishes to know you may i present you to her mary felt that she had not had much choice in the matter but she found herself curtseying to a tall and formidable looking elderly lady dressed in rich brocades who surveyed her as if from a great height and said allow me to tell you miss crawford how much pleased i was with your late performance on the harp i have heard every harp player of note in europe during the last forty years and i may say i consider you quite equal to those of the second rank though not a performer myself i am quite acquainted with the difficulties of the instrument mary hardly knew whether to be more vexed or amused at this extraordinary address and might have been inclined towards the former had not mrs darcy who had seen the beginning of the incident and hastened forward lest her aunt's insolent patronage should offend interposed with a kindly we have all been enjoying your piece so much it must be delightful to be able to play like that my aunt is such a lover of music that she cannot hide her enthusiasm and why should i hide it may i ask demanded lady catherine my judgment has often been of great service to young amateurs among whom you might include yourself elizabeth yes i know replied elizabeth good humouredly but miss crawford cannot be classed with the average amateur may i introduce myself as mr durand has gone away i am mrs darcy i saw you sitting with the elliots so perhaps you know a great friend of mine mrs wentworth miss crawford was about to enter gladly into the subject of mrs wentworth when lady catherine interposed and in a few minutes before mary had quite realized what was happening she found herself giving the assurance that mrs grant would be delighted to receive a visit from lady catherine and mrs darcy and that she herself would be present at lady catherine's reception in pulteney street in a fortnight's time she hardly knew how it had all come about and she found herself wondering as she was led back to her seat by sir walter elliot whether it was lady catherine's domineering manner or mrs darcy's kind looks that she had yielded to so easily the elliots were eager with their questions what she did not know that that was lady catherine de bourgh everyone knew lady catherine she came to bath every year a very well preserved old lady must be quite sixty and does not look more than forty eight people of property large estate in kent an acquaintance quite worth following up my dear miss crawford of course we with our already large circle of friends could not attempt to include persons who only come here for a short time otherwise we should have been very happy to have visited lady catherine chapter iii the darcys found plenty to enjoy during their stay in bath as after dutifully allotting part of the day to a call on lady catherine or to joining her at the lower rooms they were free to make their own engagements and passed a good deal of their time with lord and lady portinscale mr morland and the wentworths colonel fitzwilliam invariably forming one of the party james morland the portinscales' youngest guest had favourably impressed them from the first being a young man of sense education and good address the experience he had gained from his somewhat unfortunate friendship with the thorpe family followed by his closer acquaintance with the tilneys had been an incalculable benefit to him in helping to form his character and in teaching him what are the qualities in a friend which win sincere love and respect hard work resolution and regret for his own follies and the encouragement and kindness he had received from his relations had combined to put isabella thorpe out of his head and to recuperate a heart he had thought blighted over for ever he had within the last few weeks been obliged to resign the curacy he had held since his ordination on account of the ill effects of the air of the valley on his health and was now earnestly hoping to grow strong enough to resume work in some other part of the country as he had of course resolved upon remaining a bachelor all his life and making his church and parish suffice in place of domestic joys his somewhat diffident manner in the society of men so much older than himself as mr darcy and captain wentworth did him no disservice with them and before they had known the particulars of his history for many days mr darcy was meditating upon the possibility of giving him material assistance in his career in the meantime elizabeth independently of lady catherine had exchanged calls with mrs grant whom she found anxious to be friendly more anxious indeed than mary who while appreciating mrs darcy's kindness and charm greatly disliked the patronizing manners of the mistress of rosings park a few days after the concert the sisters spent a morning in mrs darcy's sitting room elizabeth had never neglected her study of the pianoforte or of singing and as mary at the earnest request of her hostess had brought her harp the pleasure of the whole party sometimes in conversation sometimes in music was ensured colonel fitzwilliam is very fond of music is he not mrs grant said to mrs darcy glancing across the room to where the colonel and her sister were engaged in animated discussion of the latest importations from german composers he really does like it does not praise it out of mere politeness my dear mrs grant he is the most enthusiastic amateur i know i often tell my husband that he would never have fallen in love with me if colonel fitzwilliam and i had not struck up a friendship over music which made him think there was more in me than he had perceived before he himself is not such a good judge of it but my cousin was greatly struck with your sister's playing the other night and it really is appreciation from him i am so glad it will be a pleasure to mary to meet him excuse my asking i cannot quite understand does he live with you or with your aunt with neither he is our guest when we are in bath and he stays a great deal with us in the country but he has rooms in london and i think honestly prefers town as a residence but that he is so fond of my husband and all his belongings there was a pause and then elizabeth added a sudden thought having flashed through her mind he is an excellent man it is impossible for us to think more highly of anyone than we do of him but he labours under what he considers to be an insuperable disadvantage he is a younger son and therefore not much blessed with this world's goods she had hardly finished speaking when the door opened to admit two ladies whom she recognized as her aunt's latest protegees dear me exclaimed anne steele before she was fairly in the room quite a cosy little musical party i declare lord what a pity we have interrupted the music we wouldn't have if we'd have known and here we've run all the way upstairs lucy managed to silence her sister and began a kind of tour of the room making formal greetings to everyone she knew and pausing in so pointed a way before mrs grant and mary that elizabeth with great reluctance was obliged to introduce mrs robert ferrars and miss steele this accomplished lucy's errand was allowed to be divulged we are driving out with lady catherine in the barouche landau and she called here in passing to say if colonel fitzwilliam was in she would like him to come too and make a fourth she explained with assistance from anne we are not going far she added for the benefit of the company in general only to monkton combe and back before dinner poor miss de bourgh is so very unwell to day she did not feel inclined to drive out and my sister and i just happened to be calling in pulteney street as lady catherine was starting out so she was so very kind as to bring us along it is fortunate said elizabeth smilingly that my aunt was able to secure your companionship for as i have visitors i am not sure that i could spare my cousin this morning she glanced at fitzwilliam who was impatiently waiting for an opportunity to answer no certainly not i am much obliged but i am not able to come to day miss steele's manner suffered from a diminution of sprightliness even while she urged on the colonel the necessity of taking advantage of the fine weather but darcy quietly interposed with is my aunt's carriage at the door lucy was obliged to admit that it was shall we go and make your excuses then fitzwilliam he continued if our guests will kindly excuse us for a moment will you give mrs ferrars your arm mrs ferrars i greatly regret not being able to detain you but i know it would not be kind as my aunt has such a dislike to be kept waiting especially in the open street the result of this was that without quite knowing how it happened lucy and her sister found themselves in the hall again almost as soon as the waiter showed them up were in the carriage and driving away the apologies of the gentlemen having been graciously accepted and mr darcy was saying to his friend as they returned the only way with these people is firmness you are much too gentle i don't feel particularly gentle after that interruption replied the other though you got me out of it very well my aunt seems to have a special grudge against me this time i suppose she is working off her irritation well rather on me than on your sister i do not believe it is that answered darcy she is and always was a tool in the hands of unscrupulous flatterers if it were worthwhile elizabeth and i would rush to the rescue but there is sure to be a tremendous explosion before long they will all quarrel violently she will come and tell us that they are ungrateful vipers or something like that and next year it will begin all over again with someone else well cried elizabeth as they opened the door did aunt catherine mind no he has got off with a whole skin this time replied her husband or rather not quite a whole one for he has had to pledge himself to join the expedition to clifton to morrow instead i had forgotten that expedition to clifton elizabeth exclaimed in dismay i wish it would rain but if it did we should only have to go another day mr morland have you been to clifton oh do say it will be quite new to you you can't is there no one who has never been there my aunt makes up a party every year for her newest friends and we always do the same things and make the same remarks elizabeth's forecast created much amusement and miss crawford said everything i hear beforehand of lady catherine is very alarming to a stranger like myself i shall have to have caught a bad cold before her reception next week for i shall not have the courage to appear and play oh no miss crawford you must appear said darcy we are all too bad with our jokes about her for really she means to be very kind but we have got into shocking ways since my wife married into the family on the contrary i think i have educated you all admirably you are a privileged person you see said colonel fitzwilliam miss crawford will you do us the kindness of playing again i want to reap the advantage of the present moment as the reception is a long way off the lady acceded with willingness and at the conclusion of her piece colonel fitzwilliam sat down near her and found himself soon conversing with more ease and enjoyment than he had done for many months their talk was only of the most ordinary subjects but the colonel's simplicity and culture appealed to the best that was in mary and he found in her a ready sympathy felt rather than expressed his views of london life so pleasant so stimulating for the greater part of the year but the country was better for a permanent home exactly coincided with mary's and almost to her surprise she heard herself vehemently asserting that town might be the place to make friends but the country was the place to enjoy them you are a lover of country sports questioned the colonel of riding and driving mary answered enthusiastically though repressing a sigh at the recollection of her first riding lessons did she ride at bath he could recommend her some good livery stables his cousin mrs darcy did not care for it else some agreeable plans might have been made meantime the conversation was quite as animated in the other group james morland was asking if the ladies were those whom general tilney and his son had lately met at dinner in pulteney street yes you are right replied elizabeth did you hear of that dinner party lady portinscale told me i should not otherwise have known for i don't see much of the general and captain tilney james morland answered with a smile i thought eleanor told me all was forgiven catherine is but her relations do not pass the censor still it does not matter in the least so long as he is kind to her and i think i may say he is i suppose he is often at the portinscales' observed elizabeth fairly often but lord portinscale contrives that he does not stay too long he thinks it worries eleanor and as you know she is anxious to take care of herself and go in thoroughly for the cure dear eleanor i am so devoted to her yes indeed one would be she is the kindest friend anyone could possibly have do you know mrs darcy they insist on my having a sitting room to myself where i can read undisturbed or i can spend my time with them just as i like that is a nice arrangement and you are better for coming to bath yes a great deal better i should be able to get to work in a very short time now if only rather mournfully some work could be found i am sure it can if you are patient said elizabeth kindly the very thing one wants often drops upon one unexpectedly do you know our part of the world at all you must come and pay us a visit some time the derbyshire air is splendidly bracing and would benefit you morland said all that was proper and elizabeth who had been trying unsuccessfully to catch her husband's eye continued we are fortunate in our rector at home and even more fortunate in his wife they have just come to pemberley and oddly enough they are related to these very people of whom we have been talking but as different from them as possible indeed the ferrars or steele i have not made them out yet mr edward ferrars our rector is a brother of mr robert ferrars husband of the lady in blue it is rather difficult to keep mrs robert ferrars off the subject when she is with us as she seems to think it establishes a sort of connection although they don't visit their relations perhaps they will do so now said morland with a slight smile it is your own parish that you mentioned yes it is a fair sized village that has grown up round the house or rather round a much older house that formerly stood on the site it is such beautiful country mr morland you really must see it mrs grant came towards elizabeth to take leave and they stood chatting together while colonel fitzwilliam and miss crawford rose and joined them to morrow then at eleven o'clock you are sure suits you the gentleman was saying mrs grant your sister has been so kind as to say that with your permission i may be her escort on a ride if a horse can be found that suits her riding she will enjoy that said mrs grant with momentary surprise she has not ridden for a long time we have never tried to get her a horse in bath it seemed that the whole thing had been thought out all difficulties could be got over colonel fitzwilliam assured her if she would trust her sister to him for an hour or two and mary having expressed a proper amount of amiability and approbation the arrangement was confirmed but what about your engagement the day at clifton mrs grant unluckily remembered in the midst of the adieux colonel fitzwilliam looked as if he were determined to forget the existence of such a place mr darcy reproached himself for having furthered the scheme and miss crawford immediately said oh pray do not give that up on my account we can ride another day if we care about it not at all miss crawford excuse me but i should not think of giving up our plan it is not at all necessary for me to go to clifton it would not be fair to make you break a prior engagement no let us put it off from to morrow was the lady's response elizabeth interposed with if you and miss crawford went out a little earlier you could still be at clifton in time for dinner robert which would quite satisfy my aunt darcy joined his advice to his wife's and as a matter can generally be easily arranged by a number of people who are all in favour of it the ride was fixed for ten o'clock and the ladies took their departure among many promises of meeting again james morland shortly afterwards left colonel fitzwilliam accompanying him as far as his road lay in the direction of the livery stables and elizabeth sat down to write letters but she had not got very far before a new idea struck her which must immediately be acted upon darcy she exclaimed rising and going to her husband who was occupied with the newspaper can you listen to me i want to help mr morland in some way i was thinking about it this morning while i was talking to him he ought to have work to do and he is such a good young fellow could you not make him mr ferrars's curate or something darcy smiled at his wife's earnestness you will be surprised to hear my dear that i had already thought of helping him you had how good of you you can do it better than anyone else he will be an object worthy of your interest but though i had considered the question of the curacy i had dismissed it as unsatisfactory mr ferrars does not want a curate and mr morland does want a living i do not know if i told you that i heard before i went away that the old rector of kympton was likely to resign if so i shall have a living to present and did you think of mr morland how delightful that would be the very thing for him we must not say anything about it at present for i cannot hurry the old man out but i expect to hear in the course of a month i am sure you can bring it about successfully how well everything is going to day some dreadful catastrophe is sure to happen soon what else has gone well why robert's getting on so excellently with miss crawford she is such a thoroughly nice woman and it is certain to do robert good i would not think too much about that lizzy robert gets on well with all nice women and as to miss crawford i should say she is accustomed to receiving a considerable amount of admiration nonsense you shall not spoil my pleasure in it why should they not be friends and nothing more i took care to do him a good turn too i told mrs grant the thing i could about him namely that he is not well off i knew he would tell them himself and make the most of it in that disparaging way he has as if it were a great blot on his character or some serious personal defect he has become so diffident the last few months that i have no patience with him he does not value himself properly and causes people to undervalue him one cannot say that diffidence is a fault of miss crawford's other admirer sir walter elliot no the tiresome dressed up doll she is so sensible that i cannot understand her having those people for her friends perhaps she has no choice possibly the acquaintance was of their seeking she may have made a mistake who knows even the wisest of us may sometimes be mistaken in our estimates of one another may we not elizabeth chapter iv the ride duly took place on the following morning and the circumstances caused elizabeth much secret pleasure her husband hesitated to attach any importance to the friendship thus inaugurated and did not care to consider the possibilities arising out of it for the engagement between his sister and his cousin had been a scheme very near his heart and when it failed he was so much disappointed that he could not give up the idea of fitzwilliam's being disappointed too it was difficult for him to imagine that a man who had lost georgiana could console himself with another woman however talented and charming it therefore followed that elizabeth was compelled to keep her satisfaction to herself and being very anxious that nothing should be said to dispel it she refrained from giving any account of her cousin when the carriages assembled before her aunt's door at eleven o'clock with a warning glance at her husband she replied to lady catherine's peremptory inquiries that robert had an engagement that morning but he would join them at dinner coming over on horseback an engagement repeated lady catherine haughtily i was not aware that any engagement could have a prior claim when my party has been made up for some days it is very annoying the result is that you have an empty seat in your carriage if we had known captain tilney's gig would not have been wanted perhaps captain tilney would not mind giving poor little me a seat in his gig suggested miss steele who since she saw that the honour of sharing a back seat with colonel fitzwilliam was denied her had been revolving the next most advantageous plan in her mind captain tilney who was already in his gig hoping that his destined companion had not yet appeared looked round for a way of escape but from lady catherine's generalship there was none and she said after a moment's consideration very well i suppose that must do i had intended but when people are so extremely ungrateful i sent a note round last night to mrs grant and miss crawford elizabeth asking them to join us they actually declined it is not often that i go out of my way to take notice of strangers my dear aunt interrupted darcy had we not better start we are collecting a crowd in the street miss steele may i help you into the gig i suppose your sister and her husband will go with my aunt and miss de bourgh take care of the wheel tilney your horse looks as if he were going to leave us all behind now mrs ferrars it is a good thing we have a spare seat you know madam mr morland can take care of the baskets and the wraps if you like we can make different arrangement in coming home the carriages drove off and elizabeth in the highest spirits congratulated her husband on his disposal of the steele faction the party however was not destined to be so successfully divided for the whole day and while they were all strolling about at clifton in the hour preceding diner elizabeth was taken possession of by her aunt to listen to some severe strictures upon her management of the family affairs i blame you exceedingly elizabeth for not using your influence with fitzwilliam he ought to go about with the rest of us in an ordinary way not wander off by himself heaven knows where that is not the way to teach him to forget that affair which so unfortunately miscarried under your guidance but aunt we cannot control his movements as if he were a child he naturally goes where he likes and makes his own friends his own friends yes indeed desirable friends they must be to cause him to break an engagement with his nearest relations i think it is quite time that he were taken in hand by someone who cares as much for his welfare as i do even at his age a man cannot be trusted to know what is best for himself i always thought no good would come of it when you and darcy took so much pains to throw him and georgiana together your own family's matrimonial affairs have always been conducted in such extraordinary lines we will leave my family out of the discussion please aunt catherine i do assure you that the breaking of georgiana's engagement was for the best in every way of course i know you feel bound to defend your handiwork and i am only too glad to think that my dear nephew has not suffered more than he has from the effects perhaps next time you will agree that he should be guided by the advice of those older and wiser than himself certainly aunt catherine returned elizabeth who only endured these remarks by making allowance for her aunt's disappointment or perhaps it might be better to let him choose a wife if he wants one entirely by himself i should prefer that he should choose one of whom i could approve and that i could be sure next time an engagement is made that it is not likely to be broken returned lady catherine when i was a young girl a betrothal was regarded as a very serious thing one not lightly to be cast aside because of a fancied change of feeling elizabeth had begun to wonder how much longer she could bear this conversation when the opportune arrival of colonel fitzwilliam caused his aunt's attention to be concentrated upon him to the exclusion of everyone else and elizabeth was pleased to observe his contented air and cheerful manner while he laughingly parried his aunt's cross examination and even submitted to the advances of miss steele who delighted to find him more approachable than usual continued to address all her remarks to him while they visited the pump room and strolled down towards the river elizabeth found herself obliged to pair off with mrs ferrars but lucy who possessed a considerably larger share of adroitness than her sister perceived at once that different methods were necessary to recommend herself to mrs darcy than to lady catherine and had for some days been endeavouring to show herself equal to the standard of elegance required by a young lady on this occasion she began by expressing warm enjoyment of the concert a few nights before yes said elizabeth it was a good concert very much above the average of those things i thought oh it was charming i do not know when i have been more delighted that exquisite italian song the air of it runs in my memory still you must have a good memory for those florid operatic songs are the most difficult things to remember ah dear mrs darcy i fear you undervalue your powers we all know what an accomplished musician and critic you are elizabeth disclaimed but mrs ferrars continued perseveringly you prefer instrumental music perhaps it is no doubt a sign of a more cultivated taste elizabeth was somewhat amused i do prefer instrumental music but only because it is the kind i understand best then of course you appreciated the playing of that young lady miss crawford i suppose it was very wonderful lady catherine was much struck by it i do not know that it was wonderful but miss crawford has a great gift and plays with all the feeling and charm one would expect of her you know her well do you not asked lucy not very well but i do hope to know her better lucy meditated upon this it was not very agreeable news to her if mrs darcy saw much of miss crawford it would mean that colonel fitzwilliam would see a good deal of her too lucy felt that after poor anne's many failures success did not look more probable here and the result of her reflections was the question is miss crawford as rich as they say i do not know what miss crawford's fortune is replied elizabeth in cold surprise she and her sister appear comfortably off oh i only meant began lucy confused she is said to be such a great heiress that i often wonder why she has never married then as her companion did not speak she added they say that perhaps she will be the next lady elliot and that would be most suitable would it not his title and her fortune i should not think such a match was very probable but i scarcely know sir walter elliot replied elizabeth lucy could not help pursuing the subject do you think miss crawford very pretty she inquired she is very graceful and sweet looking and her face has a great deal of animation which is always so attractive answered elizabeth her complexion has rather lost its bloom though and she is so unbecomingly thin lucy ventured to say i have not remarked it returned elizabeth vexed with herself for having drifted into anything like an intimate conversation with mrs ferrars shall we join lady catherine she is evidently wanting to collect the party it must be nearly time to start for home lucy saw that she had made a mistake and covered it as well as she could by saying oh but i think miss crawford charming i assure you and so talented i wish we could have heard the harp when we were calling on you yesterday morning you will have another opportunity of doing so at my aunt's reception next week said her companion mrs darcy had been quite conscious of the undercurrent in mrs ferrars's mind during this conversation for she had perceived the aspirations of miss steele supported as she was by her sister towards colonel fitzwilliam and elizabeth felt the extreme importance of preventing any hint from being dropped which might open her cousin's eyes to the situation or even to the fact that anyone thought there was a situation a word of raillery from miss steele or of archness from mrs ferrars would be enough to drive him from bath in disgust he would resent nothing more deeply than the imputation of his paying court to an heiress and persons of the steele kind elizabeth knew would be able to make remarks of a character most difficult for him to bear the friendship between himself and miss crawford was at that time in the stage when a very small incident might affect it one way or the other and elizabeth felt miserably uncomfortable until she found herself safely at home again and their little party of three collected round the fireside in their lodgings mr morland having been dropped at his rooms well robert i did not have the chance to ask you she began trying to speak unconcernedly did you enjoy your ride this morning and where did you go i enjoyed it very much thank you replied the colonel though we did not go far only about three miles on the wells road that was a pity said darcy you ought to have had a good gallop on the downs i wished to do so said the colonel but i fancied miss crawford was a little disinclined for it she seemed so much afraid i should be late in arriving at clifton and always talking of turning back you must go farther another time said elizabeth yes i hope so indeed responded her cousin it is perfect weather for riding and miss crawford is a horsewoman such as one seldom sees talking of horses either tilney is not much of a driver or else he took pleasure in frightening that miss steele to day remarked darcy you did not see did you robert no it was on the way up there he let his horse gallop down the long hill i thought the gig would have been upset and the silly girl actually caught hold of one rein i thought miss steele seemed very unwilling to drive back with him said fitzwilliam with a smile by the way have you noticed what a wonderful girl she is for asking questions she almost equals my aunt elizabeth felt her fears returning and inquired did she manage to find questions to ask you robert i should think she did she was trying to extract from me why i had not arrived earlier and what i had been doing i had to admit that i had been riding and in some way of her own she dragged miss crawford's name in too i simply pretended not to hear and began talking vigorously about something else how in the world it can matter to her whether i was riding with miss crawford or miss anybody i fail to understand she is an inquisitive little minx and i cannot bear her elizabeth exclaimed emphatically fitzwilliam do let us go home i don't like bath this year or the people in it we can ask the nice ones like miss crawford and mr morland to stay with us at pemberley i am quite willing to return my dear replied darcy but it would not do to leave before my aunt's reception or to admit ourselves driven away by a miss steele of course we will stay over the sixteenth but we will go after that it only means a week or two less than our ordinary visit the wentworths are leaving and eleanor portinscale is too unwell for me to see anything of her and aunt catherine has her extraordinary friends to amuse her there is really nothing to keep us you will come too will you not robert to this the colonel made no reply and elizabeth interpreted his silence as her wishes dictated the next few days passed without any special event to mark them elizabeth wished more and more to leave bath and to be able to persuade colonel fitzwilliam to come too for she felt an uneasiness that would not be stifled as to the outcome of the various friendships that had been inaugurated that year in particular she suspected the steele and ferrars faction of making some mischief with her aunt they were incessantly with her and it seemed to elizabeth that lady catherine was becoming what with all her faults of overbearing pride haughtiness and love of flattery she had never been before namely suspicious of evil motives and thoughts in those around her when her nephew and niece were with her she would question them and hardly accept their explanation of their occupations at other times she blamed everybody for what they were doing mr morland for accepting the hospitality of the portinscales lady portinscale for not entertaining captain tilney for not marrying anne steele for wishing to do so colonel fitzwilliam for coming to bath and georgiana for staying away mrs grant and miss crawford were criticized for being in such an expensive place but on the whole lady catherine said but little about them in a general way which elizabeth regarded as a bad sign for she was sure that as friends of her choice lady catherine must have a great deal to say in private in their disfavour as to james morland elizabeth felt there was everything to be said in defence of his present situation but she was so anxious for it to be known that he was on the way to obtaining work that she wanted to be at home in order to set the necessary arrangements in motion though her husband laughed at the idea of the vicar's resigning any sooner because the patron happened to be at pemberley instead of at bath it was however in regard to the progressing friendship between mary crawford and colonel fitzwilliam that elizabeth felt most troubled and as long as she remained in bath most helpless mary and mrs grant would not come and see her more often than she visited them and although there were numberless opportunities of meeting at the rooms the gardens the theatre and other public places on these occasions there always seemed to be something to interfere with the enjoyment of their little party either lady catherine was there with the steeles who could be depended on to break up any rational conversation or other amusement or worse still sir walter and miss elliot would appear on the scene and assuming the privileges of an older acquaintance would take possession of mary and draw her away from her newer friends with many protests of having been quite deserted of having so much to say to our dear miss crawford whom we have missed so terribly lately they had of course a slight previous acquaintance with the darcys whom they had intended to become intimate with at one time as people of fashion but to miss elliot's intense chagrin mrs darcy had been quite unresponsive to her and had instead formed a friendship with her younger sister mrs wentworth although the wentworths and the darcys were frequently together elizabeth could not well confide her difficulties to anne when it was so evident that sir walter elliot was another admirer of miss crawford and not at all evident in which direction the lady's choice would lie it was hard to believe that she could find true pleasure in the company of sir walter with his tedious inanities or of miss elliot with her artificiality and pride and yet at times she seemed to greet them almost with a heartiness and be glad to join them even though she might have been a moment before in conversation with the darcy party and showing them her real self in a charming and spontaneous gaiety but those who watched closely might have noticed that these times coincided with the appearance of lady catherine who on seeing her nephew colonel fitzwilliam usually endeavoured to detach him from the group he was in and to join him to her own he on his part was always most unwilling to relinquish the society of miss crawford but she gave him no chance to do otherwise gliding away with a pleasant word of farewell before lady catherine's insistent i want you fitzwilliam if you can spare me a few moments made itself heard he had no key to her behaviour sometimes it seemed to him as if she really liked him and as if he might venture to hope he could make her like him more and then again sir walter elliot was so frequently at her elbow with the compliments and gallantries which seemed to be his native language and were so foreign colonel fitzwilliam thought to himself that naturally diffident distrusting his powers to charm and attract he often felt as if it were hopeless even to think of becoming a suitor while at the same time his deepening love for mary compelled him to persevere elizabeth perceived some part of all this and longed to help but there was something about mary's reserve that made it impossible to win her confidence or to do anything more for colonel fitzwilliam than his own powers were able to do for him mary never gave him what could be construed into the smallest encouragement it was only by observing that with him she seemed to be able to talk more naturally to express her real opinions more frankly that elizabeth could surmise his interest in her to be in the slightest degree reciprocated had it not been for the very strong liking elizabeth had formed for her new friend she would have been disposed to think that her cousin's happiness would best be furthered by separating him from a pleasure that might become such great pain but after a conversation with him in which he briefly admitted his growing attachment and the existence of his hopes she could not advise him to give up the quest and could only assure him of her sympathy and belief in mary's being a prize worth winning he confessed that he felt it was doing a wrong to georgiana to indulge in such thoughts so short a time after leaving her and reproached himself with his presumption in thinking that so brilliant and admired creature as mary could have any warmth of feeling for a battered old soldier like this as he styled himself elizabeth tried to reason him out of these scruples and to give him all the good counsel that her knowledge of his character suggested she found that he did not believe he had at present the remotest chance of being accepted he only hoped while they remained in bath to win his way in miss crawford's esteem and to be assured that she had no preference for any other man chapter v elizabeth was anxious to see as much of miss crawford as possible before their departure from bath which was now fixed for the th of april the day after lady catherine's reception she accordingly made an excuse to walk down to mrs grant's house on the day before with the piece of music which it had occurred to her might be arranged with a setting for the harp and she found miss crawford in and alone mary was wearing her bonnet and cloak and was wrapping up a parcel when mrs darcy was announced and the latter exclaimed that she would not stay as mary was just going out no no i am not it does not matter i was only going to take this parcel to miss elliot's pray sit down mrs darcy i can send it by the boy and recalling the servant miss crawford handed him the package with directions to take it to camden place then returning she threw off her cloak and said it really does not signify in the least it is only a fan miss elliot lent me a few evenings ago as an excuse she said for seeing me again when i brought it back this was spoken with a slight blush but on elizabeth's repeating her regrets she exclaimed oh but i would much rather stay and talk to you i so seldom see you alone one seldom does see anyone alone in bath i think what have you brought some music how delightful you will play it to me now elizabeth explained her scheme and miss crawford examined the piece with great interest and presently declared she thought it would make an admirable duet as she walked across the room to the harp elizabeth remarked if you like it we might play it to morrow night at my aunt's reception miss crawford appeared to be busily tuning the strings of her harp and it was after a moment's pause that she replied i do not think we shall be at lady catherine's reception not be there repeated elizabeth concealing her dismay as best she could i am very sorry for that we shall all be sorry not to see you there thank you returned miss crawford and seemed unwilling to say more elizabeth however could not bear to leave the subject at that point and after a few moments suggested that if mrs grant did not feel equal to going she herself would be delighted to call for miss crawford and take her to pulteney street you are very kind mrs darcy but it is not that said miss crawford at length turning round and showing a countenance expressive of some embarrassment the truth is she continued and i know i can speak it to a friend like yourself that i don't think lady catherine really wants such very small rushlights as ourselves in her firmament of glittering stars she cannot be said to know us she has not called here since i was introduced to her at that concert and only sent us a note late one evening asking us to come next day to clifton i do not in the least mind being invited only on account of my music but as frances and i always agree since i am not paid in money i must be in manners oh i beg your pardon she stopped short colouring and biting her lip i should not have said that lady catherine has of course a perfect right to do as she likes i daresay she has long forgotten having given me an invitation my dear miss crawford exclaimed elizabeth whose colour had also risen say no more you quite put us all to shame was there ever such an ill mannered family of course i thought that my aunt had sent you and your sister an invitation in due form you must let me take all the blame to myself for having omitted to remind her we had talked we had assumed all this time that you would be at the reception which must account for my unpardonable forgetfulness of what should have been an early and most pleasurable duty miss crawford tried to laugh the matter off by saying that it was in no respect mrs darcy's fault and that the whole thing was too trifling to deserve a moment's consideration besides she added mrs darcy had presented her sister to lady catherine on one occasion and could not have done more that she was sure she and mrs grant would not be missed at such a large party and that she hoped to have other opportunities of meeting mr and mrs darcy it is because i fear there will be so few more in bath owing to our departure for home that i am so particularly sorry to lose this one and also for the cause of it returned elizabeth i can quite enter into your feelings miss crawford but will you do a very kind and generous thing and show that you have forgiven me by availing yourself of my aunt's invitation if she tenders it in a manner you can accept miss crawford could not be persuaded to give a definite assent to this proposal she tried to treat the matter of her going to the party or staying away as no consequence and laughingly protested that she would send the harp alone which would answer all purposes as far as lady catherine was concerned the utmost she could be induced to say was i should be very glad to give you the pleasure and with this elizabeth was obliged to be content nevertheless elizabeth was so extremely desirous of securing miss crawford's presence partly in the hope that lady catherine might be more kindly disposed to her on a closer acquaintance and partly in order that colonel fitzwilliam might be enabled to enjoy her company without fear of interruption from the elliots that on leaving mrs grant's house she hastened at once to pulteney street trusting to find lady catherine alone and disposed to listen to her errand in both these objects she was successful for though the inevitable miss steele was in the house she was upstairs with miss de bourgh and lady catherine having just had a disappointment in hearing that some old friends found themselves obliged to quit bath before her reception was in a mood to demand elizabeth's sympathy and to discuss matters connected with entertainment it really is exceedingly trying she said i am not prepared for these annoyances at my age my friends should take care to spare me them i am convinced that lady alicia markham's son is not so ill but that he could have done without his mother for another two days elizabeth condoled warmly and listened to a description of the arrangements for the evening in which it appeared mrs ferrars's help had been invaluable and when lady catherine named the musicians she expected elizabeth took advantage of the opening thus afforded her by suggesting that a more formal invitation should be sent to miss crawford to ensure her presence lady catherine stared and in a tone of offended surprise reminded her of the first meeting with miss crawford you were present i recollect elizabeth when she was introduced to me and i gave her the opportunity of bringing her instrument on this occasion yes i remember its being mentioned said elizabeth but i hardly think she took it as an invitation i fancied you meant to follow it up by calling on her and her sister i may have had some thoughts of doing so returned lady catherine haughtily but in the end i decided that i did not choose it i cannot take up with all the new young ladies who come to bath and least of all those who are talked of as much as she is she is the greatest flirt imaginable that foolish old beau sir walter elliot and half the men of bath are running after her no indeed dear madam you have been misinformed and i must defend her said elizabeth with more earnestness she is not in the least a flirt and though men may run after her they receive no encouragement to do so but if you do not like her there is no more to be said now whom could you get in her place i do not know any other lady but there is a man at the theatre who is said to play the harp tolerably well lady catherine was silent for a moment with anger then she broke out as elizabeth had expected there is no one i can get in her place the impudent girl she should be glad to come to a house like this probably she is intending to come all the time if the truth were known how can you tell she is not only that when i last saw her she distinctly said that she and her sister had no reason to think themselves expected no reason when with my own mouth i said 'i should like you to come and play at my house on the sixteenth' nothing could be clearer as to her sister if that is the very ordinary looking person whom i believe you presented to me one morning no i do not recollect saying anything to her but it is not she who plays the harp she is a very agreeable and cultured woman widow of a canon of westminster and miss crawford goes nowhere without her well it is all extremely annoying and i do not know when i have been so upset you should have told her elizabeth told her plainly that she was to come really the airs these people give themselves here is a card i will write their names and send it round this afternoon and i hope after that we shall have no more nonsense this by no means satisfied elizabeth and the next ten minutes were spent by her in using every means of persuasion she could think of to induce her aunt to repair all previous omissions by going to visit mrs grant and conveying her invitation in person lady catherine at first resisted the proposal indignantly and would have continued to do so but for her knowledge that miss crawford's music was to have been an attractive part of the evening's entertainment and an uncomfortable recollection of having told many of her friends that they would hear a person scarcely known in whom she had discovered some remarkable talent this she did not betray to her niece and when the latter left the house it was without having secured a definite promise but elizabeth felt she had said as much as she safely could and she walked home pondering on what had passed and wondering uneasily whether what she had done had been a real kindness to mary this question was also raised by her husband to whom she had related the affair on her return he shook his head over it and gave it as his opinion that as his aunt had been rude to miss crawford and the latter was fully conscious of it they would not meet in a spirit conducive to future good feeling but it would have been worse said elizabeth if aunt catherine had counted on miss crawford's coming and she had not appeared there would have been no healing the breach then would it have greatly signified if there had been a breach inquired darcy but never mind my dear you have done your best and it will be interesting to see the result of aunt catherine's efforts at conciliation the first time she has ever appeared in such a role i should think strangely enough lady catherine's efforts were successful enough although no one ever knew precisely how she accomplished it but it was partly accounted for by the fact that she saw mrs grant alone miss crawford being out she had taken only her daughter with her not choosing that miss steele should be a witness of an interview which was undoubtedly galling to her pride and mrs grant realizing but a small part of the great lady's insolence towards her sister and the nature of mary's resentment of it only perceived that lady catherine was anxious to have them at the party and was willing to acknowledge any remissness in her manner of issuing the invitation lady catherine was so relieved at not having to apologize directly to the object of her dislike that she became in the course of the interview more and more condescendingly gracious to mrs grant whom she found as she afterwards remarked to her daughter an amiable unpretentious person and actually admitted that she ought to have called sooner but the pressure of engagements in bath at this period of the season was so great the call was strictly limited to a quarter of an hour and mrs grant described it all to mary when she came in with much spirit and humour mary on hearing that her sister had actually accepted was inclined to be defiant and to declare that she would have a headache and not go of course it was kind mrs darcy's doing but she did not care to accept favours thrown at her at the eleventh hour like this by ill tempered old ladies who only wanted to make use of her mrs grant whose pride in and love of her sister were unbounded and who delighted in seeing her shine by means of her beauty and talents had great difficulty in persuading her in fact when they met the darcy party at the lower rooms the following morning mary still declared that her coming was so doubtful that it was not worth while to give mrs darcy the trouble of learning the duet elizabeth however felt fairly confident of seeing her there and colonel fitzwilliam confirmed this by telling elizabeth with a cheerful glance that she had not actually said she would not go their hopes were realized by the arrival of the two sisters mary looking lovely and sparkling in white with a few fine jewels the gifts of her devoted brother elizabeth who had arrived some time earlier happened to be near her aunt and so was able to satisfy herself that their reception by their hostess was properly courteous if not cordial lady catherine even took the trouble to mention the name of her daughter who stood close by and miss de bourgh actually exerted herself so far as to make two separate curtsies though the remark that it was a cold evening was taken out of her mouth by anne steele who was standing next to her and evidently considered herself included in the introduction elizabeth saw with delight that colonel fitzwilliam was impatiently awaiting his turn after these formalities should be over and that he immediately placed himself by miss crawford's side they seemed to have much to say to one another and elizabeth after greeting the two ladies and giving mary an expressive glance of gratitude which conveyed much more than her quiet remark it was kind of you to come began to converse with mrs grant until music should be demanded of mary elizabeth was very well amused in watching the arrival of the guests and in noticing which of them were under the special patronage of the robert ferrars who appeared to have brought into lady catherine's circle a number of individuals of about the same standing in the world of fashion as themselves robert ferrars was in his element as though he found entertaining in another person's house a much more satisfactory matter than when the trouble and expense had to be incurred by himself besides having the advantage of being able to introduce his friends to an earl's daughter as their hostess when all who were expected had arrived he in company with a showy looking young man dressed in the extreme of fashion began strolling about the rooms in search of someone upon whom they could make an impression elizabeth thought that she and her husband might at least have escaped mr ferrars's civilities and great was her surprise when the young men paused before her and mr ferrars begged leave to introduce his friend mr yates who had newly come from london mr and mrs darcy he thought might be interested to meet mr yates in view of their intended journey as mr yates would be able to give them all information as to the state of the roads mrs darcy had scarcely made her curtsey and was about to frame some suitable reply when the glance of the newcomer happened to fall on mrs grant who was seated on a low chair close by he immediately pronounced her name in tones of questioning surprise and when she looked up exclaimed yes i was sure it was upon my word madam i take some credit to myself considering the length of time it is since we met i hope i am so fortunate as to recall myself to your remembrance you are very good sir replied mrs grant with a perceptible effort her countenance expressed no great pleasure at the encounter of course i recall you perfectly mrs yates i trust is quite well very well i thank you madam and i hope the same may be said of your fair sister miss crawford but perhaps she is no longer miss crawford don't be under any alarm yates struck in robert ferrars she is still miss crawford and you can judge for yourself how well she is for you will see and hear her to night this speech was so offensive to mrs grant that she cut short mr yates's compliments and remarking yes i am glad to say my sister is still with me rose and prepared to move away elizabeth immediately suggested that they should go in search of some tea and the dismayed mr yates saw mrs darcy departing before he had uttered a single word about london or about the distinguished people he had dined with the night before last well i'm very sorry ferrars he replied to his friend's reproaches i'm sure i didn't want to talk to mrs grant at all but seeing her was the greatest surprise i never dreamt of meeting her here and of course i had to speak a civil word or she would have thought it so strange my dear fellow retorted ferrars what on earth did that matter i should have thought you would understand that mrs darcy is the person to make yourself agreeable to here not mrs grant who is only a clergyman's widow i suppose as you knew her before that she lived down at that precious dull place in the country where you took your wife from yes she did answered mr yates but there's a good deal more in it than that not through her do you mean to say that sister of hers is really here going about in bath of course she goes about why shouldn't she demanded ferrars is there anything against it the women are all down on her i know you should hear my wife and sister but only because she's such a devilish pretty girl and proud she won't have any friends but the darcys but do you actually not know have you never heard all about her and her brother between the two of them they managed to lead my wife's family a pretty dance neither of them can ever show their faces in mansfield again so it was a lucky thing the grants moved when they did to think of meeting miss crawford again i shall tell her that edmund bertram is uncommonly well and prosperous and tom bertram isn't married yet and you see how she looks when i do it this amiable intention was frustrated as elizabeth who could readily see that mrs grant was disturbed by what had happened did not need even the hint dropped by her that she hoped mary would not meet mr yates as he was connected with the bertrams and all that part of her life that it was painful to her to remember in order to make her strive in every way to protect mary from any disagreeableness they went to the tea room whither colonel fitzwilliam and mary had fortunately preceded them some time before mr yates's appearance they were there joined by darcy and all five formed a happily conversing group mrs grant whispered a word to her sister whose countenance changed for a moment but she shook off the cloud and gave herself up to the delight of the present once elizabeth received a message from her aunt requesting her to make miss crawford play now and she escorted her friend back to the music room and did not leave her after the performance until she saw colonel fitzwilliam safely stationed beside her no command to play a second time followed rather to elizabeth's surprise but having a number of friends to take leave of she could not give it much thought before her own departure which her husband had insisted should be an early one in view of the journey on the following day mr yates did not in fact come near any of this little party during the rest of the evening but might have been observed conversing earnestly in a quiet part of the room with lucy ferrars and her sister who judging by their rapt attention and animated countenances found what mr yates had to say deeply interesting so much so in fact that when his narration was finished the two young women having faithfully promised to repeat no word of what he had told them took the first opportunity of slipping away unostentatiously in the direction of their hostess and having drawn her aside with a hint of having something very important to communicate poured into her ears that whole story just heard a story which as may be imagined lost nothing in their version of it lady catherine was so exceedingly angry that her instantly expressed desire was to have both mr yates and miss crawford the latter being of course the heroine of his tale brought before her with some confused idea in her mind of proving to the world at large that her dislike of mary crawford had all the time been well founded but lucy's extreme terror of the consequences of this act and her part in it while mr and mrs darcy were there to protect their friend caused her to implore lady catherine to suspend pronouncing judgment till the following day there would still be plenty of opportunities of meeting miss crawford lucy assured her patroness lady catherine would make no promises only the necessity of attending to her other guests she replied delayed her from informing miss crawford of her strong disapproval she would not appear to condone such conduct as miss crawford's had been one moment longer than she could help lucy and her sister thought it safest to mingle inconspicuously with the crowd until the storm should break over some other heads meantime elizabeth and her husband had made their farewells to most of their friends and were exchanging a few last words with mrs grant and mary the latter looked unusually lovely and an expression of quiet happiness illumined her countenance colonel fitzwilliam did not allow himself yet to adopt the easy manner of an intimate friend but the earnestness of his glance towards mary the eagerness with which he obeyed her slightest request betrayed the state of his feelings and his air and manner were those of a man whose thoughts are wholly pleasant i am so sorry that this is really good bye elizabeth was saying but i am consoled by thinking it is only for a little while you will keep your promise and come to us this summer will you not mary crawford and her sister repeated a cordial acceptance and the former added you must tell us exactly how to come mrs darcy you must explain all the intricacies of travelling between brighton and derbyshire or we shall undoubtedly be lost on the road brighton shall you come from there and it was explained that the ladies generally spent the months of june and july at some seaside place and brighton had been thought of for this year or we may be in london with my brother continued mary but wherever we are if you remember to ask us we shall come the usual protestations of the impossibility of forgetting followed and very warm handshakes were exchanged then elizabeth turning to her cousin said are you coming home now robert it will be most unfriendly of you not to for how else shall we see you again since you positively decline to go with us to morrow colonel fitzwilliam hesitated and said he had not thought of going home just yet but mary interrupted him by saying pray don't let us keep you colonel fitzwilliam i am sure our coach will be there now if you would kindly inquire colonel fitzwilliam was so kind as to wish to put us into our coach she added to elizabeth but it would not be worth while just for that to prevent him from driving home with you and mr darcy i will go and see certainly said the colonel moving off but don't wait for me elizabeth i would just as soon walk back and i will see you and darcy at breakfast darcy drew his wife's arm within his and they made their way to lady catherine who was sitting very upright in an armchair and wearing her most stern and forbidding expression to elizabeth's civilly worded thanks for all the kindness and pleasure which their aunt had bestowed on her relatives during their stay she made no reply but when elizabeth referred to their departure on the morrow she started placed her hand coldly within her niece's for a moment and said yes you are going i recollect you did not consult me in the matter but still perhaps this year it is as well you are not staying longer elizabeth was too well accustomed to her aunt's insolent speeches to seek to account for them and turned away while darcy remarking yes we have stayed as long as we care to for this year also shook hands with his aunt cutting her rather short in the midst of a statement that she could send no message to georgiana and without further delay escorted his wife downstairs mary crawford watched them from the room and then said to mrs grant let us go and say good night also frances we may as well be ready and there will be the harp to be carried down very well my dear returned her sister we shall have to take our turn for everyone else seems to be preparing to leave at once they approached lady catherine and when after a few minutes they reached her side to their surprise she addressed them in a more stiff and stately manner than usual ah miss crawford i was awaiting you will you kindly come this way and she preceded them towards a small library where card tables had been placed but which was now deserted mary was not the least apprehensive of harm and even whispered mischievously to her sister perhaps she is going to present me with a fee so that her astonishment was unbounded when lady catherine having closed the door turned to her and exclaimed in a voice shrill with anger which she did not attempt to control as this is probably the last time we shall meet miss crawford you will allow me to inform you that i have been entirely under a misapprehension in inviting you to my house and that i very much regret having done so the two sisters gazed at her both silent from surprise and lady catherine made haste to continue i see you are on the point of asking me what reason i have for coming to this conclusion i do not care to enter into particulars it must be sufficient for you that facts have come to my knowledge facts which if you search your memory will no doubt mary had by now found words and she broke into lady catherine's speech in a voice that distress and wounded dignity caused to tremble i was not on the point of asking you why you propose to forbid me your house in that matter my decision had anticipated your wishes but i have a right to ask the meaning of this insult even your ladyship will hardly refuse to inform me of what and by whom i am accused lady catherine drew herself up still further and said i repeat that i do not care to enter into particulars i have no wish to say anything that may be injurious to you in your future life the facts which have come to my knowledge are facts which you must be well aware are damaging to yourself and any member of your family only in a lesser degree to you mrs grant i shall repeat them to no one i only wish you to understand our acquaintance is henceforth at an end mary scarcely heard the last words she had turned to her sister who seemed quite overwhelmed and could only say almost indistinguishably that dreadful mr yates i feared i feared frances dear frances do not give way i implore you do not let her make you unhappy what does it matter about mr yates the truth cannot harm either of us then confronting lady catherine once more with head proudly thrown back she demanded now madam in justice to my sister if not to me will you kindly state what mr yates has told you lady catherine who had expected a shamefaced attitude was unprepared for this counter attack and replied after some hesitation it is evident that you know mr yates has something to tell certainly we know exactly what mr yates knows retorted mary with spirit but what he may have told your ladyship is quite another matter will you tell us or are you disposed to wait for the presence of mr and mrs darcy a message from us would cause them to postpone their journey to morrow the taunt was a well judged one lady catherine felt its truth and anxious not to involve herself more deeply she exclaimed mr yates has not spoken on the subject to me it is sufficient for me that he has told others upon whom i can rely the whole story of your brother's disgraced connection with that married woman with whose dishonoured name i will not sully my lips is that the true or is it not you say the truth can do you no harm the fact is true replied mary who had grown very white oh mary mary exclaimed mrs grant let us come away now that we know the worst no answered mary who was retaining her calmness by a great effort we will not deprive lady catherine of the pleasure of telling all she has heard and you express no contrition you shameless you bad hearted girl broke out lady catherine giving rein to her anger you think it can do you no harm to have all known of that shocking affair which alone should make you shun the society of respectable persons but beyond and above all that there are your own intrigues with the two brothers of that wretched woman one of whom you enticed away from the girl to whom he was attached and your own flirtations here which i will not enter into but which i have watched taking place under my very eyes that will do i think said mary raising her hand you can have nothing further to say you have insulted us in every possible manner i only hope lady catherine that by this outrage you will consider yourself to have taken ample revenge how dare you speak so to my poor sister demanded mrs grant wrath at last overmastering her distress if you only knew the real truth of the matter if you only knew who had suffered and who was to be blamed god forgive you your wicked thoughts and your poisonous tongue hush hush frances interposed mary drawing her sister away do not try to convince her she is not worth it and the two sisters left the room and walked with fairly firm steps downstairs where they procured their cloaks and mrs grant was able by drawing down her hood to conceal the traces of her emotion mary directed a servant to bring her instrument downstairs and they awaited it within the cloak room a few minutes later the servant knocked at the door asking for miss crawford and both ladies hastened forward expecting the announcement of their coach but mary drew back on encountering the pale and anxious gaze of colonel fitzwilliam and hearing his eager words i feared i had missed you that you had gone i searched for you through the rooms and then i heard you were with my aunt is anything the matter dear miss crawford i fear there is something it is of no consequence thank you colonel fitzwilliam she replied speaking with cold pride you are come a little too late to be of any assistance i see the footman has brought my harp so if you will kindly allow us to leave the house that is the most you can do i implore you not to speak so dearest miss crawford he exclaimed though keeping his voice low on account of the persons standing round is there nothing i can do nothing i can put right i could i am sure if only i knew what had happened lady catherine can best inform you of that returned mary in icy tones may i again request that you will ask for our carriage one moment only and i will not detain you he said hurriedly may i call on you to morrow at an early hour pray give me permission i shall not be at home to morrow answered mary and swept proudly past him towards the front door where a footman had just announced mrs grant's carriage stops the way mrs grant exclaimed colonel fitzwilliam placing himself beside that lady as she followed her sister you will allow me to come and see you i will not torment your sister but you will not close your door on me without at least explaining the reason for this dreadful change oh colonel fitzwilliam exclaimed mrs grant with difficulty controlling her agitation if you knew all you would not expect me to receive you but i cannot altogether refuse only i must have time to reflect to consider and my sister must be my first care he could only bow and acquiesce and he assisted her into the carriage which immediately rolled away chapter vi mr and mrs darcy were dismayed at the haggard aspect of their cousin when he joined them at breakfast the next morning he looked like a man who had not slept and whose wakefulness had some distressing cause to their inquiries he replied by giving as brief and quiet an account as he could of the incident of the preceding evening elizabeth exclaimed with consternation when he described miss crawford's manner to him at the door but refrained from making any comment until he had related how he had gone in search of his aunt to obtain if possible an explanation from her he had had to wait some time until all but one or two of the guests had gone and he could be alone with her but she had been most difficult to talk to on the subject when reproached with her treatment of miss crawford and mrs grant she had admitted that perhaps she did speak rather severely to miss crawford but the latter's attitude had annoyed her that everything she had said was fully justified and she was perfectly convinced that miss crawford was a most undesirable person and one she should never have had in her house good heavens can such things be said without impunity exclaimed elizabeth what did you say robert colonel fitzwilliam replied that he hoped he had controlled his temper but it had been no easy matter his aunt would not even substantiate her charges and only referred to the shocking conduct of miss crawford and her brother towards a family called bertram adding that though this information had only just come to her ears she believed that in london it was common property needless to say her nephew's assurances that whatever the brother might have done miss crawford herself was absolutely innocent of any wrongdoing whatever had not the slightest effect neither was she able to perceive that upon no basis but a shred of vulgar gossip she had done a vile thing in attacking and defaming two guests under her own roof that made her more enraged than ever continued colonel fitzwilliam she said it was not vulgar gossip but a well founded fact and though she evidently was under a promise not to reveal the source of her knowledge the word ferrars slipped out once so i was assured of what in fact i had guessed before namely to whom we owe this whole abominable affair it is most deplorable said darcy gravely we can never regret it enough i am sorry for you fitzwilliam and still more sorry for mrs grant and her sister but i do not see that there is anything to be done beyond apologies from all who are in any way connected with my aunt it must be talked of as little as possible for miss crawford's sake the ferrars will do their mischievous part and it must be the duty of her friends to take it for granted and ignore it there is a modicum of truth in the story i suppose i do not know or wish to know anything about it began fitzwilliam but elizabeth interposed eagerly i can tell you all there is to know i heard the story if you can call it so from anne wentworth only the other day but i did not mention it again for there is no use in reviving these things it is true that miss crawford's brother ran away with mrs rushworth who had been miss bertram he had treated her very badly before her marriage gaining her affections and then showing her he did not intend to marry her mary crawford had been on terms of friendship with the whole family and one of the brothers a young bertram had paid her attention naturally the scandal of the divorce separated the two families and i suppose ill natured people can find some reason why mary should be blamed for it but i know of none how came mrs wentworth to be acquainted with these events asked darcy colonel fitzwilliam seemed to pay little heed he rose from the table leaving his untasted breakfast because they have a great friend a naval officer young lieutenant price who is also connected with the bertrams his sister married one of the sons in fact she was adopted by the family as a child and would naturally know all its affairs i suppose the ferrars got their information from that mr yates who was there last night i do not know anything about him but i will ask anne wentworth you know my advice which is as little said as possible was darcy's reply and he crossed to the window to lay his hand on his cousin's shoulder and say warmly do not take it too much to heart my dear fellow on reflection miss crawford when she is a little less upset will see that you are not to blame and mrs grant who is evidently a sensible woman will take the right line when she has had time to think things over i hope so returned colonel fitzwilliam but very little hope was expressed in his voice or bearing i wish we could stay another day or two to do some good in this miserable business exclaimed elizabeth we might even now put off starting no elizabeth we could hardly do that and it would not be advisable said darcy with decision none of us could make my aunt's peace with these ladies and if we have to make our own as well as robert his we can do it better by letter by the way robert how do you stand with my aunt we parted in anger i fear replied fitzwilliam it was inevitable after the argument we had had it is immaterial to me she knows now that i am an advocate for miss crawford and she will consequently not expect to see me again in spite of what you say darcy i do think we might do some good elizabeth interrupted let us countermand the carriage we can easily tell the landlord we wish to keep these rooms till monday fitzwilliam begged his cousins not to put themselves to such an inconvenience on his account and darcy being also unwilling to change his plans at the moment when the carriages were driving to the door elizabeth was obliged to give up the idea which she did with greater reluctance through feeling that had she not persuaded miss crawford to go to lady catherine's reception this disaster would not have occurred revolving in her mind plans for the future when all the parties concerned should be removed from the influences at work in bath she continued her preparations for departure and when all was ready and the luggage placed on the vehicles she walked downstairs with colonel fitzwilliam speaking words of consolation and encouragement to him promising to write to miss crawford from their first stopping place and urging him to wait patiently and not be deterred by mary's being reluctant to see him again for some time after her very painful experience he promised not to give up hope but feared that this might cause him to lose the ground he had gained you are very good elizabeth he said as they shook hands whatever happiness comes out of this i shall owe to you but it is beyond what i can expect there never was much reason why she should look at me and now if she connects me with this wretched affair there is less than ever elizabeth once more earnestly begged him to take a more cheerful view and immediately afterwards she and darcy started their long journey northwards and their cousin having exchanged a few words with james morland who had walked round to the hotel a few moments earlier to take leave of his friends returned to his own rooms and to the thought of mary crawford which indeed was never absent from him his eagerness to be with her once more was only exceeded by his desire to protect her fair name against the danger which threatened it and in spite of darcy's advice he came to the conclusion after long thought that he was justified in going first to the ferrars's and then if necessary to mr yates to demand that whoever was responsible for the calumny should retract it he did not wish to pose as mary's champion until she had given him the right to take a warmer interest in her than he might yet assert but as he could not in any case have failed to be aware of the insult last night and as he was at the same time miss crawford's friend and lady catherine's nephew he felt that he could do no less than endeavour to right the wrong himself having been unsuccessful in an appeal to his aunt which seemed the most direct he accordingly repaired at once to the ferrars's lodgings the address of which had been given to him by anne steele on one of the many occasions on which she had begged him to call there a request hitherto ignored and as soon as he was shown into the room he perceived that his two errands would be accomplished in one as mr yates was sitting with the ferrars and miss steele fitzwilliam would neither shake hands nor take the offered seat and addressing himself to ferrars and mr yates he requested in a tone as calm and deliberate as he could make it that they would immediately and unreservedly withdraw all the accusations they had brought against miss crawford and would furthermore go to lady catherine and make to her the same complete denial of their previous statements he was careful to utter miss crawford's name as seldom as possible and refrained from demanding an apology to be made to her personally as he felt the greatest delicacy about appearing to act on her behalf and could judge also that it was not the unkind talk but the insult from her hostess that had given her such deep offence he found his present task an easier one than he had expected and had his heart been lighter he could have derived amusement from witnessing the kind of turmoil which his words immediately created amongst his hearers neither robert ferrars nor mr yates was of a quarrelsome disposition they were alike in living only for trifles and in being of an idle careless gossiping nature tolerably good humoured when it did not interfere with their pleasure or comfort at that moment the matter of greatest importance to them was to set themselves right with this extremely distinguished gentleman who came to them with an air of such authority and they hastened with the utmost zeal to assure and protest to deny regret or explain away whatever might have happened to annoy any friend of his robert ferrars who beyond listening eagerly to the story had had nothing to do with the affair was not long in discovering that his wife and her sister were really responsible for the mischief and both he and mr yates bitterly reproached the ladies for having broken their promise and carried mr yates's information to lady catherine anne steele's composure was not proof against this attack especially in the presence of her admired colonel fitzwilliam and she found a burst of tears the most convenient resource but lucy defended herself with spirit and declared that she had only told lady catherine what it was right for her to know as certainly her ladyship would not wish to receive miss crawford if half of what mr yates had said was true this produced a renewed flood of eloquence from mr yates who denied in the handsomest manner having said anything to miss crawford's disadvantage and wound up by boldly asserting that she was a lady for whom he had the greatest respect that she could not help the faults of her brother and that as for edmund bertram everyone considered that it was he who had treated her badly hanging round her always and never making her an offer we none of us knew what he could be at colonel fitzwilliam intimated that he did not wish to know any of these particulars that he was come simply because he had learnt that lady catherine in consequence of what she had heard had been led to treat her guests with great injustice injustice was the strongest word he would allow himself to use and that for everyone's sake it was highly necessary for her mind to be disabused of all false impressions mr yates when it was made clear to him professed himself perfectly ready to go to lady catherine and give her what he termed the true facts and he heartily supported colonel fitzwilliam in the latter's request that mr ferrars should accompany him mr ferrars looked from his friend to his wife extremely ruffled and uncomfortable lucy was reduced to such a state of anger that she could scarcely speak but mr yates speedily recovered his usual state of easy insouciance and volubility and was the only one of the party able to walk with colonel fitzwilliam to the door and usher him out with many bows and smiles and promises to wait on him in the course of a day or two to tell him the result of his forthcoming interview mr yates was not a man who could long be disconcerted by anything and he probably looked forward to his scene with lady catherine as one in which he could play a leading part colonel fitzwilliam walked away smiling for a moment at the thought of the storm of mutual recrimination that was going on in the room he had just left he feared that what he had achieved would be of little use for his aunt would be much more desirous of believing the first version than the second everything depended now upon the effect of his own influence upon mary and her sister upon whether he could succeed in atoning to them to any extent for what they had suffered he greatly distrusted his own powers and walked to their house in the deepest dejection of spirits the servant said the ladies were at home and he waited for some time in the drawing room mrs grant's countenance when at last she appeared was not such as to reassure him she did not ask him to sit down and remained herself standing at a little distance while she explained briefly and formally that her sister was not at all well and was unable to receive visitors colonel fitzwilliam's heart sank at this confirmation of his worst fears he hastened to reply that he knew he could not have expected her to be willing to see any member of his family after what had happened the night before but that he brought the sincerest most heartfelt apologies on his own behalf and that of his cousins he was only too sensible that nothing he could say could obliterate the memory of the treatment to which mrs grant and her sister had been subjected but he had been endeavouring to right the wrong and hoped that when lady catherine should be brought to acknowledge mrs grant here interrupted him colonel fitzwilliam i must tell you plainly that it is not of the slightest use to mention that lady's name to my sister or myself i know you mean very kindly but the harm is done now and nothing lady catherine can do or say can repair it i do not wish to go into the whole matter it is too unspeakably painful but if you had been aware of the language she used towards us you would see that it is not a thing which can ever be forgotten i had almost said forgiven colonel fitzwilliam admitted it fully he told her who were the real authors of the calumny as far as regarded lady catherine and he could guess how she had been incited to anger and how she must have spoken even though he had not been present and he repeated that lady catherine would be enlightened and would regret as much as anyone having spoken so hastily but none of this had any effect on mrs grant she gradually realized colonel fitzwilliam's anxiety to spare her and her sister pain and thanked him for what he had endeavoured to do but concluded by saying that she sympathized with her sister in feeling that all intercourse between the two families had better cease colonel fitzwilliam's dismay was extreme he felt himself dismissed but rallied his energies enough to ask but you do not identify us mrs grant my cousins and myself with everything that my aunt does surely you must know mrs darcy at least better than to include her in such a condemnation mrs grant appeared confused mrs darcy has been very kind she said hesitatingly i have appreciated it there seemed a but behind this and colonel fitzwilliam gently pressed for further reasons when the lady at last said the truth is colonel fitzwilliam if you will have it my sister feels and i though not going the whole way with her do understand her point of view feels at present too bitterly about it to be able to judge impartially she thinks that she should not have allowed mrs darcy to over persuade her that she did wrongly to go to lady catherine's on what was practically mrs darcy's invitation good god broke from fitzwilliam but she does not consider my cousin in any way to blame for this behaviour of my aunt's no certainly not returned mrs grant she blames herself as i have said but she regrets also that mrs darcy took so many pains to induce lady catherine to show us any civility lady catherine disliked us and when the opportunity of showing her real feelings arrived she was glad to take full advantage of it mrs grant believe me it is not as you think said fitzwilliam earnestly my aunt is just now entirely in the hands of some evil natured and unscrupulous persons who can make her act in any way they choose it may be so i try to think so but it does not excuse her conduct returned mrs grant fitzwilliam took two or three turns about the room wrapped in thought at length he approached mrs grant and in tones which scarcely concealed his emotion said forgive me but i cannot take what you say as final it is of course for you and your sister to decide but i cannot think that you mean to cast us off myself and my cousins on account of this thing which has happened a thing which you know we deplore as much as we condemn may i not hope to be allowed to call upon your sister if only for a few minutes not to day i know but to morrow or the next day mrs grant i have no right to say anything but i think you can guess what it means to me mrs grant's countenance softened and she spoke more kindly than she had done during the interview i will not pretend to misunderstand you colonel fitzwilliam but frankly my sister would not see you just now and it would do no good to anyone if you did see her her feelings have been deeply wounded more deeply probably than you have any idea of it would be far better for you not to think of it any more you are shortly quitting bath we too shall be leaving for the summer and at some future time we may possibly meet again and be able then to gather up the threads of our friendship fitzwilliam had turned very pale for though partly prepared for the blow he had hoped for some mitigating circumstances and mrs grant's words conveyed to him at that moment nothing but a counsel of despair he could not immediately reply but mastering himself with an effort he said steadily i only care for your sister's happiness and whatever she wishes shall be done then bowed and quickly left the room mrs grant left alone reflected with an aching heart upon the scene that had just closed resentful though she felt both on mary's account and her own yet she had been a very unwilling bearer of the message which she had delivered to her visitor she had liked him she liked him still she had observed with keen pleasure the growing mutual attraction between himself and mary for she considered him almost worthy of that beloved sister the event of the night before had not shaken that belief whoever was to blame for it she knew it was not lady catherine's nephew and when she had partly recovered from her agitation she had tried to persuade mary to do him equal justice knowing well that he would not let the matter rest and that they would hear from him again but mary had been unpersuadable the shock had been very great not only from the incredible insult but from the sight of the buried past risen up again to be an undying reproach to her all that she most bitterly regretted of her own acts and of other persons' all that she most wished to forget had been revived in her mind exactly at a time when she had allowed herself to think that a new prospect of happiness might be opening up before her in the midst of a set of people and circumstances with which the past should be wholly unconnected but now the painful memories had intruded into the present and thrust upon her in a peculiarly galling manner threatened to mar and taint the new life mary's mind was in a state of too great distress and tumult for her to see that their power of doing so lay in her own hands that she only could let herself fall back into that wretched listless discontented condition from which she had so lately emerged she only knew that the old influences had returned and she was bitterly angry at the knowledge in response to her sister's pleading she replied that she was determined not to see any of them again they were all alike proud and hard hearted they patronized her they made her do things she did not want to do and she wished she had never met one of them mrs grant ventured to speak a word on colonel fitzwilliam's behalf but mary sore at heart and suffering the more for knowing she was unjust replied that colonel fitzwilliam meant well but really he ought to keep his most terrible old aunt in better order she would not confess even to herself far less to her sister how much she had learned to care for the man whom she was now sending away through wounded pride perversity anger she could hardly have told for what reason mrs grant could only endeavour to soothe and sympathize she saw it was better not to continue the discussion of the subject and looked forward to the lapse of time and a change of scene and companionship to restore to mary some measure of comfort and serenity of these blessings colonel fitzwilliam was in even greater need he walked back to the hotel in an agony of mind such as he had never before in his life experienced to the pain of his disappointment was added hopelessness for he felt that the cause of his repulse lay beyond his power to remove she was too deeply offended to see him or to hear what he had to say and as she would not do these things he thought she could not possibly care for him and now completely cut off from her he had no chance of ever winning his way his anger against his aunt remained unabated but even were she persuaded to make all the reparation in her power he had been told that it would be unavailing there was nothing more that anyone could do he called his servant and gave him directions for leaving bath early on the following day then made a pretence of dining and threw himself into his chair for an evening of sad and solitary reflection it was nearly half past nine when a card was brought up to him and it was with a start of surprise that he recollected he had been promised a visit from mr yates that gentleman well bred easy and talkative as usual was shown into his room a few moments later colonel fitzwilliam had never been more ill disposed to receive a guest but this one must be listened to and it was a relief when he passed from his compliments and observations on the weather to the business at hand which he introduced with an air of nonchalance as if he had only just remembered what he had come to say by the way colonel he began i was calling on lady catherine this afternoon and i took the opportunity of mentioning to her that subject which we were discussing this morning did you indeed returned colonel fitzwilliam and i hope you were able to convince her why as to that proceeded mr yates settling himself more comfortably in his chair i hardly know i have seldom found a lady so hard to convince but wishing to oblige you my dear sir i did my best in all honesty i did my best i explained as i told you i should that she had been quite misled miss crawford was not at all the sort of person she assumed her to be and that was very nearly the end of our conversation for i give you my word colonel with all respect to her ladyship that she became quite violent declared that she did not want to hear the young lady's name or another word about her that she was tired to death of the whole affair it is probable she would not like to find she had made a mistake said fitzwilliam as mr yates paused evidently expecting some comment well no i suppose that was what caused the sting for it seemed as though she did not want to have to think well of miss crawford which could not be so really you know i told her what i had said i mean what i had intended to convey to the ferrars that i was surprised no one knew the story about her brother and added that i could not imagine how anyone could twist and turn my remarks merely general ones made in no ill natured spirit to miss crawford's disadvantage that set her off cross questioning me as to what there was at the back of it all till i hardly knew where i was and i finally had to point out to her that owing to my connection with the family i could not enter into the details of its affairs he paused again and fitzwilliam forced himself to say i am obliged to you for doing what you could though i feared it might not be of much avail true enough i thought it was not going to be but just at the end her ladyship said evidently with much resentment 'there must be something in all this though you deny it why should mrs ferrars and miss steele concoct a story to tell me why should it be in their interest to vilify miss crawford there was no reason why they should make the worst of what they had heard' so of course in reply to that i simply told her the truth 'my dear lady catherine' i said 'you ask why the reason is as everyone knows that mrs ferrars was anxious to secure colonel fitzwilliam for her sister and both the ladies were very much disappointed when he paid attention to miss crawford instead' why colonel you are looking quite annoyed don't trouble to protest my dear sir between friends you know it is not necessary i wish you would confine yourself to talking of things you know something about mr yates broke out the colonel in extreme vexation this is not one of them nonsense my good sir not know anything about it i could not fail to see what was before my very eyes before ever we started for your aunt's reception last night mrs ferrars and her sister were talking of you in a manner as to make me expect that it would be you who would be in attendance on miss steele all the evening or at all events that that was what she hoped for of course i said not a word but i could see that things turned out very differently and if that were not enough ferrars himself told me all about it during the evening of miss steele's fancy and what they had planned and so on really i can hardly suppose that being as they are such friends of lady catherine's she should not have had some idea of it fitzwilliam had not thought that anything was needed to complete his disgust and annoyance where the whole ferrars party was concerned but this tale of gossip and vulgar intrigue had that effect and he was conscious of a strong desire to get rid of his visitor and hear no more of the whole nauseous affair he rose and again thanked mr yates coldly for the trouble he had taken and that gentleman too courteous not to take the hint rose also though with evident unwillingness to end the conversation and drawing near the fire stretched out a foot towards the blaze and continued but i must not leave you with the impression that lady catherine was not convinced on the contrary i am inclined to think she eventually was for her manner quite changed after what i had told her she seemed first astonished at it and showed considerable incredulity and indignation asking how anyone dared to think or say such a thing though as i explained to her sorry though i was to have given her any unpleasing intelligence the idea did not emanate from me upon that she became calmer and seemed to be reflecting then thanked me and asked to be excused requesting me if i was going back to the lodgings to send mrs ferrars and miss steele to her at once i was not particularly anxious to be her messenger and i fancy she saw this for she called me back and said that it did not signify she would write to them instead i have gathered said fitzwilliam that mr ferrars did not accompany you on this occasion oh lord no i should have mentioned that at first but it escaped me no i could not persuade him to come i fancy he had private information that his wife did not wish it it was a pity as he might have confirmed your statements and afforded further proof to lady catherine observed colonel fitzwilliam he might have said something no doubt but i hardly think he would have succeeded if i had failed was mr yates's complacent reply my dear sir i think you may sleep easily if lady catherine is not persuaded of her error now she never will be at this moment she is very probably explaining to the ferrars how unfortunately they have caused her to be mistaken colonel fitzwilliam felt tolerably certain that his aunt was doing nothing of the kind and that the interview pictured by mr yates was turning upon a different subject from miss crawford's rehabilitation but even if mr yates's explanation had caused the ferrars to fall into disfavour it would not mean that the harm they had done the day before would be wiped out lady catherine would not be more inclined to forgive miss crawford because her own friends had made her angry and angry fitzwilliam guessed that she must be at the machinations which mr yates had casually disclosed it was always particularly offensive to her and her nephew could conjecture that even the tact and ready wit of mrs ferrars would not be able to avert the torrent of her displeasure it was but poor comfort to him to feel assured that she would disapprove of miss steele as a possible wife for him quite as much as miss crawford and the very idea that such an alternative could have been thought of was so repugnant to him that he was glad to dismiss it from his mind these people had done their worst and whatever happened now they could not injure miss crawford any more or blight his own prospects more completely mr yates having as he considered disposed of the subject in hand proceeded to others but colonel fitzwilliam contrived to cut him short and to hasten his guest's departure by indicating his wish to make preparations for his early start the following morning mr yates was desolated to hear that the colonel would actually have left bath by eight o'clock he himself proposed leaving on the morrow he had come intending to stay with the ferrars for a week but really everything was so infernally upset owning to this tiresome affair he declared mrs ferrars had as good as called him a liar and that he was inclined to shorten his visit and go straight to his sister's place in berkshire he feared he could not be ready before twelve noon would not colonel fitzwilliam delay in starting and accept of a seat in his curricle the colonel regretted it was not in his power but thought mr yates was doing wisely in going away and in his own mind added the heartily expressed wish that that well meaning gentleman had never come chapter vii the darcys travelled slowly and they had not been at home for long before a letter from their cousin who had gone direct to london from bath was received by darcy colonel fitzwilliam briefly related what had occurred after their departure his application to ferrars and yates with its more or less successful result and his totally unsuccessful visit to mrs grant he omitted of course all reference to the second part of yates's conversation with lady catherine and stated his few facts with the smallest amount of comment adding that he was grateful to his cousins for their kindness in the affair but in the circumstances he thought it would be better not to return to pemberley for the present but to try to occupy his mind with some work he had therefore accepted an offer made to him by one of his brother officers to collaborate in writing a history of his regiment and he proposed to remain in london where he would have access to manuscripts and authorities darcy need have no fear that he would not correspond as regularly as usual and he would call in at the hursts' while they remained in town so that he would be in continual touch with as he said in conclusion the best friends a man ever had elizabeth sighed over this letter but consoled herself presently with the thought that mrs grant and miss crawford might possibly be in town during the summer darcy on the other hand was well satisfied with it deeming that his cousin had acted with perfect uprightness and he begged elizabeth to give up the idea of trying to bring them all together at some future time fitzwilliam my dear is of an age when he can be trusted to manage his own affairs as this proves to us he said to her i do not think it proves much except that aunt catherine is the cruel domineering old woman we always knew her to be replied elizabeth poor robert to think of his being so abominably treated of course a true honest man as he is was powerless among these insufferable people who have not a word of truth amongst them elizabeth indeed felt acutely disappointed at such a disastrous and unforeseen ending to her hopes she blamed herself bitterly for her share in the disaster and again regretted having persuaded miss crawford to come to the reception she had written to mary according to promise at the first opportunity but not for more than a week after their return home was an answer received and then it was a disappointment like all the rest merely a note brief and tremulous acknowledging mrs darcy's kindness and apologies begging that no more might be said as to the offence and breaking off with assurance of the writer's good will but of her inability to express herself at greater length the only sign of the real mary appeared in the postscript i will write again by and by dear mrs darcy if you will not mind very stupid letters the lines of the note clearly showed the writer's shaken health although her pride forbade her to make it her excuse elizabeth was grieved and felt herself for the time being repulsed she resolved to send after a time a cheerful letter on different subjects which might re establish their friendship on new ground so that the painful memories which miss crawford at present associated with the darcy family might by degrees be eradicated these anxieties occupying her thoughts and her time being taken up with her children and with georgiana who had returned to pemberley in greatly improved health and spirits she still did not fail to remark the absence of any news of lady catherine for she had fully expected a speedy communication announcing the lady's triumph over miss crawford and ignoring all that had followed it when her husband therefore in opening a letter one morning observed that it was from his aunt she was prepared for something considerably more disagreeable than its contents proved to be the letter began by announcing lady catherine's recent return home with her daughter and the extreme pleasure of mr and mrs collins and of all their neighbours in seeing them again the worthy rector and his wife had come up to rosings to pay their respects on the very first evening mrs jenkinson had not yet come back from her vacation she had in fact written to ask leave to stay for another week which was excessively inconvenient as dear anne depended upon her so much anne's sensibility was indeed very great she might not have inherited her mother's strength of character but she had such warm affections they sometimes led her to form attachments to people who proved unworthy of such devotion there had just been an unfortunate instance of that during their stay at bath darcy who had been reading the letter out loud to his wife and sister hesitated at this point but elizabeth urged him to go on saying that georgiana knew all about the ferrars and was as anxious as herself to learn whether their reign was over you and elizabeth have probably heard something of the regrettable termination to my reception on your last evening in bath the young lady whom elizabeth was so obstinately anxious for me to patronize must have acted at some former time with extreme imprudence to say the least of it though i really do not feel it to be my duty to investigate the rights and wrongs of the matter still the information i received was so positive that i was bound to act upon it and to point out to her that i regretted having brought her into my immediate circle of friends i think i may say that she or at any rate her sister admitted the justice of my remarks there i hoped the matter would have ended but immediately afterwards i learned that the very persons from whom i had received this friendly warning about miss crawford had been themselves acting towards me in a scandalously hypocritical and underhand manner you will guess that i refer to the robert ferrars and miss steele i cannot enter into particulars of their conduct suffice it to say that for all the latter part of their stay in bath it has been a continual course of deception of nefarious and vulgar schemes for their own aggrandizement they have traded upon my kindness and upon the warm regard which my poor innocent hearted anne displayed towards miss steele to foster the most impudent designs never have i been so mistaken in people whom i regarded as deserving of my interest never have i met with such vile ingratitude you may imagine that i lost no time in sending for the whole family and informing them that our acquaintance was at an end for the reasons i have given and naturally i declined to listen to any defence miss steele was utterly confounded but mrs ferrars seeing that her whole plot was exposed showed herself in her true colours she lost control of herself and used expressions more insolent than anyone has ever dared to do in my presence indeed she was so determined to be heard that it was only by leaving the room myself and sending my footman to show them out that i was able to rid myself of their presence the man is a mere weak fool i could see that by the way he ineffectually tried to control his wife but even he seemed to have no sense of the impropriety of her conduct and her sister's it is easily conjectured that after such a shock as this all enjoyment in bath for me was entirely at an end we should have left immediately but that anne was too unwell on hearing what had happened to travel for another week my indignation at the whole affair is still beyond words darcy paused and elizabeth asked is that all the letter fitzwilliam yes he replied that is she signs her name there but there is a postscript which is evidently intended for your perusal elizabeth took the letter which he handed to her and read were it not that out of pure perversity elizabeth always chooses to act exactly the opposite to my advice i should suggest that you proceed very cautiously in any further dealings you may have with the young lady i mentioned above elizabeth flushed deeply and laid down the letter but immediately took it up again and re read lady catherine's version of the ferrars's defeat meanwhile georgiana was eagerly asking what does aunt catherine mean darcy she writes strangely does she not how can those people have nefarious schemes or designs against her she does not say how she knew they had i hardly understand it all said darcy but you know your aunt has often been disappointed in people before when they have desired more of her favour than she was prepared to give yes she takes great fancies and then forgets about people returned georgiana but she really seems to be dreadfully angry this time elizabeth says that you and she did not like those people the ferrars no we did not for we considered them undesirable replied darcy and whatever reason your aunt has for quarreling with them undoubtedly it is well she should have done so georgiana perceived that she was not to hear more about the ferrars and dropped the subject which in fact was what darcy wished for it was a distasteful one to him for they had aroused his dislike more than most of his aunt's proteges and he was glad to hear they had fallen from favour without being interested in the reason for it elizabeth was quite aware of this and accordingly refrained from any further discussion of her aunt's letter with her husband she could not forbear a little private smile over the exposure of the impudent designs the nature of which she had quickly surmised in the circumstances she thought they had hardly merited such severe strictures as those passed on them by lady catherine and but for mrs ferrars's unpardonable conduct towards miss crawford elizabeth might have spared her some pity for the manner of her dismissal from pulteney street georgiana took an early opportunity of asking elizabeth about the references to miss crawford that is your friend of whom you told me is it not elizabeth i wonder what really happened and why aunt catherine speaks of her so harshly it seems very unkind it was very unkind georgiana of course aunt catherine was entirely misinformed she listened to some malicious gossip and was terribly rude to miss crawford at the end of the evening after we left i heard about it from robert who stayed later than we did and the worst of it is that in consequence miss crawford feels deeply wounded i fear as regards the whole family oh i am so sorry what a pity it is cannot anything be done surely you will be able to put it all right again some time will you not i hope so yes of course i shall do whatever is possible i should be so extremely sorry to lose sight of her now she must be charming from all you say commented georgiana and then asked rather shyly and with a deep blush did cousin robert like her too yes he liked her very much i think you know she played the harp and he is so fond of anything to do with music yes i know said georgiana and added in a low voice i remember he would always much rather have listened to my playing than have talked to me do not let yourself grieve georgiana said elizabeth kissing the young girl's fair brow you know that robert has the greatest possible regard for you and you will find next time you meet that you are the best of friends georgiana smiled rather sadly she often felt that she must have not only fallen in the estimation of a cousin she revered but that she must also be possessed of no qualities capable of inspiring affection and what was even worse of no heart of her own to give elizabeth understood her well and tried often to give her more self confidence and to raise her lowly opinion of herself but though she was growing less reserved and more disposed little by little to trust her own judgments the old habits of timidity of reliance on the guidance of those whom she loved were still strong in her elizabeth would often refuse to decide a thing for her but when she was helped to weigh it in the balance to judge it by all the standards available her choice could always be recommended for discretion and clear sightedness the month of may was now nearly half way through and the time was approaching when james morland was expected to pay a visit to his friends at pemberley so much of their stay at bath had been productive of disappointment that they looked back upon their acquaintance with this young man as its one circumstance of unalloyed pleasure darcy whose regard for him had grown very warm had received letters from home which enabled him prior to leaving bath to inform morland that a living in his gift would shortly be vacant and that he would have the pleasure in offering it to morland when the time came this important communication had been received by the young clergyman with a depth of joy and gratitude which had increased the darcys' satisfaction in being able to assist him the living though not a rich one would suffice for his needs as he possessed some capital advanced by his father and its situation in a hilly and bracing country district made it most desirable for a person whose health like his own had to be considered the conversation between himself and darcy which had been very short had taken place only the day before the latter's departure and morland still scarcely realizing his good fortune had hurried round to the hotel the following morning to repeat his acknowledgments to both his friends and to make his adieux there was time only for a very few words to be exchanged at the house door and morland found it difficult to express himself fluently on a subject which lay so near his heart but elizabeth and her husband set him at his ease with a few kind remarks repeating cordially an invitation already given that he come and stay with them on the conclusion of his visit to the portinscales since their return home the resignation of the old rector at kympton the living in question had been made public he was to leave within a few weeks so that morland's visit would afford him as the rector designate an opportunity of getting to know the place and of meeting some of his future parishioners pemberley was not in the parish for kympton was eighteen miles away but the link between the two places had always been strong and the distance was frequently bridged for desborough park the home of the bingleys was the principal house in kympton parish and only a mile and a half from the parsonage house morland's pleasure was extreme on hearing that his nearest neighbours would be the brother in law and favourite sister of mrs darcy next to being within a stone's throw of the darcys themselves it was the best thing imaginable morland arrived at pemberley late one afternoon just in time to prepare for dinner and was introduced to miss darcy when they all assembled in the drawing room before the meal georgiana's intense shyness generally caused her to appear at a disadvantage with strangers but there was something in the young man's open countenance and pleasing unaffected manners that attracted everyone to him at first sight and they were soon chatting together completely at their ease morland was deeply interested in everything that he could learn of his future home and asked eager questions of his hosts georgiana had been so lately staying at desborough and had while there so frequently called on old dr and mrs taylor that she was able to give more particulars of the house and garden than her brother and sister were able to recollect the evening passed quickly away with conversation and music and morland learned that on the following morning the whole party were to drive over to desborough park to dinner starting early that they might have time to walk through the village and inspect the church and parsonage as well the weather proved propitious and the drive through some of the most beautiful vales of derbyshire was agreeable to all but especially delightful to morland feeling as he did that he was within reach of the goal he had so long desired restored health and the power to do the work he loved amid congenial surroundings it was in vain that darcy not wishing to raise his hopes too high told him that the parish was very scattered and the roads bad that the climate was exceedingly cold and the distant cottages were almost inaccessible in stormy weather that some of the farmers were people of a very independent way of thinking difficult to get on with he could discover no drawback only fresh incentives to throw himself into his task elizabeth commended him for his enthusiasm but added a sly reminder that he might be disappointed in the house large rambling and picturesque though it may seem when tenanted by the taylors and their seven children it would she feared be an inconvenient residence to a bachelor it will be too big i have no doubt responded morland but you know i need not furnish more than a part of it besides i intend as soon as i am thoroughly settled to have my sister sarah to stay with me if she can be spared from home georgiana was interested in hearing of the sister and james morland at her request gave an account of his home at fullerton and of his brother and sisters eight besides himself and catherine who was now mrs henry tilney catherine was evidently the favourite there was a smile and a lightening of the eye when he spoke of her he wished it had been possible for her to come and help him with his settling in but they lived such a great distance away woodston was forty miles away from bath quite at the other end of somerset mr darcy's chaise and four rolled through the village of kympton not long after twelve o'clock and paused to put down its owner his sister and his young guest there was so much to see but georgiana was an untiring walker and intended staying with the gentlemen until the carriage should be sent back to bring them to desborough in time for an early dinner elizabeth drove on for another two miles and was presently alighting at the door of a handsome modern house built in the italian style and being warmly welcomed by bingley and jane whom she had not seen for some weeks bingley on hearing what had become of the rest of the party immediately decided to walk down to meet them and the sisters strolled into the garden for the weather was remarkably warm and sunny for that time of year and they could venture to seat themselves upon a bench that was sheltered by an angle of the house whence a beautiful view was obtained of the wide spreading park with its chestnut trees in full bloom and clumps of pink and white hawthorns desborough was not so imposing and extensive a place as pemberley but it was pleasant and home like and the grounds were particularly delightful including as they did an orchard a shrubbery and lawns and flower borders laid out in a series of terraces which sloped towards the park the bingleys took great pleasure in their garden and had made many additions and improvements during the two years of their occupancy i am overjoyed that you are come lizzie began jane for i have so much to tell and ask i have not seen you since we brought georgiana home nearly a month ago you really think she is better elizabeth warmly assented and declared that georgiana seemed in greater spirits than she had been for many months jane anxiously inquired after fitzwilliam and elizabeth made out as good an account of him as she could but as she was naturally not at liberty to mention what had passed at bath she could not perfectly satisfy jane as to his well being choosing a safer subject she talked of mr morland praised his modesty ability and good sense and repeated her conviction that the bingleys would find him a thoroughly agreeable neighbour jane listened with interest and promised every kind of help and support to the new rector who was to come with such strong recommendations but she was clearly a little preoccupied and elizabeth seeing this asked what news she had to communicate i am afraid it is not very good news began jane hesitatingly but you will have guessed it i expect i have had a letter from lydia she is going abroad elizabeth fancy almost immediately poor lydia wickham's regiment is ordered to the west indies and he insists on her going with him i am not sure why it should be 'poor lydia' returned elizabeth smiling you have such a terribly compassionate heart jane i should think lydia would like the west indies very much though she probably dreads the voyage oh no she does not think she will like them at all it is so hot there and she cannot bear the idea of being waited on by negro servants she says there is only one consolation very few of the ladies of the regiment are going there will not be more than six of them and no one as young as herself since so many are staying behind i should have thought she could have arranged to do the same though i confess i think it is much better she should be with wickham yes you are right i believe elizabeth she says she would rather have stayed in england and that wickham declares he does not particularly want her only he cannot afford to keep up an establishment for her at home while he is abroad jane sighed it is very sad that they talk like that to one another i only hope they do not mean it elizabeth preferred to waive this question and continued i suppose she goes on to ask you for money jane admitted that this was so but said that lydia would need a suitable outfit for the west indies and everything of that kind was very expensive it appeared she added that lydia was anxious to come to derbyshire before she went away if a remittance for the journey could be sent but jane had not made any response to the suggestion no i do not think that that is at all necessary elizabeth remarked well jane of course i will give you some bank notes to send with your own on the usual condition that lydia does not know from whom they come but i only wish one could believe that they will be used for paying debts to the newcastle tradespeople of which there are sure to be plenty could you not persuade her to give you a statement of what she owes you could then perhaps arrange for some of them to be paid off first i will try i will ask bingley about it but it is very difficult to help lydia the way one would like she does expect the most extraordinary things what do you think of her inviting kitty to go to the west indies with her my father of course paying all expenses i am past feeling any astonishment at lydia's demands elizabeth said but i hope kitty had too much good sense even to think such a thing possible oh no i think she knew it would not be allowed though perhaps the idea was tempting to her poor kitty but she had her promised visit here to plead as an excuse she is coming you know towards the end of next month it has been arranged then i am so glad to hear it she must come on to pemberley and she and georgiana will enjoy being together again yes indeed but i hope she will stay with me until the autumn i wanted her to have come a little earlier but she has received an invitation from some people called knightley in london which she is very desirous of accepting and my father sees no objection yes i know of whom you mean i think they are friend of my uncle and aunt gardiner's and live in brunswick square i fancy it is not those knightleys but relations of theirs still we shall hear all about it very soon for i am expecting a letter from kitty at any moment to give me her direction in london and to tell me when she will be ready to leave for bingley is to go to fetch her is bingley going to town then i wonder if it could possibly be arranged for him to escort georgiana darcy had thought of going but he would be very glad not to if bingley would not find it any inconvenience i am sure bingley would be delighted she is going to the hursts' is she not i have heard mention of it yes mrs hurst and caroline have both written begging for a long visit from her i do not think it can be for more than a month as aunt catherine is sure to want her to go on to rosings when she hears she is so near georgiana does not like being away from home for long nor do we like to spare her i can quite understand that she has such a sweet disposition such sympathy and brightness and intelligence that it is a joy to have her companionship and you have improved her so much elizabeth at one time i thought her very difficult to approach but her manners have gained so much ease and elegance that everyone must be charmed with her from the first meeting i often think fitzwilliam must regret what he has lost my dear jane let me assure you for the twentieth time that he does not regret it nor can he be said to have lost what he never possessed their hearts were never united but now you will see that each will marry happily and their old friendship will survive unimpaired if you had seen fitzwilliam at bath you would have wasted no regrets on him now shall we walk about a little i want to discover if your lilacs are further advanced than ours three o'clock brought back the remainder of the party and mr morland was introduced to mrs bingley and found her a most sympathizing listener to his enthusiasm over his new home he was full of plans and was interested in everything from the beautiful little church down to the honeysuckle growing over the rectory porch darcy had promised him to have certain repairs and renovations made as soon as the taylor family should have quitted the house and faulty chimneys and new wallpapers formed topics for a kind of discussion which bingley thoroughly enjoyed and he would have presented his young guest with the contents of several rooms at desborough and the greater part of the stables if there had been the slightest chance of his accepting them there was not time to do more than begin on these important subjects to day for by half past four the visitors had to be in the carriage again but the proposal that bingley should take georgiana on her journey to london was brought forward and approved of by all concerned bingley was also going to his sister's house and it was immaterial to him what day he arrived there or how long he had to wait in london for kitty bennet he thought he had heard something about a ball for which kitty wished to stay but was uncertain about the date it was decided that their next letters from their relations in town should determine the time of their departure chapter viii morland was easily persuaded to prolong his stay at pemberley until his induction to his new living should take place this was expected to be not later than the end of june for dr taylor was anxious to hand over his duties to his successor as soon as possible morland was by no means an idler he spent a considerable part of his time in study and read and worked with mr ferrars helping him occasionally in parish duties the acquaintance of these two men formed directly after morland's arrival promised to ripen into a friendship there were similarities in their characters that mutually attracted them and on the tranquil simplicity of the life at the parsonage morland hoped to model his own the ferrars had so recently arrived at pemberley having as has been said exchanged livings with the former incumbent and left delaford shortly after colonel brandon's death that there had not been time for much intercourse between them and the darcys though elizabeth had been greatly pleased with what she had seen of mrs ferrars since the former's return from bath and after her experiences there of the other branch of the family she could appreciate fully the immense superiority of the edward ferrars over their relations ferrars himself was too quiet diffident and reserved a man to recommend himself easily but in his wife all recognized a woman of a rare and noble nature distinguished alike by the sweetness of her character and by its strength the darcys rejoiced in the increased opportunities of meeting afforded by the presence of their guest and various walks drives and out of doors excursions were organized for which the glorious weather of early june afforded every opportunity the first diminution their party suffered was in the departure of georgiana for london which occurred on the seventeenth of the month the visit had long been talked of and georgiana really looked forward with no little pleasure to seeing her old friends for caroline bingley and louisa took pains not to show to her of whom they were exceedingly fond the cold hearted and worldly aspect of their dispositions but when she found herself actually in the travelling carriage with bingley with her maid seated opposite she felt as she did every year the sensation of leaving all that she cared for behind her and of entering scenes alarming because unfamiliar bingley good naturedly endeavoured to divert her in every way talked of the pleasures awaiting her and of the friends she would see in london kitty bennet and mrs annesley besides her hostesses and casually mentioned the possibility of her coming across colonel fitzwilliam georgiana had been prepared for this by elizabeth and had first shrunk from the idea but afterwards became reconciled to the view put before her that the first meeting which must necessarily be painful must come some time and it would be best to get it over in a crowd with a few ordinary words of greeting which would put them on a comfortable footing for the future she therefore made an effort to reply cheerfully to all bingley's suggestions and had not found the journey tedious when they drew up in grosvenor street in time for dinner on the third day caroline and louisa could not make enough of her and the evening was spent in talking over the plans they had formed for her amusement and in detailing the engagements they had entered into it soon appeared that the ball which bingley had mentioned was on their list for they were also acquainted with mrs george knightley whose entertainment it was and had secured invitations from her for their brother and their young friend bingley inquired of the date of the ball explaining how it affected his movements and his sisters endeavoured to conceal their surprise on hearing that miss kitty bennet was staying with the knightleys i thought when you spoke of coming to fetch her charles that she was with her uncle and aunt in gracechurch street said miss bingley to tell the truth i was not very clear about it myself returned bingley jane told me that she was going to stay over this ball but whether she was with the gardiners or the knightleys i did not make out until just before we came away it does not make a vast deal of difference to my thinking there is certainly some difference the knightleys live in portland square for one thing replied miss bingley do they i am glad of that for it means i shall not have to drive so far round to pick kitty up was bingley's cheerful answer and he moved away to speak to mr hurst leaving his sisters to their speculations as to how miss bennet could have come to know the george knightleys georgiana did not know but conjectured it was through mr and mrs gardiner and the ladies though they refrained from showing their perplexity were even more puzzled to account for the uncle who lived in cheapside being acquainted with such people of fashion have you seen anything of fitzwilliam louisa inquired bingley of his eldest sister when he came to have his coffee cup refilled really charles what a foolish question to ask replied mrs hurst with affected carelessness of course we see him frequently when he is in town very good i hope he will come round while i am here and if not i shall get you to give me his direction for i must certainly look him up before i go back mrs hurst made a vague answer for both she and her sister were sincerely anxious to spare georgiana any embarrassment and they would not of their own accord have referred to fitzwilliam until they knew how she was able to bear the mention of his name in public caroline immediately began speaking of another subject but georgiana divining their intentions felt that she must not indulge in a foolish sensibility which might give her friends a false impression of the state of things so summoning all her courage she said with a deep blush but a tolerably firm voice yes i hope my cousin may be in town this month elizabeth and my brother gave me many messages for him if i should see him she was conscious that the ladies were looking at her in surprise but that bingley noticed nothing but the amount of milk louisa was putting in his coffee was a great help and caroline the next moment said quietly oh yes no doubt he will call which made it unnecessary for georgiana to say any more bingley having secured his cup next produced a notebook and proceeded to write down the address of fitzwilliam's lodgings and the name of his club and as an afterthought the various engagements to which he had been pledged by his sisters georgiana found that mrs hurst and caroline were anxious she should go with them on the following day to call in portman square and meet mrs george knightley mrs knightley formerly emma woodhouse had since her marriage been able to enjoy a larger measure of the social power and influence in the use of which she had always delighted since mr woodhouse's death she had persuaded her husband to go into parliament and except for short visits to donwell they now lived entirely in london an arrangement which just suited emma who had long desired some stir and variety in her life after having spent so many unbroken years in a country village mr knightley still took the greatest interest in the farming of his property and as soon as he was trustee to his sister in law mrs john knightley for the estate of hartfield which had passed to her on her father's death he found as much to do out of london as in it while emma though fond of donwell had grown weary of the neighbourhood and took a keen pleasure in forming round her in london a large circle of acquaintances whom she loved to entertain and in whose characters and careers she took the deepest interest mrs knightley's ball had become an annual fixture in the month of june and this year she had a special incentive for giving it and for making it as gay as possible at her sister's house she had met mrs gardiner whose husband had long been a close friend in business of mr john knightley mrs gardiner was chaperoning a niece miss catherine bennet a slender blooming young girl and pretty without being very striking but mrs knightley was impressed with her pleasing manners and the enthusiasm with which she received the prospect of a theatre party which was being discussed on that occasion it was the work of a moment for emma to decide that she must ask her sister to bring miss bennet to the ball but during the remainder of the evening while she considered and observed an improvement on the first idea suggested itself miss bennet must be invited to stay in portman square for the great occasion what better arrangement could there be isabella would not want to stay late but young girls liked to dance till the last moment and she emma would have the benefit of miss bennet's help in the preparations and would be able to introduce her to her partners beforehand yes miss bennet was certainly very pretty prettier than she had appeared at first such a slim upright figure such a profusion of hair such a delicate fairness of complexion she would be a great success it would be as delightful as when last year the girl who was at the ball as mrs knightley's special friend and protegee had finished the evening triumphantly becoming engaged to the most eligible man present sir william manvers emma felt a thrill at the recollection the event had justified all her admiration for sophia lennox and mr knightley who had been so sceptical had been obliged to admit that sometimes people did marry those whom one had destined for them there was no sir william manvers this year it was true but miss bennet was still young and there was plenty of time for the right man to appear in fact it was really only her due that she should be properly taken out in london in order that she might have every chance and this her aunt mrs gardiner was quite evidently not able to give her what wonder that the upshot of these reflections was a courteous note to mrs gardiner begging for the pleasure of a visit from miss bennet as soon as her stay in gracechurch street should be concluded kitty was in transports of happiness when all was arranged and she found herself actually mrs george knightley's guest with a ball in prospect and each day one round of visits and shopping and other delights with intervals only long enough to admit of changing one elegant gown for another for her mother and sisters had taken care she should be provided with an ample wardrobe she soon ceased to regret not having been allowed to accompany lydia to the west indies and before many days were over had discovered a reason to rejoice that she had not gone among mrs knightley's frequent visitors at this time was a young naval lieutenant named william price whom she had met a short time previously at the house of the same mr yates who had paid a visit to bath in the preceding spring mr yates lived in cavendish square and as his wife was a first cousin of william price's they had begged the young man to make their house his home whenever he happened to be in london young price had lately been attached to a ship of the line the andromeda which he had been obliged to put into portsmouth for repairs and he had been employing some of the period of his enforced leisure in taking up a course of signalling and gunnery as he was extremely anxious to gain promotion as speedily as possible but he had found that it was necessary to use other means than those of mere hard work and at the present time he was living in london keeping in touch with the admiralty and endeavouring to recommend himself to every high official and person of influence with whom he could contrive to become acquainted in the intervals he paid hasty visits to his sisters who were settled in northamptonshire and to his mother at portsmouth and being a young man of excellent address great charm of manner and marked abilities he had gained a deserved popularity and could not help enjoying the gaiety of london life available to him through the hospitality of numerous friends mrs knightley was extremely pleased with him and with his next brother david who was a clerk in the india office and both young men found it a very agreeable house to come to especially when to the welcome of their hostess was added that of a pretty girl who warm hearted and impulsive did not attempt to conceal her pleasure in their company david price was two or three years her junior and in him kitty bennet found only a merry and boyish companion but the manliness of the young sailor aroused different feelings and it was not long before she realized that the visits of william price were becoming the most important thing in her life she dreamt of him before he came she had no eyes for anyone else when he was present and she treasured his words when he had gone and although she could not honestly read into those words more than a passing friendliness yet she allowed herself to cherish hopes that each next time there might be something warmer poor kitty had secretly longed to be married ever since she was sixteen and now at last it seemed as if destiny itself was working for her in placing her with so kind a hostess who was always giving invitations and affording opportunities and in sending her such a splendid hero of romance to fall in love with for a hero he was of a campaign at sea when he had distinguished himself as much by bravery as he had on shore by industry a hero with good looks an assured position and prize money saved and at the present moment with nothing particular to do but fall in love with miss kitty bennet it was impossible not to feel under the circumstances that the course of events was plainly marked out mrs knightley certainly thought so too and although she refrained from definite statements her sympathetic attitude encouraged kitty to talk herself into hope and self confidence the importance of the ball itself in the great scheme of things was not overlooked and emma even dreamt now of a brilliant denouement like last year's she had invited a large number of people and was anxious to have as many dancing couples as possible so mrs hurst's request for permission to bring her brother and miss darcy was warmly acceded to and it was only a matter of regret that their friend colonel fitzwilliam could not be induced to go to any balls this season kitty was delighted at the prospect of meeting georgiana again and when the call spoken of by mrs hurst was being paid on the day following georgiana's arrival she availed herself of a pause in the conversation and a nod and a smile from mrs knightley to ask her friend to come to another room for a few moments on the plea of showing her some new possessions georgiana duly admired the bonnets and pelisses and the gold chain which was mrs knightley's present and the rose coloured ball dress which was to make its first appearance on the much talked of occasion kitty's head was evidently full of this event she dwelt on it constantly and from her quick nervous manner georgiana guessed at some kind of special preoccupation with the subject and so you are very happy here kitty perhaps i need not ask that she said as kitty turned to unfold another new muslin gown oh very very happy perfectly happy exclaimed kitty with eagerness mrs knightley is so kind and such nice people come here you have no idea georgiana now do look is not that beautiful a real india muslin and the colour just suits me you ought to like it for i bought it with some money elizabeth gave me yes dear i do like it of course returned georgiana but tell me some more about yourself how long were you with the gardiners i forget just how long but i came here on the first of june oh i do not know how ever i shall be able to leave georgiana i must tell you i have been longing to do so and yet i do not know how i can after all for it has not really happened yet of course you have guessed she went on in answer to georgiana's affectionately inquiring glance it can only be one thing but pray do not mention it to anyone for no one has any idea of it except mrs knightley it is so wonderful georgiana do you believe in love at first sight i have never thought about it answered georgiana honestly but i should think it might be possible indeed indeed it is possible it does happen when you see him you will know how easily you will see him on tuesday night i do wonder what you will think of him you must be sure to tell me quite truthfully dear kitty you cannot think how glad i am you mean you are engaged or just about to be oh no no no exclaimed kitty you do not understand i think i hope but i do not even know if he cares sometimes i feel sure he does and then again he seems to be perfectly indifferent and it is so terrible then more terrible than you can imagine but you will see you will judge for yourself i shall depend so much upon you for comfort and counsel especially if bingley asks him to come down and stay at desborough as i mean to persuade him to do georgiana was not much enlightened and her shyness and natural reserve made her hesitate to ask questions on such a subject which had she been kitty she could not have mentioned to any living creature but kitty was evidently longing for sympathy and poured out her hopes and fears and her reasons for both mingling with them a description of william price painted in the most vivid colours and emphasizing his courage and distinction as an officer his amiability as a man his perfection as a ball room partner and the high opinion mr knightley and all sensible men had formed of him georgiana listened and was interested almost against her will she had known kitty to take fancies several times before for persons who had not returned her regard or thought of doing so but in this case from what she could gather the young man seemed really to deserve kitty's enthusiasm they had met under mrs knightley's auspices he had been very often at the house and certainly everything considered it was much more likely that he should fall in love with kitty than not nevertheless she hardly knew how to answer her to encourage her in hopes which might prove false would be the cruellest kindness so while murmuring her wishes for her friend's happiness she agreed that she must wait for the evening of the ball before she could really tell how far kitty's dreams were likely to be realized they talked so long that eventually she had to propose a return to the drawing room fearing to be guilty of discourtesy towards mrs knightley but she was glad that only a moment was left for kitty's hurried inquiry about her own affairs as they hastened down the staircase and that she could therefore dismiss the subject with a light word kitty was scarcely satisfied but finding that georgiana could not be induced to speak of colonel fitzwilliam returned to her own all absorbing topic with the remark i do wish you could meet someone just like my dear mr price chapter ix the next few days passed rapidly for both girls and were so full of engagements that they were not able to arrange another meeting and georgiana deeply regretted the fact that except for a glimpse of her at the ball she should not see kitty again before bingley's departure from town she could only hope that all would go well and looked forward to a fuller intercourse in derbyshire in a few weeks' time meanwhile there were many friends to see and georgiana would have enjoyed herself thoroughly had she not dreaded the first meeting with colonel fitzwilliam which she felt hanging over her since bingley had called on the colonel and reported him to be in town but which she did not know when to expect a slight change in her plans necessitating a short absence from mr hurst's house led her to imagine that it would be temporarily averted but on the very day of the ball when she and her hostesses had remained at home and a larger number of visitors than usual happened to be in the room she experienced a painful shock on hearing his name announced and on seeing him walk into the room next moment she was angry with herself for losing her composure even momentarily and bracing herself for a possible encounter she endeavoured to continue to bear her part in a conversation with two or three of mrs hurst's friends who she realized gratefully were strangers to her until that day it was some minutes afterwards that she was aware of colonel fitzwilliam approaching her guided by miss bingley whose kindly intentions of making the occasion as ordinary as possible only served to intensify its discomfort georgiana however thought the fault all hers as not reassured at all by caroline's cheerful colonel fitzwilliam was so glad to hear you were staying with us georgiana she found herself only just able to give him her hand with an almost inaudible greeting while her face suffused with deepest blushes must she felt have made her noticeable to all around it was colonel fitzwilliam's part to set her at her ease which he did to some extent with a few kindly and naturally expressed sentences inquiring about her journey and the health of those she had left behind georgiana presently ventured to let her eyes rest on him and was startled to see how much older he looked even in the short time since she'd seen him and how ill and worn a terror seized her heart that she might be guilty of these altered looks but it passed in an instant there was not any doubt that their parting had been for the good of both but poor cousin robert it was plain to see that he had been suffering from whatever cause and her sympathy went out to him unconsciously even while she could hardly talk to him from embarrassment of knowing that caroline bingley was standing by apparently occupied with other people but drawing conclusions from every word she could hear i had intended coming to see you anyhow georgiana said fitzwilliam but i am very busy you know i do not go out much and you live in a perpetual whirl of gaiety i expect he smiled as he spoke and georgiana tried to answer in the same spirit telling him that they had a good many plans and people were very kind but she was not really in a whirl in fact the very next morning she was leaving for grosvenor street for a few days to spend them quietly with her old friend mrs annesley who lived in hans place quite away from the bustle of london mrs annesley repeated fitzwilliam of course i remember her she will enjoy having you but how have mrs hurst and miss bingley become reconciled to parting with you even for a week georgiana explained hurriedly that it had been quite a sudden engagement her old friend had been to see her and had begged for a short visit from her if possible for mrs annesley was on the point of going to india to live with a married son who had lost his wife and she might not have the opportunity of seeing her former pupil again for many years georgiana had been happy in the opportunity of going to her friend at such a time her present hostesses had acquiesced and a week was to be spared to mrs annesley but it will be made up in grosvenor street next month i assume said colonel fitzwilliam i hardly know i believe elizabeth and my brother want me at home again soon but of course i like being here too said georgiana stumbling over her words and feeling that she was disgracing herself if only caroline would not stand there and seem to be observing them so closely she did not believe it would be so distressing to talk to cousin robert if only they could be together somewhere among strangers this thought impelled her to ask him quite at random for she had every reason to know what his reply would be whether he was going to mrs knightley's ball i am afraid not georgiana i think i am getting too old for balls but i wish you a great deal of pleasure there oh cousin robert you are not too old but you she checked herself in this impetuous speech and ended rather confusedly but you look tired which was not what she would have wished to say her cousin glanced kindly at her but turned her remark off with a laugh and as he seemed about to move away georgiana in desperation and astonished at herself said timidly i hope we may meet again even though you do not go to balls i hope so too georgiana but of course we shall i must come some morning and take you all to kensington gardens georgiana felt that this would not be a great improvement on the present situation but she could not say any more and supposed their conversation was at an end when fitzwilliam who had made a step from her seemed struck with a sudden idea and turned to her again saying may i come and call on you at mrs annesley's she will perhaps remember me and i may not be in town later on georgiana flushed with surprise and pleasure and her eager assent left fitzwilliam in no doubt as to his reception he stayed only to assure himself of the number of mrs annesley's house then bowed and walked rapidly away as miss bingley approached with the evident intention of breaking up their conclave georgiana had to submit to a certain amount of comment from the sisters who while condoling with her for having had to pass through a uncomfortable few minutes appeared surprised that she should have been able to talk to colonel fitzwilliam but she herself felt nothing but happiness in having met her cousin again and found it possible to think of being on those terms with him that elizabeth had predicted she spent a part of the afternoon in writing a long letter to her sister telling her what had happened but she did not like to send an account of her cousin that might alarm them at home so she contented herself with saying that he was not looking at all well and that she wished elizabeth would persuade him to go down to pemberley as he must be working too hard in london she concluded her writing with the words i will leave this open till to morrow dear elizabeth that i may tell you about the ball and how kitty looked kitty indeed was the chief subject of her thoughts when they dwelt upon the prospect of the evening and when the time for dressing arrived kitty's rose coloured silk occupied her mind far more than her own white satin and pearls when mr and mrs hurst's party entered the ante room where mrs knightley was receiving her guests the two girls managed to exchange a few words and georgiana gathered that the hero of the evening had not yet appeared but kitty was separated from her by the crowd of arrivals and so it eventually came about that it was their hostess who performed the introduction of mr william price to miss darcy georgiana's first thought when she looked at the noble brow and clear blue eye of the young man was that kitty's attachment was easily understood and each moment that she spent in his company strengthened that assurance she was desirous of liking him eager to find everything to praise in the admired and perhaps the admirer of her friend and the opportunity came at once in the infectious gaiety and good spirits of the young man and the unaffected warmth of his manner he asked her for the honour of her hand in several dances but the first two she noticed he danced with kitty and from the sparkle in kitty's eye and her quick movement as he approached to claim them georgiana conjectured that the engagement had been made previously when georgiana's turn came among the excellencies that she discovered in her partner was that of being a perfect dancer and moreover one who moved through the set as if he enjoyed every step somewhat shyly she commented on this yes indeed miss darcy i am fond of dancing i began very early when i was such a small person that you probably wouldn't have seen me in a room much less have danced with me we all used to jump about as children i believe and on board ship one somehow managed to learn so as to be ready for the balls were there balls so often asked georgiana yes wherever we were stationed somebody always seized the opportunity to give a ball either a private person or the governor or the regiment or someone there seems to be a connection established in people's minds between naval men and dancing anyhow as soon as there were a few days' quiet someone would produce musicians and a waxed floor and we were expected to go and perform so i decided that i had better like it you are a very fortunate person to be able to be able to like what you have to do said georgiana highly diverted it is not a matter of fortune is it anybody can do it rejoined william price i am sure you can miss darcy no indeed i dislike very much some things i have to do but if you found you positively had to do them and there was no way out then you would decide to like them would you not it would make them so much easier this was a new idea to georgiana and she considered it a little before replying with a smile i am sure there are some things i should never like doing such as sitting on the back seat of a carriage i know that it is disagreeable to some people but i am sure if one thought long enough one could find a way to make it less so said the young lieutenant with great earnestness for instance he considered when the window was open the rain and wind would not do so much damage to the feathers in a lady's bonnet as if she were opposite and at night one could shut one's eyes and imagine one was travelling forwards it would be difficult to tell the difference he looked inquiringly at georgiana who was so much entertained by his arguments that she said laughingly i was right in calling you fortunate mr price for you seemed to have secured a sovereign remedy against all ills do tell me how you would console yourself if you slipped down now and broke your leg so that you could not dance any more for a long time i should like to know whether your principle always holds good now miss darcy you are driving me into a corner i only said if i positively had to do the distasteful thing and there was no way out i beg to inform you in the plainest language that there is a way out of your suggestion that is not to fall and break my leg and it is the way i mean to adopt but if such a thing did happen to me i should certainly try to console myself as yet i am not quite sure how yes i have thought of a method but i do not think i had better tell you what it is he means he would have kitty to sit beside him and talk to him thought georgiana i wonder what he would be like if he were ill he would have just the same merry smile i believe aloud she said i am not so strong minded as you mr price i'm afraid i should never be able to think of any way of consoling myself for a broken leg i hope you will never have to endure anything one twentieth a part disagreeable miss darcy her partner replied dropping his gay manner for a moment although it helped me to get through my examinations even now i cannot think very kindly of it were you has it actually happened to you exclaimed georgiana with a horrified face and she never felt less pleasure at the arrival of a new partner than at that moment most unwillingly she placed her arm in his to be led away wanting far more to hear the history of william price's misfortune while the young man full of concern at having startled her walked a few steps beside her to say it is all right miss darcy because you see that guarantees that it will not happen again to night bingley who was her partner asked the name of her companion and georgiana told what she knew of him describing him as kitty's friend bingley recollected having heard of him from kitty and pleased with his appearance and always attracted by a new face expressed a wish to know him and georgiana looked forward to making the introduction when her dances with bingley should be over this however was not to be kitty and mr price were dancing together and occasionally passed them in the set when georgiana could observe her friend's flushed cheek and air of radiant happiness but at its conclusion they were swept away in a crowd and bingley and georgiana looking round for chairs were accosted by mr knightley with the request to present mr and mrs yates who were anxious to know them the name was unfamiliar to both and so were the faces of the couple who approached mr yates with his usual aspect of complete self satisfaction and his wife a woman of fashion with a considerable share of good looks but an expression of countenance from which weariness and impatience were never long absent the lady fell to bingley's share and georgiana on her part learned from mr yates that he had heard her name and wished for the pleasure of her acquaintance as he had already made that of her brother and sister in bath georgiana replied to inquiries after their health and colonel fitzwilliam's whom mr yates told her he knew very well indeed and he desired to send his compliments to the colonel if miss darcy should be seeing him he is in london i believe georgiana assented ah yes i understood that and the lady is in town too i fancy georgiana's look in reply to this was so blank that mr yates evidently not caring to trust himself in the deep waters of explanation continued do present him my cordial regards and say i hope he has forgiven me i was so unfortunate as to do him a little disservice but it was easily put right i saw to that myself lady catherine de bourgh i am sure had made amende honorable you know lady catherine miss darcy your aunt of course i beg your pardon i should have recollected do pray remember me to her too you were not in bath this year were you well you did not lose much i have known pleasanter seasons georgiana only bowed mr yates's familiar allusion to colonel fitzwilliam had not pleased her and an instinct which she had not time to analyse led her to connect it with her cousin's depressed spirits the next moment her companion introduced a more welcome subject by saying i think i saw you dancing with my young cousin william price a smart young fellow is he not is he your cousin asked georgiana in some surprise yes or rather my wife's through the mother but we have all known him for years he seems quite like one of ourselves and spends half his time at our house when in town though i often tell my wife it is no compliment to us for he is for ever playing with our children we cannot get him out of the nursery georgiana felt that this was just as it should be mr price's being fond of the children accorded him well with the merry kind smile that was so characteristic of him she ventured upon an inquiry as to his naval career and mr yates who liked nothing better than to be talking either of himself or of those belonging to him immediately entered upon a description of william's notable conduct at the battle of st domingo and the extraordinary courage he had displayed in the taking of a french ship and in defending the colours of his own bingley's attention was caught and georgiana was grateful to him for asking questions to prolong the story and for interpolating expressions of admiration which she felt but could not utter the more she saw and heard of him the more delighted she was with the young hero for such he now appeared to be and the more she commended kitty's good sense in bestowing her devotion upon such a worthy object she looked forward to further opportunities of hearing from mr price's own lips the account of some of his adventures but recollecting that if events took the much desired course there would be plenty of such opportunities she decided that it would be best to employ the remainder of the time which she might spend in his company that evening by discoursing of kitty in the hope of gaining some assurance of the strength of his inclinations he knew her to be kitty's friend and the subject of kitty would naturally become the chief bond between them when they came to know each other a little better shortly after supper william price claimed her hand for a second time and at the first interval in the dance long enough for any connected conversation georgiana began who is that dancing with miss bennet do you know mr price it is a mr churchill a great friend of the knightleys i believe he is rather agreeable but miss bennet tells me she does not like him replied william price laughing why should she not like him i wonder asked georgiana oh i hardly know just a fancy i think he and i had a great set to here one day an argument i mean and i was fairly worsted it was about foxhunting so perhaps i deserved to be but miss bennet very kindly took my side and was quite vexed with mr churchill when he retired with the honours of war kitty is so loyal to her friends said georgiana yes she is a delightful girl and mrs knightley too is the kindest person imaginable she has been so good to both my brother and myself and i have never enjoyed my leave so much it must be a very pleasant house to stay in said georgiana miss bennet is very sorry to be going away i know yes is it not a pity she has to go and down to the depths of the country too i must not disparage it miss darcy for i am reminded that it is your home as well but when people go so far off one is desperately afraid of not seeing them again you are not leaving town with miss bennet are you georgiana was explaining their respective plans when the summons came for them to rejoin the set but an interruption soon occurred in the shape of a slight accident a lady dancing next to william price in turning sharply trod upon her dress with the result that she slipped and fell upon the polished floor with her foot twisted under her the young lieutenant sprang forward lifted her with skillful and gentle touch and carried her pale and suffering to an adjoining room where mrs knightley and several friends hastened to her aid a servant was sent for a surgeon and william price returned to georgiana with the news that pending his arrival the lady was being treated for what appeared to be a severe sprain poor thing said georgiana trembling i am so sorry for her it must have caused intense pain i was afraid she might have broken it no it is bad enough but fortunately it is not broken i could perceive that replied the young man you must not prognosticate such sad things miss darcy you see they very nearly come true georgiana looked into his face for enlightenment then broke into a smile oh mr price you are unkind to assume that i was responsible for it i only suggested a broken leg and it was you who said it had been a reality in your case how did it happen was it in action william led her to a seat as the incident had unnerved her for more dancing but could not be persuaded to give a narrative in the style of mr yates he only laughed and said that it had been about as glorious an affair as falling down in a ball room one of our fellows had foolishly got himself into a very awkward place at the storming of a fort and i was so stupid as to get in the way of a shower of falling rocks one of which when it reached me decided to stay as close to me as it could so i was severely reprimanded and had to spend six weeks in hospital at the very busiest time georgiana listened with interest certain that there was another version of the story which would show her companion up in a different light and she inquired what did you say about examinations only that i had some books and a good friend who helped me to the utmost of his power so that while i was lying by i contrived to work up my subject enough to have scraped through they talked for some time longer until william had to go in search of his next partner while georgiana was carried off by her hostess who placed her at a small table to drink coffee with herself and mr and mrs gardiner the gardiners were of course no strangers to georgiana and she showed the pleasure she felt in meeting them again is it not kind of mrs gardiner to have lent kitty to me for so long miss darcy said mrs knightley i feel i can ill spare her now i shall miss her after the happy time we have had together georgiana said what was proper and mrs gardiner added perhaps she will be able to come to you another year indeed i hope so i should like her to come any time but another year you know she may not be so free the claims of a house of her own may be paramount certainly they may be but it seems early to anticipate that said mrs gardiner early oh no i do not think so i shall not be at all surprised to be asked to help in buying kitty's wedding clothes before christmas returned mrs knightley smiling mysteriously mrs gardiner expressed inquiring surprise while georgiana listened with interest for what mrs knightley would say regarding her as the chief authority in the affair as far as it had gone her hostess proceeded it is quite between ourselves you know mrs gardiner i know i am perfectly safe in mentioning it as you are kitty's aunt and miss darcy her greatest friend and you can imagine whether it is a pleasure to me to find that two young people in whom i am interested are so much interested in each other undoubtedly said mrs gardiner but pray enlighten me mrs knightley as to who the other person is you have met him to night mrs gardiner the young naval officer mr price whom i introduced to you mrs gardiner was very anxious to learn more particulars and mrs knightley gave her full information as to william price's career and prospects while as to kitty she affirmed she had every reason to believe that both were equally attracted and that an engagement would shortly be formed between them subject to the approval of their friends mrs gardiner agreed that it was very good news if the young man was all mrs knightley believed him and remarked what a delight it would be to her sister mrs bennet who had always wanted kitty to be settled mr price is all we think him i can assure you mr knightley will answer for him but pray do not mention a word of this to anyone let it not go beyond us four i am most desirous that the affair should pass to its easy and natural conclusion i quite understand that and of course we shall wait until kitty tells us said her aunt what do you think of it all miss darcy has kitty mentioned the matter to you georgiana replied that she had and on further questioning owned that she felt sure that if what mrs knightley expected came to pass it would make kitty very happy mrs knightley called upon her to join in commendations of the young man and this she could sincerely do and she rose from the table feeling as if everything were settled and it only remained to congratulate the two persons most concerned a minute later she met kitty flying in search of her kitty seized her friend's hand and drew her into a quiet corner of mrs knightley's morning room where the two girls could seat themselves on a sofa partly hidden by a screen and be quite secluded i wanted so much to see you before i went georgiana began kitty in an excited undertone i thought i should never get to you and this is my last chance as we start so early on friday now do tell me what you think of him you can judge now cannot you is he not delightful is he not handsome and a noble creature is he not all i said yes indeed dear kitty he is responded georgiana with tender sympathy i can quite understand your feelings i am sure anyone would be very proud to have gained the affection of such a man oh i am so glad to hear you say so do you think i have gained it sometimes i think so sometimes i am not sure mrs knightley thinks i have i know she does i have heard her say so and she would not mislead you kitty i am sure she cares so much for your welfare yes indeed she has been very kind i cannot tell you what i should have done without her she has done everything she thinks of everything to night when she was arranging the supper partners i was standing near him but not very near and he had not asked me i suppose he was waiting to see if he might as we had already danced together a great deal and she looked up from her list and said 'and mr price i do not think i have put anyone down for you will you take miss bennet' in that kind way not to make me feel uncomfortable as if it had been planned so he came and offered me his arm with such an air and after all we did not talk much at supper i was too happy but when i asked him if he liked my dress he paid me such an elegant compliment on it something about a rose he is a most agreeable companion said georgiana i should never tire of hearing him converse the marvellous adventures he has had it is like a glimpse of a new world to meet a person who has actually been through those things and who describes them with such modesty and simplicity such a man seldom comes into our quiet lives oh but they are so horrible it quite frightens me to hear about them if i were married to him i would never let him go to sea again for fear of his coming back without an arm or a leg or an eye but it is his profession kitty i know but it is a horrid profession the only thing about him that i don't like except for the uniform and a man in a black coat looks positively nothing beside him oh kitty as if the uniform mattered do not let me hear you talk so foolishly said georgiana really pained well perhaps it is foolish but it does make a difference you know bingley has been teasing me half the evening about a young man that he says they have got for me down in the country whom i shall be sure to like the rector of kympton i believe as if i could possibly look at a clergyman after knowing william price perhaps it is not fair to compare two such different types of men but mr morland is very nice kitty i am sure you will think so i am sure i shall not i don't want to see him how can i think anyone nice when i am away from here oh if i could only see price once more just once more to make sure but as he says how can one ever see anybody down in the wilds of derbyshire kitty here is the music beginning again and we shall be asked for said georgiana standing up do not be unhappy or over anxious about this and do not show too much what you feel for i am sure it will all come out right if you have patience do you really think it is so that is such a comfort but i wish he had spoken to night mrs knightley thought he would dear kitty whenever it comes i wish you all the happiness in the world write to me very fully and as i said have patience and self command now we really ought to go kitty pressed her friend's hand and georgiana tried to calm her as they walked back to the ball room by talking on indifferent topics for she feared the girl's burning cheeks and nervous manner would betray her agitation and its cause miss bingley met them as they entered the room and asked georgiana if she was ready to go as mrs hurst seemed inclined for it yes i am quite ready said georgiana i think i am engaged to mr bingley for another dance but he will not mind missing it charles is over there talking to mr price but i have told him we want to go so he will be expecting us said miss bingley and led the way across the room kitty not unnaturally following mr bingley welcomed them warmly calling out here kitty come and add your entreaties to mine i want this young gentleman to come down to desborough and shoot our pheasants in november but he is not sure if he can manage it i never heard such nonsense if anyone is entitled to ask for leave when he wants it i should think he is kitty was rendered perfectly incapable of speech for the first moment after hearing these words never had a wish been so suddenly and gloriously placed in the way of accomplishment but she found an unexpected ally in miss bingley who supported her brother's invitation having like him been attracted by the young lieutenant's agreeable demeanour and high reputation william price stood still looking diffidently from one to another and expressing in disjointed sentences his gratitude his uncertainty and his extreme pleasure should he be able to accept mr bingley exerted all his powers of persuasion and kitty's bright eyes shot glances not less eloquent georgiana turned a little away feeling suddenly very tired and spiritless and mr and mrs hurst who came up at that moment remarked on it georgiana tired exclaimed bingley then let us go at once you are not used to these late hours and i don't know what mrs darcy will say to me if i take them a poor account of you we are all neighbours in the country you know mr price then that is settled you will come to us if you can possibly get away and i hope nothing will prevent it you do not expect to receive the command of the mediterranean squadron do you no sir replied william laughing neither that nor any other command this year i am afraid well well i wish you luck shall i see you again before i leave town william was beginning to reply negatively when miss bingley who was leading the whole party towards the cloak room turned and asked mr price if he would not come and see them some time in grosvenor street she called on her sister to ratify the invitation which mrs hurst did and it was courteously accepted there followed a confusion of good byes and a getting of cloaks and the three ladies were placed in the coach while the two gentlemen prepared to walk georgiana had warmly embraced kitty at parting and had intimated that she knew how much the arrangement by bingley meant to her friend and her last impression of mrs knightley's ball was of william price waving farewell in the doorway and then ascending the steps to where kitty awaited him in the vestibule chapter x colonel fitzwilliam had come to london because he thought it was the place where he would be most likely to meet miss crawford again and he had taken up literary work merely to pass away the time until that longed for event should occur two months had elapsed before he heard of her arrival with her sister but it was not many days after that he contrived to be present at the house of a mutual friend where he knew her to be expected her manner of greeting him on this occasion was not free from embarrassment it was neither cordial nor unfriendly and so brief was the encounter that he could discover but little from it of the state of her mind towards him another casual meeting seemed to promise more hopefully but hardly had they exchanged a few sentences when the appearance of sir walter and miss elliot turned the conversation into channels more congenial to the new comers and colonel fitzwilliam was forced to stand aside and see miss crawford taken possession of without any semblance of unwillingness on her part he then devoted himself to mrs grant and tried to propose an expedition a theatre party but that lady hesitatingly replied that she could arrange nothing without her sister colonel fitzwilliam applied for permission to call which was readily accorded but on availing himself of it the following day only learned that the ladies were gone to richmond with a party the manservant obliged him unasked with the information that it was mr crawford's party and the colonel was left to speculate gloomily on the chances of sir walter elliot being one of the number and what was of greater import whether if it was so it was with miss crawford's approval he had gone to call on the hursts after leaving mrs grant's house and had not again seen the object of his thoughts and hopes when a few days later he directed his steps towards mrs annesley's residence in hans place he could scarcely believe it was but three months since the severance of his engagement with georgiana it seemed to have retreated so far into the background of events but he had pondered earnestly over their interview in grosvenor street and from her demeanour had concluded that his presence was not objectionable to her so that any further meeting might help to re establish their old cousinly relations a result which their friends would rejoice in it was therefore with a tolerably easy mind that was ushered into the presence of the two ladies and found georgiana in great good looks and far less shy and confused than on the previous occasion indeed in a few moments any awkwardness between them seemed to have quite melted away and she was readily answering his questions about mrs knightley's ball it certainly seems to have been a great success for i never knew you so enthusiastic about a ball before georgiana said her cousin smiling it was better than the bath assemblies i gather oh bath exclaimed georgiana with a note of contempt in her voice which spoke volumes you laugh at me cousin robert but it was a beautiful ball even mr bingley said so and he must have been to a great number hundreds if not thousands i should think returned her cousin bingley's shoemaker must have made a fortune but who were the partners who contributed to such enjoyment for they are usually the really important part two mr prices you have mentioned captain carter and mr dixon who else oh i forget who else mr hurst and mr bingley of course and mr knightley but he was very grave and terrible i was almost too frightened to move and mr gardiner and then there was mr yates but i did not dance with him do you remember him cousin robert he said he knew you at bath georgiana had been so disagreeably struck by mr yates's way of speaking of her relatives whom he had met that she had not intended to mention it to colonel fitzwilliam but the rest of his talk had eradicated his first impression and she had unguardedly given utterance to his name fruitless regret and vexation overcame her when glancing up at her cousin she perceived his countenance darken and noted the change in his voice as he replied with an effort yes we did meet in bath but not in the pleasantest of circumstances mr yates may be a more agreeable man away from the companions he then had i do not think he was particularly agreeable said georgiana falteringly but i thought he appeared to me to be an interesting talker yes that is quite his line if yates can do nothing else he can certainly use his tongue replied colonel fitzwilliam not without bitterness but do not let us concern ourselves with him georgiana what about the walk in kensington gardens that we had thought of will mrs annesley very kindly let me escort you both there this delightfully fine morning mrs annesley willingly acceded and the two ladies having attired themselves a hackney coach was called which conveyed them a mile on their way towards kensington place georgiana was somewhat silent during the drive she did not wish to speculate on her cousin's private affairs but having been the innocent cause of recalling painful thoughts to him inevitably produced the wish to atone to help and she found herself wondering while trying not to wonder what could possibly be the connection between mr yates cousin robert and a lady in bath now said to be in london to be sure it was none of her business she had no right to wish to know and yet she did wish she knew whether that had anything to do with cousin robert's looking so sad and worn stay that letter of lady catherine's which her brother had read aloud a lady in bath a friend of elizabeth's a misunderstanding georgiana felt for one instant with a thrill of fear and excitement as though she had laid hold of the thread and was almost glad when the stopping of the carriage obliged her to let it go by scattering her thoughts and her bringing her back to the present moment she reproached herself for prying into others' secrets and pressing close to mrs annesley's side she eagerly responded to that lady's eulogies of the beautiful scene around them the gardens were indeed looking their best in the glory of their june array and crowds of well dressed persons strolling gaily about added to the general sense of brilliancy and festivity they had taken a few turns and fitzwilliam had greeted several of his acquaintances while georgiana was beginning to think that she too might see someone she knew when her attention was arrested by some comments of mrs annesley's made in a low voice on the singular beauty of a young lady who was approaching them escorted by two gentlemen the lady was dark and extremely animated and her fine eyes seemed to be glancing in the direction of their party as the two groups slowly passed each other colonel fitzwilliam's bow was acknowledged by the lady and her friends and she half paused as if about to speak but passed on without doing so mrs annesley seeing the recognition made a laughing apology to her companion i beg your pardon colonel fitzwilliam i did not know you knew that lady but really she is such a lovely creature that one cannot help remarking on it i am quite of your opinion mrs annesley returned the colonel and georgiana saw that though he endeavoured to speak lightly something had happened which necessitated the exercise of a degree of self command it is very obliging of you to voice sentiments which i am always wanting to put into words when i meet miss crawford although no words can exactly describe her special charm it is her expression is it not said mrs annesley so full of changing life and brightness and that vivid complexion and graceful carriage of the head all that one can see at a glance and i imagine we are not in the minority in admiring her no indeed said fitzwilliam she holds quite a little court he was interrupted by a gentleman who detained him for a moment and the ladies walked on georgiana's mind full of tumultuous thoughts she had recollected the name crawford in a moment as being that of elizabeth's friend to whom lady catherine had behaved so unkindly but she did not like to admit her knowledge for fear it might be painful to her cousin to have the whole chain of circumstances discussed what they were georgiana could not help longing to know but the only one that was quite clear to her was her cousin's deep admiration for this lady her heart went out in sympathy to him both for his attachment and for the difficulties in his way if difficulties there were did miss crawford perhaps not care for him yet she had looked as if she wanted to speak were there friends or relations influencing her he had alluded to a little court but how could anyone separate miss crawford from colonel fitzwilliam if she really loved him he so noble so kind so true georgiana blushed deeply at her thoughts perceiving the rapid pace at which they had led her on and the somewhat inconsistent conclusion that they had reached but their very sincerity reassured her in the knowledge that her own love for colonel fitzwilliam was the sisterly love that longed to see him happily and suitably united no idea crossed her mind of helping towards this end she had too lowly an opinion of her own powers as a force in other persons' lives her only wish was for an opportunity of showing her sympathy towards her cousin in some practical form in vain she tried to plan how this might be done for she could not speak of it until he had opened his heart to her a most unlikely thing to happen and not at all could it be mentioned before mrs annesley fortune seemed to favour her for when colonel fitzwilliam rejoined them mrs annesley confessed that she felt a little tired the heat was so great and she would like to rest a while but do not come with me she added as fitzwilliam instantly proposed moving towards the chairs if you are not tired yet it is much more amusing for you and georgiana to walk about and probably you would like to go nearer to the music i will go and sit by my friend mrs sackville whom i see over there until you are ready the cousins accordingly found themselves together and georgiana hardly knowing how to begin but feeling no time was to be lost broke silence again after a few minutes after a few minutes by saying timidly i think i have heard elizabeth speak of miss crawford you all knew her in bath did you not have you indeed that is good exclaimed colonel fitzwilliam i had forgotten that you would know her name yes we all met in bath he seemed about to say more but after a pause concluded with ask elizabeth to tell you about her georgiana was disappointed but told herself that she could not have expected anything else how could he make a confidant of her who had shown herself unworthy of any trust they walked on for some little distance until fitzwilliam observing two vacant seats in a group of chairs placed close to the edge of the grass asked georgiana if she would like to sit down for a little before turning back it was a charming spot in the shade of a tree and immediately facing a large sheet of artificial water and georgiana willingly assented remarking how fortunate that we should be able to get two chairs they seem to be nearly all occupied it is generally so people come and sit here the whole morning when it is so fine and warm returned fitzwilliam placing himself at her side but not resuming their conversation of a few moments before georgiana was not content to be silent and her cousin was wrapped in thoughts of miss crawford and did not dream of the anxious solicitude for him in georgiana's heart the other man in mary's party he reflected must be her brother henry crawford there was a slight resemblance besides he answered to the description mary had given of him how well he remembered her laughing looks and tones as she uttered it henry is not tall colonel fitzwilliam no i allow him every other imaginable beauty but he is not tall thin dark rather plain of course to me singularly handsome did i not say so do you think you would recognize him if you saw him and the colonel did see him now for the second time a few steps away approaching with his sister who walked between him and sir walter elliot as before mary glanced towards miss darcy and in an instant the colonel was at her side how do you do miss crawford i was sorry to miss you the other morning when i called would you allow me to present to you my cousin miss darcy she has heard of you from her brother and sister mary coloured deeply as she returned his salutation but immediately complied with his request pausing only to say to her brother in a low voice henry please walk on do not wait for me to georgiana it was such a surprise and delight to see miss crawford being brought towards her and to find a wish granted which she had scarcely dared to formulate that instead of being exceedingly shy as she would ordinarily have been she forgot to think of herself and rising and looking into miss crawford's lovely and expressive face she entered fully into what she believed her cousin to be feeling towards its owner in reality the shyness was on mary's side for she could not help in seeing in colonel fitzwilliam's action another proof of the generosity and devotion of the friend whom she had exiled from her a few words passed between them all three about the beauty of the day and their surroundings then miss crawford turning to georgiana inquired after mr and mrs darcy this was a subject to unloose georgiana's tongue and drew forth animated replies and mary still addressing her made a few civil inquiries about her journey to town and the probable duration of her visit it was colonel fitzwilliam who presently begged miss crawford to take his seat which after a slight demur no other chair being within sight she consented to do he remained standing near them for a few moments and then moved a little distance thinking they might be able to talk more comfortably if left to themselves you are staying with your aunt lady catherine de bourgh asked miss crawford when he was out of earshot no replied georgiana my aunt is not in town for the moment i am with my old governess mrs annesley but i am really on a visit to some other friends mrs hurst and miss bingley i see and your cousin is with you there just now mary pursued oh no no no said georgiana smiling no he has been living in town by himself for some time you have not happened to meet him since you were in london mary answered that she had met colonel fitzwilliam once or twice but murmured something about thinking he and the darcys were all like one family georgiana assented to this he is indeed like one of ourselves my brother and sister are devoted to him and he is the oldest friend i have she replied after my own brother he is the kindest and best person i have ever met people do not know for a long time how good he is because he is so modest and retiring georgiana was conscious that she was perhaps transgressing the bounds of good taste in this vehement praise but she did not care what miss crawford thought of her so long as she would think well of her cousin at all events it appeared that miss crawford was not offended for she smiled faintly and said he is fortunate in having you and mrs darcy for his advocates it is just the same said georgiana eagerly with whoever speaks of him his friends are all devoted to him and he is so staunch to them whatever they do he never changes or fails them when they want him i think i know one who would not fail him miss darcy said miss crawford still smiling but indeed she added as georgiana turned away her head i am sure you are quite right in all you say who should know colonel fitzwilliam well if not his old friends and i know myself that he is even loyal to them when he is angry with them which is the great test georgiana could heartily agree though without understanding mary's allusion their talk drifted to other subjects in the midst of which the colonel returned and tried to interest miss crawford in some such plan as he had suggested to her sister mary said it was kind of him it would be pleasant without pledging herself to anything and replied pray do when he asked if he might call to talk it over but it appeared that she and her sister were so full of engagements that it was doubtful if they would be at home any morning before the end of that week by this time she had risen and appeared anxious to return to her friends mr crawford indeed was seen approaching so colonel fitzwilliam could only bow his adieux while promising himself the pleasure of calling early in the following week for though he would have liked to make henry crawford's acquaintance for himself he did not wish to be responsible for introducing him to georgiana she on her part only perceived that miss crawford was taking leave and she pressed the hand that her new friend extended to her saying in a low voice it has been such a pleasure i hope i shall see you again indeed i hope we may meet i should like it responded mary cordially you go about so much that i have no doubt we shall pray remember me to your sister and mr darcy georgiana promised and turned away with colonel fitzwilliam but she ventured to say to her companion nothing more than a few shy words of appreciation of miss crawford's beauty and charm i am so glad you like her he replied i thought that you would though it never occurred to me that we were likely to meet her here elizabeth talked of inviting her to pemberley and i hope some day she will if we can get up a water party georgiana you must come to it do you think you could persuade mrs annesley to bring you indeed i am sure i could if i am still with her but i go back to grosvenor street on saturday afternoon you know well we must contrive it somehow i doubt if miss bingley would care much for such simple pleasures georgiana laughed regarding a river party as a very distinguished and elaborate form of entertainment their progress towards mrs annesley was slow as colonel fitzwilliam was frequently accosted by some friend or other one of whom stopped him to call out do not forget that you are going with us to see siddons in macbeth on friday night are you cousin robert how i envy you said georgiana as they passed on we have tickets to see her next week in king john but i hear lady macbeth is her finest part i am ashamed to say that i have never witnessed any of her performances as yet replied fitzwilliam i hardly know how i have missed them but it behooves me to make up for lost time i shall come round on saturday morning and harrow your feelings with a description of the play do please and then i can write to elizabeth about it how much i shall have to tell her this week about my coming to this beautiful place and meeting miss crawford georgiana thought her cousin looked happier when they were driving home than she had yet seen him look in london and they discussed the details of a plan to go to hampton court and dine there which seemed to contain all the elements of perfect bliss fitzwilliam was indeed experiencing greater peace of mind than he had done since he parted from mary in bath though for what reason he could scarcely explain to himself her manner had been merely that of courtesy and had not contained a hint of the old friendliness and sir walter elliot had been as ever at her elbow yet fitzwilliam felt that each interview he could obtain opened the way towards her a little more and he had resolved to press straight onward letting no such obstacles arise as he had formed an effectual barrier between them in bath but rather making use of every incident that occurred such as georgiana's accidental presence and the ensuing introduction to bring himself nearer to her he was keeping this object ever in view when he joined his friends at the theatre a few evenings later and in glancing round the house after the first act observed miss crawford with several other persons in a box at some distance from him he immediately began to consider the possibility of going up to speak to her although unacquainted with the hostess for mrs grant was not there and he conjectured that the party were in the charge of sir walter and miss elliot by the manner in which that lady and gentleman rose to welcome a visitor who had just entered the box fitzwilliam determined to obtain an introduction through some friend and for this purpose to go up to the box during the third interval which was the longest of the evening the second interval however was destined to produce something of a disconcerting nature fitzwilliam was conversing with the wife of his friend general stuart whose guest he was and learning from her the names and other particulars of many of the persons present for she had long lived in london and had a wide acquaintance she was reckoned to be a lively companion though the information she gave and her manner of imparting it were the one so positive and the other so vigorous that her hearers were tempted frequently to forget until after they had assimilated it that she might have spoken without the best authority she had chanced to notice the people in the elliots' box and she drew colonel fitzwilliam's rather unwilling attention to them he did not wish to discuss or hear discussed the crawfords or their friends and implied at once that several of them were known to him mrs stuart was all interest and inquired if it was that charming miss crawford that he knew and if so whether he could explain why it was that she was going to marry that insufferable old coxcomb sir walter elliot colonel fitzwilliam replied concealing his apprehension as best he could that he did not know that she was he had never heard it then you are the only one in the population of london who has not heard it my dear colonel why where have you been to be out of the way of such a piece of news at least fifty people have told me and of course all of them have it straight from the most reliable source it is hard to believe that such a beautiful creature should throw herself away like that on a foolish impecunious old fellow who is old enough to be her father and has nothing in the world but his title and his tailor to recommend him i cannot comprehend why girls do these things one can only suppose that she is tired of the single life and wants a suitable settlement i am almost sure there must be some mistake mrs stuart interposed colonel fitzwilliam i saw miss crawford the only lately and she there was nothing said about her engagement he stopped feeling how very lame such a refutation was unsupported by any testimony nonsense my dear sir you have been living in your books or you would have heard of it do you see that short stout young man over there he is a mr john thorpe and he was speaking of it at our house the other evening and asserted positively that he had heard it mentioned in bath months ago i am quite certain that miss crawford was not engaged when she was in bath was all colonel fitzwilliam would permit himself to say well you are very uncivil i must say you had better obtain someone else's assurance if you will not accept mine though anyone can see how it has come about naturally the elliots have pushed it forward to the utmost of their power sir walter wants a pretty wife and as he cannot support one out of that vanished fortune of his he must choose one who has enough for both and miss elliot would like to establish a connection between the families for the sake of a certain mr henry crawford who is still unmarried he is a rake of course but she does not mind that you know which he is the dark young man standing up at the back of the box colonel fitzwilliam was so excessively disturbed and irritated by this conversation which he had endeavoured to check by saying you must be quite satisfied now mrs stuart with the answers you have provided to your own question that the rising of the curtain was a great relief he could sit silent inattentive to the play wrapped in his own anxious thoughts mrs stuart's was certainly not the last word on this terribly important matter for he felt he must hear the facts from some other quarter before he could credit them the fine scene of banquo's murder was played as far as he was concerned to deaf ears and his eyes continually sought the box above where he could just see mary's white cloak and sir walter's fashionable attire always it seemed in proximity to it the instant the curtain fell again he rose from his seat and made the best of his way towards the exit but so many gentlemen were leaving their seats at the same time that he found himself in a crowd where it was impossible to progress at any great rate of speed at this moment he heard his name pronounced behind him and looking round he recognized two friends former brother officers of his own who had remained seated near the end of one of the rows impatient of the delay he nevertheless went to them and remained a few minutes in talk finding that one of his friends captain ross was lame and had difficulty moving along the narrow gangways they were presently joined by a mr palmer whom fitzwilliam knew as a man of few words reserved and of almost unamiable temper but thoroughly trustworthy and too little interested in his neighbours' affairs to be possessed of any superfluous knowledge concerning them fitzwilliam had a slight acquaintance with him and after a little consideration he asked him as if casually do you know anything of sir walter elliot palmer as much as i want to was the reply a stupid fellow if he were framed and glazed he would be a good deal more useful than he now is i consider captain ross laughingly agreed with him claiming some knowledge of sir walter elliot himself and calling on his hearers to witness the inequality of human justice when such a man as that could find a young and charming wife is it true then asked fitzwilliam summoning all his fortitude that sir walter elliot is going to be married perfectly true rejoined captain ross and his companion and you know to whom that lady in the box with him now colonel fitzwilliam had no need to look it was enough to know that the worst he dreaded was about to befall his friends seemed to notice nothing in his agitated manner of asking are you sure in such haste were they to pour out their information yes it has been talked of for a long time but is quite settled now i was in the club last night when elliot was having supper there and he told us all to drink to his health to day for he would be the happiest man in the world so that party up there is doubtless celebrating the betrothal besides do you not recollect added captain ross that when i met miss elliot the other night she told me her father would probably have some legal business to arrange when mr crawford returned from paris and then she hoped would come the announcement of a happy event crawford is there now you see the legal business in this case may include a settlement to be made on elliot himself laughed the other officer can you understand people advertising their affairs so freely beforehand he must have had reason to feel pretty confident well i shall always think it a great shame miss crawford is much too good for him but it is not the first time she has played with a man in this way and now i suppose she finds herself too much involved to draw back or elliot has been sharp enough to make sure of her unlike that dilatory young bertram why yes besides being presumably a better bargain than a mere country parson added captain ross i imagine they will live at kellynch when i last saw wentworth he told me his sister the tenant was just leaving fitzwilliam felt as if he could not bear more of this but making a great effort he turned once more to mr palmer and asked if he thought the rumour to be true mr palmer looked at him in some surprise yes certainly why not there is not the slightest reason to doubt it we have the evidence of our eyes and the word of one of the principal parties my wife and her mother are going to call to morrow and offer their congratulations colonel fitzwilliam hardly knew how he got away what his three friends thought of him or what general stuart whom he had met outside the lobby could comprehend of his excuses for his abrupt departure he only knew that he could not return to his place watching the woman who possessed his whole heart in the company of the lover to whom she had promised herself he must be alone in the darkness and silence to brace himself to endure the shock of what he had heard and realize all that would follow from it he hastened through the streets and shut himself up in his rooms conscious only that this was a defeat not a mere repulse such as he had received at bath but a defeat the completeness and finality of which admitted no rally on the losing side long he paced his room struggling to fight down the anguish of his mind and to see clearly through his utter wretchedness what had happened and how even in the midst of his sufferings it was not difficult for him to piece together all the items of his knowledge into a connected whole she had wearied of him at bath that must have been the beginning of it he had not been able to gain her affection in a sufficient degree for it to be proof against lady catherine's attack that catastrophe had swept him equally with his cousins away from whatever place he had held in mary crawford's esteem and when he met her again in london and could resume his efforts to recover that place it was already occupied was that then why she had seemed not to wish to be too friendly because it was too late he was forced to believe it he could indeed easily believe anything that was a proof against her consideration her goodness of heart that had endeavoured to save him pain he could and did believe that he had failed to win her but that she could have accepted sir walter elliot left him for many hours stunned and incredulous that she with her many gifts of mind and body her true elegance her sensibility her refinement of breeding placing her in almost a different world from the vulgar pretentiousness of sir walter and his daughter which in bath had so often seemed uncongenial to her should now actually find such a man all sufficient and should consent to join her life with his was an outrage a madness all the more so if she had drifted into it in the way the onlookers imagined she could not know what she was doing her friends what were they about she must be warned fitzwilliam impulsively strode to the door then stopped and flung himself down with a bitter laugh at his own folly he to be raging through all the commonplace jealousies of a rejected lover like any boy of nineteen what could he or anyone else do miss crawford was perfectly free to choose she had a brother with whose knowledge she was probably acting and there was nothing to be alleged against sir walter elliot's character recollecting the comments he had heard that evening fitzwilliam was forced to the same conclusions to acknowledging that miss elliot mary's own friend had in all probability promoted the match that henry crawford weak and unstable where women's persuasions were concerned had allowed himself to be drawn into the elliot net and that his sister though she could have little real regard for sir walter wished to settle down and her fortune making her independent of means in her future husband had chosen where her fancy and a title attracted her how mean how sordid was the whole story not the least heartrending of colonel fitzwilliam's reflections that night was that it could not be his mary the true mary who had shown herself to him for a short time who was now taking this step so unworthy of her best self for the woman he knew her to be what happiness could be in store chapter xi georgiana was alone in the drawing room of mrs annesley's house on the following morning practising the pianoforte when the expected rap at the front door was heard and colonel fitzwilliam was presently ushered into the room she sprang up to welcome him prepared for a cheerful greeting but was unspeakably concerned at the sight of his haggard face and worn exhausted looks the more so because he made no attempt to account for them but forced a smile accepted the chair which she offered him and endeavoured to speak as usual georgiana begged him to partake of some refreshment and expressed a fear that he was ill not daring to give utterance to her real conjecture no no georgiana thank you i will not have anything i assure you i am not ill i have only come to wish you good bye as i have changed my plans i i am thinking of going to ireland to ireland repeated georgiana in consternation yes i have a friend who owns an estate there and he has often invited me to come over and fish and shoot with him so i shall start to night and take him by surprise arriving early next week but to ireland georgiana could only repeat so utterly bewildered was she dear cousin robert i am so sorry i wish you need not would you not go to pemberley elizabeth and darcy would so gladly receive you or do anything i know they would there is nothing that goodness and kindness suggest that would not occur to them but i do not think i could go there just at present will you give them my love georgiana when you are next writing and tell them of my movements i will write to them from ireland and give them my direction indeed indeed i will but may i not tell them anything more oh how i wish i could help you in any way exclaimed georgiana anxiety showing itself so acutely in every syllable that fitzwilliam was forced to get up to avert his face from hers lest his self command should be too sorely tried my dear kind little cousin i shall always be grateful to you even though i fear it is not in your power to help me just now some day perhaps we may speak of it in the meantime i have had a great disappointment and i think i had better go away for awhile so as to be more fit to meet my friends when i return he came back to her raised her up and spoke with resolution and cheerfulness come georgiana do not be sad it is not worth while i shall probably be at pemberley in the autumn and we must do something then to make up for the loss of our exploration party now do not think of me at least only think of me as catching and eating a great many salmon i hope you will have great deal of pleasure still in london you return to the hursts to day do you not will you make my excuses to mrs annesley during this speech georgiana had striven to recover her composure and she managed at the conclusion of it to look up at him with a tolerably calm face and to promise to deliver his messages she felt convinced that he had been refused by miss crawford and the situation was to her so dreadful so far beyond repair that it was a relief to see her cousin's courage and to know that he did not wish to hear vain and spiritless words of consolation words which she hardly could have been able to utter even had he been able to listen from the very surcharge of tender feeling that burdened her heart nevertheless her sympathy was reflected in her eyes and in the gentle voice with which she bid him adieu and wished him well fitzwilliam was not insensible to it it gave him the only comfort he could have received at such a time and pressing her hand warmly with a very earnest god bless you he quitted the room as his footsteps died away georgiana sank into a chair and wept bitterly so brief had been his visit a few ticks of the clock had seen his arrival and his departure and in those few moments the aspect of everything had changed since their last meeting georgiana had dwelt incessantly upon his prospects of happiness and allowed herself to think of them as being in a fair way to become realized the difficulty which elizabeth must have referred to and mr yates had actually hinted at could surely be cleared away now that he and miss crawford had met again and georgiana had not been able to read cruelty or harshness in that fair face time only a very short time would be necessary and once miss crawford knew fitzwilliam as he was the rest would follow as a matter of course for how could any woman whom he really loved be able to resist him so reasoned georgiana and the collapse of her kindly hopes brought back all her old sense of personal guilt she too was partly responsible for her cousin's dire fate for was she not one of the two women who had failed to make him happy she who had not been able to inspire him with a real love and miss crawford who could not respond to it now it was fully awakened the luxury of grief could not be long indulged in for tear stained features must not be shown to her friends nor was there leisure that day to pour out her heart in a letter to elizabeth georgiana had to keep her sorrowful thoughts to herself and fortunately it was not necessary to give any explanation of colonel fitzwilliam's abrupt departure from town to mrs annesley the simple statement that he had gone leaving apologies and suitable compliments was sufficient with her hostesses in grosvenor street however it was a different matter and georgiana lacked courage to introduce the subject until a morning or two later at breakfast choosing the moment when the letters had just been brought in and everyone had only that remnant of attention to spare which their meal and their correspondence had not absorbed mr hurst asked a question or two which as his wife and sister were speaking at the same time went so long unanswered that he quite forgot them louisa showed surprise and offended dignity that the colonel had not paid a farewell call on her before leaving while caroline with less pride and a great deal of curiosity attempted at first to draw georgiana into some admission beyond the mere mention of the fact but remembering by happy chance to have heard the name of the friend in ireland and even that of his estate she was able to her own satisfaction to convert the mysterious journey into an engagement of respectably long standing georgiana breathed more freely she had dreaded miss bingley's cross examination and still so dreaded anyone guessing at her cousin's misfortune that she even deviated so far from her usual truthfulness as to say yes probably he had been intending to go all the time as soon as the weather should be suitable it was the greatest comfort to feel that with elizabeth there need be no concealment already a description of the meeting with miss crawford had travelled to pemberley but with none but the simplest and most obvious comment georgiana asked as directed by fitzwilliam for more particulars connected with her new acquaintance but until she had been openly admitted to a share in her elders' knowledge she did not like to speak of what was still mere guesswork but now although elizabeth's answer had not yet been received she felt she could write more freely she only had been allowed a glimpse of her cousin's inmost heart she only had witnessed his grief and had been allowed to surmise its origin she could be the indirect means of bringing him the quick sympathy of his two best friends and she was justified in telling her sister of all she knew and all she conjectured he had been refused dear elizabeth ran one sentence it can be nothing else and i fear it is irrevocable poor cousin robert he feels it so terribly can nothing be done for him you know her you know them both he is sure to tell you all do help him dear elizabeth you always help people who are in trouble her letter closed and dispatched she experienced a feeling of relief from strain having left her cousin's affairs in more capable hands than her own his sad face long haunted her but the words she had written reminded her of another person who was now probably calling upon elizabeth for sympathy and help not that kitty had been by any means forgotten but in the silence that followed on her departure and the new interest that had occupied the last few days the ball and its attendant emotions had been rather pushed to one side but georgiana had returned to grosvenor street fully expecting to find a letter from derbyshire or intelligence of kitty in some other form her own letter to elizabeth concluded the morning after the ball had contained in addition to an account of that memorable event a paragraph to this effect kitty has something extremely interesting to tell you i shall not spoil her pleasure by anticipating her but only add that i believe everything is going to turn out just as happily as she would like and as we should like for her pray pray give me your opinion on this important matter as soon as you can form one i am longing to have it a reply to this letter was indeed awaiting her but did not give the desired information as elizabeth though anxious to hear kitty's news had not yet had an opportunity of seeing her and kitty herself had not written she was a wretched correspondent and the delights of the first few days with jane and the children doubtless absorbed both head and hands bingley's own notes to his sisters during that week were useless one announced his and kitty's safe arrival another requested the forwarding of some stockings he had left behind was it likely that such communications would have any bearing upon an important matter like the progress of a young lady's love affair as to mr price georgiana knew nothing and was prepared for anything it was quite possible that he had been unable to wait for the shooting of mr bingley's pheasants and was at that moment in derbyshire upon this point however elucidation was presently forthcoming at the dinner table that afternoon miss bingley suddenly inquired did i tell you georgiana that we had a call from charles's friend mr price one day last week no replied georgiana startled by such an abrupt incursion into the subject i had not heard were you at home did you see him yes we were all at home he is an agreeable young fellow manners a little too self possessed perhaps for his age but they are what these naval men acquire he asked after you rather as if he expected to find you here georgiana said to herself that he wanted the latest news of kitty or at all events any he could not obtain from mrs knightley and was glad to be saved the necessity of replying aloud by mrs hurst's beginning to speak yes they had quite liked him she thought of inviting him to fill a vacant place at a dinner she was giving the following week for these young men who had travelled could always talk entertainingly enough to be worth while but she would like to be assured of his character she fancied he had been a good deal run after and spoilt and certainly he was a great flirt georgiana's heart swelled and her pulse beat quick at such an accusation while she uttered a mild but steady protest against it mrs hurst maintained her ground but her young guest was supported by miss bingley who said nonsense louisa you know i have told you there is really nothing in that all these young officers especially those who have seen service are bound to be run after whether they will or not and as to his being a great flirt we have seen him once or twice going about with a very good looking woman and that is all the reason we have for thinking so how can you say such a thing caroline mr price is perfectly at liberty to go about with as many handsome women as he likes even if their brothers are notoriously vicious but if he is engaged to one of them and from all we heard and saw at emma knightley's the other night he certainly ought to be one has a right to expect a little more discretion it is not at all certain that he is engaged to kitty bennet i believe said caroline you know emma knightley's great schemes do not always come to anything georgiana was thereupon appealed to by both sisters to give a denial or confirmation of the fact alleged and she could only say that she believed that at present he and kitty were not engaged that rather supports my opinion of him said mrs hurst but i shall be glad to be proved wrong georgiana if you are behind the scenes you must let us know as soon as there is anything to be told and in the meantime unless you think mr price likely to injure our morals you had better invite him to dinner added her sister georgiana felt unaccountably disturbed by this conversation she could not bear hearing a person ill spoken of whom she had every wish and reason to like and esteem and though she felt sure her own impressions of mr price which differed so widely from mrs hurst's were far more likely to be the correct ones her timidity in trusting her own judgments caused her to pause and wonder whether she had been too hasty in being so impulsively delighted with him ought she not as kitty's friend to be more cautious until she had been sure that he was not going to disappoint the hopes of that friend that he had raised high hopes georgiana knew but even supposing kitty's imagination had been her strong ally his attentions and kitty's willing acceptance of them had clearly been such as to expose her to remark georgiana sighed over the difficulties of the whole problem she could not bring herself to believe that william price was a flirt though the picture of him in constant attendance upon a handsome woman who had doubtful relations when he should have thought only of kitty was an unwelcome one no one with that countenance that frank smile and clear honest eye could surely be other than he seemed and yet georgiana had not to look far into the past to find a disappointment as unexpected as severe as mr price's defection could be the persons who were apparently most attractive could often fail one most disastrously with miss crawford's image on one side of her and william price's on the other georgiana felt that anything was possible but she resolved to keep an open mind she recollected that kitty and mrs knightley must know him more intimately than mrs hurst did and in trying to obliterate the latter's words from her mind she fell into a reverie wherein she lived again through every joyous moment of mrs knightley's ball during the ensuing week the long wished for letters arrived but as is usual in such cases they fell far short of expectation which of us has not looked forward some time or another to receiving a letter which we are convinced will have an important effect upon our minds it will clear up a mystery give specific information console us in affliction or furnish the exact counsels which we need we depend upon it for one or all of these things and we continue to do so even though the letter which arrives after so much anticipation is almost always inadequate it tells us half instead of all we expected our correspondent to know its advice has overlooked our difficulties and does not meet the case its words of comfort are few and arid yet hope leads us ever on and the envelope bearing our friend's handwriting is torn open with as much eagerness at the fiftieth crisis as at the first georgiana put down elizabeth's letter with a feeling of disappointment yet telling herself that she could not have expected anything else elizabeth wrote that various matters had prevented her from seeing kitty up to that time but that she had heard from jane all particulars of kitty's acquaintanceship with mr price with additional interest from having heard his name already from the wentworths and was inclined to entertain the most favourable hopes regarding it it was difficult to say more without seeing the young people together and they could only look forward to the visit in november and trust to it to bring about the happiest results this was the ordinary sensible view and georgiana took up kitty's letter wondering whether she was now calm enough in mind to be induced to take the same desborough park july my dear georgiana i make no apology for not writing for you know what it is like here the first few days so much to see and jane wanting me all the time besides you have all the news now that i have left london there is nothing for me to relate i received your letter from mrs annesley's but pray write again as soon as you possibly can and tell me if you have seen anything of mr p i was so enchanted to hear miss bingley ask him to call as it meant i should hear of him from you he stayed on quite a long time at the ball and mrs knightley told me he thanked her in such a particular and unmistakable way when he said good night i forgot to ask you do you not think he dances exquisitely i have never worn that rose coloured gown since how i long for november what shall i do if he is prevented i cannot describe how thankful i am that i did not go with lydia to the west indies i have seen mr morland whom you told me of a great many times indeed he spends half his time here as jane and bingley are very fond of him he is very pleasant considering he is a clergyman he is laying out his garden at the rectory afresh and jane is giving him a quantity of plants so we go down there frequently to help him to put them in now i must conclude as mr morland is coming to take me out in a boat on the lake it will be very amusing as i have never been able to get near enough to the water lilies to gather them but as i say to mr morland we can neither of us swim and what will happen then jane sends you many messages your affectionate friend a postscript on another page added mrs k says that mr p is likely to be made commander very soon i hope he will not be for he would have to join the ship immediately but would not captain price sound well captain price sounded very well even georgiana could not help thinking so as she smiled over kitty's artless question which resented the promotion while it welcomed the title this letter too was just what might have been expected kitty was nursing her attachment in the country just as she had nursed it in town and georgiana was called upon to supply it with nourishment she would have to wait until after she had seen mr price to know whether any was forthcoming mrs hurst's dinner party took place and closely resembled every other function of the same kind in fashionable houses being very long very correct and very sumptuous georgiana wished that louisa would place her next to mr price but this was not done and accordingly though he walked straight towards her after having spoken to his host and hostesses he had scarcely inquired after her health before he was drawn away to be introduced to his dinner partner while georgiana was accosted by hers a certain captain wentworth whom with his wife she had met in bath the year before the wentworths went there regularly and the friendship which existed between them and the darcy family had been renewed there in the previous april on one occasion when they had all happened to be in town together elizabeth had introduced the wentworths to mrs hurst and the result had been a liking on the part of that lady stronger than with her cold and narrow disposition she was usually inclined to form the liking was not perhaps quite so heartily returned but captain wentworth was sociable and enjoyed mixing with the world and anne's tender solicitude for him caused her to accept willingly any invitations likely to procure him amusement both at winchester where they lived and in the course of their frequent visits to town captain wentworth well remembered mr and mrs darcy's shy handsome sister and prepared for a pleasant evening when he found in her less of the former quality and even more than she had used to possess of the latter on her other side was seated the alarming mr knightley and georgiana was glad to find she had at all events one companion so conversable as captain wentworth who belonged to the profession she was most interested in even though he was not the representative of it which she would have chosen their talk was lively for captain wentworth had the art of treating subjects amusingly and of drawing from his companion professions of opinion which she had not till then known herself to hold somehow or other they had drifted on to the topic of inconsistency in sailors and captain wentworth gravely undertook their defence against this charge i assure you miss darcy it is a great mistake made only because people are unacquainted with our true character it is of long standing but a fallacy just as much as many other accepted fallacies for instance that parrots always talk bad language that ladies cannot keep accounts that the king can do no wrong etc oh stop please captain wentworth interposed georgiana you are opening up too many vexed questions i was going to say she added more seriously that no doubt you are quite right but i should think if they are inconstant it would not be so very strange for they must have so many temptations not at all i protest they have no more excuse on that head than any other class of man if a man is inconstant by nature he will be so whether he is a sailor or a butcher's assistant i speak from experience for i know i tried very hard to be inconstant and could not succeed though i had as many temptations as mist knowing mrs wentworth said georgiana with a smile at that lady i cannot help being aware of how strong a temptation you had to be the reverse exactly and so would it be with anyone who had once given whatever affection he had to bestow how have you got the idea miss darcy that we poor men of the sea are so fickle indeed no i have not got it replied georgiana trying to speak lightly i was merely speculating for i know too little about it to form any judgments it was put into my mind through hearing someone say that young officers were so much sought after everywhere and i thought if that were so it was only natural that the amiable ones might find eventually that they had formed many more friendships than they could possibly keep up very considerately put miss darcy but in effect what you mean is that they continually 'love and ride away' sailors may have more opportunity for that kind of living but upon my word i do not believe they have more inclination but granting that it is so i gather that you are prepared to forgive them this little weakness that is asking rather too much captain wentworth replied georgiana in the same spirit of gaiety had she spoken the whole truth she would have said certainly not if any friend of mine were involved but not wishing her companion to think that their chat had any personal application she continued i shall be able to tell better when i have met with such a case and turned the subject off with a smile soon after the ladies returned to the drawing room georgiana seated herself beside mrs wentworth whose gentle manners combined with serenity of temper and the power she had of entering unobtrusively but none the less sincerely into the feelings of others had for georgiana a strong attraction they had not met for so long that there was much to be talked over between them mrs wentworth presently asked after colonel fitzwilliam and explained that she happened to know he was in town through seeing him a few nights previously at the theatre where she had been with a party invited by her father and sister georgiana replied that he was well but had gone away since then and so as not to dwell on the subject asked for a description of the play which led them on to other topics of interest when they were interrupted by mrs knightley's joining them her errand was merely to ask for news of kitty and georgiana rather than resenting the smile of mutual understanding with which the question was put answered as briefly as she could without discourtesy mrs knightley then began talking of other things and resettled herself in her chair so that georgiana despaired of having mrs wentworth to herself any more that evening but perceiving she was not wanted elsewhere she continued to retain her place until the gentlemen entered the room simultaneously with the tea and coffee which the servants began to dispense mr price obtained cups immediately and brought them across the room to the group of ladies at once warmly greeting mrs wentworth mrs knightley remained beside them and georgiana indulged in a little private regret partly on her own account and partly on his for she knew he must be wanting to talk to her about kitty and since there was music during the evening the present might be the only opportunity they would have she began to think of moving away for mr price seemed quite monopolized by mrs knightley who was endeavouring to show him off by asking him questions and calling mrs wentworth's attention to the answers and though georgiana was grateful to his efforts to draw her in by an occasional smiling glance at her and a don't you think so miss darcy there did not seem to be any place for a fourth in their conversation presently however an interruption arrived in the person of captain wentworth who came with coffee cup in hand to join their group and as mr price stood aside to give him room he exclaimed cheerfully well price have you and my wife undertaken the conversion of miss darcy yet here has someone been deluding her with most horrible picture of us sailors 'one foot on sea and one on shore to one thing constant never' you know the rest of it i have been trying to persuade her that it is all wrong georgiana blushing and smiling began to protest and mrs wentworth to spare her also treated it as a joke but mrs knightley when she had comprehended captain wentworth's meaning gave her a look of no great goodwill and said surely miss darcy does not take seriously what is merely a vulgar tradition 'men were deceivers ever' was not written with special reference to sailors i imagine but to men in general of course not said captain wentworth with mock gravity but miss darcy does not base her suspicions on those lines only but on far more serious premises frederick i will not have you tease miss darcy so unmercifully said mrs wentworth it is really too bad i am sure you have placed words in her mouth which she never uttered has he not miss darcy georgiana struggling with embarrassment amusement and not a little real vexation as she was conscious of mr price's eyes being turned silently upon her could not protest as intelligibly as she would have wished yes mrs wentworth it is quite untrue i never said anything of the kind captain wentworth you are unfair not that it really matters but i said i had no opinion on the subject i only thought i could quite understand their being changeable if they were whether her hearers could extract any meaning from these words she did not know but it was certain that her confusion stood her in good stead for captain wentworth immediately apologized with just as much seriousness as was needful i am very sorry miss darcy pray excuse my stupidity i was so distressed to feel that we as a class should merit your disapproval in even one particular that i wanted to clear our characters and after all you are so kind as to imply that they needed no clearing i do not think miss darcy implied that said mrs knightley and i confess myself curious to learn why she thinks naval men are likely to be changeable it would be interesting to compare notes for my experience of them has led me to the opposite conclusion georgiana felt the double edge in mrs knightley's words and it was painful to her to be so completely misunderstood even in such a trifling matter but she had hardly recovered her composure enough to defend herself when captain wentworth took the matter out of her hands miss darcy's experience of inconstancy in sailors has been a sad one mrs knightley he said solemnly it is drawn entirely from books and plays and we know how persistently they look on the dark side of human nature she only needs to become acquainted better with real life as personified in myself mr price with a bow to william and many other admirable specimens of naval men to form the soundest of opinions of us pardon me miss darcy for assuming the role of spokesman but i fancied the fear of offending my modesty might have prevented you from expressing such sentiments as you would wish i hope you will always interpret me as correctly as you have done captain wentworth returned georgiana smiling and seeing that mrs knightley was beginning to speak in a low tone to mr price and not wishing to hear any of her comments she turned to mrs wentworth and proposed that they should move to chairs nearer the pianoforte they therefore turned in that direction but mr price could hardly have any time to reply to mrs knightley for an instant later he was at georgiana's side asking if he might find her a seat and mrs wentworth being just then drawn away by miss bingley she not unwillingly allowed him to lead her to a sofa on the opposite side of the room to procure her another cup of coffee her own having been removed and to sit beside her talking quietly and agreeably in a manner that soothed her nerves irritated as they were by captain wentworth's ill timed raillery she listened absently without saying much grateful to him for not renewing the subject which had just been dropped and hoping he had not attached any importance to it but her attention was all alert when after a pause he inquired have you good accounts of miss bennet since she left town she tried to collect her scattered ideas to remember what kitty expected of her yes she had had good accounts she thought her friend was very well and she believed enjoying the country though it probably seemed very quiet to her after such a long visit to london william price assented and said that miss bennet had so much freshness and enthusiasm she could enjoy many things and enter keenly into them all georgiana fully endorsed this but thought that kitty had had a particularly delightful visit to town this year and really regretted leaving william price said that miss bennet's friends were very sorry to lose her this is all very well thought georgiana but we do not get any farther am i shy of him or is he shy of me oh i wonder what kitty would like me to say if i were mrs knightley i could probably bring in the inconstancy of sailors with good effect i suppose she thinks that i mean to throw a doubt on mr price how unlucky that it should have had that appearance she was assisted in her meditations by mr price's remarking that he had never been in derbyshire and imagined it to be a beautiful county and this afforded her the opportunity of descanting on the loveliness of its scenery and the particular attractions of the country round desborough park she added that she hoped there would be nothing to prevent him from seeing it for himself that autumn and he replied warmly agreeing and saying that if he were still his own master at that time nothing should prevent it a question or two about pemberley followed and the relative positions of the two houses he had heard of it as being a show place from his sister mrs bertram who had made a tour through the midland counties to visit all the cathedrals and old churches but he declared had actually been so worldly as to look at one or two of the grand mansions as well georgiana questioned its worldliness and was told that his brother and sister were the dearest people but dreadfully good they thought everything wrong this description of which georgiana would have liked to have heard more was interrupted by a song and at its conclusion mr price was waiting with the inquiry do you return to pemberley soon miss darcy in about a month i think but i leave town in a fortnight's time to stay with my aunt at hunsford i am leaving london almost immediately i am sorry to say said william price i have to go down to portsmouth where my mother is changing houses and as she has that and a quantity of lawyers' business on her hands since my father died she wishes me to help her georgiana could not but approve of this decision but she thought it partly accounted for the young man's being in far less good spirits this evening than on the previous occasion he evidently did not like to quit london she was endeavouring to think of a way of conveying to him that she would see kitty almost as soon as she reached home when the opening of a solo on the harp caused her to forget everything but the sound of the instrument in which she had always taken extreme delight mr price too listened with close attention and when it was over and they were commending the performance he exclaimed the harp always reminds me of one of the most charming women i ever knew who used to play it still does i daresay at all events it is associated inseparably with her curiosity as well as politeness impelled georgiana to ask for more particulars for she privately wished very much to know what her companion's idea of a charming woman might be and he answered readily enough she was a lady i first met some years ago at mansfield before my sister's marriage she was a friend of the whole bertram family and in a way of my sister's also but circumstances divided them miss crawford's people left the neighbourhood and now i only see her occasionally in town miss darcy's start and heightening of colour did not escape him he looked inquiringly at her and question and answer broke from them both simultaneously yes i have met miss crawford said georgiana what a very strange thing i was introduced to her in the gardens the other day by by a mutual friend and i had heard of her before from my brother and sister that is indeed strange i wish i had known when i was with her last i have been seeing a good deal of mrs grant her sister and miss crawford lately being myself that abomination an idle man about town but it has just this once had its agreeable side georgiana murmured that she had supposed he was seldom in london for so long and he continued with perfect ease and frankness quite true indeed i have never before had time to see the sights and miss crawford who is a regular londoner takes me about to them in order she says to waste my time as usefully as possible to day we were at a picture gallery and last week we went to see an exhibition of silver models of ships most interesting and unusual it was i would not have missed it for the world the curious design and rigging of them i should like to have shown them to you miss darcy georgiana echoed his wish but was so much interested in pursuing her theory that miss crawford was the handsome young woman mrs hurst had spoken of that she ventured one more question you said you had known miss crawford for some time mr price oh yes for years looking back on it i must have been quite a small boy when we first met at all events i regarded her as being one of my elders that is a very ungallant thing to say is it not i do not know why i said it but i always had a great regard for her and when the families were alienated i always tried to keep in touch with her and mrs grant for the severance was through no fault of hers only her brother's though i know the blame for it has often been laid at her door how easy it is to believe in people if only we wish to do so this speech fully accounted for all that had been heard of mr price and acquitted him of any lightness of conduct he had merely been faithful to an old friend and miss crawford was only proved more worthy than before of colonel fitzwilliam's esteem georgiana longed to inquire further to see if mr price could throw more light on the recent perplexing event but felt it would be presumption to do so and he sat musing for a few moments unaware of the sentiments he had aroused in his companion until in response to a remark from her he exclaimed warmly yes she is indeed a beautiful woman and as charming as beautiful you would like her miss darcy if you knew her i heard this evening that she was engaged i do not know if it is true but i am inclined to hope not if i heard the name aright still one must presume it will be all for the best he spoke the last words somewhat hurriedly as if not wishing to dwell on them but could not overlook the anxiety in georgiana's face and voice is she engaged mr price i thought perhaps that might be the case do you know to whom it is i heard a name mentioned miss darcy but i do not like i am uncertain whether it is correct i should like to verify it first said william price in some embarrassment of course i quite understand it would not be fair to say anything until you are sure but no doubt it is true and georgiana with a sigh fell into a reverie which her companion observing her with solicitude did not venture to interrupt they were divided a few minutes later georgiana being called upon to contribute a solo upon the pianoforte and she could not help feeling gratified to see that william price listened attentively to her playing for the love of music was in her eyes an additionally attractive feature in anyone's character these were the pleasantest impressions she derived from the evening for on the whole they had been sad ones she had inadvertently exposed herself to being misunderstood by mrs knightley and perhaps by mrs wentworth for whose esteem she cared far more she had not been able to say one word to help kitty and would have no news to give of the kind that kitty was longing for and worst of all her fears for her cousin were confirmed instead of anyone being able to help him he could only be told that the disappointment he had experienced was a final and permanent one georgiana's thoughts were all for him they hardly even strayed to speculate upon miss crawford's choice except for a touch of wondering pity for one who had possessed his regard and thrown it away for another's no the world was determinedly awry and georgiana went to bed longing for the comfort of elizabeth and pemberley and dreading the days to be spent under the judicial and unsympathetic eye of her aunt catherine chapter xii elizabeth and her husband desired georgiana's return as much as she did herself but lady catherine had been very urgent that her niece should visit her and they judged it right that she should take the opportunity of going while comparatively near rosings georgiana had never before stayed there without the protection of her brother's or sister's presence but she found it to be less alarming than she feared for her aunt was probably disposed to be more complaisant and less dictatorial to her than to any other living creature and while not comprehending her niece's character in the least wished to make her happy if it were possible to be happy in the best rosings manner so georgiana obediently played the piano joined in games of quadrille drove out with her cousin in the pony chaise endured her aunt's admonishments and listened politely to lady catherine's long stories about her own youth and the time did at length pass away though not until she had many times decided that london even with the agitations that it had afforded this year was far less wearing to the temper and spirits the date of her homecoming was fixed for the fifth of august and an escort was unexpectedly found in the person of mr bennet who had made one of his sudden resolves to go and stay with his two daughters mrs bennet having the prospect of her sister mrs phillips's companionship throughout that month georgiana was enchanted when this decision was conveyed to her as it ensured that no postponement of the journey would be made upon any pretext mr bennet had proposed visiting his daughters and bringing back kitty and the first part of this suggestion was warmly welcomed the second they could not promise to accede to but mr bennet would be conferring a signal service if he would meet miss darcy in london and bring her home mr bennet declared himself quite agreeable let miss darcy name her own day for starting and it should be his but once named it must be considered fixed for mr bennet it must be noted had a wife and five daughters and knew something of the variability of the female mind he had however never been in less danger of a change of plans than on this occasion elizabeth had received the first intimation of her father's intended visit shortly after dispatching to georgiana the letter which has been mentioned and having now so many matters to talk over with jane she determined on going to desborough without delay an hour or two's chat would not be sufficient and she therefore arranged to stay for a night and return the following afternoon and pressed darcy to accompany her but this he declined to do telling her that he should only be in the way when she jane and kitty were putting their heads together for a feminine conclave and bingley was as bad as the rest it happened that jane was alone when she arrived bingley being out riding with kitty and mr morland but he was not long in returning and when kitty had greeted her sister and retired to change her dress he joined the conference as darcy had foretold well elizabeth he began and how do you find kitty i never saw her in better looks and has jane told you about my young friend in london who it appears is an admirer of hers i declare i had not an idea of it when i asked him to come down but it turns out very well as it happens elizabeth admitted herself informed and asked bingley for particulars of mr price's character appearance and manners of which it was to be presumed he could give a more reasonable account than kitty he spoke warmly in the young man's praise and mentioned what he had heard of his family and connections from mr yates it seems most satisfactory said elizabeth and his being a friend of the wentworths is a further recommendation i am quite looking forward to meeting him though time alone will show if there is anything in it kitty has set her heart on it to such an extent that i feel extremely anxious that she may have no disappointment said jane with tenderness it would be enough to make her ill her sensibilities are so acute one can see how she watches for the letters from mrs knightley and the eagerness with which she reads them whatever mrs knightley may do said elizabeth in my opinion we should not be acting wisely by kitty in encouraging her to talk and think much about it on the young man's side it has not gone beyond a promising inclination i infer and it may never be more you are a prudent creature elizabeth exclaimed her brother in law but as regards kitty your precautions are too late as i know to my cost there was i thinking i was bringing down the very girl for morland to fall in love with indeed i had almost told him so and now it appears she is more than half engaged to someone else and what good is that to a man who wants a wife to establish in that big house of his well said elizabeth laughing you need not reproach yourself charles a house and living were promised to mr morland but a wife i believe was not in the bond it would have been very pleasant to have provided him with one nevertheless returned bingley as it is they see a great deal of each other and are such excellent friends that if it were not all such a profound secret it would be incumbent on me to give him a hint of the state of things elizabeth looked at her sister for confirmation of this and jane replied yes they are good friends kitty seems to enjoy his companionship and he has evidently a strong liking for her so that i sometimes feel afraid lest it should develop into anything likely to cause him pain hereafter but of course as i have repeatedly told bingley even in view of such a contingency we have no right to betray our knowledge of kitty's private hopes as mr morland dined at desborough elizabeth had an opportunity of observing the young people and she thought she had seldom seen kitty to greater advantage her particularly delicate beauty was heightened partly by excitement and partly by the healthful country life she was at perfect ease happy with her sisters and mr bingley and treating mr morland much as she would have treated an elderly friend of the family not as a man to be captivated the feeling of frank goodfellowship which he seemed to inspire was a simple and wholesome one and elizabeth tried to rest assured that mr morland was aware of kitty's attitude towards him and wished for nothing more that indeed was the impression he gave but the longer she was with him the more clearly she perceived that now his circumstances were more settled a quiet contentment an evenness of temper had become habitual to him without taking away the earnestness the steadfastness of purpose which underlay the whole she felt that she did not yet thoroughly know mr morland and the following morning in the course of a brief talk with kitty she suggested to her in the gentlest possible way of the desirability of not allowing so excellent a young man who was also a solitary one to entertain thoughts of her which might be so much more easily admitted to his mind than expelled from it kitty had just been giving wings to her imagination in a description of mr price which elizabeth had felt herself hard hearted to be obliged to check and the young girl with difficulty came down to earth again to mr morland to assure elizabeth with all haste of indifference that she was positive that morland did not think of her in that way he only cared for his parish and his house and as for his being solitary why his sister sarah was coming to live with him elizabeth was compelled to be content and in addition she secured a promise from jane that kitty should come to pemberley about the middle of september kitty was delighted with the arrangement so long as there was one which secured her return to desborough for the shooting party early in november her eldest sister exhibited an almost equal amount of eagerness on her behalf to settle this important matter and kitty who had been living in terror lest some cruel fate should intervene to send her back to longbourn before that time breathed more freely when her sisters undertook to obtain her father's consent to such a long absence mr bennet and georgiana duly arrived at pemberley and were welcomed with all the warmth that affection could show they had been a curiously assorted pair of travelling companions and their relations had speculated with amusement upon their chances of congeniality neither being talkers they had at least had that in common though after their arrival georgiana smilingly reproached mr bennet with having intently studied a book of latin poetry throughout the whole journey and mr bennet gravely apologized for not having selected a volume more suitable for reading aloud he was sorry he had not been at more pains to while away the time for a young lady who was exceedingly punctual and always ready when the carriage came round for his own part he declared that he felt himself becoming more conversational with every mile of the way in proof of which he twice voluntarily told elizabeth during the first hour that he was glad to see her again and announced that after his own library there was no place he would sooner be in than mr darcy's the first evening was a cheerful one there was so much to say so many friends to inquire after adventures to relate and plans to detail the children were brought in and according to the time honoured custom everywhere were pronounced to have grown though it is to be feared that mr bennet was not an ideal grandparent for he so far miscalculated as to bring them toys which they could not properly appreciate for some years at least and elizabeth wanted to hear of little william and elizabeth collins with whom georgiana had often played at hunsford parsonage and who were described as being strikingly like their father and mother respectively it was not until the following day when the sisters were alone together that any words passed between them concerning colonel fitzwilliam elizabeth showed georgiana a few brief lines she had received from him stating little more than the bare facts of his departure and its cause she is engaged and it is all over for me now at all events i know the worst he wrote do not be too compassionate for me elizabeth i have been a fool to think that anything so bright and lovely should become mine yet i did not think she would bestow herself where she has i was a laggard i suppose and i threw my chance away in bath and how could she wait until i had reinstated myself no my dream is over you will hear of her engagement no doubt and i beg you to tell her that i join with you in wishes for her happiness i shall be with you at pemberley before long georgiana is an angel i did not deserve from her one quarter of the kindness she showed me in a postscript he added will darcy trust me to choose him a horse i have seen a beautiful pair of bays that would suit your large carriage besides a perfect chestnut hunter georgiana sighed and smiled over the letter and elizabeth said yes he evidently does not wish us to think he is overwhelmed by it though from what he does not say i can realize the depth of his feeling it is incredible for of course it must be sir walter elliot sir walter's was only a name to georgiana a vague recollection from the last year at bath and she replied that she had heard of the engagement from another source without particulars elizabeth gave a vigorous description of him and ended by saying that she should wait and see if the necessity for writing to miss crawford arose for she did not feel much disposed to congratulate her kitty's affairs were of course passed under review and elizabeth was somewhat surprised to find that georgiana was a staunch upholder of the notion that william price was likely to make her an offer as she had fancied that the accounts might have been exaggerated and that georgiana would be the one to take a sober and dispassionate view but her asseverations of her belief that mr price's truth and steadiness and in kitty's being unlikely to have deceived herself in this case went farther to convince elizabeth than anything she had heard before the next few weeks passed in tranquil enjoyment for all the persons in the pemberley circle in which must be comprised the party from desborough as no plan of any importance could be carried through without the joining of forces and the inclusion of mr morland on the one side and the ferrars from pemberley rectory on the other the bingleys with the two young people frequently drove over to spend a day or two days and when mr bennet removed to desborough towards the end of august it was not felt to be so much of a break up as a changing of the scene of their activities boating expeditions rides over the moors blackberry gatherings or evenings spent quietly at home in games or music something could always be found to suit the tastes of a party of people who were bent on finding pleasure in each other's company even kitty felt that only one thing was wanting to fill her cup of happiness to the brim for her father had sanctioned her staying on until november the month she hoped which would see its overflow for one person however this peaceful time was about to end in pain and disappointment mrs bingley and her sister were sitting indoors together one morning in the middle of september when mr morland was observed approaching the house he was such a frequent caller that it had become a habit with him to walk straight in and the ladies after waiting for some time wondered at his non appearance and still more at the intelligence brought by a servant in answer to jane's summons that mr morland had asked only for mr bennet and had been shown into the library what can he want with my father said jane a suspicion of the truth shooting across her mind and checking her utterance as she glanced anxiously at her sister but no such idea seemed to have occurred to kitty who innocently conjectured their interview to be a literary conference or a discussion that had arisen out of mr morland's sermon making mr bennet on perceiving his visitor might have anticipated something of the kind but mr morland's first words corrected him the young man's errand was indeed nothing more or less than to make a formal proposal for the hand of mr bennet's daughter and to request permission to address her he was nervous as men in his situation are apt to be but genuine feeling and sound sense enabled him to state his case well if not very fluently as he represented the strength of his attachment and described his worldly position and prospects mr bennet had long ceased to be surprised at receiving applications of the kind however unexpected they might be and certainly this one found him quite unprepared what little thought he had given to the subject had certainly not led him to the supposition of mr morland's becoming his son in law and he endeavoured to make his answer a discouraging one my daughter will be much honoured by your high opinion of her mr morland and i have no reason to think ill of your pretensions but i must admit that i have not remarked on her part any strong prepossession in your favour it is one of the things i have found most charming in miss bennet's character sir replied morland that she would not easily give her heart away or readily suppose a man to be enslaved by her no one else could have failed to perceive the depth of my admiration but she has seemed quite unconscious of it though at the same time i am fully aware that there is no brilliancy or distinction about me nothing to attract anyone who herself possesses a full measure of those qualities he looked so downcast that mr bennet remarked if that were the question mr morland you might set your mind at rest for my daughter though a very good girl is not brilliant nor would she be comfortable with a husband of that description this observation inspired mr morland to a fairly long speech in which he extolled kitty's amiable qualities and dwelt on his own demerits but notwithstanding the contrast thereby presented he was able to deduce a number of excellent reasons for his being allowed to propose to miss bennet without delay mr bennet heard him in silence and at the end replied that though flattered by mr morland's first referring to him who was merely the father of the young lady he could not answer for his daughter's sentiments he had found that in these matters his girls had always made up their own minds and no doubt would continue to do so indeed yes it is with miss bennet that i must plead my own cause but you will not refuse me your sanction said the young man eagerly you think so far favourably of my suit that you will place no bar in the way of my i trust i may in time say our perfect happiness no mr morland the way to your perfect happiness is open as far as i am concerned replied mr bennet taking up a book morland's satisfaction at having the father even passively on his side was very great and he spoke his gratitude very warmly mingling with it such praises of kitty and such rosy prognostications of the future as caused mr bennet to reply in characteristic fashion let me know when the time comes to wish you joy mr morland and i will do it but life is so uncertain that i think for the present i had better refrain have you ascertained whether kitty can cook make her own gowns and trim hats i understand it is a great promoter of married happiness when the wife can do so and i am not sure whether all my girls have turned their education to such good account mr morland only replied by asking if he might be allowed to see miss bennet at once and her father left the room foreseeing that whatever happened he should not have one more quiet hour during that day his anticipations were soon in the way to be fulfilled for on finding his daughters and sending kitty to the library he had to give jane an outline of what had just passed then repeat it to bingley who joined them and listened to their exclamations of surprise and regret at the probable downfall of mr morland's hopes jane and bingley were both too convinced of kitty's prior attachment to have the slightest expectation of his success and mr bennet was put in full possession of the facts relating to it while they anxiously awaited the termination of the interview it came after some minutes in a glimpse of kitty emerging from the library and hurrying upstairs with streaming eyes and while they all debated as to their next move mr morland was seen to cross the hall rapidly looking nowhere but in front of him and leave the house with precipitation jane herself almost equally distressed longed to go to kitty and bingley questioned whether he ought not to hasten after the young man while mr bennet was disposed to think they would be better left to themselves for a time and wished heartily that there were only just enough lovers in the world to go round one to each young lady and none over in spite of this jane was not long in finding her way to her agitated sister and in showing her the tenderest consideration kitty's distress was very great and also very sincere for she had in truth been far from guessing that mr morland took a more than common interest in her and as is usual in such cases the declaration of the young man's love woke in her feelings which she had not known to exist of reciprocal kindness and even affection which only did not share the nature and strength of his kitty could never have been hard hearted to any lover least of all to one whom she liked as much as she did james morland and his devotion touched her as deeply as the knowledge that she could not accept it wounded her between regrets for what had happened pity for him and for herself and the excited thoughts of william price which the incident itself was bound to evoke she was in a sad state and jane easily prevailed upon her to have her dinner upstairs and go early to bed not so easily could she check the tears which flowed continuously and jane to occupy her mind and body proposed that she should go to morrow to pemberley instead of in three days' time as arranged she could very well be sent over and the change would be beneficial besides she was not really leaving them for there was the november visit to look forward to kitty caught at the suggestion and declining the offices of the maid began to busy herself about her packing as jane hoped she would do while the latter descended to consult with her husband and father mr bennet and bingley both approved and jane hastily wrote a few lines to elizabeth to apprise her of what had happened that she might be prepared for kitty's arrival the two gentlemen walked to the nearest post town to convey the letter and after dinner the indefatigable bingley again set out this time to the rectory to perform the same kind office by james morland as his wife had been doing by kitty the young man though calmer proved far more unreceptive of consolation he had felt his rebuff acutely for kitty had been too much taken by surprise too sure of herself to make it otherwise than decisive and even the modest hopes he had ventured to entertain of being able to make more progress with her once the subject was opened between them had been most thoroughly dispelled miss bennet would not hear another word of it begged him never to speak of it again with tears reproached him for having spoilt everything so that in addition to his own disappointment he had the pain of feeling that she thought less well of him than before bingley could deny this but could not affirm anything else likely to give him comfort it remained for morland himself to declare which he did in a firm though melancholy tone that he regretted having distressed miss bennet and would endeavour so to meet her in the future that she would not suffer through being reminded of it by any act of word of his bingley commended his courage told him of kitty's departure and begged him to continue coming to desborough just the same and walked home with a full report of what had just passed jane shook her head over it for while sympathizing with both she was more truly sorry for mr morland since for him she could see no immediate prospect of compensation in spite of her father's assurances that a young clergyman was seldom allowed to remain inconsolable for more than six months and if kitty's other young man only did what was expected of him her fate would be a certainty in half that time chapter xiii needless to say kitty was heartily welcomed by georgiana and elizabeth and given every opportunity to relieve her mind by descriptions of the tragical affair in all its aspects both regretted it deeply for mr morland's sake and elizabeth privately did so for kitty's sake having such a good opinion of him as to make her wish that kitty could have been persuaded out of her fancy for a young man who however excellent was comparatively a stranger to them all and whose intentions at present were extremely uncertain she would have rejoiced if kitty and morland could have made each other happy and had entertained a slight hope that her hint to kitty might perhaps have helped matters in directing her thoughts into another channel but it seemed to be of no avail and georgiana gave her friend her warmest support implying entire agreement with her point of view i could not help it now could i georgiana you know yourself lizzie that i never dreamt it how could i do anything else but refuse him outright i was amazingly grieved to do so but you know very well georgiana that if i could think of one man more than another he is not that one she paused for assent which georgiana gave by a silent caress and then continued it is all so unfortunate it will never be as pleasant at desborough now poor mr morland i wish i had not had to hurt him he does want someone so badly in the rectory well my dear do not make yourself ill with these vain regrets said elizabeth it is as you say very unfortunate but no one blames you if you could not care for him you could not do it and someone else will have to inhabit that nice rectory kitty looked as if this prospect were not very pleasing either but georgiana seeing what elizabeth wished began to talk cheerfully of something else and kitty gradually joined in though whenever the two girls were alone together she found it difficult to abstain long from referring to some branch of the subject georgiana's loyalty and patience never failed but she wished for november almost as earnestly as kitty herself so that matters might reach some definite conclusion for kitty's restlessness had considerably increased since she had received james morland's offer and she was constantly nervous and excitable and not mistress of herself on the day when the bingleys and mr bennet came over for the latter to take leave before returning to longbourn this was specially noticeable in her state of anxious flutter when drawing jane aside to inquire after mr morland mr bennet bade her farewell gravely and more affectionately than was his wont telling her that he left her in good hands and would only give her one piece of advice namely that second thoughts were sometimes best kitty blushed deeply and could not pretend to misunderstand him but told georgiana afterwards that it was impossible to have better second thoughts when price was the first with his elder daughter mr bennet was rather more explicit telling elizabeth that he considered it was a great pity that so unobjectionable a young man should have been sent about his business elizabeth entirely agreed with him and thought it would not be going too far to express mr morland's praise in even warmer terms he will never set the thames on fire but there seems good stuff in him was mr bennet's reply when he proposed for her i had not taken much notice of him except to think him a tolerably sensible fellow and of course i had to readjust my ideas but i soon began to see that he must not be judged by that alone i have really liked him better too for his way of taking his refusal my dear father it does not always indicate a want of sense to wish to be married interposed elizabeth perhaps not but morland is much better off as he is than in marrying a girl he knows so little about kitty is flighty and expensive she ought to stay longer with you and jane and not think of being married for the next ten years elizabeth smiled and said she thought that it was unnecessary but that it would certainly be better for kitty to marry a clergyman than an officer in the navy who would be compelled to spend long periods away from home as to that of course it is a complete absurdity and i cannot think why you women who are so fond of making matches did not originate something less ridiculously unsuitable among yourselves elizabeth thought it wiser not to explain who actually had originated the idea and said after a pause you were saying that you have liked mr morland better of late yes he has positively shown some sort of self command and dignity he turned up at the house a day or two afterwards apparently not bent on making us all uncomfortable by the sight of his misery as most rejected lovers do besides bingley had had the foresight to produce some excellent port i hear from jane said elizabeth that he does not avoid or seek the mention of kitty and she thinks he is trying to give up all hope of her her absence for a few weeks will no doubt materially assist him said mr bennet kitty seized the opportunity offered by this visit to speak a private word to her brother in law with reference to the hero as bingley persisted in calling him she herself had no news for mrs knightley's frequent letters reported him still at portsmouth and bingley had heard nothing but promised to write and renew his invitation as soon as october was fairly in the same silence prevailed at pemberley with regard to miss crawford no announcement of her marriage had reached any of them and elizabeth had a half inclination to make some inquiries but was dissuaded by darcy who said whatever precisely has happened elizabeth we can be sure of one thing that miss crawford has allowed fitzwilliam to understand that she does not wish him to approach her again under these circumstances it is better that you should have no news to give him elizabeth sighed as she agreed to the wisdom of this decision but when shortly after her father's departure a letter was received from colonel fitzwilliam to say he would be returning at the end of the month she could not help wishing that she was more fully informed of the present state of affairs it would be a relief even though a sad one to fitzwilliam's mind to know that miss crawford was actually married and he would be unselfish enough to wish to hear that she was happy nothing occurred however to enlighten them and fitzwilliam arrived on the appointed day looking much as usual except for a few more lines about the eyes and an increased number of grey hairs it was the first time he and georgiana had been together at pemberley since the rupture of their engagement and both must have felt conscious of it georgiana in particular being prepared to be miserable for a time from the belief that her cousin instead of being cheered and invigorated as formerly by his return home must be reminded at every turn of the failure of their experiment the failure caused by her wretched weakness and incapacity worse still her brother must be reminded of it and there might be a repetition of his stern looks his cold manner she trembled at the thought unaware that darcy had long been persuaded of the wisdom of their parting ever since events in bath had shown him where his cousin's real affections were likely to be bestowed and the only difference which georgiana perceived after fitzwilliam's arrival was in the particular kindness he showed her and the complete renewal of the old comfortable relations amongst them all when inquiries after the hursts and mrs annesley had been made and georgiana had mentioned the dinner party and the persons who had been present little more was said with reference to london indeed there was little more for either to say for georgiana dared not refer to the person who had chiefly occupied his mind there fitzwilliam talked of his book and of ireland inquired about the prospects of the shooting showed interest in the minutest details of life in the neighbourhood and in every way endeavoured to prove that he was exactly his old self and only when walking with elizabeth in the park one morning did he betray how far that was from being the case there was no doubt that his disappointment had coloured his whole life he had allowed himself to think of miss crawford and to build high upon his hopes and to find himself again mistaken had been a blow which cut at the foundations of all his happiness his gaiety was feigned his pursuits had lost their zest his friends no longer sufficed him and as he said to elizabeth he had felt he had better adopt some country occupation and settle down to it and there grow old as quietly and quickly as might be elizabeth's heart was wrung the spectacle of her cousin's fine nature locked away as it were in a closed room as a thing no one had any need for was inexpressively painful to her and nothing else would have caused her to venture upon a reopening of the subject which he himself had not approached with the utmost gentleness she spoke a few words of commiseration and then still proceeding with extreme caution she told him of the absence of news and her assumption that miss crawford's marriage with sir walter elliot had been delayed i daresay it has returned colonel fitzwilliam with a kind of listlessness striking with his stick at the head of some tall grasses which bordered their path there can be no doubt of it i suppose pursued elizabeth none at all i should imagine replied the colonel miss crawford is not the kind of woman who would break her word once the engagement had been announced no of course not said elizabeth but i had expected that she or mrs grant would have written to me or even mrs wentworth as they must know i should be interested colonel fitzwilliam could not immediately recall anything of mrs wentworth beyond her name and on being reminded that she was sir walter elliot's daughter presently replied i do not think it altogether surprising she should not have written to you she probably cares little for the marriage and still less for the one which it was anticipated would follow it i mean miss elliot's to mr crawford this was a new idea to elizabeth and while she was pondering over it and the inferences to be drawn from it colonel fitzwilliam broke the silence by saying perhaps we had better not speak of this anymore elizabeth i know your great kindness of heart but i feel it does no good rather harm to be reviving thoughts which i must in honour suppress as much as possible i was anxious to know whether you had heard anything and to ask you again when you have the chance to tell her that i wish her well but now we have mentioned it it would i think be best for my contemptibly weak character to put it as far away as possible with tears in her eyes elizabeth assured him that through the tenderest regard for him not through any fear of overtaxing his fortitude she would respect his wishes but could not help begging him to remain with them at pemberley as heretofore so as to give them an opportunity of showing him how completely their happiness was bound up with his and of making use of any opportunity which might arise for them to be of service to him fitzwilliam gratefully promised to stay for the present and said that his only engagement was to go to some friends in leicestershire in november for the hunting elizabeth was nevertheless not perfectly satisfied and took occasion to ask georgiana shortly afterwards whether it was from mrs wentworth that she had heard confirmation of the fact that sir walter elliot was engaged to miss crawford no said georgiana in surprise it was from mr price mrs wentworth never mentioned it mrs wentworth of course i recollect now she is sir walter elliot's daughter but at the time i never thought of it for you see i did not know sir walter was the man very true i had also forgotten that you did not know said elizabeth and would never connect her with miss crawford i have been thinking that i should like for our own satisfaction to know when the wedding is going to take place and the simplest way will be to write and ask mrs wentworth i wish i had done so before but i did not wish to be in haste and i felt so convinced we should hear from others georgiana agreed that this was the best course to pursue and elizabeth having told darcy of her intention to which on account of her promise to fitzwilliam he could no longer object wrote and dispatched her letter the season was now drawing on and with the shortening days the family at pemberley found themselves thrown more upon the resources of their own immediate circle for amusement the weather was consistently bad and though this did not prevent the gentlemen from covering great distances for the purpose of slaughtering their game the ladies were of necessity restricted to a smaller area and their walks seldom extended beyond the park except when their inclinations led them along a tolerably clean road towards the rectory this happened pretty frequently for both elizabeth and georgiana were extremely attached to elinor ferrars their friendship was of a particularly sincere and well balanced kind and was not marred by their constant intercourse as each knew how to maintain that degree of reserve which prevents indiscriminate confidences and so greatly strengthens mutual respect kitty was the one who perhaps found the society of the rectory the least congenial but it is to be feared that she was extremely difficult to please that autumn and in the impatience with which she waited for one young man she might have sometimes regretted the solace which the company of the other would have afforded in such a small neighbourhood everyone was of some value and they all heard with interest of the approaching visit to mr and mrs edward ferrars of an old friend mrs jennings who was coming early in october to spend six or seven weeks with them mrs ferrars was in delicate health and mrs jennings besides having an almost maternal affection for her was well qualified to be of service as sick nurse and enlivening companion so that elinor's warning to mrs darcy that her friend although the kindest of women had not always the most refined manner of expressing herself did not prevent them from being anxious to make her acquaintance mrs jennings performed in safety the long journey from her son in law's house in devonshire and arrived in her customary high spirits it was her first visit to the ferrars's since their removal from delaford and she had to examine the house to criticize minutely the arrangement of their furniture and to compare their surroundings social and material with what they had been in their old home mrs darcy paid an early call on the new arrival and the morning after her visit georgiana and kitty also found their way to the rectory mrs jennings's exuberance her loud laugh and general noisy cheerfulness did not recommend her strongly to either of the girls in the first few minutes and georgiana was glad to move to a chair by mrs ferrars to enter into a quieter conversation with her but before long judging by the sounds which reached them mrs jennings and kitty had found some subjects in common this perhaps was not so surprising as mrs jennings was exceedingly fond of the society of all young girls and cared not at all whether they returned her partiality or no in this case she had begun with the utmost frankness to discourse on the subject nearest her heart at the moment namely her dear mrs ferrars and was relating all the circumstances under which their friendship had been formed the dashwood girls' visit to london the disagreeable conduct of mrs ferrars's mother and sister and the absurd misunderstanding as to colonel brandon's attentions the whole being punctuated by frequent bursts of laughter and she would doubtless have gone on to describe in detail the events attending the engagement of her two young friends had not elinor mildly but decisively interposed dear madam she said breaking off in the midst of a remark to georgiana i am sure miss bennet does not wish to hear the history of such a very dull old couple as ourselves you are so kind as to be more interested in it than most people could be lord my dear cried mrs jennings why did you not stop me i declare i am very sorry if i said a word i ought not i know my tongue does run on and miss bennet must excuse me for it was only for the pleasure of talking to you and mr edward and as for its being dull i don't believe there is anybody who does not like to hear of other people's love affairs it makes one think of one's own now does it not miss bennet kitty blushed and looked embarrassed and mrs jennings laughed heartily saying it is just as i thought miss bennet could tell us a pretty tale too i'll be bound if only she would miss bennet can tell us some wonderful tales of the west indies said elinor endeavouring to turn mrs jennings's mind from her favourite topic she has a sister there who writes to her constantly does she not miss bennet those tropical places must be very beautiful do you remember how colonel brandon used to talk to us of his travels in the east ma'am that i do my dear replied mrs jennings emphatically and i never want to hear again of such fearful things as he had seen swamps and great things like alligators and insects that did everything insects ought not i hope you will tell your sister not to get amongst them miss bennet kitty replied that her sister had written chiefly of the beautiful balls and illuminations which they frequently had and lately of some shocks of earthquake which had frightened them terribly mrs jennings exclaimed at this and declared that the finest ball in the world would not compensate her if there was the fear that the ground would open under her feet while she was dancing but i know young people do not care what risks they run said she there was sir john middleton three weeks ago wanted to have a moonlight picnic my daughter middleton was all against it for the weather was so threatening but have it he would and the consequence was that they all ate their supper or as much of it as they could in a roaring thunderstorm i can tell you they were in a pretty pickle when they got back all the girls so cross and the young men not a dry thread among them through trying to protect the ladies but sir john he made no bones about it at all but said they would go again another night when for sure it would be fine her hearers could not help laughing at such a picture of undaunted pleasure seeking and elinor inquired if the second party had taken place oh lord yes they all came but their fathers and mothers made them promise not to stir beyond the grounds i heard at any rate they turned it into a dance instead but as i say young people don't care for a drop of rain i am sure when i was young i would as lief have had it as not for there was no hardship in sheltering under a hedge with the right young man to hold an umbrella over you do you think so miss bennet still i fancy that most people old or young prefer outdoor expeditions to be in dry weather said elinor that reminds me that i must show you what terrible havoc last night's rain and wind worked in my flower borders when i looked out first i was quite in despair thinking i should not have another nosegay all the autumn there is a gleam of sunshine now so shall we take a turn in the garden georgiana gladly walked out with her and mrs jennings and kitty followed at a distance the former questioning her young companion about her sister abroad and hearing laments over the gaieties which that sister had been able to offer her but which she had never been able to accept mrs jennings's hearty comments of well there now that is a shame and a regiment too you would have broken all their hearts i vow and other such remarks pleased kitty while she knew in her heart they ought not to do so the two girls shortly after took their leave and while walking homeward naturally compared notes upon the stranger whom they had just met georgiana expressed herself guardedly not wishing to condemn any friend of mrs ferrars's although feeling as if that friend could not be in any way an accession to their party but kitty's first unfavorable impression seemed to have been obliterated and she declared frankly that she liked mrs jennings and thought she was very merry and good natured georgiana could not quite agree with this for she found mrs jennings's style of raillery not at all to her mind but admitted that she might be pleasanter when one got to know her well at dinner these opinions were canvassed and georgiana found as she expected that her own were largely shared by elizabeth who however was amused at her severity and told her that she would often meet people who with more refined manners were yet at heart far more vulgar than mrs jennings and had not a tenth part of her redeeming qualities i do not think i want to meet them then said georgiana but i am sure you are right elizabeth and i daresay she will be a great comfort to mrs ferrars when the ladies were together after dinner kitty whose gravity and preoccupation had been noticeable for the last half hour after wandering several times round the room stationed herself near to her sister and began in a solemn tone lizzie i want to ask you something very important elizabeth smiling professed herself all attention and kitty continued you know you have never kept your promise that you made before you were married of having a ball here for each winter something has happened to prevent it quite true kitty so a ball is in your mind and what made you think of it just now i never come here without thinking of it but i had somehow not expected to be staying long enough this year as i imagined i should go home directly after the shooting party but mrs jennings said to day she supposed you sometimes had balls in this lovely house and she was sure georgiana and i were fond of dancing and mrs jennings is quite right about the latter statement is she not georgiana looked up with a smile to assent to her share of the question and kitty clasped her hands rapturously exclaiming oh lizzie you know how much i love a ball it would be so kind of you and darcy everyone would enjoy it i am very fond of balls myself said elizabeth darcy as you know is not but i think even he might admit that it is sometimes a duty to give one the idea had crossed my own mind i confess but i had not considered whether our party or our numbers would be suitable kitty's joy at the favourable reception of her proposal was excessive she could not refrain from beginning to practise her steps about the room and singing the while from sheer delight and the gentlemen entering at that moment paused in astonishment on the threshold what is this kitty inquired darcy approaching something mrs jennings has taught you extreme merriment at the idea of mrs jennings as an instructress of dancing prevented kitty from immediately replying but the whole matter was presently explained and laid before darcy for approval seeing that her brother in law did not instantly dismiss the whole scheme kitty poured out a flood of reasons to commend it it was just the right time of year not too cold and snowy jane and bingley would have a party they could bring over no ball had been given at pemberley since georgiana was grown up the house was so conveniently built as if on purpose for balls and finally it would be a most delightful thing for everybody i know you want time to think it over said elizabeth to her husband and there is no hurry at all but i think it is quite feasible and we really owe the neighbourhood some entertainment of the kind darcy declared that he did not see why his house should be required to furnish his neighbours with the so called amusement of watching each other promenading about a polished floor and though no doubt it was a great compliment to the original architect he did not believe that pemberley had really been primarily designed for giving balls in but his family could perceive that his opposition was not intended to be very serious and the discussion terminated with his promising to talk it over with elizabeth and even to consider the middle of november as being a date likely to suit the convenience of both households kitty regarded the matter as settled and carried her news to the rectory the following morning in the highest spirits assuring mrs jennings that it was owing to her suggestion that the subject had been brought forward at the right moment the sincerity of that lady's delight and the warmth of her congratulations were most gratifying and she immediately began to ask kitty who her partners would be and what variety the young men of the neighbourhood could afford kitty confessed that there were not many living very near them with the exception of the officers of a regiment stationed at ashbourne with some of whom her brother was acquainted but that her sister mrs bingley would bring over one or even two who she knew for certain danced extremely well aha cried mrs jennings very pretty and they are single men too i warrant you kitty's look of consciousness gave mrs jennings far too fine an opportunity to resist and it did not take her long to ascertain enough particulars about a certain young naval officer to convince her that this ball was going to be the occasion for two young people to be made happy and all their friends regaled with some interesting news there was no need for her to hear very minute descriptions of mr price's conduct and the impressions it had left on the beholders the mere mention of his existence and a hint of kitty's partiality were sufficient material upon which to build up a whole romance miss bennet might depend upon it he was only waiting to come down here and make the acquaintance of the rest of her family and then not a moment would be lost although these assurances gave her pleasure and revived sensations which elizabeth and georgiana had not wished to encourage kitty could not help feeling a certain absurdity in accepting them from someone whose convictions were based solely on a good natured interest in the affair and she was tempted into giving a longer version of all that had happened in london in order that mrs jennings might be more fully informed it was a decided relief to talk to a friend whose opinions coincided with those of mrs knightley and as mrs ferrars was not in the room there was nothing to put a check on their confidences she had however an instinctive feeling of delicacy which made her stop short of divulging a more recent experience and the unconscious mr morland was saved had he but known it many witty sallies on his deserted condition elizabeth and georgiana were amused to notice how willing kitty henceforward became to go to the rectory for whereas she had formerly rather endured than enjoyed her visits there she now volunteered to join the others whenever they went she was generally to be found during some part of the time chatting with mrs jennings and when the good lady called at pemberley it was kitty's office to escort her home again mrs jennings had early discovered that miss darcy was grave and quiet and could on no account be induced to join in any joking references to lovers while mrs darcy's general style and manner were not such as to warrant the intimacy implied by such a conversation there were many other topics for mrs jennings was thoroughly kind and friendly and took the deepest interest in all her neighbours' concerns besides the sentimental ones their children their gardens their poultry their houses and their clothes the ball too afforded unending subjects for discussion there was to be no disappointment mr darcy had allowed himself to be talked into it and the fifteenth of november was fixed for the momentous occasion cards were sent out the officers accepted in a body colonel fitzwilliam promised to stay for it new dresses were ordered from london and not least among the minor excitements was reckoned the arrival of a letter from jane expressing the pleasure of herself and bingley at the prospect and engaging to bring with them at that time namely miss bingley mr price and a tom bertram this last name was accounted for by jane's explanation that bingley had asked mr price to bring his brother with him or some other man who could shoot and the brother not being available mr price had secured instead his cousin the elder son of sir thomas bertram of mansfield park perhaps not one of the party at the breakfast table to whom this letter was read aloud could hear it altogether unmoved elizabeth and her husband were naturally deeply interested in all that concerned kitty and were glad to know there was a certainty of seeing at last the young man of whom they had heard so much while georgiana rejoiced in this clear proof of his anxiety to meet kitty again and built upon it hopes of the progress of the affair speedily and uninterruptedly to its desired ending there need not surely be anything to delay it on the contrary no young lovers had ever more favourable circumstances his own brief stay on shore an excuse for apparent haste and kitty's being surrounded by her friends whose approval would be equivalent to that of her parents making everything easy indeed it was impossible to see what obstacles could arise he could not be diffident enough to entertain doubts as to whether his feelings or what were supposed to be his feelings were returned georgiana could not help a little smile at this thought though at the same time regretting that kitty should allow her heart to be read so clearly to kitty the announcement of his intended arrival at desborough was scarcely less tremendous than if he had walked into the room himself at that moment demanding her hand as he approached the latter incident could hardly have caused her a greater tremor than the former did and as soon as she could get georgiana alone she poured out afresh the old hopes fears and anxieties desiring georgiana to confirm all her own surmises with positive assertions to reply i am sure he will when kitty said i hope he will and to say of course most certainly when kitty speculated upon the various ways in which mr price might be expected to commit himself although feeling tolerably confident georgiana tried to confine herself to assurances of warm sympathy and pointed out to kitty that it was not prudent or delicate to assume so much when no actual declaration had been made but with mr price's coming so nearly in view this idea detracted from kitty's perfect satisfaction she privately found mrs jennings and her arrangement of the coming events far more encouraging colonel fitzwilliam's attention was caught by the names of mrs bingley's guests in rather a different manner mr price he recollected as georgiana's acquaintance but the name of bertram awoke associations of a kind which he was trying to subdue it was the name he had more than once heard coupled with miss crawford's it belonged to the people who were fatally connected with her past life had he only the right to protect her the meeting with this representative of the family might have afforded him an opportunity of refuting for ever the vague scandals which were doing her so much harm but he had no right that privilege belonged to sir walter elliot and the truest kindness he could do her was to remain silent in the new life she had chosen all the past should be forgotten he strove resolutely to put away these saddening reflections and to throw himself into the general interest of the subject by making a few inquiries about the two young men georgiana was the only person who could supply any information about mr bertram for mr price had told her his sister was married to his cousin a mr edmund bertram also of mansfield it was evident that this must be the older brother fresh excitement was caused shortly afterwards by a second letter from mrs bingley jane wrote that mr price and mr bertram were to arrive at desborough on the sixth of november and begged that the two girls would come over on the previous day to spend a week there mr morland she took care to inform them was intending to pass the greater part of the month with his friends the portinscales and so as elizabeth had no doubt already heard would be unable to be present at the pemberley ball in kitty this intelligence aroused the most fleeting of regrets but the others had leisure to feel sorry while commending his prudence that circumstances should prevent his taking part in the general gaiety jane had special reason for feeling kindly towards him for she had wished to ask kitty to join the party but had not liked to do so in view of mr morland's being at home but he suspecting that it would be an occasion for inviting some of the relatives from pemberley had quietly made his arrangements without allowing anyone to perceive the hardship it was to him to deny himself a glimpse of miss catherine bennet the invitation was rapturously accepted on the part of kitty and very willingly by georgiana for she liked being with jane and was pleased at the prospect of seeing william again for his own sake elizabeth felt it most important that the girls should be together for georgiana to watch over kitty and be a check on her impulsiveness and darcy gave a sign of his confidence in his sister very precious to her by saying it is a good thing you are asked georgiana for there is no one else who can be trusted to keep kitty in order and bring us a sensible account of this young man and his intentions to desborough then they were to go and to bear with them mr and mrs darcy's invitations to mrs bingley's guests for the pemberley ball chapter xiv october was rapidly passing and elizabeth had received no acknowledgment of her letter to mrs wentworth this occasioned her to some surprise for anne was a punctilious correspondent and certainly would not have allowed such an important question as had been put to her to remain long unanswered at last when elizabeth had begun to fear that either letter or reply must have miscarried the wished for packet was discerned among the morning's post and she carried it to her own private room before perusing it my dear mrs darcy i do not like to imagine what you must be thinking of me for my long and inexplicable silence your letter bears the date october the second almost a month ago will you forgive me when you hear that i only just received it we have been travelling abroad as frederick wished to take advantage of this period of comparative peace to visit some of the old dutch cities and we returned only this week after a delightful but extremely fatiguing tour our letters have followed us about to our continually changing addresses and it is little short of a miracle that so many of them have reached us yours has now reappeared at winchester after its wanderings this must be my excuse for not writing instantly to correct a misconception under which i grieve to think you have been labouring my father is not engaged to miss crawford and there is no probability of a marriage between them either now or at some future time i know that some months ago a rumour to that effect was in existence for indeed it must be confessed that my father's attentions to miss crawford were very marked and my sister was among those who were confident that an engagement would ultimately result but before we went abroad elizabeth wrote to me from brighton where she and my father had removed to say that the affair was at an end miss crawford having given my father a definite refusal i think they were a great deal vexed and disappointed which was perhaps natural for my father had counted upon succeeding and it would have been a very advantageous match for him but i cannot help thinking that there would not have been any great happiness in it for either of them it was not altogether suitable but dear mrs darcy i should not weary you with my comments in such a case as this everyone can supply their own i do not know where mrs grant and miss crawford are now but i conclude in bath the only news of them that has reached me besides what i have stated was i am sorry to say that miss crawford had been ill but i heard no particulars all this seems bald and unsatisfactory i wish i could have given you better and earlier information pray give our warm regards to mr darcy and his sister it was a great delight to me to renew my acquaintance with the latter and to see her looking so lovely and blooming her countenance expresses so much sensibility that one is convinced she must have a tender heart and one hopes that life may always be kind to her i had a great wish to invite her to pay us a visit when we returned to winchester from london and was disappointed to learn she had already travelled north will you mention it to her and say how glad we should be if ever she was disposed to come in this direction we would try to give her a pleasant time your children must be reaching a delightful age alas with what a pang do i view our empty nursery accept my very cordial remembrances and believe me etc it was well that elizabeth had taken the precaution of being alone to read this letter for the agitation it caused could not easily have been concealed a thousand confusing thoughts surged through her mind action of some sort she felt she must take being the only person of their circle in possession of this knowledge but what action would be safe prudent and productive of results while believing that fitzwilliam had been refused she had always found it hard to credit that he should have been refused for sir walter elliot and the denial of the statement found willing acceptance it was so unnatural so horrible almost to think of miss crawford as lady elliot before elizabeth had even time to think of fitzwilliam she had rejoiced over miss crawford's not having committed an act so unworthy of her she next tried to recollect exactly what she had heard with reference to fitzwilliam's dismissal he had been confident that she was lost to him through her engagement he assumed but since she had never been engaged clearly there had been indications which as darcy had said had forced him to believe that she was ill disposed towards him what then could anyone do for him now it was not by any means certain that because she had rejected sir walter elliot she could be induced to accept colonel fitzwilliam and yet the knowledge that she was free free still to be won was a reason for not withdrawing utterly until he knew what would be the fate of his own pretensions taken on their own merit elizabeth could not feel satisfied remembering what had happened at bath that he had ever had a fair opportunity of pleading his cause he might indeed have had a refusal as definite as sir walter's and in that case there would be no kindness in reopening the subject it would profit him little to know that another suitor had fared no better than himself even though that suitor might be one who should never have aspired but what if it had all arisen through a misunderstanding after long and earnest consideration elizabeth determined that whatever steps she now took towards her cousin and the chances of a reconciliation he must know nothing of them if she had finally decided against him there was no reason why he should be put to the pain of hearing it a second time this at least seemed clear and it paved the way for her next resolution namely to write to mrs grant without mentioning anything she had heard beyond the intimation of miss crawford's illness and ask for news of them both darcy entered while she was preparing to write and she immediately handed him mrs wentworth's letter having read it he handed it back to her saying gravely what are you going to do now elizabeth for i suppose you are going to do something elizabeth described her plan and its motives and darcy listened without giving her much encouragement at length he said have you realized what a great responsibility you are taking upon yourself in endeavouring to bring these two people together again yes said elizabeth and dear darcy do you not think we should be prepared to take it i shall do nothing which could possibly give fitzwilliam a moment's uneasiness he has already suffered too much and is a changed man as you were agreeing the other day but if there is the slightest chance of making him happy i think we ought not to let it slip no one but ourselves can possibly make any attempt to reunite him and miss crawford i know you are prepared to undertake herculean tasks in the interests of your friends my dear but when a man has been so decidedly repulsed it is a delicate manner to heal the breach i imagine your scheme would be straightaway to invite miss crawford here and send them both off for a walk with instructions to return in half an hour an engaged couple this was spoken without the ghost of a smile but the idea it suggested to elizabeth was so brilliant that she forgot to remonstrate her husband for not being sufficiently serious i never thought of it but i will do it she exclaimed not send them off for a walk of course but invite miss crawford and her sister to come and stay here they shall come if they will as soon as the ball is over for robert is leaving the next day and in the course of a quiet fortnight it will be strange if i cannot discover whether she cares in the least for him and after that time fitzwilliam is to be summoned home with all speed i suppose oh i cannot look so far ahead if my endeavours prove unavailing of course we must not let him know that they have been here at all well elizabeth i am glad you are providing for all contingencies and do not forget the most probable one namely that they will not be persuaded to accept your invitation miss crawford may not want to lend a helping hand or mrs grant to play fitzwilliam's game for him naturally i shall tell them distinctly that he will not be here and we shall be quite to ourselves if she has been ill she may like to have a change i decline to be discouraged darcy by whatever you may suggest for i am convinced that this plan can do no harm and may do a great deal of good perhaps you are right my dear it seems to me to be a considerable risk and we cannot emphasize too strongly the need for absolute secrecy but you know i cannot wish fitzwilliam anything better than a thoroughly happy marriage when i think of what mine has done for me darcy for you to be paying me compliments the world must be coming to an end and now here is nurse bringing the children so i shall have to postpone my writing for the present the letter was posted and elizabeth had to wait longer than she would have wished for an answer to this one also but after about ten days she had a note in a hand she did not know was brought to her it proved to be from mrs grant who dated it from everingham norfolk and said that she was writing in place of her sister who was still so far from well that it was necessary to spare her all trouble and fatigue she had been extremely ill during august and september and had seemed to make so little progress towards recovery that they had come to stay with their brother a few weeks ago in the hope of obtaining some benefit from the more bracing air unfortunately she had not gained all the good they had hoped for and they were still anxious about her on first receiving mrs darcy's kind invitation she had felt it was impossible to accept it as her state of health and spirits made her languid and disinclined for exertion but mrs grant and mr crawford had at length using all their powers of persuasion induced her to reconsider her decision for they both felt that to mix with her friends once more and to be in the midst of such agreeable and stimulating surroundings as a visit to mrs darcy would afford would be the best possible remedy for the nervous complaint from which she had suffered in any case they would shortly have to leave everingham as it was too cold and exposed a spot but her sister was scarcely equal to the journey to bath yet so that mrs darcy's letter had come at a most fortunate time miss crawford was very desirous that mrs grant should explain that she was still an invalid to a great extent and she insists on my saying a tiresome and exacting one though i cannot endorse that added mrs grant but she is afraid of giving trouble and of being on account of her want of health an unacceptable visitor and she says that if she is going to trespass upon your kindness she cannot do so on false pretenses and so wishes you to know just how you will find her in case you would rather postpone having her until some future time when she is more of a rational being elizabeth perceived something of miss crawford's old spirit peeping out in this message the spirit of independence which would laugh at her own weakness rather than appeal for pity and made her reluctant to accept a kindness which might wear the aspect of an indulgence had it not been for her recent illness and the consequent pressure put upon her by her brother and sister it was clear she would not have come to pemberley elizabeth was conscious in the wording of the letter of a shrinking from it and the earnest way in which mrs grant on her sister's behalf begged to be assured that they would find mr and mrs darcy quite alone at home emphasized something more than an invalid's wish for seclusion in her reply elizabeth endeavoured to convey a complete assurance of the quietness of pemberley and its suitability for anyone in miss crawford's delicate condition there would be no one at home but themselves she said excepting of course mr darcy's sister whom miss crawford had met and who was one of the household the patient should have every care and could lead whatever kind of life she preferred she should not be troubled in any way or even be asked to join the rest of the party until she felt stronger as elizabeth hoped and believed she soon would the letter was expressive of the writer's goodwill and she trusted that it might do away with any remaining unwillingness that miss crawford might have felt in renewing an acquaintance which had indirectly caused her so much pain elizabeth rejoiced in having accomplished the first step miss crawford's acceptance might have been wrung from her but it was unlikely she would withdraw it and once she were safely established at pemberley whether colonel fitzwilliam were to be made happy or not at least there would be no more misunderstandings elizabeth proposed a date to mrs grant for the arrival of the two ladies but decided to maintain her reserve on the subject towards everyone except her husband until the ball should be over and her cousin should have left the house for she was particularly anxious that no hint of it should reach his ears georgiana's discretion could have been depended upon but elizabeth felt it would be better to postpone telling even her of mrs wentworth's reply until matters should be further advanced chapter xv georgiana found that her presence as a check on kitty and an outlet for her excitement was very necessary for kitty had come to regard herself as the central figure in the little drama that was to be played during the next few days her manner of speaking of mr price during the first evening would certainly have betrayed to miss bingley the state of her feelings towards him if that lady had not been already possessed of the information georgiana felt both sorry and vexed for she could read clearly the expression on miss bingley's face and knew that kitty was exposing herself to a not altogether friendly criticism miss bingley had never learnt to do more than tolerate the rest of the bennet family in spite of her openly professed affection for jane and when as in this case she happened to have taken a liking to the admirer of one member of it she evidently found their inferiority greater than ever that mr price was a great deal too good for kitty bennet she managed to convey by looks and tones which were not intended for anyone but kitty but which georgiana could not help but notice and resent to georgiana herself miss bingley said with a great air of frankness that now this affair had been so much talked of and was expected on all sides she trusted it would soon become an accomplished fact of course it was all emma knightley's doing but as kitty was evidently so much in love she hoped with a good deal of emphasis that mr price felt the same the great day arrived and mr tom bertram's curricle drove up to the door late in the afternoon laden with its two passengers and a manservant and all the necessary complement of bags gun cases and a spaniel on a chain william price had been staying at mansfield and consequently the journey for both was a comparatively easy one there were many greetings to be made and introductions to be performed in the short half hour before everyone retired to dress for dinner bingley in the warmth of his welcome could not make enough of his guests and wanted to be talking to them both at once but the look of delighted surprise on william price's face when he caught sight of the two young girls did not escape observation any more than the remarkable fact of kitty's being suddenly struck almost dumb with shyness and being unable to reply except in monosyllables and with deep blushes to his inquiries after her health georgiana with greater self possession shook hands in her own grave manner looked him straight in the face answered him simply and bowed with quiet courtesy in acknowledgment of the pleasure he expressed in meeting them again at dinner kitty was placed between georgiana and mr price the latter being on mrs bingley's right hand and as jane considerately talked for most of the time to mr tom bertram who sat on her other side kitty was able to enjoy mr price's conversation almost uninterruptedly he had much to tell and she to ask of london and their mutual friends there of his stay in portsmouth and the king's visit to review the ships of the shooting parties at mansfield and the astonishing sagacity of his cousin's new dog georgiana heard scraps of it and noticed with satisfaction the good understanding that seemed to exist it is much the wisest beginning she thought far better to have a basis of common interests on which to found a friendship before love comes than to rush blindly into a violent attachment which may as rapidly subside mr price will gradually bring out the best that is in kitty he will care for the same things she does but more moderately and he will develop her finer taste she will have so much to make her happy that her charm of nature will not fade mr price was evidently too sensible to expect to have the exclusive enjoyment of kitty's company in such a small party he was ready to reply to anyone who might address him seemed to wish to get acquainted with mrs bingley and always had a lively word or glance for his cousin opposite tom bertram would put up with a greater amount of good natured teasing and joking from his cousin than he had ever done from anyone in his life but his illness had sobered him and though not much less careless and selfish than formerly he entertained a secret admiration for the younger man who had already done so much with his own life and he had shown himself strongly amenable to influence from that quarter to exercise an influence was the last thing william price would have thought of doing and yet it was entirely through his half laughing half serious representations that tom had been induced to settle down at home to interest himself in the work of managing the estate and to show more consideration for his parents at the moment he had allowed himself to be carried off from home knowing that it was part of a general scheme to distract his mind from a matrimonial entanglement in which he was on the verge of becoming involved and which his family cordially disliked but there was reason to fear that miss isabella thorpe had played her cards too well and that in spite of the efforts of friends she would eventually reign at mansfield park as the next lady bertram when the gentlemen rejoined the ladies after dinner william price immediately approached georgiana and made a few remarks upon indifferent subjects until the attention of the others being directed to a story narrated by mr bertram he inquired if she had heard anything more of miss crawford since their last meeting owing to elizabeth's reticence on the subject georgiana was able to answer with truth that she had heard nothing when she had spoken her reply seemed to her so curt that she added my sister mrs darcy has written to a friend to mrs wentworth in fact to make inquiries but i do not know with what result to mrs wentworth repeated william price then of course that means you know what i was so churlish as to refuse to tell you that evening at mrs hurst's sir walter elliot's name i hope you have forgiven me miss darcy and will understand why i did not feel at liberty to repeat it at that time i am sure you were right mr price and indeed we have never heard the rumour confirmed yet said georgiana i wish i had seen miss crawford again but there was no opportunity i did not see her again either said william i had to leave town directly after and when i returned they were gone i wish i could learn something i so trust it may not be true for miss crawford to marry that man would be not one but a thousand pities it is difficult to understand why anyone should make a so called marriage of convenience but one feels that she of all people is worthy of a better fate one must hope if it really is decided upon that it is not altogether a mere convenience that that there is some mutual regard also said georgiana oh no doubt there is a great deal of regard on his side but he is not the sort of man to appreciate her properly rejoined mr price if you knew him miss darcy even your kindness of heart would fail to find suitable excuses i know miss crawford's friends are dissatisfied about it said georgiana but i cannot help feeling that there is no need for her to make any marriage at all unless she is confident it will conduce to her happiness so that whatever she is doing one must assume that she is using her judgment you put the case so admirably miss darcy that i declare you have nearly consoled me it is just what i have tried to remind myself of that she can afford to marry where she chooses and as there is no compulsion except her own good nature i can hardly believe she will make such an unwise choice that absolutely settles it i believe you have got private information which you have conveyed to me from your own mind without speaking a word and which has reassured me no indeed i have no private information replied georgiana with a faint smile and i think you have reassured yourself by your own close knowledge of miss crawford's character i may know miss crawford better but in matters of this kind women are far better judges of one another than are men of them you read each other as you would yourselves and deduce each other's motives from your knowledge of your own consequently you bring a far keener insight to bear than we can i think that perhaps women understand each other better and it is natural that they should said georgiana after a moment's reflection but then you must remember that they are expected to acquire the habit of entering into the feelings of others their position as onlookers in the active world enables them to find their pleasure in studying the characters of those around them and their happiness is in proportion to the amount of sympathy and comprehension which is excited in themselves that is too modest an estimation of the qualities of your sex miss darcy i should go further and say that some persons do not need to acquire the habit you mention for they have naturally such quick and generous sympathies such a power of reading with true kindliness the dispositions of others and drawing out the best that is in them that i think it is impossible for them to receive more happiness than they give you must have met some such and that is what i mean by a woman's power of insight he looked at her earnestly as he said this and georgiana had never seen him so grave that he meant kitty she had not a moment's doubt and they seemed to be within half a sentence of her name she fully expected his next words to be there is someone we both know i think miss darcy or something similar and in her confusion she did not stop to reflect how unlikely it was that he would speak so openly when kitty was standing a few yards away but as he continued to look at her without saying anything further she strove to interrupt a pause which threatened to become embarrassing and murmured not very collectedly yes indeed it is so my brother's wife mrs darcy she added not daring to show her thoughts were following the same direction as his is one of those you were describing she understands everyone so well she knows what one would say even when one has the greatest difficulty in expressing it i think she is the cleverest person i have ever met she thought he looked a little disappointed at her change of theme but he bowed and said courteously that he had a great wish to meet mrs darcy georgiana caught at this remark as a means of extricating himself from a conversation which was almost too interesting to be pursued just then i hope very much that you will meet her she said i do not know if mr bingley has mentioned it but there is to be a ball at pemberley next week and my sister hoped mr and mrs bingley would bring you all over with them william's face displayed the pleasure he felt before he could give utterance to it and georgiana recollecting that she had not intended to give the invitation but to leave to kitty the gratification of doing so turned round impulsively and called to her friend who was standing close by jane's chair on the opposite side of the fireplace but casting many wistful glances towards georgiana and her companion kitty i have been telling mr price about the ball said georgiana as kitty darted towards them that is that we hope he is coming to it but you must tell him what an achievement it is to have persuaded elizabeth and my brother we owe it entirely to your suggestion that there is going to be any ball oh georgiana why did you tell mr price i was keeping it for a great surprise exclaimed kitty reproachfully and turning to william she demanded his approval for the scheme the details of which were quickly expounded william gave a proper meed of praise and admiration and georgiana presently slipped away to join the others who were preparing to sit down to a round game but william and kitty remained talking together until tea was brought in chapter xvi the following day the sportsmen went out early and returned late and as some friends from the neighbourhood were dining at desborough there was no opportunity for much conversation between the young ladies and mr bingley's guests kitty passed their chief of the day in writing a long letter to mrs knightley and georgiana was taken possession of by miss bingley who wished to practice vocal and instrumental duets miss bingley had a good deal to say during the intervals of their performance about mr price whom she acknowledged she liked very much and she endeavoured to prove to georgiana by a number of arguments the improbability of his having any matrimonial intentions in general and towards kitty in particular georgiana would not discuss the point with her her own esteem for mr price depended on his not disappointing kitty and she would admit no suspicion which might imperil it on the third afternoon the shooting party having returned earlier on account of bad weather they were all assembled in the library bingley was showing mr bertram some hunting prints that hung on the walls and the rest were gathered round the fire the ladies sitting and william price leaning on the overmantel glancing at the pieces of porcelain and the miniatures arranged upon it what beautiful little chinese figures these are mrs bingley he suddenly exclaimed they are genuinely old are they not a man i know brought back just such a pair from hong kong and i know he regarded them as priceless i do not think they can be imitated in europe yes i believe they are really old replied mrs bingley i do not know the history of them but they have been in mr bingley's family for a long time and they are special favourites of his perhaps you can tell us caroline miss bingley was beginning to speak when she was interrupted by a cry of dismay from mr price he had taken the little figure in his hand to examine it more closely and the head had immediately fallen off and rolled on the hearth fortunately a thick rug had received it and after a search it was discovered intact but mr price was overwhelmed with self reproach for his carelessness until stopped by mrs bingley saying you need not mind mr price for it was not in the least your fault the head was broken off already look it has been slung between the shoulders by a piece of wire i should have mended it but could not manage to attach a new length of wire i am relieved to find i am not the guilty party said mr price that is if you are quite sure mrs bingley indeed i am and kitty she added turning toward her sister perhaps you can help me to clear mr price's character do you happen to know anything about the breaking of this little mandarin we found it so a few days after you left and no one in the house could account for it i have always meant to ask you about it but had forgotten until now owing to the comparative dimness of the firelight jane was unable to perceive her sister's growing confusion but it became evident in the embarrassed pause which followed her question kitty began to speak broke off and began again stumbling over her words i had thought it had been broken that is i knew it had but something put it out of my head i forgot it too till now what a pity you did not mention it said miss bingley severely it might have been worse injured next time it was touched by anyone not knowing the head was loose oh well never mind dear kitty said jane kindly it does not matter it can easily be repaired no doubt kitty on the verge of tears looked distressfully from one to the other torn between her dislike to recalling the occasion and her desire to exonerate herself in the eyes of william price the latter consideration prevailed and addressing jane she murmured with deepest blushes it was not i who broke it it was mr morland mr morland repeated jane perplexed yes it was that last morning he was here we he was in the library you know he had the chinese figure in his hand and i recollect noticing it was in two pieces i never thought of it again until now and i suppose he forgot it too kitty's self consciousness increased as it was by the knowledge that jane and georgiana would now perfectly understand the reason for the disaster which had befallen the porcelain ornament quite mystified her other two hearers to whom the explanation taken by itself would have been sufficiently simple all they could plainly perceive was that the association of mr morland with the incident made kitty extremely uncomfortable and they were left to draw what conclusions they might by her hasty departure from the room william price with a delicacy of feeling for which georgiana's heart went out to him immediately filled up the moment of awkwardness by reverting to the original subject of their discussion which he still held in his hand at any rate he said smiling i have helped to decapitate this poor mandarin so it seems only fair that i should try to mend him have i your permission mrs bingley i believe with a fresh bit of wire and some sealing wax i could make him nod as benevolently as ever bingley was called upon to produce the necessary articles and being warned by a glance from his wife not to pursue his inquiry as to whether they had discovered who had damaged the old fellow the incident seemed likely to arouse no further remark georgiana evaded miss bingley's eyes and went away as soon as she could to kitty's room finding her friend lying upon the bed and weeping bitterly georgiana what must he have thought she began instantly throwing herself into her friend's arms why did jane ask me that unfortunate question just at that time it could not have happened worse i was thinking about it a little because you know i had not been in that room since mr morland and i were there together we were standing in just the same place as we were all in to night and it made me quite miserable to remember it and now mr price will not know what to think hearing mr morland's name like that he will suspect something and perhaps it will prevent him from speaking i wish we were back at pemberley i knew things would never go so well here again georgiana comforted her assured her that what had happened would never make the slightest difference to mr price laughingly reproached her with having run away saying that no one would have perceived anything out of the ordinary but for that and counselled her to behave just as usual when she met the others again and everything would be forgotten nevertheless kitty was far from comfortable during the rest of their stay and was in continual expectation of some occurrence which might affect mr price's attitude towards her although the cheerful friendliness of his manner never varied this apprehension rendered her particularly uneasy the following day which was sunday they all went to church where the service was read by a stranger and kitty's sensibility was sorely tried by having to listen to various questions asked by their visitors during the walk back was that the regular clergyman he was absent ah indeed was he a pleasant neighbour a good preacher and so that was the rectory what a commodious attractive looking house no doubt the parson was a married man and he was certainly a lucky fellow to be so circumstanced commented mr bertram bingley made brief answers out of compassion for kitty and jane began a conversation with the two girls about something different but she could not attend it was so distressing to think of mr morland whom bingley praised so highly and whom the others thought so enviable having been driven away from home on her account that a man so charming and so desirable should have fallen in love with her when she was not able to care for him there seemed something particularly unfortunate particularly wasteful about the whole affair if he had been a mr collins that nobody not even maria lucas would have minded refusing poor kitty walked home silently and as far from mr price as possible with her muff held up to conceal a countenance which she knew was unfit to be seen on monday bingley and mr bertram went out hunting and the ladies escorted by mr price drove to the spot where the foxhounds were to meet in the hope of seeing a little sport bingley had offered to mount mr price also but the latter had declined laughingly declaring that like all sailors he was not much of a horseman and though he had once hunted from mansfield park when he was a careless youngster he thought it would be wiser not to venture over the derbyshire country with its rough moors and high stone walls on a borrowed horse it is most kind of you mr bingley he said and for my cousin it is all right for he has hunted here before but i am sure you would not be pleased if you saw me come crashing down at the first big fence with your hundred guinea hunter doubled up in the further ditch the ladies held up hands of horror but bingley much amused said he would not believe a word of it and that he felt sure mr price could ride as well as he could shoot william shook his head i have ridden all sorts of horses at different times when occasion has required it and have even managed to adhere to the animal as a rule but my good luck might desert me to day perhaps you will let me go for a jogging ride along the lanes before i go on your least valuable horse seeing that i am in charge of you just now william i highly applaud your decision said his cousin as i don't want to have to send you back to portsmouth with a broken neck which is certainly what could happen you in charge of me i like that exclaimed william say much more and i will borrow a gypsy's donkey and come to meet you on it announcing to everybody that i am bringing along your second mount mrs bingley was a little afraid of the cold wind and decided not to go so mr price took his seat in the barouche with the other three and greatly enhanced the gaiety of their party they drove about for more than two hours and when at last the hunt having gone away among the hills they decided to turn homewards mr price created consternation among his fair companions by asking permission to get out and walk walk mr price exclaimed miss bingley who placed on the front seat had assumed the direction of the party why should you want to walk and in this desolate wilderness why we must be six or seven miles from home yes i thought it was about that said william i rather wanted a walk and do you know i like this desolate wilderness as you call it i should enjoy exploring my way homewards and i have noted all the landmarks it is so cold too a splendid day for a walk oh mr price do not go we are all so snugly tucked in here said kitty imploringly oh if you prefer walking pray do not let us detain you said miss bingley speaking at the same moment and in rather an offended voice william looked in surprise from one to the other it had evidently not occurred to him for one moment that he would be missed by any of them unconsciously his eye sought georgiana's and she said quickly mr price must be cold with sitting still so long i expect he would enjoy a walk it really is not so far from the top of the hill one can see kympton church i know and on foot one can take an almost straight route the carriage had stopped and the servants awaited their orders william remained irresolute he had one lady's leave to go another was doing her best to appear indifferent and the third plied him with entreaties not to break up their comfortable little party georgiana was amused but also a little ashamed to see caroline and kitty for once united in the object of their wishes showing those wishes so plainly it was clear that william price felt the awkwardness thus created for his hesitation only lasted a second or two and he said lightly why of course i will not get out if it would be disturbing anybody probably the negotiation of those short cuts would make me very late for dinner shall they drive on miss bingley gave the order in a dignified tone and assured him that he had done wisely to desist for he certainly would have been late georgiana could not help remarking that it was a pity he should have missed his walk for the others would not be in before five but he gave her a glance and a half smile which showed her that he was not allowing it to trouble him kitty delighted that mr price had given this proof of a wish to please him talked all the way home and described with great animation several dreadful walks that bingley had taken her on the moors when according to her account they had narrowly escaped death on many occasions wild cattle dangerous bogs rushing torrents and venomous snakes being among the risks to be encountered on such expeditions mr price listened with interest but his courage did not appear to be shaken for as soon as they descended from the carriage he paused only to glance at the clock and to divest himself of his heavy coat before asking miss darcy if she would accompany him on a walk it will be as short as or as long as brisk or as leisurely as you are disposed for he said and georgiana declined with real regret i should have enjoyed it very much mr price but i think i had better not it is rather late and the others may be wanting me before dinner besides she added as she saw his disappointed look i know you want a good walk and you can go further if you have not to adapt yourself to the slow paces of a lady i should esteem it an honour to have to adapt myself to yours replied william price with the quick bright smile which was so noticeable in him we must all go together to morrow morning said georgiana as she turned away mr bingley can show us what is the best direction i hope it will keep fine but it looks very like snow mr price did not move from where he stood for some minutes and georgiana as she ascended the stairs felt strongly to return and accede to his suggestion but the fear that kitty would not like it withheld her she wished that he had asked kitty instead or as well for although anyone might well have assumed after the descriptions she had given that a country walk for its own sake was to her the most uncongenial form of amusement yet georgiana knew well that it would be viewed in a very different light were a particular companion available the promised walk did not take place for the snow which had been threatening fell the following day not thickly but with enough of fog and dampness in the atmosphere to make the fireside seem by far the most agreeable place the gentlemen shot in the first part of the morning but returned home soon after one ready for any entertainment that they might be expected to provide or be provided with and tom bertram's inclinations as usual were in favour of the former not being a card player or enthusiast for music and having found mr bingley to be at billiards an adversary unworthy of his skill he was obliged to seek some other method of spending a winter's afternoon and without hesitation he broached to the assembled party his idea that they should act some charades mrs bingley looked doubtful and william price gave his cousin no support but the notion was warmly taken up by bingley his sister and sister in law and mr bertram set himself to persuade mrs bingley that next to a real play charades were the most delightful things imaginable and that they had a party collected about them remarkably well qualified to undertake any and every kind of character his hostess proved not difficult to persuade when she perceived what pleasurable anticipations were aroused by the suggestion and only needed to be assured by her husband that it was a capital notion and the young people would thoroughly enjoy it to promise help of whatever kind was needed william price was ready to enter into it when it became evident that it was the general wish and even georgiana began to be interested and concealed her nervousness at the idea of taking part you need not be frightened georgiana said miss bingley all you will be required to do is to stand perfectly still and assume a particular expression louisa and i have often taken part in them there is no acting it is all the pose excuse me miss bingley interposed mr bertram the kind of charades i propose we should do involves a certain amount of movement acting in short and others require impromptu speeches i recollect once at the house of my friend i am sure you are mistaken mr bertram the correct charade is not acting at all it is simply a series of pictures or tableaux to represent the various syllables the discussion threatened to become keen especially when the two younger girls joined in protesting that they could not possibly recite any impromptu speeches but bingley finally settled the point by agreeing with mr bertram's vehement assertion that it would be much more amusing if they acted their parts and that he could show them how to do it in such a way that no speaking would be necessary though miss bingley doubted if all the company would be equal to such a demand upon their capabilities the next point was to choose the words a matter of prodigious importance for which many books were brought out and consulted and the merits and possibilities of each word exhaustively debated it was not until they renewed the consideration of the subject at the dinner table that they made the discovery that if all of them were to appear in different scenes of the same charade there would be no one left to guess the meaning this becomes really serious said bingley if it was a play we could act to ourselves and the chairs and tables and be perfectly happy but the very existence of a charade is threatened if no one is ignorant of it and from what i hear of intended costumes it will take the rest of the evening for our preparations so that we shall be ready to begin the performance just as our ladies have to leave us to morrow but who is leaving to morrow not miss bennet and miss darcy exclaimed tom bertram in real alarm this cannot be allowed pray mr bingley use your authority i am sure they could remain another day oh yes i am sure we could cried kitty they could not wish us to miss the charades it would spoil everything if we could not be here bingley looked at georgiana and asked her smiling if she thought it could be managed but she had already given an imploring though unheeded glance towards kitty and now replied in a low voice it is very kind of you but we ought not to stay i am sure the carriage will be coming for us and we ought not to detain it for a whole day what does it matter georgiana kitty exclaimed only for one day elizabeth will not mind don't you care about the charades and about putting a stop to the whole thing we can easily be spared if that is what you are thinking the ball is not until friday georgiana blushing and distressed by finding herself the object of attack was endeavouring to maintain her ground without giving offence when jane came to her assistance georgiana is perfectly in the right she said and sorry though i am to lose them both there is no doubt that they will be expected back to morrow without fail but that is no reason why the charades need be given up for as we shall all be coming over to pemberley on the following day we can give them there that evening if my sister and mr darcy will consent to be audience and our performance to night will serve as a kind of rehearsal this suggestion was enthusiastically received as it met all difficulties and kitty forgot to reprove georgiana for hurrying her away in the contemplation of the news with which they would return home and the delightful bustle of preparation that would ensue jane and bingley had not quite the same views and they spoke privately to georgiana before she left asking her to take a message begging elizabeth and darcy not to put themselves to any trouble about the arrangements for the stage which need only be of the very simplest nature a sufficiency screen and lamps being all that would be asked for the rehearsal proceeded in admirable style mr bertram had constituted himself stage manager and gave everyone minute instructions as to their movements and attitudes shouted directions from the midst of an imaginary audience and hastened at the last moment to take his place in the scenes where he was required to be actor as well with some assistance from mr bingley he had allotted the various parts and as he was so fortunate as to be able to regard all four ladies from an absolutely impartial standpoint his judgments were on the whole tolerably good although the usual difficulties of such an occasion arose and had to be smoothed away as for instance when mrs bingley positively declined to play a part which required any acting although she was the only person who looked the queen to perfection or when miss darcy wanted to give up an important part to miss bennet whom it did not suit at all simply because the latter was anxious to wear the dress that went with it or when miss bingley desired to represent both lady macbeth and joan of arc and could not be made to understand that she could take only one on account of the necessity for passing quickly from one scene to another all however was amicably arranged before the evening ended and when the others went to bed tom bertram sat up desperately writing lists of the properties and accessories which he deemed necessary to the performance chapter xvii kitty was partly consoled for the agony of quitting desborough park by the prospect of a reunion of the family under such enticing circumstances and georgiana was sensible of the advantage of having two or more evenings of excitement to prepare for and look forward to to sustain kitty's spirits which might otherwise have suffered some diminution of liveliness in consequence of mr price's not having made his offer before they left kitty talked of it and of him and of the charades incessantly and inextricably all the way home and it was fortunate that elizabeth was alone when they arrived for it was hardly possible for kitty to disentangle the three subjects in giving a description of their visit elizabeth made her happy by a kindly reception of the plan for the following evening and a promise to invite the ferrars and mrs jennings to witness the charades and when she had darted away to the nursery with some presents sent by jane to the little darcys elizabeth smilingly asked georgiana if from her own observation she could confirm kitty's eager anticipations georgiana could only reply that she believed all was going well that mr price was more charming than ever and the only difficulty in the way of forming a judgment was that he was equally charming to everyone i suppose kitty's preference for him was very clearly marked said elizabeth yes replied georgiana i am rather afraid it was but he appeared to accept it without any embarrassment and the understanding between them seemed so good that i do not think there can be any fear of his disappointing her we were almost always all together at desborough and i used to think he was only awaiting an opportunity of seeing her alone or she used to think so perhaps said elizabeth well i trust it is going to end satisfactorily meantime i am most anxious to see this paragon with whom jane for her letter seems to be nearly as much delighted as you and kitty are kitty was allowed to be the bearer of the note conveying the invitation to the rectory party the next morning and while mrs ferrars was writing a reply in another room the enthusiastic young lady was able to pour out her heart to the equally enthusiastic old lady mrs jennings received her with much warmth and immediately began a series of questions which she usually answered herself at the same time that kitty was giving a reply so that the real and the imaginary descriptions were inseparably mingled together and how was the young officer my dear ay ay you need not tell me as handsome and as attentive as ever i can see by your eyes yes just as handsome as ever dear mrs jennings and attentive yes but you see we were a small party so he could not devote himself entirely ah but i fancy he did did he not now you need not be so modest about it these small parties are the very thing for the right people always to pair off together lord how well i remember when mr palmer was courting charlotte and there was a young man too coming after my niece and my sister used to say 'it won't be a match this time sarah' and i'd say 'you wait and see henrietta each of the girls has got her beau and there's a room for each to sit in and the weather's very bad' and sure enough the very next monday did you not say you had bad weather too my dear i did not say so mrs jennings but we did have some rain and snow i thought as much well well you are a lucky girl to have it all your own way and your friends liking him so much too i suppose he will speak to mr darcy when he comes over here as your father is not just at hand dear mrs jennings you are making too much of it he has not spoken to me yet you know it is only that we are good friends and he seems to enjoy talking to me and jane was so kind and let us sit together that is quite right my dear just as it should be i'll warrant your sister jane is a very sensible woman and these charades too just the thing there i am downright pleased to think i shall see the finish of it this acting i suppose was the young man's idea he is a clever one i know no it was not his though of course he does it better than anyone else it was mr bertram's idea his cousin who came with him his cousin ah yes the other young man i recollect he was invited for miss darcy wasn't he come come now miss bennet no secrets among friends there is no secret ma'am returned kitty laughing i do not think he was invited for miss darcy or anyone my sister did not know him before you may be sure that was in her mind is he not heir to some great property it seems to me i have heard so he is heir to his father sir thomas bertram in northamptonshire i do not know if it is a great property you may make up your mind that it is and that something will come of it my dear miss bennet a baronet the very thing for miss darcy her brother and your sister would be sure to look high was he not a fine young man and did they not make a nice couple i do not know i did not think of it but mrs jennings no no indeed of course not we all know what your thoughts were full of laughing heartily and very naturally too never mind my dear we shall hear all about it before long and you shall see if i ain't right lord what a thing this will be to elinor she thinks no one is good enough for miss darcy well well it will be an evening to look forward to only come and tell me when i am to make my congratulations for they will be on the tip of my tongue and monstrous glad i shall be to get them off will it be to night i wonder or to morrow night these young sailors can't afford to let the grass grow under their feet and your dress my dear what did you say it was going to be in such pleasant anticipations the time passed quickly until the re entrance of mrs ferrars with her note when kitty felt obliged to return to pemberley as their visitors were to arrive early and there were still many preparations to be completed as she walked homewards she was in a glow of delight over the visions which their talk had evoked and mrs jennings's prophecy with regard to georgiana and mr bertram fitted into its place in the same cheerful picture undoubtedly mrs jennings was quite right she so seldom erred in her judgments kitty could not recollect that those two had ever seemed specially pleased with each other but in all probability they were for now that she came to think of it there was no one else for georgiana and mr bertram matched her as naturally as mr price did kitty herself yes it was most likely that they would soon be engaged perhaps married before another and to kitty a more interesting couple no that would certainly not do if the wedding at longbourn must be a less magnificent affair than the one at pemberley if kitty could not aspire to a wedding dress trimmed with such lace as miss darcy had inherited from her mother at all events she would have the honour and importance of being married first with smiles of satisfaction she pictured the sending out of the invitations and had decided on the form of them and the number of recipients by the time she re entered the house the same subject absorbed the attention of the two ladies she had just left mrs jennings could not refrain from recounting to her hostess the conjecture she had instantly founded upon her knowledge of mr bertram's existence and though mrs ferrars was well acquainted with her friend's flights of imagination she had no positive arguments to array against this one and was obliged to content herself with urging mrs jennings to let no hint drop of her suspicions until something should occur to confirm them as it would be so painful for both the young people mrs jennings promised caution at the same time being evidently unwilling to relinquish an idea that pleased her so much and mrs ferrars perceived that it would be necessary to repeat the warnings very often before the following evening when her friend and her husband would go to the pemberley ball without her as she dreaded over fatigue on the first evening the occasion of the charades she intended to be present and hoped to be able to control and check mrs jennings's remarks should they threaten to become embarrassing knowing her intense and freely expressed interest in her fellow creatures mrs jennings's friends would have been glad to bargain for not more than one love affair to be in progress at one time under her eyes the arrival of the party from desborough could not fail to bring even to dignified pemberley a pleasant sense of bustle and excitement and in the first flood of greetings introductions and inquiries elizabeth and her husband were only aware of a generally agreeable impression of mr bingley's two young guests of tom bertram good looking fashionable easy and talkative and of william price with his shorter sturdier figure fine open countenance and manners which with no want of animation yet attracted by their quiet simplicity even in the short time since the two sets of friends had been parted a great deal seemed to have happened which must be talked over bingley wished to narrate to anyone who would listen to him the wonderful achievements of his shooting party yesterday who had accounted for an incredible number of pheasants mr bertram had taken possession of georgiana in order to propound to her at great length a scheme for altering and improving several of the charade scenes and william price who was somehow established on a settee by kitty was telling her how far he had succeeded in the task she had bequeathed to him of endeavouring to teach mrs bingley's parrot to talk the whole party were comfortably disposed round the drawing room fire and looked like remaining there until it was time to dress for dinner but tom bertram not satisfied with explaining wished to demonstrate and presently asked if he might see the acting room after which he was not long in requesting the presence of his whole company there to see if they understood their movements and positions on the new stage kitty had undertaken to show him all their preparations and had carried off william price with her and bingley followed with many good humoured grumblings summoning his sister who was not anxious to break off conversation with colonel fitzwilliam in the course of which she was examining him closely as to his reasons for quitting london so abruptly in the summer it was necessary however to assert her position as leading lady so she joined the others georgiana slipping in with her and watching for opportunities to make herself useful while in the intervals she put the final stitches in a head dress for kitty mrs bingley was allowed to excuse herself pleading fatigue and the presence of a sufficiently large number of persons at this informal rehearsal a reason fully justified by the bursts of laughter and sounds of prolonged argument which occasionally penetrated through the folding doors when after a hasty toilet the actors returned to the saloon the dinner guests had already arrived kitty was so distressingly conscious of the confidences she had so freely given that she kept in the background while the two young men were being introduced to mrs jennings and avoided meeting her eye mrs jennings shook hands with them both warmly and congratulated them upon having discovered such a delightful form of amusement for themselves and the young ladies as acting charades these long evenings madam returned tom bertram with a bow let us hope that the amusement will not be entirely on the side of the performers since the hard work is not the exclusive share of the spectators oh law mr bertram you quite mistake me as to amusement i can assure you it will be the greatest treat to me and mrs ferrars but you must admit that the hard work is not just the sort a young fellow gets soon tired of is it now you think so because you cannot see behind the scenes mrs jennings interposed william price assuming an air of solemnity i do not imagine my cousin would care to have command of a troupe of actors such as we are for long together you have no conception of what amount of trouble we give him i mean the unruly ones mrs jennings highly appreciated the allusion which she supposed these words to contain and tapping william on the arm with her fan she exclaimed ay ay mr price i understand you but you and mr bertram will have the whip hand by and by and then you can get some of your own back i am sure mr bertram is an excellent stage manager said mrs ferrars who had not heard all that passed but judged by mr price's puzzled look and mrs jennings's laughter that it was time to intervene i cannot think how you have been able to work up your charades and be ready for an audience within so short a time it can only be proved that the charades are sufficiently worked up when we see whether the audience are sufficiently perplexed by them said bingley if you guess the words at once we shall feel that we have utterly failed do not overestimate our intellects my dear bingley said his host as mrs jennings says these charades are sport to you and as a natural consequence they are presumably death to us nonsense darcy exclaimed bingley in the midst of the storm of laughing protests evoked by this remark think of the acting and the splendid mise en scene if your heart fails within you besides you can always applaud nowadays it is the fashion to admire loudest what one understands least darcy led the way to the dining room with mrs jennings and as the ladies of the party out numbered the gentlemen william price found that it fell to his lot to escort both miss darcy and miss bennet the former seeing this stepped on for a pace or two in advance and kitty as she took his arm murmured how discouraging darcy is he always manages to make one feel that he despises the things we are doing william glanced to see if mr darcy's sister had heard and rejoined i should hardly have thought so he is only teasing i fancy and you know he was speaking to mr bingley and they probably understand each other particularly well still said kitty i must say i do not like that sort of teasing it is very provoking to be continually laughed at and for one's best friend to do it makes it all the worse no no miss bennet i am afraid i can't agree with you there one can put up with anything from one's best friend or at all events with things which one would not stand for a moment from anyone else i wonder if miss darcy feels that too he added as they settled themselves into their places at the table i am not quite sure replied georgiana when the question had been explained to her i think that ridicule may be harder to bear from our friends than from an uninterested person merely because one feels they ought to know best what is painful to one if it is of a painful kind but on the other hand one may always feel sure that a real friend had no intention of saying anything of the sort that would not be much good to me cried kitty i find it is too late when i have already been very much vexed with anyone to remember that they really did not mean to vex me of course it is not much consolation when the blow has been already dealt said georgiana musingly i meant that when one has reason to believe no unkind motive exists behind anything one's friend says then one is not expecting to be hurt kitty did not want to seem inclined to pursue the subject and william price after a moment's pause said i imagine that you mean by a motive the general feeling of goodwill in your friend's mind towards you i should doubt if people really have a distinct motive for every little thing they do and say at all events they would have some difficulty in defining one but perhaps you yourself miss darcy are a student of motives perhaps your own actions are determined by a clear purpose mine oh dear no said georgiana looking up at him and down again with a bright blush i think it is rather interesting to speculate upon other people's motives and to wonder what hidden impulses make them do certain things which seem hard to account for but as to myself oh no i never understand my own motives i do not always know what they are do you understand yours well yes i think so not that i have ever troubled much about it but on general principles i think i always do things or try to do them either because i want to very much or because it is a matter of professional duty then you are decidedly to be congratulated mr price said georgiana smiling i should i mean most people would think themselves fortunate if they had two such burning lights to guide them i suppose the way is so clear that you do not need to seek any further motives as to why you want to do the thing so much for instance of course not promptly replied william that would be looking back how would one ever steer a ship unless one kept one's eyes fixed on the course ahead if you suspect there are rocks you must avoid them but it would be a waste of time wondering how you came to be where you are you see that too do you not yes i see what you mean replied georgiana but i am afraid i have not learnt to steer my ship quite so well or perhaps i have too many lights and they are confusing william began to reply but was interrupted by kitty tired of a conversation in which she had no share mr price do you know what you have done refused the lobster sauce what can you be thinking of your turbot will not be half so nice without it william made proper apologies to the bearer of the lobster sauce who returned it at kitty's summons and she was pacified by mr price's applying himself to his dinner and entering heartily into a reminiscence of hers at a dinner party at mrs knightley's when they had met for the first time and when there had also strange coincidence been turbot for dinner georgiana was glad to sit for a while in silent thought mr price's suggestion that her life was governed by a distinct purpose appeared sadly wide of the mark did not the mistakes she had made in the past show that she was merely drifting lamentably weak and having no sound judgment of her own whereas people like kitty who had given themselves up to the guidance of a definite aspiration and mr price too who had owned what lights he was steering by would they not soon be in safe harbour it seemed so and georgiana almost envied them of that delightful security for of late she had allowed herself to wonder if such heights of happiness would ever be attainable by herself and a longing had sometimes crept over her since she had known and liked mr price that she might meet someone who could be to her what he was to kitty throughout the remainder of dinner she did not have any further conversation with william price though occasionally appealed to by one or other of them to give an opinion upon some point at issue generally connected with the charades with mrs ferrars who sat on her other side she enjoyed a quiet little talk and before they left the table elinor inquired casually whether mr bertram was nice whether they had found him pleasant yes i think so i think we all like him very much replied georgiana who until that moment had not formed any estimate of him he is very lively and he has taken an immense deal of trouble about the charades and mr bingley i know considers him an excellent shot that is quite an adequate description of him in a few words said elinor i wondered what you all thought of him as i know you had not met before he is not much like his cousin is he no indeed responded georgiana speaking with more animation could you imagine a greater contrast one can see at a glance how different their lives and professions have been and how different their characters must be i should be interested to hear said elinor in a low tone and with a smile what you take to be the chief points of unlikeness in their characters if you were not sitting too near to one of them to tell me georgiana smiled and shook her head i could not very well and i am sure you can read faces as well as anybody i understand said elinor that the one we mentioned first is heir to a title and a large estate i believe so replied georgiana but the other is fortunate in needing neither titles nor large estates to recommend him elinor needed nothing further to convince her that mrs jennings's suspicions as far as georgiana was concerned were perfectly groundless what the bingleys might be desiring of her or mr bertram aiming at was another matter certainly an onlooker could hardly help thinking of the probabilities of the match with a handsome and wealthy young man on the one side and a girl of georgiana's beauty accomplishments and high birth on the other chapter xviii all went well the dinner came to an end the actors retired to dress and the six members of the audience disposed themselves in armchairs in front of the curtain and prepared to be mystified the performance commenced after no longer delay than is usual on occasions of this kind and opened with a duel scene in which bingley and tom bertram aimed pistols at one another in a most realistic manner but failed to kill each other owing to one weapon missing fire and the ball of the other not penetrating a vital part two of the ladies rushed in and made demonstrations of relief at finding the wounded hero able to walk off the field the next scene represented a card room with a party of players and bingley as the inveterate gambler staking higher and higher until all was lost on turning up of a fatal four of hearts next was seen william price as richard i in prison aroused from despair at the sound of blondel's harp and the vision at the barred window of the minstrel impersonated by miss bingley cloaked and hooded and playing on a zither the whole word gave a fine opportunity to tom bertram to exhibit his comedy powers in the part of a gentleman whose pocket is picked of a purse of money his lamentations to his family his efforts to recover it and the final restoration of the purse by then totally empty much laughter and applause followed this conclusion and though the word misfortune was presently discovered by the audience without any further help they were delighted with the spirited and vigorous quality of the acting which had conveyed so much to them in dumb show not a word being spoken on the stage darcy's only adverse criticism was that so far there had not been enough for the ladies to do but this defect was remedied in the next word which consisted of only three scenes in the first miss bingley made a very tolerable lady macbeth striving to cleanse her hands of blood while she walks in her sleep and is observed by her gentlewoman and doctor the second showed joan of arc in the person of kitty led to the stake while the others grouped themselves round and endeavoured to look as numerous as possible in the parts of the judges soldiers and executioners poor kitty's slight figure and insignificant presence made it difficult for the character to be well realized in her and mr bertram's frown as he looked at her was not an assumed one for he had originally cast miss darcy for the part and had expostulated vehemently when she had insisted on yielding to the broadly hinted at wishes of her friend finally mrs bingley as cleopatra looked exceedingly handsome in a robe as egyptian as it could be made on short notice and received the asp from a basket held by georgiana while miss bingley represented her other handmaid this word was not so easily guessed as the other and darcy and fitzwilliam were the first to arrive at it while elizabeth had to attend to the panegyrics of mrs jennings and the more quietly expressed admiration of mr and mrs ferrars the former had indeed forgotten that there was anything to guess so enchanted was she with the whole proceeding so convinced that miss bennet and miss darcy were two of the most beautiful and gifted beings who had ever appeared on any stage and it was only by making really meritorious effort at self control that she refrained from descanting on the good fortune of the two young men whom she supposed to be their respective admirers she was still talking eagerly about the dresses and the snake and the pile of wood that looked so terribly real and mr bertram's being so clever and funny when he pretended to be angry when the curtain rose on a new scene and the spectators found themselves in another period of the past miss bingley an unmistakable queen elizabeth graciously received a folio from shakespeare handed a ring to essex and on departing stepped on a cloak laid down for her by raleigh in spite of this astonishing disregard for chronology the scene was greatly enjoyed as was also the next which with the aid of a great deal of imagination represented the deck of a ship here william price had the leading part he received a party of ladies on board showed them all round the vessel in such a lively manner that the deficiencies in the setting of the stage were hardly observed gave orders to his sailors and finally took an affectionate farewell of his friends with much waving of handkerchiefs as the ship was supposed to sail away and kitty wept real tears of nervousness and excitement the audience had had time to put the first and second syllables together while the ship was being cleared away and they were in a measure prepared for the subject of the last scene which reflected great credit on the stage manager it was a very pretty adaptation of the taming of the shrew and showed the young girls in the characters of bianca and katharina kitty of course taking that of her namesake in an episode of her stormy wooing by petruchio while georgiana as bianca submitted to a gentler form of love making over a music lesson the curtain was lowered for a moment before the sequel was given wherein the two husbands enacted by tom bertram and william price wager of their wives' obedience and the conduct of the sisters proved how far marriage had altered them to mrs jennings's extreme delight the part of petruchio was taken by william price and this seemed to her to settle the whole manner finally a view which was confirmed when she heard the word courtship passed from one to another of her companions what do you think of that now my dear she whispered loudly into the ear of mrs ferrars what have i been telling you all along nothing could be clearer a very pretty way of showing their friends i say 'courtship' you see my dear ha ha very pretty indeed no no trust me i shall not say a word until i am told i know better than that and the other one too it all points the same way does it not well i declare i have not seen anything to please me so much this long time the actors presently reappeared when they had resumed ordinary dress all a good deal fatigued but in high spirits and much gratified by the unstinted congratulations of their friends mrs bingley and miss darcy indeed shrank from praise for to georgiana it had all been rather an ordeal when the time came and she had been conscious of doing her part stiffly and without natural ease and jane declared she had not acted at all for she would not have known how to do it she had simply stood about under mr bertram's directions and worn the clothes that had been contrived for her but the others were not so diffident for bingley and william price had enjoyed the whole thing heartily and appreciated the joke of throwing themselves into an imaginary character kitty had enjoyed the acting and the applause the pleasure of being with william price had been quite intoxicating and not being altogether without aptitude she had really acquitted herself with some spirit particularly in the scenes from the taming of the shrew but it was to miss bingley and mr bertram in their own estimation that the honours of the evening belonged they received all compliments with the utmost complacency and caroline was heard explaining to mr ferrars and colonel fitzwilliam as they all moved towards the dining room for supper that she had modelled her conception of lady macbeth on that of mrs siddons which she had seen so frequently and studied so closely as to be quite at home in the portrayal of it the lady might perhaps have selected other listeners had she known the associations which one of them had with that play it does you great credit miss bingley said darcy who had been listening to her it has been an evening of surprises has it not elizabeth i could not have believed that there was so much hidden talent among us which would never have been unburied but for the happy idea of these charades it is always so i can assure you mr darcy said tom bertram once you decide to act you can always discover talent in any collection of people ample for your needs of course one or two will always stand out by reason of greater ability but you must know how to select your players so that everyone has a part worthy of him i am afraid some of us had parts we were not worthy of to night cried william i never felt such a fool as when i was playing petruchio and nothing but the kindness of miss bennet could have pulled me through it needs a fellow about six feet high i always said you ought to have done it yourself tom my dear william we have been through all this before you know i should have liked nothing better but i decided after due consideration that i could not do justice to the principal part when i had to be directing the full company all on stage at once you hardly realize my responsibility but rest assured you did not do it so badly i think you managed most wonderfully mr bertram said mrs ferrars to have to arrange the scenes drill the other performers and appear in every scene yourself it was a task few people could have undertaken mr bertram bowed as if there were a foregone conclusion mr bertram has had a good deal of experience in private theatricals said georgiana i have indeed said that gentlemen few men in england have had more i should say and anyone who is known to be fairly well up in these things is naturally in request whenever they are going forward and i have been lucky too in my companies i do not think i have ever known a real failure except perhaps once mrs ferrars's attention was just then called off and he turned to georgiana did i ever tell you miss darcy about that one time when we attempted to do a little acting at my father's house at mansfield park no i do not think you did well it is a long story it might not wholly interest you thank you yes some cold chicken but the substance of it was that we had decided to act a play amongst ourselves you know a pleasant party divided among the two households as this might be just the very people for acting free to rehearse it is true my brother had made some difficulties but all was going smoothly and our friends seemed to be then all one could wish i am not sure that miss crawford had much idea of acting but still she might have improved miss crawford exclaimed georgiana and involuntarily glanced round to make sure that colonel fitzwilliam had not overheard her seeing him occupied in talking to william price she continued in a lower tone i did not know that you knew miss crawford and i am so much interested have you heard anything of her lately mr bertram could hardly believe his ears he looked at miss darcy in the greatest astonishment certainly i know or used to know miss crawford but naturally i have not heard anything of her for several years georgiana was puzzled by his manner and felt that in some strange way she had made a mistake so after a moment's pause she said it was stupid of me not to recollect that you must be acquainted with miss crawford too as i was already aware that mr price was i suppose it was at the same time you were speaking of at your father's house that he met her mr bertram had by this time partly recovered from the shock of finding there was anyone who did not know of the rushworth crawford case and said i beg your pardon miss darcy but your question was a surprise to me no i have quite lost sight of miss crawford and i daresay you know more of her now than i do you are a friend of hers i assume no returned georgiana beginning to regret having pursued the subject i have only met her once for a few minutes but my brother and sister knew her fairly well in bath in bath ah yes i heard that they had settled there georgiana now wished nothing better than to find a new topic or a new companion without delay but mr bertram having rapidly disposed of his cold chicken began again you must not mistake me miss darcy i should be very glad to hear good news of miss crawford once more it is a long time since our families held any intercourse for without going into details her brother behaved like indeed is an intolerable scoundrel but as to his sister she had nothing to do with that she enjoyed amusing herself i fancy as much as most people do but there was really no harm in it as events proved we all thought her a very bright pretty accomplished girl but one thing followed another and of course people are bound to hold by their relations are they not yes indeed assented georgiana warmly who had listened with the deepest interest to this recital which fragmentary though it was seemed to agree with that strange rumour which lady catherine had written about from bath she pondered over it and though reluctant to be indebted to mr bertram for further information she could not help wanting to have her own opinion once more confirmed i am glad to hear you say that mr bertram i thought miss crawford charming and i heard the same from everyone who met her but i think she may have been misjudged blamed perhaps some time or other for the faults of those who belonged to her quite true miss darcy i have no doubt you have hit upon the secret indeed my brother in law yates used to say much the same she was certainly a very handsome girl and it was a thousand pities she never had the chance to play amelia i did not finish telling you about our play the parts were all cast the stage was prepared the rehearsals in full progress yates was after myself the leading spirit i think you said you had met my friend yates miss darcy he was fairly started and georgiana had time to grow weary of the history of lovers' vows and its ultimate conclusion before the announcement was made of mr and mrs ferrars's carriage which broke up the party everyone moved towards the hall and cloaks were fetched while mrs jennings loudly uttered her good nights interspersed with many complimentary remarks to the actors william price had hurried back to the room they had called the green room to search for a cherished ornament of kitty's which she had mislaid so he escaped from congratulations to which in his case mrs jennings would have given a double edge and kitty contrived to avert her share by murmuring as she embraced her guest i shall come and see you to morrow nevertheless mrs jennings was not to be entirely baulked of her intention and the long conversation between mr bertram and miss darcy had attracted her notice so in wishing tom bertram good night she managed to add a few words felicitating him upon his success in another field besides that of the drama laughing heartily at his look of blank astonishment she passed on and as she never felt quite as well able to approach miss darcy on these subjects as other people she contented herself with a sly glance remarking well miss darcy and what a delightful evening it has been we have not heard the last of these charades yet for many a long day have we why all the pleasantest part of them is still to come i fancy georgiana succeeded in avoiding a reply she supposed the allusion was to kitty but she always preferred not to understand mrs jennings whenever possible the visitors directly afterwards went away and the ladies retired the gentlemen sitting up for some time longer chapter xix it was impossible for either kitty or georgiana to think of anything else when they first awoke the next morning than that it was the concluding day of william price's visit twenty four hours more and he would be on the point of departure twenty four short hours were all that was left for an event of such prodigious importance georgiana knew of her friend's half formed hopes that the acting in the last scene of the charades might have afforded an opening for the reality and kitty had not been a little chagrined at william's pronouncement that he wished mr bertram had taken the part but a night's rest had dispersed these clouds and in the happiest frame of mind miss bennet went down early ready to make the most of every instant of this precious day a disappointment awaited her shortly after breakfast for mr darcy was so barbarous as to propose taking the gentlemen to see the farm and the horses and to this they actually agreed bingley only stipulating that they should return in good time as he had made an arrangement to ride with georgiana the damp and muddy state of the ground would not permit of the ladies accompanying them even the most venturesome and when they had all set out kitty found that there was nothing for her to do until their return but to hurry to the rectory in search of the consolation which mrs jennings was always ready to offer mrs darcy found an opportunity during the morning for a little quiet talk with her sister jane so thoroughly liked and respected mr price that she was delighted to find elizabeth in agreement with her and related many instances of his sterling common sense good taste and amiable disposition which she had had time during her longer acquaintance to meet with elizabeth hazarded the suggestion as to his presumed intentions towards kitty that however earnest they may be it was possible that he did not mean to make her an offer at present for his circumstances might not permit of it he was still young and his prospects might not be assured enough to warrant him in taking a wife jane was not inclined to think that any such obstacles stood in his way his cousin had told her that he had saved a considerable sum of money and that his brothers now being all out in the world his family were no longer dependent on his help besides which he knew he would be made a commander by the end of the year and after that it was only a matter of short time to an officer of his experience especially if a little interest could be exercised before he obtained a ship of his own bingley had heard of him from several persons in london and all agreed that there was not a more promising young lieutenant in the service these were the days of quick promotion and his career so far gave rise to no expectation that he would be left behind elizabeth heard it all with pleasure and would not give utterance to her solitary regret that kitty should have been fated to fall in love with a man who in the event of their marriage would be obliged to spend the greater part of the year away from her the gentlemen had returned from their walk by twelve o'clock and fitzwilliam and the two cousins waited near the front door to watch bingley and miss darcy starting for their ride hardly had the horses moved off and colonel fitzwilliam was considering what the guests might like to do next when tom bertram seized william by the arm and with a word of apology to the colonel carried him off to a distant patch i want to speak to you william he began with some abruptness and miss bennet will be popping out on us if i do not take this chance i want to know did you happen to hear what that gossiping old woman mrs jenkins or what ever she is called said to me last night just as she was leaving i certainly did not hear anything particular but i'm afraid one never does pay much attention to mrs jennings returned william then let me tell you she had the impertinence to give me the broadest hint i ever had in my life to give me if you please that i was paying court to miss darcy i never was more astounded i forget exactly what she said but she made it quite clear and yes one remark i do recollect something about the 'charming future lady bertram' good heavens exclaimed william what unpardonable insolence i have never heard anything more outrageously offensive was she i hope i hope tom that miss darcy did not hear any of this no she was nowhere near at the time but imagine my feelings william never having dreamed of such a thing and then having it suddenly brandished in my face as it were by that odiously vulgar woman it was disagreeable certainly but i am thinking more of miss darcy's feelings as from what i know of her i can conceive nothing which would be more repugnant to her than to have such a subject bandied about in jest well you may make your mind easy for she was certainly not listening but that was not what i wanted to say of course it was a complete surprise to me but once it had been put into my head i could not help thinking of it and indeed i have been pondering over it ever since and have come to the conclusion that it would not be at all a bad thing what is this exclaimed william do you expect me to listen to you with patience tom when not three weeks ago you were sighing over miss thorpe and regretted your parents' objection to her and declaring there was not such another girl in the world you need not be so hasty william you talk as if i were already on my knees to miss darcy when i have no intentions whatever towards her the idea has simply been put into my head by the circumstances and naturally i must think it out the idea has been put into your head by a foolish chattering old woman if you call her a circumstance and coming from that quarter is not worth taking seriously for an instant i do not know so much about that it is true she had no business to say it but there was a reason in what she said miss darcy would make an admirable lady bertram imagine my father's and mother's satisfaction if i could present such a girl to them as their daughter good god tom exclaimed william tearing his arm away the cold blooded way in which you talk is more than one can bear weighing one girl against another as if it were a question of relative merit which you would throw the handkerchief to it is not much of a compliment to miss darcy to admit that you never thought whether she had attractions or not until mrs jennings suggested it to you i am not considering paying compliments to miss darcy and i do not see why you should get so hot rejoined his cousin i merely wanted to talk it out with you quietly and ask your opinion but it is perfectly useless if you will fly into a passion at a word well what do you want my opinion about demanded william trying to speak in his ordinary tones tom was easily placated and really wanted to be talking so he resumed my difficulty is that i am more or less involved with isabella of course we are both perfectly free nothing has passed between us that she could construe into an engagement i had to promise my parents that but at the same time i practically promised myself that i wouldn't do anything until i had seen her again which i expect to do in january now for the sake of this connection would it be better for me to break off entirely with the thorpes by degrees you know i like isabella very much it is her family that one sticks at while these darcys are unexceptionable in every way but she herself is a devilishly fine girl with far more style about her than miss darcy you must admit that i think that the two ladies are not to be mentioned in the same breath with each other said william with difficulty restraining his indignation you think not that was what i wanted to arrive at well perhaps you are right though i always thought you needlessly prejudiced against poor isabella i certainly feel more and more the advantages of such an alliance as this on the worldly side that is for their dispositions i fancy that of my old friend would suit me best tom said william turning to face his cousin fully i cannot think what possesses you to talk in this detestable way can you not feel how horrible it is if you care for miss thorpe you cannot think of marrying a girl you meet directly after leaving her and have only known for a week whereas if you think for one moment of miss darcy with the feelings a man ought to have if marriage is in his mind how can you possibly go on making comparisons between her and miss thorpe either way it is abominable treatment of one of them my dear william you are going to the other extreme just now you told me not to take anything mrs jennings said seriously yet you are assuming me to be in the most sober earnest all round when all i want is to give the matter the consideration it deserves miss darcy is very charming but i am quite heart whole where she is concerned at present and so no doubt is she as regards me but everything must have a beginning and if such difficulties are to be put in way of my marrying isabella i could hardly do better than this at any rate it is worth thinking of i shall go home and see how things develop in the course of the weeks i can always come over again you know it is not the ends of the earth william broke from his cousin with an impatient gesture and hurried away to another part of the grounds mr bertram looked after him in surprise shrugged his shoulders and returned to the house to establish himself by the fireside with a newspaper many inquiries were made for mr price throughout the afternoon to which mr bertram could only say that he had seen him last in the garden and it was not until nearly dinner time that he reappeared with a heated wearied look and confessed to having walked too far and missed his way in the park kitty had been on the verge of tears as the hours of his absence went on and even georgiana had begun to look grave but this explanation revived their drooping spirits to a great extent anyone might lose their way in such a large park nearly ten miles round and on a dark foggy afternoon the paths looked all alike and the stream had so many windings it was quite evident that this unlucky circumstance alone had caused the delay these considerations and a most satisfactory glance at her mirror when she was dressed for the ball renewed kitty's bright hopes for the evening she wished lydia could see her now how could regimental balls however smart and gay compare with the splendour the importance of this occasion at pemberley the house as she had always foreseen was exactly right for a ball the arrangements the space and all details were superior to those at mrs knightley's house her dress had been given to her by elizabeth and was even prettier than the one she had worn in london and there seemed to be numbers of pleasant partners including several officers though these gentlemen were not persons of such consideration to kitty as formerly she having now decided that the naval uniform was far handsomer than the military it only remained for mr price to ask for her hand in the first two dances and the gentlemen of the house were so long in appearing that she was in the utmost terror lest she should be obliged to give them away before he arrived but at last among a crowd of other men entering the room she discerned him he approached passing close to georgiana who was just being led into the ball room by a neighbour and old friend and came straight to where kitty stood by mrs bingley's side how delightful to hear the words spoken in his own friendly way and with his own charming smile well miss bennet i hope i may have the honour of these two dances if i am not too late kitty very joyously accompanied him to a place next to georgiana and her partner in the set and with equal joy made an engagement for other dances later in the evening chapter xx the rooms filled and the ball proceeded and many present who were frequent visitors to pemberley nevertheless felt that those noble rooms had never before been the setting for a more brilliant scene mr darcy received innumerable congratulations upon having at last delighted the neighbourhood by permitting his house to be seen to such advantage and not having altogether looked forward to the evening he surprised himself by discovering how much with elizabeth at his side he could enjoy both his own pleasure in entertaining guests which he had not previously done on so large a scale and also the pleasure of others who were important to him elizabeth georgiana and the bingleys georgiana in particular he watched with affectionate appreciation as she moved through the crowds handsome and stately generally grave but occasionally lighting up into shy animation and far more admired than she knew or cared about william price had been dancing for a second time with kitty and they were sitting in a corridor on some chairs placed below a cluster of candles in a sconce projecting from the wall when one of the candles guttered and a few drops of hot wax fell on the edge of kitty's chair narrowly escaping her gown with an exclamation of annoyance she sprang up withdrawing quickly from the post of danger and looking above them both perceived that the mischief was caused by a candle having loosened in its socket and fallen a little to one side william immediately proposed that they should move to other seats and should summon a servant to replace the candle but kitty was in a wild and excitable mood and would pay no heed laughing and calling out that she would put it right herself in a moment she sprang upon the chair reaching as high as she could and to the dismay of the onlookers thrust her hand into the midst of the candles in order to grasp the offending one do pray miss bennet come down exclaimed william and several other persons joined their entreaties to his do not try to do it you will set your dress on fire your sleeve is so dangerously near do let me help you down lest you fall and hurt yourself mrs jennings who had been observing the couple during the dance and had followed them at a little distance now arrived in time to hear kitty say thank you mr price but i have already done it and all is well i and my gown are quite safe you see and looking down at him with a gay triumphant smile she gave him both her hands and with this assistance jumped to the ground adding now was that not skilful of me and if we had waited to discuss it you would never have let me attend to it though it was by far the best i would have tried to prevent your running such risks certainly replied william but his quieter tones were lost in the noisy interposition of mrs jennings oh my dear miss bennet now how very naughty of you you have given poor mr price quite a fright ah mr price she is a sad girl i fear but i am glad to see petruchio is beginning early to learn to keep her in better order all your rehearsing in the charades will come in useful now won't it but i'll warrant this katherine will be just as apt a pupil as the other the old lady laughed heartily at kitty's blushes and at william's blank uncomfortable look there my dears i won't disturb you any longer only i hope you will both come and talk to me whenever you feel inclined kitty who had resumed her seat was the first to break the awkward silence which followed this speech mrs jennings is a great talker is she not she said with a laugh she seems able to think of nothing but those charades and would like to make one believe that the acting was something wonderful yes said william after a pause he had not sat down but remained standing with a disconcerted air twisting kitty's fan about in his hands it is very complimentary i wonder if whether all the spectators were equally impressed oh i think they were said kitty eagerly even darcy said some words in favour of it and you know it is very hard to get any sort of praise out of him and mr and mrs ferrars were quite delighted and my sister too mrs darcy said several times how much she liked it she thought it so clever of mr bertram to have arranged that scene she looked anxiously at william and his face cleared somewhat but he did not sit down again and replied so absentmindedly to a few more remarks made by kitty that when sounds of music reached them she was quite ready to go and walked beside him to the ball room thinking petulantly that mrs jennings had spoilt everything by coming just then and saying what she had that no one liked to be hurried or could be expected to declare himself in a crowd and that perhaps he was vexed at having the words taken out of his mouth as it were altogether the incident was thoroughly annoying for the next dance she saw him invite georgiana but she was already engaged to mr bertram and he did not ask anyone else but stood about watching various people and occasionally exchanging a few words with colonel fitzwilliam and mrs bingley who were sitting down together during the set kitty could see from where she was that they were trying to induce him to find another partner but he laughingly resisted their persuasions and continued to walk about the rooms until the dance was over after which he stationed himself within a short distance of miss darcy's chair and when a suitable interval had elapsed he went up to her and again made his request miss darcy acceded readily and mr bertram left them with by no means as much readiness he had scarcely moved away when william began miss darcy should you mind not standing up for this one i was wondering whether you would be so kind as to show me some of the pictures in the gallery upstairs which mr darcy was speaking of at dinner you know my time is getting very short and i should be sorry to go away without having seen them with the greatest pleasure returned georgiana and indeed i shall be glad not to dance any more at present but you should have made my brother show you the pictures as he is a far better judge than i am we may find him up there as he sometimes takes his friends round on these occasions the picture gallery however proved to be empty of visitors and they strolled through georgiana pointing out which were considered to be the best paintings william passed by them rather hurriedly looking chiefly at the family portraits and georgiana observing this conducted him to the end of the gallery where her brother's likeness hung william studied it for an instant glancing at his companion as if trying to trace a resemblance while georgiana told him the date of the picture and repeated that she wished they had come up before as he would have seen it and all the others so much better in daylight she noticed that william hardly seemed to take in what she said and was not altogether surprised when he turned suddenly to her and said with scarcely concealed agitation miss darcy you are very kind but at this moment i cannot think of these pictures will you let me speak to you for a moment i have something important to say he is going to tell me he has proposed to kitty flashed through georgiana's mind and for one instant a rush of feeling almost overwhelmed her but controlling herself as well as she could she said aloud certainly mr price do say anything you wish will you not sit down and i will do the same she indicated two chairs opposite the portrait and seated herself in one but william remained standing looking at her with such a deep earnest gaze while he tightly clasped his hands together that he did not seem to have heard her words miss darcy you must forgive my presumption it is a bad beginning to ask for forgiveness but i know no one better that it is not for me to speak to you at present as i must speak i would have waited till my position till i was justified but circumstances have made it impossible to go away and wait in utter uncertainty for an unknown future i do not ask anything as yet only a hearing only that you will let me tell you how truly and devotedly i love you and have loved you from the first moment of my seeing you a dreadful misgiving had passed over georgiana at the beginning of this speech and only consternation kept her silent till its close she sprang up in a horror and dismay that would scarcely find expression and exclaimed mr price you to say such words to me what can you mean what can anything mean you no no it is all some horrible mistake no miss darcy indeed it is no mistake broke in william eagerly and earnestly do not be so distressed i beg you i do not ask you to give me any definite reply though you can guess what perfect joy it would be to have one word of hope however slight from your lips but i will wait and try to earn the right to ask for more next year my position will have improved and your brother will not perhaps think it quite out of the question nay i implore you dearest miss darcy to hear me only this once i did not mean to trouble you so soon but i could not bear to go so far away with no prospect of seeing you again and knowing that others might be near you others far more eligible and desirable than myself you would understand i am sure if you only knew the tithe of what i felt mr price said georgiana signing to him with her hand to stop and standing erect before him i insist that you shall cease i will hear no more of this you cannot be in your right mind at all events you will not find me so destitute of sense of honour as you think she paused choked with emotion at the thought of kitty destitute of honour when you know miss darcy that i think you the purest loveliest best of creatures forgive me if i have offended you only tell me how i may correct it do i wrong in speaking to you first i will do whatever you wish i would not grieve you for the world with great effort georgiana collected herself sufficiently to reply these professions of yours amaze and horrify me i cannot tell you whether they are more painful to me if i have to regard them as true than if as at present they seem hypocritical in any case it is absolutely inexplicable that you should use such language to me you who for months past have been recognized by all her friends as the admirer of my friend miss bennet the words were out and georgiana felt hot with shame as she uttered them conscious that even with the need for openness on this terrible occasion the betraying of her friend's hopes to the object of them was a shocking thing she was so overcome as to be unable to look at william price's horror struck face miss bennet it is possible that you thought i was paying attentions to miss bennet miss darcy you cannot be serious this is too frightful i never thought of doing so never dreamed of her expecting them if she did expect them miss bennet was always gay and cheerful she is a charming girl as we were excellent companions but as for anything more surely you could not have been deceived whoever else was when you alone were the subject of all my desires and hopes georgiana shrank from the task of answering such an appeal and took hold of another part of his sentence to reply to she did expect them mr price and she received enough at all events to mislead her most cruelly she has thought of no one but yourself and of meeting again here for months past and everything that has happened in the last week had strengthened her in her belief in your attachment you cannot deny continued georgiana her indignation rising that your constant association her delight in your society have given rise to expectation in the minds of her friends if you dispute its existence in her own no said william i cannot deny that for i had a proof of it this evening in some remarks dropped by mrs jennings but though they disturbed me momentarily i dismissed them from my mind as i knew she was the kind of person whose chief delight lies in teasing young people about each other and i thought miss bennet and her other friends were too sensible to be continually entertaining such fancies fancies repeated georgiana warmly my poor friend is completely wrapped up heart and soul in what you designate as a fancy indeed i am very sorry said william looking utterly downcast very grieved and ashamed if i have caused miss bennet a moment's uneasiness though i can hardly think that others mrs bingley and mrs darcy in particular have so completely failed to perceive but it is useless to enter into the exact degrees of misunderstanding i at least have been as thoroughly blind as a man could wish to be what can i do miss darcy to prove to you my innocence if i have occasioned this unfortunate error it has been through ignorance thoughtlessness nothing more is there any one thing any incident you could tell me of by which you may have been inadvertently misled georgiana's ideas were so confused and she was altogether so agitated that at the moment she felt as if she would never be able to collect herself sufficiently to marshal her evidence now it was required but luckily as she tried to think one episode darted into her memory which had frequently been discussed between herself and kitty and had seemed to bear naturally but one interpretation painful though it was to bring such matters into dispute she forced herself for kitty's sake to say did you not tell mrs knightley after the ball which took place at her house that you had never enjoyed an evening more and that there was one person whose presence there had been everything to you did you not give her to understand that you meant miss bennet distress and surprise were clearly shown on william's countenance he began to speak hesitated and broke off and then resumed i know what you mean but it is all too bewildering surely mrs knightley did not tell you that i never spoke or thought of miss bennet in that connection except that i had some pleasant dances with her she might not have existed for me that evening i recollect telling mrs knightley what a delightful evening i had had and it was she who suggested that one person's presence had contributed more to it than any other i could do nothing but agree with her as i thought she had noticed my instant and intense admiration of you it was so evident to me that i supposed it was to others i thought of no one else but you when mr bingley invited me to stay with him i was doubtful if i could accept but directly he said that you lived in the same neighbourhood i determined that nothing should prevent my coming do you recollect anything else miss darcy our meeting at the hursts' and captain wentworth saying that you believed sailors to be fickle which made me so uneasy until i persuaded myself that you did not mean it oh do not shake your head continue to misbelieve it i entreat you and in these last few days if events have happened to throw me more with miss bennet than with yourself it has not been my doing or my wish i implore you to be convinced of this and to accept my assurances of my unswerving loyalty and devotion towards you it was impossible for georgiana not to be moved by these words though she had tried to check their passionate flow and had remained where she was leaning on a chair solely because her trembling limbs would hardly support her now however summoning all her courage and strengthening herself with thoughts of kitty she spoke in a tolerably firm voice mr price i must believe that this unhappy mistake has been made unintentionally since you say so but the wretchedness it has caused will not be so easily cleared away the assurances of your loyalty should not be made to me you owe them to miss bennet and her only she could get no further for she was interrupted by william with a vehemence exceeding any that he had shown before miss bennet except as your friend and as a lady for whom i have a great liking and respect miss bennet is nothing to me and never could be oh miss darcy you do not yet understand me can you forget miss bennet for one moment and tell me if apart from all that there would be the slightest hope for me at some future time the least chance of your having some faith in me to enable me to strive to win you as i long to do he had made an error and saw it before he had finished his sentence forget miss bennet repeated georgiana with a flash of angry pride as she walked away from him i do not think you understand me mr price when i have desired a friend's happiness so long i cannot lightly see it thrown away and never never would i seek it for my own if it was to be at the expense of hers william on hearing this made a quick pace forward to intercept her and turning so that they stood face to face he asked in quieter but not less ardent tones only one word more miss darcy forgive me for what i said but tell me this you spoke of happiness did you mean that it might be happiness to you if all this were cleared up did you mean that i might be able to make you happy and that there was any possibility of your ever coming to feel for me even the smallest part of what i feel for you georgiana trembling almost weeping her anger not subsided but other sensations surging strongly up brought herself to look for one moment into the eyes of glowing entreaty bent upon hers with almost a sob she broke away from him exclaiming no no it is of no use to ask me do not talk to me in such a way i must not i will not listen i cannot bear it and fairly ran out of the gallery william stood stunned and motionless for some minutes at last he roused himself with a deep sigh from the contemplation of his ruined hopes and strove to think of what he ought to do next while desiring nothing so much as solitude and quiet he remembered that georgiana would not have gone straight back to the ball room and for the two of them to be absent would give rise to remark to protect georgiana was an instinct and it gave him a ray of satisfaction in the midst of his perplexity and misery to remind himself that though she had refused his love she now knew of its existence and whatever misapprehension there might be as to the past she would perceive what influence guided his actions in the future he slowly descended the stairs so bewildered still as scarcely to be conscious of what was going on around him rehearsing their conversation and thinking too late of things he might have said which would perhaps have been of some service to his cause a crowd of persons were streaming into the hall from the ball room the second dance since he and georgiana went upstairs having just ended and supper being now talked of he mingled with the rest and presently manoeuvred himself into a place near mrs bingley who was now sitting with mr ferrars and greeted him with a pleasant smile beyond a casual inquiry as to whether he had seen kitty she asked him no questions and before long he found himself introduced to a young lady and directed to find a place for her at one of the supper tables what he talked of he did not know and the rest of the evening passed in the same dreamlike manner in his desire to attract no special attention he chatted and laughed and danced and was persuaded that he did so as gaily as before but he could not keep his thoughts from wandering to georgiana whom he had seen returning looking very pale about a quarter of an hour after they had parted or to kitty whose eyes continually and anxiously sought his it was far more painful for him to see her than georgiana whom of course he held blameless even for her hard words kitty he vaguely felt to be in part responsible for the whole trouble and though bitterly reproaching himself for folly and blindness he could not bring himself to go near her to speak to her or dance with her again when such a construction had been put upon all their previous intercourse angry at the pain he was giving her and driven to despair at the sight of georgiana's pale cheeks he found the length of the evening almost unendurable and the only relief he obtained was in going to mr bingley and asking him to fix as early as possible an hour for their start on the following morning for it would be necessary for him and his cousin to be well on their long journey towards mansfield by the afternoon it had been already arranged that the three gentlemen should return to desborough independently of mrs and miss bingley who were to remain at pemberley for another day or two to recover from the fatigues of the ball mr bingley good naturedly agreed judging that the young people had decided that it would be better to make their adieux the night before rather than come down early to a painful scene of parting at the prosaic breakfast table so he went away to consult darcy and send out orders to the stables this done william felt more comfortable inaction was intolerable to him and he would have removed himself from the house at once if he could have done so since to relieve her of a presence which had become embarrassing and distasteful to her was the only thing he could now do for georgiana she had as he anticipated sought the refuge of her own room when she fled from the gallery but even there the old habits of self command and consideration for others prevailed over the longing to give way to her grief and distress of the mind she knew she must not allow herself the luxury of a burst of tears nor even a little quiet thought in order to realize what had occurred and decide what if anything she should say to kitty no there was no time for that there would be plenty of opportunity soon to readjust their view of recent events and all that they meant to kitty and herself shaken and unnerved by the shock of william price's declaration georgiana shrank from immediately facing its consequences she could only take a few moments in which to compose herself and endeavour to smooth away the traces of emotion that she must see him again was a dreadful thought but it would be a far worse ordeal to have to encounter kitty's inquiries and lamentations on the following day and the surprise of elizabeth and jane georgiana dared not let herself think of all this when this horrible evening was not yet over she hastily bathed her face and opening the windows wide leaned out for a few minutes for the night air to cool her throbbing temples and went down at last feeling as if her countenance must betray to every observer the secret of what had happened she took refuge at once by the side of elizabeth who made room for her with a smile and did not fail to notice her aspect as soon as she was at liberty she asked georgiana if she was very tired and took care that she was provided with some refreshment georgiana owned to a good deal of fatigue but declared that she should sleep it off and elizabeth who thought her lassitude partly attributable to some worry about kitty told her that she might slip away to bed as soon as she chose and that kitty must not come into her room for one of their long conversations they must wait till to morrow to talk over the ball poor georgiana assented with a grateful glance but had difficulty in restraining her tears as she thought how little elizabeth dreamt that interview with kitty could be a thing to be dreaded not welcomed after supper she could not for fear of making herself conspicuous avoid one or two invitations to dance but she was truly glad when colonel fitzwilliam on a hint from elizabeth approached her and said let me take you to a seat in the library georgiana i fear you are tired and you will be able to rest quietly there and not say one word to me unless you please we are old enough friends for that i should think there were but few persons in the large library at one end of which a table had been set out where servants dispensed tea and coffee during the evening and the cousins placed themselves on a leather covered couch near the fire at the opposite end true to his undertaking colonel fitzwilliam remained silent after he had established his cousin in comfort and screened the blaze from her face but after a few minutes georgiana roused herself thinking anything better than being left to her own reflections and suddenly recollecting a thing that she had intended to tell elizabeth had she been able to see her alone during the day and deciding that there could be no harm in communicating it to colonel fitzwilliam herself she mentioned having learnt the fact of mr bertram's acquaintance with miss crawford and asked if her cousin happened to know it he admitted himself informed but expressed interest as he himself had not discussed it with mr bertram georgiana therefore ventured to give him mr bertram's description of her and pointed out rather timidly that it seemed to agree entirely with what they already knew and had heard yes said colonel fitzwilliam thoughtfully and after a pause he added i am glad he spoke so well of her glad she had an advocate in him for as you may have gathered from what he dropped with regard to her brother it would not be surprising if the bertram family were a little prejudiced against all the crawfords i am glad that he at least has the manliness to award blame only where blame is due georgiana listened attentively half expecting that her cousin would go on to explain the nature of the prejudice against the crawfords which had clearly done miss crawford so much harm but he did not so after a little she hazarded the remark he did not seem to know anything about her of late years so i thought it useless to ask about her marriage you were right it would have been useless said the colonel elizabeth i know troubles herself a good deal about not having heard any particulars but doubtless the world will be informed all in good time and when there is any news one may expect it will penetrate even to derbyshire he smiled as he spoke but it was not a cheerful smile and his voice had the ring of something very like bitterness georgiana's heart ached for him she felt that never before had she known what a disappointment could be colonel fitzwilliam talked of other things until they were interrupted by tom bertram who came hurrying in search of them to ask miss darcy to dance with him again miss darcy so sorry you are tired but you positively must allow me just these two people are beginning to go actually and you know when that happens a ball always begins to lose some of its spirit besides who knows when we shall have another such a delightful evening as this again i have been telling mr and mrs bingley i can never sufficiently thank them for having brought me here georgiana suffered him to lead her to the dance and to go on talking for she was quite unequal to arguing with him at the conclusion of the two dances elizabeth who had been watching her came up and asked her if she would not like to retire at once and fortified by this permission georgiana turned to say good night to her partner whose protests against her disappearance were as strong as the polite tom bertram could make them why miss darcy if you remove yourself the ball may as well break up and it is really cruel to make me say good night when it is good bye as well is it do you start so early to morrow i am very sorry said georgiana with an effort at the cordiality which seemed expected of her we do indeed some wild idea of my cousin's i fancy that it will take us all day to get to mansfield even going round desborough to meet the curricle it will not but mr bingley has just informed me that william wishes to start not a moment later than eight and you ladies i fear are not likely to be on the scene at such an unearthly hour no indeed said elizabeth after such dissipations as charades and a ball it will be remarkable if any of us are able to leave our rooms for a week you do not realize what quiet people we are here ordinarily mr bertram she chatted on and under cover of it georgiana managed to say a brief adieu and glide away could she avoid seeing mr price again no he was standing by the foot of the stairs he seemed to be watching for her there was no escape her head was averted and her foot placed on the lowest step when he started forward and not offering to shake hands but in a low voice and a look of intense earnestness he said may i say good bye to you miss darcy georgiana hardly knew if her good bye mr price was audible but he bowed and stepped back his eyes following her as she went up the stairs chapter xxi in the gloom of the following morning at an hour which seemed exceptionally cheerless by reason of the mist and fine rain which prevailed mr bingley's chaise drove round to the front entrance of pemberley kitty who after a night of weeping and wretchedness had fallen into a doze was aroused by the sound of movements and voices but when she peeped through her curtains she was too late for anything but a heartrending glimpse of the skirts of william price's great coat as he stepped into the carriage the door was shut darcy and fitzwilliam waved their farewells and the horses moved off at a brisk trot kitty watched and listened to them as long as she could and then flung herself on her bed in a paroxysm of grief though william's avoidance of her during the latter part of the previous evening his strange altered looks and his embarrassed way of saying good night had undermined her hopes to such an extent that she had been all night facing the terrible desolation caused by the thought if he does not care for me after all yet she had not actually given all up in despair until the moment of hearing him leave the house some note some message might have arrived might still arrive but since parting from him kitty had not been able to quell the horrible fear that all was over the indications which had been so favourable had completely changed since mrs jennings had uttered her foolish remark in vain had she tried to reinstate her old relations with william price what could it all mean each time she put this question to herself she gave way afresh to unrestrained tears and weakened by fatigue and emotion was totally incapable of following out any train of thought or conjecture she had longed to hasten to georgiana the night before to pour out her heart in an appeal for the support which georgiana had never failed to give but elizabeth had checked her in this intention and poor kitty unable to bear pain alone with any degree of courage had worked herself into a deplorable condition by the time her sister arrived at her door in the morning elizabeth and jane had naturally both surmised something of the state of things as regarded kitty it was not difficult for anyone acquainted with the previous development of the affair to perceive that william price had not fulfilled the expectations which had been formed of him and elizabeth accounted for georgiana's evident unhappiness by concluding that she had become aware that this would be the case william price had looked much as usual up to the last but elizabeth suspected that there had been some elucidation either between him and georgiana or through mrs jennings and she hardly knew how much to blame him there was no time to talk matters over with jane for she felt as soon as she was up that her immediate visit must be to the chief sufferer to comfort and sustain her and if possible to shield her from the consequences of her own error kitty would not admit her at first and when at length elizabeth persuaded her to do so she was distressed to see what ravages the shock of disappointment and the hours of weeping had wrought kitty's tears broke out anew but the sense of elizabeth's affection and companionship somewhat soothed her and when she could speak more coherently she begged to see georgiana who could perhaps tell her things who would be able to explain this elizabeth could not permit for she saw that kitty was in no fit state to talk over her troubles but she promised her an early opportunity of doing so and having induced her to swallow some food and a cordial she soon had the satisfaction of seeing her fall asleep these precautionary measures were fully justified in the course of the next forty eight hours during which time kitty remained really ill attacks of strong hysteria alternating with weakness of extreme exhaustion every care was lavished on her by her two sisters by georgiana and by elizabeth's maid but naturally anything like rational discussion of the cause of her illness was out of the question and indeed kitty herself after once asking if mr price had left any message for her or spoken of returning at some future time and receiving a negative answer seemed after giving way to a torrent of tears unable or unwilling to puzzle matters out any further georgiana did not escape the inquiries and speculations of elizabeth and jane when she descended from her room the morning after the ball at an hour little later than her usual one to take her place in the family circle she had regained complete control of herself and declared herself entirely refreshed and beyond a little heaviness of the eyes and paleness of cheeks naturally attributable to the fatigues of the last two days there was nothing in her aspect to cause remark no one guessed at the sense of guilt which filled her heart when she saw what grief and disappointment had done for kitty or at the deep compunction and almost unendurable self reproach which assailed her when the others discussed his strange defection and professed themselves unable to account for the curious change in his attitude towards kitty a change which several people had noticed the last hour of the ball elizabeth and jane asked her if she was at all prepared for it whether anything had occurred to make her suspect that mr price would not propose marriage to kitty after all these questions were a hard trial to georgiana for she could not bear to be other than straightforward and for a multitude of reasons she could not divulge the true explanation she could only say in a low troubled voice and with as few words as possible that she had learnt in the course of the evening that their expectations were mistaken ones and that she feared kitty would take it very much to heart seeing her unhappiness on her friend's behalf the two ladies forbore to tease her with further inquiries though jane still felt that georgiana could have thrown more light on the mystery had she cared and in her hearing continually lamented the failure of everything for poor kitty who had fallen as it were between two stools the regrettable ending to all this pleasant time and the fickleness of young men or rather the unfortunate complications that arose through their not knowing their own minds georgiana had to listen to this in silence though conscious that the last was not an accusation that could fairly be brought against william price and elizabeth's more rational way of accounting for things was not much better when she said that she did not think mr price guilty of more than thoughtlessness but it was certainly a pity that he had not been able to perceive earlier the extent of kitty's feeling for him as no doubt when he had at last become aware of it he realized what elizabeth had already surmised to be in his mind namely that his roving life did not warrant him in thinking about matrimony at present georgiana thought she might venture to say here that william price had indeed expressed great sorrow to her on finding that he had been the cause of disappointment to kitty and she even went so far into the dangerous fields of explanation as to add that he had had no suspicion of it until surprised by a chance word of raillery from mrs jennings she was pleased to see that this news partly rehabilitated him in the mind of elizabeth if not of jane and for fear of betraying more than she ought she went away wondering why she should be glad for him not to be misjudged when she really ought to be only thinking of how wrongly he had behaved the hour of enlightenment for kitty could not be long postponed by the third day she was well enough to sit up in a large chair in her own room and on being visited by georgiana begged her to stay for a time and to fasten the door when assured of their freedom from interruption she seized her friend's hand made her sit close beside her and implored her to relate everything she could that would throw light on mr price's changed conduct and hasty departure georgiana nerved herself to reply but for the first few minutes kitty was talking and crying incessantly pouring out the pent up grief of the last few days so that georgiana had great difficulty in calming her and dreaded the effect of the revelation about to be made dear kitty remonstrated georgiana you must not cry you must be more composed or elizabeth will not let me stay with you do try to be brave think whether it is right to give way so much you will make yourself ill again you know anyone would be ill after what i have been through lamented kitty i shall never be happy again why does he not care for me did he tell you why not georgiana what have i done or what has mrs jennings done something must have happened to offend him for he changed all in one minute i do not believe anything happened to offend him kitty returned georgiana as he has gone away now and did not do what he all thought he would do is it not best to assume that he does not care in the way we hoped for and try to forget about it and not mind too much dear kitty i am deeply grieved for you it has been my fault more than anyone's and you are right to reproach me i can never forgive myself for having led you into the mistake but you are not answering me georgiana cried kitty with the petulance of an invalid of course i know he does not care and has gone away but i want to know why he has gone if it is not for anything i have done he might come back georgiana was silent and held her down she shrank still from telling kitty that he would not come back kitty began again impatiently it is foolish of you to talk about reproaching yourself it is not more your fault than anyone else's not so much as mrs jennings's but if he spoke to you about it at all he must have said something have given some hint did he talk to you georgiana you have not told me that yet georgiana gave up what hopes she had had of concealing from kitty what would make the disappointment far more thorough and crushing and as gently as possible managed to convey the fact of william's confession of attachment to herself she was obliged to say it several times and in language of unmistakable clearness before kitty could grasp her meaning and even then as she sat crouched on the ground her face averted and her cheeks burning with shame kitty who had drawn her hand away gazed at her in mingled horror and incredulity in the course of these three days the notion that miss kitty bennet was not the object of william price's preference had at length penetrated the mind of that young lady but that her friend should be the chosen one was a thing altogether past comprehension and the first idea that occurred to her was that there must have been treachery to herself somewhere kitty's changes of mood lately had been punctuated by bursts of tears and this was no exception to the rule though they were now tears of mortification her first angry impulse was to pour out words of blame accusing georgiana of not being satisfied with the attentions of mr bertram but requiring those of his cousin too georgiana disdained to reply to such a taunt but it needed all her patience all her tenderness to persuade kitty out of her bitter frame of mind and to endeavour to heal the wound to the poor girl's vanity which had indeed all through been more deeply involved than her affections little though she realized it combined with a love of importance and the encouragement given by her friends it had carried her on a wave of excitement through the past months and had helped to fix her hopes more firmly on william price than any knowledge of his character any real congeniality in their natures could have done but she could not be aware of all this and there was no immediate comprehension to make the disappointment less acute it certainly was consoling to feel that everyone else must have been to blame that everybody had been equally deceived that even georgiana herself had been taken by surprise and was now heaping upon herself the severest reproaches while she implored kitty's forgiveness not kitty discerned in a puzzled way for having received mr price's proposals but for having helped to foster the deception which had reacted so cruelly upon her friend above all it would have been a relief having discovered that mr price must have acted atrociously to say so and the more kitty thought of it the more she resented his conduct but georgiana would not admit this she would only allow that it was all utterly inexplicable but that they could not judge fairly of mr price not being able to see his point of view and that if that was clear to them she was sure that he would be found to have acted honestly all the way through kitty immediately suspected that georgiana had been won round to the said point of view and began to question her closely as to what had passed between them but georgiana indignantly repudiated the suggestion and assured kitty in a manner that forbade further discussion that she had decidedly refused mr price refused even to listen to him and had not the slightest expectation of ever seeing or hearing from him again she added that she had refrained from telling elizabeth or any of the others about mr price's offer and thought it would be best if kitty decided to do the same to which as she had expected kitty willingly agreed nothing in fact could have suited kitty better in the circumstances than a compact of silence at the end of their long conversation when georgiana left her by far the more exhausted in spirits of the two she had begun to have some of the sensations of an injured heroine and it was much more satisfactory to consider herself badly treated to have been jilted to all intents and purposes than if it came to be known that she had been all the time in love with the wrong man in which case her position would be shorn of much of its dignity her sisters' sympathy was very acceptable to her and when jane invited her to return with her to desborough for a time she gladly promised to do so knowing that it would not at first be at all comfortable to remain with georgiana the one person who knew the whole story it was therefore arranged that jane and miss bingley should defer their journey for two days more when it was hoped she would be quite equal to travelling with them the only drawback to the plan as far as she was concerned was miss bingley's presence for another fortnight at desborough that lady had not troubled herself to make any conjectures with regard to william price's departure but frankly told jane and georgiana that it was exactly what she had expected she at least had never been misled she had never supposed mr price to be in love with miss bennet or anyone else she could not imagine why they had all persuaded themselves of it nothing was clearer than that he was a young man quite heart whole jane protested but georgiana made no comment only begging her friend privately not to refer to the subject in kitty's hearing the day arrived mr bingley's carriage again drove to the door and the three ladies took their seats in it kitty's farewell glance being given towards the spot where she had last seen william price with their going the whole episode seemed to be finally closed and georgiana turned to re enter the house and to take up the duties of a life which in one short week seemed to have been robbed of almost all its brightness she had been making an unsuccessful struggle against low spirits ever since the ill omened day of the ball and being unable to dismiss had tried hard to account for the strange sense of depression of loneliness and loss which assailed her continually it was not only sorrow for kitty's disappointment or regret for her own share in it nor was it the estrangement that had arisen between them no it was not a vision of kitty that so constantly obtruded itself upon her thoughts but of a very different person one whose ardent looks and words insisted on being remembered whose voice she seemed to hear again pleading for what she dared not give every detail of their conversation in the gallery crowded upon georgiana's memory once she had made her confession to kitty and would admit these thoughts they would not be denied as she had denied him a hearing but came back to her with a vivid clearness and an irresistible appeal she remembered how he had described the beginnings and the growth of his attachment to her and looking back over the course of their acquaintance countless incidents stood out to verify all he had said when no longer viewed through kitty's illusions every one of their meetings and conversations was seen in its true light consolidating their friendship giving each an insight into the other's character why was it such a joy though an indescribably painful one to recall these things to live again through the moments spent in the gallery georgiana's heart answered her and she felt that the answer must always have been there though she had only just awakened to it it was a joy because everything connected with william price must be a joy to her himself his nobleness his true worth and the knowledge that he cared for her but it was pain because sweet though it was to hear what he had to tell her it was a disloyalty to her friend to listen the friend whose life had perhaps been spoilt by their mistake how could she ever think of being happy as long as that friend suffered for despite her grief at the thought that she had lost him for ever that she had refused his love and he would never know now that she loved him in return yet georgiana felt that she could not have acted differently even had she known at the moment he spoke what he was to her she could not have been so traitorous as to take what kitty longed for from under her very eyes and she was glad that kitty did not guess at the extent of the sacrifice chapter xxii the departure of the ladies for desborough left a small party at pemberley for several days previously colonel fitzwilliam had gone with his horses to leicestershire and good accounts of the hunting prospects had been received from him the darcys were not however to remain for long alone for the arrival of mrs grant and miss crawford had been fixed for a date early in the following week elizabeth delayed no further in preparing georgiana for their visit and at same time communicated to her the fact which she had learnt from mrs wentworth of miss crawford's not being engaged to sir walter elliot georgiana listened with the greatest interest and joined warmly in the expression of elizabeth's hopes that colonel fitzwilliam might yet be made happy although for the present there was nothing to be done but to try to make miss crawford feel at home and comfortable among them all i shall confine my efforts solely to that said elizabeth laughingly it would be useless as well as dangerous to attempt any further matchmaking until we know the extent of feeling on both sides for that want of that knowledge has made us singularly unsuccessful lately has it not georgiana georgiana assented but could not smile for just then only the tragical side of unrequited love was turned towards her a brief letter of thanks had been received by his hostess from william price saying all that was necessary in a matter simple and sincere and closing with a message of greetings and remembrance to all your family georgiana's cheeks burned as she handed it back and she was glad to turn away and take her little niece upon her lap while darcy glancing over the letter said he seems an agreeable manly young fellow from what i saw of him i should be sorry to think he would treat a girl ill a girl's fancy does not always keep pace with common sense in such a case as the one you speak of said his wife and as i told you i do not think kitty was very wisely counselled from the first probably not said darcy a young man at his age and in his profession is likely to flutter the dovecotes quite unconsciously but there was something so frank and pleasing about him that one would wish to believe him thoroughly estimable georgiana through the little one's chatter heard these words with delight that william price should have gained her brother's good opinion was a source of rejoicing even though that advantage might now avail him nothing miss crawford looked very thin and ill when she arrived and the first part of her visit passed very quietly she spent the chief of her time in her own rooms descending only to join the family at dinner and during the evening and when not talking to elizabeth seemed to find her greatest pleasure in listening to georgiana's music mrs grant watched over her with unremitting solicitude but by no means treated her as a sick person evidently desiring that she should rouse herself take an interest in things around her and make whatever exertion she felt equal to the tranquility of the life exactly suited her and before many days an improvement in her health and spirits became noticeable she was able to take drives in the mildest part of the day or go for short walks through the pleasure grounds when the frosts of december came in and the mornings were bright and invigorating the beauty of the country around the healthiness of the air and the quiet kindness of her host and hostess gradually had their effect upon a troubled mind and a weakened body and colonel fitzwilliam's name was barely mentioned lady catherine de bourgh's never one morning when georgiana and mrs grant had walked down to the rectory elizabeth was sitting with her guest and with the view of entertaining her gave her a description of the charades not omitting the energetic part played by mr bertram in organizing them mary's colour changed a little on first hearing his name but she gave all her attention to the recital and it was not until some minutes later when silence had fallen between them that she said suddenly i wonder if mr bertram or mr price spoke of me to you mrs darcy were you aware that i knew them both elizabeth replied that she had heard from georgiana of mr price's acquaintance with miss crawford but of mr bertram's she had not known the subject never having been approached while the young men were there i thought not said miss crawford and after a moment's pause she added colouring slightly i have had too much experience of your kindness to think that you would treat me differently if you did know the whole circumstances nevertheless i felt sure that you did not and i made up my mind before i came here that i would not be any further indebted to you while you remained in ignorance each day i have been expecting you to ask me some question about the reason for lady catherine's hostility to us for you were fully entitled to an explanation after the kind and generous way in which you wrote to me and which i fear i acknowledged so inadequately she stopped emotion and weakness depriving her momentarily of speech and elizabeth who had been endeavouring to check her took hold of her hand and with the utmost gentleness begged her not to continue and not to agitate herself dear miss crawford i am entitled to no explanation and i do not wish for one it is you who ought to receive the fullest apologies of the whole family for my aunt's conduct to you my cousin told us all that happened that evening after we left and as i told you in my letter i can never be sufficiently ashamed and grieved on account of what you were subjected to if you can forgive us do not let us revive the subject it is painful to us both miss crawford indicated that she wished to be allowed to speak and after a few moments spent in recovering herself she went on in a low voice and looking away from elizabeth i did not mean to refer to that part of it and least of all with you whose goodness has almost obliterated it from my mind i mean the reason for lady catherine's attack you must have surmised that there was some cause for it she must have told you that she had heard something to my detriment or at all events you have gathered that something of the kind exists it is that that i wish to make clear i feel that i owe it to you to tell you exactly as far as they concern myself what things are said about me in order that when you hear them from others you may be able to separate the true from the false for some of them are true you know that is the unfortunate part of it as she concluded she glanced at elizabeth with an attempt at a smile though her hands were trembling elizabeth attempted to calm and reassure her there is no need for you to tell me anything if you do not feel equal to the effort she said i think i do already know the greater part of the story and i can assure you that we have never believed the smallest thing disadvantageous to yourself i had heard enough of it before mr yates appeared to be convinced that you were the person injured and misjudged and that a maliciously distorted version of events was poured down my aunt's ears i shall be very happy if some day you will give me your confidence but i fear it might do you harm to talk of it just now and recall things in which persons you cared for were involved elizabeth's manner was so kind that mary was glad to allow herself to be persuaded and lay back on her sofa murmuring yes you are right looking at the same time tired and relieved she presently added with a little more brightness i am glad you know and that you do not think me such a monster as lady catherine described i never thought you were a monster my dear miss crawford assured elizabeth smiling and studying her guest's countenance while her own mind was busy miss crawford's definitely if laughingly expressed desire to be reinstated in the good opinion of mrs darcy probably included in its object the rest of the family and if so then in spite of their abrupt separation at bath in spite of all that had happened since in london colonel fitzwilliam must be among the number elizabeth felt as if she were groping in the dark for she had no clue to miss crawford's present feelings towards him but though she had not intended to speak of him yet this was at least an opportunity of discovering whether they were feelings of goodwill she accordingly said as if continuing the same train of thought my cousin was so glad that he had happened to remain behind us and could therefore attempt to do something even though it was but little to remedy the evil caused by those objectionable ferrars mary started and changed her position and elizabeth though not looking directly at her could perceive a variety of expressions pass across her face she did not answer immediately and her reply when uttered it was very kind of colonel fitzwilliam sounded cold and reserved i do not regard it as kindness said elizabeth his regard for you and his indignation on your behalf made him anxious to do far more he told me that he bitterly regretted having left you that evening after we had gone away if he had stayed near you he could have prevented much that followed again mary took some time to reply and when she did to elizabeth's surprise it was with more than a touch of scornfulness colonel fitzwilliam has a great power of self effacement has he not he must have practiced the art of disappearing unexpectedly with as little warning as the magician in the fairy stories but does he so asked elizabeth whose astonishment increased i had not noticed it we think him generally a staid and sober person who does things with even more than the usual amount of consideration did he not return did you not see him that evening at my aunt's oh yes that evening said mary i believe he did see us to the carriage i was not thinking so much of that occasion but in london i saw him once or twice and he talked as if he were going to remain and then he vanished as if the earth had swallowed him of course it did not matter he had only himself to please but i heard several people remark on it elizabeth pondered and to gain time inquired did he speak as though he hoped to see you again while he was there yes at least we thought so my sister and i may have misunderstood or he may have meant nothing people can hardly be expected to account for all their sudden freaks can they replied mary speaking with an indifference so marked that her companion could not help fancying it was assumed elizabeth hesitated no longer and was about to speak with the intention of telling miss crawford why colonel fitzwilliam had left town so suddenly when the door opened to admit mrs grant and georgiana so that she was obliged to postpone the communication till some future time and to leave matters in a state which more than ever seemed to need elucidation the opportunity however was long in coming after their half finished talk mary crawford appeared to avoid being alone with her hostess she came downstairs more and gradually began to live almost entirely with the rest of the family but constantly kept close to her sister and georgiana on various pretexts the latter did not venture to speak to her of colonel fitzwilliam but mary was not long in discovering that the name of william price was a welcome one to her young friend and seeing that georgiana wished to hear without having to ask mary told all she knew of his youth his family and his past career descanting on his charm and his fine qualities of character while georgiana sat in silence her downcast eyes and glowing cheeks alone betraying the interest which the subject had for her mary guessed at the meaning of it all but considerately said no word to arouse georgiana's self consciousness and their friendship grew almost unawares neither knowing how much each thought of and would have liked to help the other it was not until nearly a week after the subject had first been broached that elizabeth found it possible to renew it and then only by deliberately engaging the attention of miss crawford in inviting her to walk with her one morning along the high road darcy had driven with mrs grant and georgiana to a distant part of the estate and it had been proposed that the other two ladies should come to meet them on their return so that miss crawford could take a seat in the barouche should she feel tired it was such a beautiful morning crisp cold and bright that mrs grant over ruled the objections which her sister was beginning to make and assured her that a brisk walk in such weather could do her nothing but good elizabeth half suspected that she would still find some way of avoiding the expedition but when twelve o'clock arrived miss crawford descended into the hall saying smilingly all ready you see mrs darcy don't you think i am the most obedient patient you ever saw at this rate you will soon be able to send me away a complete cure i hardly think of you as a patient now and still less do i think of sending you away returned elizabeth as they emerged from the house mr darcy and i should be sadly disappointed if you left us directly you were well enough to do so you are always so kind said miss crawford but i fear our visit must come to an end soon as it is less than a fortnight to christmas and you will probably be having a large family party for the occasion such a remark could only be interpreted in one way and elizabeth after reiterating her hope that miss crawford and mrs grant would make a long stay and assuring her guest that their numbers at christmas would be the same as at present went on almost immediately the other day we were speaking of colonel fitzwilliam's sudden departure from london and i wanted to tell you if it is not tiresome to you to hear what i believe to have been the reason for it i am so anxious he should not be misunderstood or thought capricious oh mrs darcy i did not seem to imply he was i am sure he has the best of reasons for what he does and anyhow they are no business of mine elizabeth would not let the subject be dismissed and continued very gently he had good reasons in this case and i hope very much you will not dislike my mentioning them as they concern you he left london because he cared for you and had just heard on what he believed to be unimpeachable authority that you were engaged to another man the news was such a blow to him that he could not endure to stay where he might possibly meet you again there was a short pause mary grew crimson uttered an exclamation and then controlling herself with an effort said in tones of suppressed anger if colonel fitzwilliam told you that mrs darcy he is deceiving you and himself it would be much better to admit candidly that when he saw me again in london he did not care for me as much as he had thought instead of making my supposed engagement an excuse for his disappearance elizabeth stood still for a moment completely taken aback by this version of affairs and could only exclaim miss crawford oh i beg your pardon i know i ought not to speak to you who are his relative said mary walking on with quick impetuous steps pray forgive me mrs darcy i know you are true who ever else is not but you cannot guess how hard it is to be accused of sending a person away before they have even approached one to be blamed for causing trouble when one has never been a free agent and when the trouble has all reacted upon one's self i would not blame you for the world said elizabeth you must remember i know but little of the facts and nothing at all of how they appear from the other side my principal object as i have said is to prevent my cousin from being misjudged not to make any accusations against anyone will you not tell me a little more so that between us we may clear the whole matter up elizabeth was obliged to proceed with the utmost caution and to speak less openly than she would have wished for instinct warned her that miss crawford was not yet ready to be guided or even sympathized with it was far too soon to assume any special interest on her part in colonel fitzwilliam though her last speech had admitted the existence of a trouble not unconnected to him there is really nothing to tell you mrs darcy said miss crawford what happened is simply a succession of negatives colonel fitzwilliam reappeared in london and showed every sign of wishing to renew his friendship with my sister and me but he departed without doing so i was not engaged to anyone at that time nor have i been since as he might have easily found out if he had asked the right people miss crawford cried elizabeth earnestly he had reason to believe it perhaps he did not ask your nearest relatives but you are surely aware it involves no reproach to yourself but it was talked of and assumed to be a fact among your friends generally mary evidently found it difficult to reply but at length said yes i know it was talked of but there was never any truth in it i know i was foolish i went about a great deal with those people with the elliots i let myself be drawn into their circle and i suppose it was pleasant to be feted and made much of mrs darcy i daresay you hardly know what it is to drift into an intimacy that amuses you and occupies your time while your heart is never in it the smallest degree i think i understand said elizabeth gently you had been with them at bath and it was difficult to free yourself from the association when you met again yes and my brother liked them or they liked him and it is always natural for me to be where he is but i was not bound to them and it was not all enjoyment how often i wished that something would happen to take me out of it how gladly would i not have gone my cousin hoped i think to have made some arrangements with you and your sister but he was not sure if they would be acceptable colonel fitzwilliam did not put himself to much trouble about it returned mary the extent of his plans was that he asked permission to come and call and then did not do so because he had heard in the meantime of your engagement said elizabeth dear miss crawford you must you must indeed let me convince you of his sincerity he cared for you in bath you know he did for he told your sister so she looked anxiously at mary and received a glance of reluctant assent no one more deeply lamented the misfortune which separated you after that and can you wonder that when you meet again the remembrance of what happened made him diffident as to his reception and uncertain of the place he still might hold in your esteem but he was as devoted to you as ever and only longed for a chance of showing it oh elizabeth broke off impatiently but smiling at herself i ought not to be saying this to you in these cold bald words i cannot plead his case as eloquently as he could but at least i can implore you to believe in him grant that he acted with over caution and did not consult his own best interests he was afraid of precipitating matters by speaking before he could divine what you felt for him but that his affection was there i know positively a man who had cared less would have stayed would have pretended indifference and would have congratulated you on your engagement i wish he had said miss crawford trying to smile though the tears filled her eyes for then i could have told him of his mistake and asked him why he was in such a hurry to credit it i do not think he was in a hurry said elizabeth sadly he would not have believed it if he could have helped it and if you could see him now you would know what real grief can do for a man of his nature i am sorry said miss crawford without much warmth but a moment later she exclaimed yes it is bad for a man to bring unhappiness on himself through an error but i suppose it never occurred to him that by going off in that way without a word he might be leaving the same thing for someone else if i were a man i would never accept my dismissal except from the woman herself i would at least have the courage to put my fate to the touch elizabeth weighed these words for an instant and then turning to look in her companion's face she said i want to ask you one thing but you need not reply if you do not wish if my cousin had put his fate to the touch while he was in london would he have had the answer or any hope of answer that he desired mary coloured deeply but did not turn her eyes away from mrs darcy's it is hardly fair is it to ask me a question which he has never asked she said with a slight smile but it is useless to try to keep secrets from such a friend as yourself and i suppose you are answered by now they stopped with one accord beside a gate and stood looking over the long furrows of brown earth in the field but neither seeing them miss crawford's blush remained and her lips were set rather defiantly when elizabeth turned to her and said with great earnestness i said that colonel fitzwilliam was not coming back before christmas and that is quite true but may i not tell him to come i will do nothing without your permission will not even say that you are here but will you not give him leave to come and speak for himself and try to atone for the mistakes and unhappiness of the past indeed though at this moment he has no hope of it i know that he would ask no greater privilege mary laid her hand on her friend's and replied affectionately but without any hesitation no no mrs darcy do not tell him to come i thought you would suggest something of the kind but i would much rather not it would be no kindness to either of us then as elizabeth still looked questioningly at her she continued i really mean it since we are to be quite frank i did feel very much what i thought to be colonel fitzwilliam's defection and frances would tell you that that accounts for my stupid ill health this autumn i do not quite agree but none the less i am confident that we had better not meet again it is too late when people are getting on towards respectable middle life as we are you smile but do you know i am near my thirtieth birthday no we have both recovered from the wounds of last summer and we should be wiser not to risk reopening them it would be a healing i think not a reopening said elizabeth do you think so but one cannot tell colonel fitzwilliam must have been in love with some ideal person a mary crawford who never really existed or he would not have been frightened away so easily from the actual one if he were to see me again there might be a fresh disappointment in store does he still think i am to marry sir walter elliot i do not know darcy and i have never told him otherwise ah well do not let him be undeceived and some day perhaps in london we shall be sent in to dinner together and imagine his surprise and dismay at finding it is plain miss crawford and not lady elliot it will give us something to talk about through the first three courses dear mrs darcy you look disapprovingly at me but seriously i do think if we ever are to meet it will be best to do so by accident i could hardly bear a premeditated encounter as it would be here each of us knowing that we were expected to play a certain part it is better he should not come of course if you are not sure whether you could accept him said elizabeth that it is i suppose i am not sure because you see circumstances have combined to make colonel fitzwilliam appear in light of a half hearted admirer and though i know from you he is not yet i have no experience of his own powers of recommending himself do not be angry with me or let this spoil our friendship i am so glad now that you know all and you will let me come and stay with you sometimes when he is away will you not a time honoured custom has ordained that only one reply shall be made to an appeal of this kind and elizabeth duly assured her friend that it should make no difference feeling indeed that as she had asked for an explanation she could not resent miss crawford's frankness nor could she like the high spirited girl less for the glimpse she had given of her heart there was no denying however that the end of their conversation had been a good deal of a disappointment mary's confession had been so much more than elizabeth had ventured to hope for that it was melancholy to realize that it came as she herself had said too late too late for colonel fitzwilliam to be in any way the gainer by it many times during the day and the succeeding ones did elizabeth turn over in her mind a series of plans to bring her two friends together again in some way entirely unforeseen by both but all had to be discarded for miss crawford had been so decisive and it was not certain that the colonel would make any better use of his chances unless he could be warned of how he had failed previously the more elizabeth pondered over the events of last year in the new light now thrown upon them the better she was able to understand mary's point of view and to comprehend that it was not solely lady catherine's insulting behaviour or her cousin's want of self confidence or mary's own pride and recklessness but something of all three that had ruined their prospects of happiness and she mourned sincerely over the wreck and the impossibility of restoring it while they were so obstinately resolved to remain strangers to one another if only fitzwilliam had known when in london that the prize lay so near his hand that he had gained mary's love almost without trying to do so merely by watching and waiting and not submitting to the rebuff she had given him at the end of their stay in bath but the opportunity had passed and he had lost more ground now than he might ever recover for elizabeth knew well that mary's resentment was the real obstacle his feelings were unaltered but hers she had striven perhaps with some measure of success to harden into indifference chapter xxiii colonel fitzwilliam wrote that he intended staying in leicestershire for christmas and going to london for the first fortnight of january elizabeth did not fail to make this information public and accordingly when the question of their two guests' departure was again broached miss crawford was more easily persuaded to prolong their visit and her sister approved of whatever she chose to do elizabeth had not thought it right to speak to mrs grant about her conversation with mary but that lady had opened the subject herself by expressing to mrs darcy her great relief that the affair with colonel fitzwilliam had gone off and attributing mary's illness to fretting and disappointment mrs grant blamed no one except the elliots who she asserted had persistently stood between mary and her other friends but she lamented the whole series of mishaps for it was evident that no one else had ever gained such a large measure of her sister's regard and now her whole endeavour seemed to be to banish him from her thoughts mary meantime was recovering health and vigour and the colour came back to her cheeks and the light to her eyes in a manner very gratifying to her friends to observe had elizabeth not been so much occupied with plans for her visitors and preparations for christmas she could not have failed to note the contrast between miss crawford and georgiana for the younger girl grew paler and graver and seemed more and more spiritless in comparison with mary's gay moods georgiana made great efforts to throw herself into what was going on and was persuaded that she smiled and talked as much as ever while she took part in the hospitalities of pemberley but in reality the weight on her mind her preoccupation with the thought of two people who were suffering through her fault prevented her from always knowing when she was silent she constantly pictured kitty grieving in solitude over the downfall of the hopes of many months and wearied her mind with fruitless speculations as to how they could have acted differently in order to have averted the blow no one could possibly have foreseen that mr price would care for her and not for kitty else the latter's friends might have persuaded her to try and like mr morland whose courtship had been under equally auspicious circumstances but then georgiana reflected with a thrill who could think of a morland when they had been better attracted by a price she was glad to be able to pay that tribute to her friend's good taste and if the affair had not been checked in its early stages it must have gone on in the way it had until the gentleman spoke and poor kitty's fate was sealed tears rose to georgiana's eyes as she recalled her interview with william price and the feeling of anger and despair that had come over her at the prospect of everything being so utterly wrong and then thrown into such confusion and since then the indignation on kitty's behalf which had overwhelmed her at first had softened into pity and shared a place in her heart equally with regret for mr price for his disappointment as sudden and as complete as kitty's and far more bewildering he would never perhaps fully understand how it came about nor fully allow for its causes and for the obstacle which had necessitated his being refused chilled and repulsed he would think her insensible unkind he would believe that she did not care for him and did not want to care what a wonder if his feelings towards her underwent a change what more probable than that now when she had learnt that his esteem was the only thing necessary to her happiness and earnestly wished he could know that she no longer blamed him he had resolved to think of her no more owing to a slight indisposition of mrs bingley's the desborough party had not come over to pemberley at christmas as was their custom but they arrived on new year's eve to spend two or three days georgiana looked forward rather nervously to the meeting with kitty for the latter had only written occasional notes to her and elizabeth in a constrained style since the departure in november and georgiana dreaded equally any reopening of the subject in words or any coldness between them combined with the unforgiving reproaches which kitty knew so well how to convey by look and manner it seemed however when they arrived that kitty was not going to adopt either attitude precisely she looked very thin and jane told her sister that she had not been eating or sleeping well but she chatted as vigorously as ever and was in restless excitable spirits she could not sit long to anything and when not flying about the house or playing with the children was constantly running down to the rectory on the plea of wanting to see mrs ferrars's new baby who had made its appearance in the world a few days before georgiana found that any private talk was out of the question and did not seem to be desired by kitty whose principal topic of conversation was after the loveliness of the baby the charms of her newest friend a certain mrs henry tilney sister of mr morland who had been staying with him for some weeks this young lady was about kitty's age but had been married for several years and had brought one of her children with her a little girl about the age of the bingleys' second boy and there had evidently been a great deal of intercourse between the park and the rectory mrs tilney was reported by jane and her husband to be a very pleasing gentle and amiable woman and kitty's enthusiasm over her knew no bounds elizabeth had met mrs tilney and was pleased to hear of her again as she would have been to hear of anyone connected with mr morland and lady portinscale and the subject offered material for frequent conversation among the whole party as mrs grant and miss crawford had an interest in it also through their acquaintanceship with the young clergyman in bath georgiana could not help glancing at kitty occasionally when his name was mentioned and noticed that the slight embarrassment kitty displayed at first soon wore off there had evidently been a good many visitors at desborough during the past month bingley had had another shooting party and there had been evenings of music and even a small dance at the house of a neighbour kitty spoke of these things as if the retrospect were one of great enjoyment and morland was so often referred to as to lead to the supposition that their constant meetings were fraught with no discomfort on either side but you have not told all our gaieties kitty said bingley as they stood round the drawing room fire one morning after breakfast did you know elizabeth that we went to see the amateur theatricals at ashbourne the officers got them up among themselves and invited everybody it was quite a spectacle and they gave us supper afterwards in that fine great mess room i never saw anything better done yes we had an invitation i was sorry not to go to it but it is too far said elizabeth i heard the performance was very good of course you would have been asked you ought to have gone for it was well worth seeing our little charades were quite put in the shade kitty can give you all information about it for she had a splendid young officer sitting by her to tell her who everybody was it was only mr cathcart he knew colonel forster once and wanted to hear about lydia said kitty colouring and becoming deeply interested in the pattern of her lace handkerchief and the one who escorted you to supper was not mr cathcart he was somebody even more gorgeous and equally delightful a field marshal at least i should think continued her brother in law in bantering tones altogether kitty did very well that evening i expected jane would have had half the regiment coming up to her before it was over to ask leave to call nonsense bingley said kitty in some confusion getting up and going to help mary crawford who was sorting her music you are making too much of it there was no reason why mr macdonald should not call if he wished to bingley laughed and proceeded to give so lively a description of the theatricals that kitty could not help coming back and joining in with sparkling eyes and every sign of pleasure in the reminiscence georgiana watched her in some surprise for nothing could be more unlike the broken hearted kitty who had gone away six weeks before bingley forbore to tease her any longer but finding himself alone with elizabeth and georgiana later in the morning he began at once i think neither of you need be under any more apprehension about kitty she was certainly very low spirited when she came to us and i was afraid that young sailor's departure had had a devastating effect but she has brightened up wonderfully and managed to enjoy herself again just as a girl ought i am very glad said elizabeth i knew she had taken it a good deal to heart at the time but fresh interests will put fresh life into her exactly there is no use in a pretty young woman like that moping about a fellow who does not care for her the best way to forget him is to amuse herself with others and i feel myself partly responsible for encouraging that young price so jane and i have done our best to distract her thoughts those officers are as pleasant a set of fellows as ever stepped and kitty by no means disliked them but unfortunately the regiment is just moving on and the next one does not come till march i have asked bertram down again at the end of the month for some hunting kitty and he seemed to get on well and we thought him a capital fellow did you not very agreeable indeed said elizabeth in a tone of calmer praise adding and i have no doubt he is an excellent young man though in spite of all i should be inclined to adhere to kitty's first preference to his cousin mr price's manners had more to recommend them i thought georgiana's heart bounded and she turned away her face to hide her rising colour as bingley responded ah yes elizabeth you are right in spite of all as you say price is the man we should have liked for her there is a sterling character i do believe it would have done most of us good to have to begin early and make our own fortunes as that youth has done and we should not be all so frank and modest at his age i'll wager yes i should be only too glad to get him back but it is out of the question i had a letter from him last week from copenhagen they expect to be cruising about in the north sea for another month or two then he will probably have to go to some distant station georgiana had turned now to look at bingley her complexion changing from red to pale she was grateful to elizabeth for keeping the conversation going by some slight remark for she could not have spoken yes continued bingley we think it a great drawback to a sailor's life that he should have to be abroad so much and away from his friends but cruises now are not as long as they used to be and when a man has as much spirit as price he is glad to be on the move to show authorities the stuff he is made of price is commander on his present ship you know the first since his promotion the entrance of jane caused bingley to break off and georgiana waited a little in the hope that he had more to say on a subject of such an absorbing nature but unfortunately it was mr bertram not mr price to whom he reverted calling upon jane to confirm his expectations of the former's visit and georgiana slipped out of the room as jane began to tell elizabeth how she had succeeded in obtaining mr bennet's permission to keep kitty until easter georgiana needed to think over what she had heard even though the pain to herself became more intense in proportion as she gloried in the approval expressed of william price by her friends to hear him praised to know him appreciated was sweet to her but how bitter by contrast was the knowledge that she had sacrificed his happiness and her own in vain that kitty had so soon forgotten him as to be able to flirt with officers and was ready to accept as a compensation for the loss of william price the attentions of any young men bingley could collect around her georgiana could scarcely believe that the devotion of half a year could have died a natural death in so short a time she might almost have thought that kitty was feigning indifference in order to conceal her chagrin but from experience of kitty's nature she knew that her friend was incapable of acting a sustained part and that if she appeared to enjoy balls and flirtations it was because they had for her as much zest as ever georgiana might wonder but she had no inclination to blame kitty for any sign of inconsistency it was undoubtedly much better for kitty to get over her infatuation for william price if she could succeed in doing so but the consequences to georgiana were far more grave and she suffered the more for realizing that kitty had not after all so greatly valued the thing she had sought after the object which had become more and more precious to georgiana than anything in the world her effort to defend kitty to william her refusal to accept his devotion for herself all had been wasted fruitless unnecessary not that she would for one moment desire to withdraw the act of loyalty towards her friend but with heart breaking regrets did she review the whole sequence of events which had so cruelly and inevitably separated william price and herself was it she thought a just punishment for one who had made two such grievous mistakes previously that she should now be accorded too late a glimpse of a happiness that would have transformed her whole life bingley's casual mention of his movements had reminded her forcibly how improbable it was that they should ever meet again she had borne up bravely until then but that night when alone she could not help giving way to an access of grief severer than any she had known before and only a dread of arousing comment enabled her to assume an air of tolerable serenity when she appeared in the morning it happened that jane while admiring a new dress which georgiana was wearing was struck with the want of animation in the young girl's face and her usual kindness prompted her to inquire solicitously how she did georgiana would confess to no ailment but a slight cold which she had had for a week and been unable to throw off and tried to make light of it when jane appealed to elizabeth to suggest what might be done to re establish her health elizabeth felt a real concern as she looked closely at her young sister and reproached herself for having neglected to give her proper care no no indeed elizabeth it is not so protested georgiana i am perfectly well a cold always makes one feel stupid and this mild damp weather is disagreeable coming after those early frosts come and stay with us for two or three weeks said jane affectionately the change will do you good and bingley and i shall be happy to have you your last visit was an unreasonably short one georgiana gratefully but decidedly declined the offer pleading various excuses but privately feeling that she would rather not be with kitty again just yet amid scenes connected inseparably with william price's presence i think she ought to have a change nevertheless said elizabeth and it is too long to wait till we go to bath in april would you not really care to go to desborough for a little georgiana and see if it does you good georgiana faltered out something of reluctance and jane smiling kindly at her went away to leave the sisters to discuss it together elizabeth drew the young girl to her and tenderly asked if there was anything the matter in which her help or advice would be acceptable and georgiana after a few moments' silent struggle recovered the self command which the proffer of sympathy had threatened to disturb and replied that she was sure she would be quite well directly and would rather not go away from home until she went with the others you are sure there is nowhere you would like to go if not desborough asked elizabeth pondering the hursts would be delighted i know but you have been there lately what a pity mrs annesley has gone abroad georgiana only shook her head at these suggestions and suddenly elizabeth exclaimed i have thought of something mrs wentworth's invitation you remember that she asked you in the letter i had from her with reference to her father and miss crawford you thought at the time that you might like to accept it some day the idea seemed to interest georgiana more than the others she raised her head from elizabeth's shoulder and said i remember it was a very kind message the wentworths live at winchester do they not yes and anne wentworth is so good hearted so thoroughly sincere that i know she would like to be taken at her word and to have you propose yourself as a visitor what do you think of it georgiana i think you might be very happy with such kind people and the change of air and surroundings would be complete it seems a very long way off i know but you could be taken to london in the carriage with the two servants as last year and captain wentworth would doubtless be able to meet you there for he makes that journey constantly your brother and i would come and fetch you any time after miss crawford goes as soon as you wish to come away elizabeth rose and went to her writing table to find mrs wentworth's letter and to show georgiana the message once more the cordiality which it expressed could not be doubted and georgiana began to feel that if she could ever find pleasure in anything again it might be in the quiet companionship of such friends as captain and mrs wentworth she had been greatly attracted by mrs wentworth and she had sufficient good sense to know that it would be advantageous to her to have an entire change of environment to be away for a time from pemberley and its associations it would revive her courage and help her to appreciate the many blessings that life still held for her georgiana was not too young not to believe that her troubles were past mending but she was also too reasonable deliberately to nurse her unhappiness she accordingly allowed elizabeth to write and propose the scheme and had grown so much accustomed to the idea as to be pleased when an answer arrived in the form of a joint letter from the wentworths warmly welcoming her to join their house with every intimation of the delight it would afford them and suggesting the last week in january as the date for her journey to london where her host would meet her and convey her straight to winchester a distance of sixty five miles the arrangement was generally approved darcy and elizabeth regretted losing their sister even for a time but they hoped it would be beneficial to her and they could perceive that it fell in with her inclinations there was no lack of escort for mrs grant and miss crawford who were now talking of going in earnest were anxious to alter their plans and travel to bath round by london for the pleasure of her company but darcy would not permit this as he had resolved on taking his sister himself and elizabeth induced them to remain with her until his return chapter xxiv january was passing the weather was remarkably mild and open for the time of year and the hunting men were rejoicing in their opportunities the ladies were able to take their daily walks and drives in which mrs ferrars's sister mrs brandon a very lovely and amiable woman who had come to watch over her sister's convalescence was often invited to join them mrs jennings had returned to london earlier in the month sorely disappointed after such a promising beginning at not having seen the successful termination of even one love affair during her stay none of the family at pemberley had ever understood what part she played in the catastrophe of november except that she had shared in the general error made by kitty's friends nor were they aware of the destiny she had marked out for georgiana but elinor when she realized that something had gone seriously wrong in consequence of the ball had no difficulty in persuading the really good natured old lady to confine her lamentations conjectures and comments to the ears of the rectory inhabitants only this end was the more easily attained since after kitty's departure there was no one to keep her supplied with information when however that young lady returned in apparently good spirits mrs jennings was immeasurably delighted and quite entered into her willingness to talk of cathcart and macdonald and indeed anyone and anything but william price and mrs jennings had only to hear that mr bertram was coming to stay at desborough again and not at pemberley to be ready to console kitty with a number of entirely new and revised prognostications as to the object of his visit the party at pemberley were sitting together one evening after dinner it was about eight o'clock and they had all settled to their customary occupations darcy and his wife were reading mrs grant working and georgiana was at the instrument playing short snatches of music while mary crawford sat close beside her and asked for one and another of her favourite pieces peace and tranquility reigned and seemed as little likely to be interrupted as on many previous evenings that had been similarly spent the sudden sound of carriage wheels therefore and the rapid trot of horses startled everyone and alarmed one at least for elizabeth's first apprehension was that colonel fitzwilliam had returned unexpectedly georgiana ceased playing and all listened anxiously but the suspense lasted for the shortest possible time required by a visitor to get into the house and on the door being flung open darcy had scarcely risen from his chair before tom bertram followed his name into the room with quick steps tom bertram had acted on many stages but in none of the parts he had ever played had he made so sensational an entrance the amazement of the inmates of the room on beholding him the dismay of mrs grant and her sister his own disconcerted surprise at seeing who were mrs darcy's guests all tended to make the first minute one of extreme embarrassment and it was only the knowledge of his urgency of his errand that enabled him to recover himself sooner than any of the others advancing to mr and mrs darcy he greeted them both bowed to mrs grant and to the corner of the room where mary was shrinking out of sight behind georgiana and at once began speaking very quickly to the master of the house mr darcy i fear i have startled i hope not frightened you all by intruding at this late hour but when you know how pressing is the need you will dispense with apologies i grieve very much to say to say i am the bearer of bad news but believing that you ought to know i constituted myself the messenger your cousin colonel fitzwilliam has met with an accident whilst out hunting to day i regret exceedingly to tell you but his state is considered serious and his friends thought it would be advisable for you to come fitzwilliam fitzwilliam hurt good god what is this exclaimed darcy completely roused out of his usual calm how did it happen tell us all about it i will go to him instantly ringing the bell in god's name bertram say he is still living where is he how long will it take to get to him elizabeth though dreadfully shocked and distressed had the wisdom to send another servant for refreshments for mr bertram while darcy ordered his own things to be packed and his travelling carriage be brought round and in the slight bustle caused by these arrangements mrs grant and georgiana were able almost unobserved to attend to mary who had not actually fainted but had sunk down on a low couch scarcely knowing what she did her sister and georgiana supported her in between them placed her in a more easy position rubbed her hands and shielded her from the light and mary with a very great effort collected herself sufficiently to listen to the details which mr bertram was hurriedly giving in answer to mr and mrs darcy's inquiries it appeared that colonel fitzwilliam had only just returned from london and this was his first day out for some time the fox had got well away and the hunt were in the midst of a fine run when the colonel's horse came down with him at a blind fence bertram paused here to give more particulars than his impatient hearers desired about the height and width of the fence and the exact manner in which the horse had approached it for it seemed that he himself had been riding near at the time and had witnessed the accident the colonel was pinned under the animal and was taken out unconscious with a broken leg and it was feared some grave injury to the spine fortunately the house of the friend with whom he was staying was not far off and he was borne thither and the services of the apothecary were promptly obtained but the only opinion he could form was very grave and pending the arrival of a more experienced surgeon who had been sent for from leicester no one could tell what an hour might bring forth the ladies were sick with horror mrs grant was weeping silently and georgiana as she held mary's cold hand felt that this was indeed the last and crowning sorrow for poor cousin robert to die without knowing the happiness that ought to have been his the pulse is so very weak i think they fear a collapse of the whole system even if he does recover consciousness said bertram in too low a tone to be heard by those at the other end of the room they were trying stimulants of various kinds when i came away elizabeth's face was hidden darcy was too much overwhelmed to speak for some moments till with a sudden start of recollection he exclaimed and you bertram how came you to be there and how come you are here now bertram with a return to something of his nonchalant manner explained that he too had been staying in the same neighbourhood with a friend who was in fact the master of that pack of hounds and with whom he often spent a few days in the hunting season as it was little over twenty miles from his own house mansfield park i had been talking to colonel fitzwilliam during the morning he continued and helped to carry him back to ashley's place and when ashley said his relations ought to know i decided at once to come with the news i only delayed to change my clothes and have the chaise got ready for i knew time was an object and i could get over the ground quicker than anyone else they could send i am sure we are deeply indebted to you bertram said darcy grasping him warmly by the hand while elizabeth joined him in expressing the sincerest gratitude you could not have done us a greater service and it is one we shall never forget it was an impulse of true goodness and unselfishness that prompted you to ride straight to us disregarding your own fatigue and inconvenience few men would have done as much bertram disclaimed and as georgiana came forward to add her thanks to those of the others he bowed to her with gallantry assuring her that fatigue was nothing if he could be of use to friends whom he so greatly esteemed and he only wished that he could have brought news to relieve anxiety instead of creating it by this time word was brought that the more substantial meal which had been ordered for mr bertram was ready in the dining room and darcy escorted him thither to attend to his wants and to obtain the particulars as to his journey from leicestershire the distance was forty five miles and darcy proposed to start within half an hour and reach his destination some time during the night but he pressed his visitor to stay at least until the next day and if he would to rest himself and his horses their peaceful evening had been turned into confusion and wretchedness the quiet circle in the drawing room was broken up and mrs grant fearing greatly for her sister was thankful to lead her to her own room there to recover as best she might from the frightful shock of tom bertram's news darcy soon went upstairs to prepare for his journey and his wife busied herself with helping him and with placing in his luggage any article she could think of that might conduce to the sick man's comfort while a maze of thoughts occupied her mind chilling fear apprehension and dread of what might be happening to the loved friend at such a distance and anxiety on account of miss crawford whose trembling and distressed condition had not escaped her a few minutes later georgiana came to her door showing traces of tears but quite calm and begging to be made useful elizabeth was just then giving some directions to the maid so georgiana waited until they were done and then coming close to her sister she said elizabeth do you think we could do anything for miss crawford i went to wish her good night and she tried to smile and say something sympathizing but could hardly utter the words i am sure she is terribly concerned about all this she almost looks like a different person so pale and stricken do you think she can possibly be caring for cousin robert all the time and not know it till now oh dear elizabeth is it not dreadful to think it may be too late elizabeth gazed at her sister listening intently and pondering all georgiana said true indeed that it would be a dreadful thing to contemplate if mary really loved fitzwilliam and the knowledge came too late to do good to either and even if mary knew her own heart at last was it not too late when pride sealed her lips and fitzwilliam was lying near to death forty miles away perhaps never more able to see her or hear her elizabeth experienced a momentary feeling of despair the powers ranged against her seemed almost too strong to be attacked but rallying her forces and putting in the front of her mind the one hopeful thought that fitzwilliam might live till darcy reached him or longer she said to georgiana i think i shall try i will ask her to send him a message if it is as we think it will be better than nothing even if he is only just able to understand it oh yes yes exclaimed georgiana clasping her hands in intense eagerness do ask her dear elizabeth she will surely tell you and my brother will tell him whatever happens she will be glad to think she has done it do ask her do not lose a minute there is so little time voices were heard in the corridor darcy was speaking to the servants who were carrying out his luggage elizabeth hesitated no longer pausing only to say dear georgiana would you mind going to sit with mr bertram i am afraid it may be tiresome for you to entertain a stranger just now but he is alone and it would be only a kind attention after what he has done for us and to receive georgiana's assent before going swiftly to miss crawford's room she found that georgiana's description had been all too accurate miss crawford had not wept but her expression of hopeless misery sent a pang through elizabeth's heart she had sent her sister away and had been sitting on her bed too stunned for action almost for thought and she made no resistance when elizabeth placed her on the couch sat beside her and taking both her hands began to plead with her quickly and simply without premeditation dear miss crawford i have come to ask you to do something for my poor cousin something which only you can do you heard what mr bertram said of his dangerous state and it distressed you as much as us i know i would not for a moment seek to pry into your inmost feelings but we are come to matters of life and death and it is on his account that i do venture to ask you if you feel that you could listen to him if he were here then will you send him a word a message something to show that you are thinking of him mary replied after a minute or two in a stifled voice i would send him such a message but do you think he would care to have it i do indeed most truly i understand your hesitation you think you cannot speak of love to him when he has not spoken to you but i would stake my life on his devotion and faithfulness the words you send him will bring comfort and peace of mind whatever the issue mary shuddered and withdrew her trembling hands mr bertram seems to think he will die we cannot tell he is a strong man and had not had the best advice when mr bertram was there we can only hope and my husband is starting almost immediately and will carry any message you feel able to send trusting that he will be in time to deliver it oh yes yes exclaimed mary rising and walking restlessly about the room he is so good and generous that if he still cares he would overlook all he would pardon the errors and foolishness that have led to this misunderstanding but the past mrs darcy does he know and forgive that i wish i could tell seeing mr bertram brings it all back again my brother his sister the divorce what lady catherine heard the world believes you know and just when one repents it all most it comes back just like a spectre to haunt one elizabeth replied very earnestly at such a time as this it would be cruel to mislead you and i only say what i sincerely believe that colonel fitzwilliam knows everything to which you refer and it makes not the smallest difference to him it would not you should be aware to any man whose love was worthy of the name that should not weigh with you for a moment the only thing that signifies in the least is whether you can return that love the only barrier between you is being unable to return it i would not urge you against your will or take advantage of a moment of strong emotion you alone know whether it would make you happier to send a word of hope to him happier ah i do not know said mary sorrowfully i do not seem able to think of happiness and yet i should be glad for him to know since you think he still cares to know and it is all i can now do for him you need not be afraid of my not trusting my feelings mrs darcy this has shown me all too late what they really are though my folly and obstinacy have blinded me all these months we will not say too late dear miss crawford said elizabeth going up to where miss crawford was standing by the mantelshelf leaning her head on her arm we do not know that it is too late and i believe that it will be an immense comfort to you to take this one step explanations can come after i am not afraid of colonel fitzwilliam being unable to clear away all doubts and fears when he is able to speak for himself again there was a moment's pause and elizabeth continued i must not stay now mr darcy is so impatient to be off but i will be back to you will you tell me what i may say so little will suffice or would you rather write it mary shook her head still keeping her face hidden and said in a barely audible voice ask mr darcy if he will be so kind explain things to him how you like but say i send colonel fitzwilliam my my love that i beg his forgiveness and that i hope he will soon be able to come home to me elizabeth just caught the last words waited to assure herself there was no more and pressing mary's hand went quietly out of the room though much moved by their interview the exigencies of the moment demanded that she should quickly recover her composure and brace herself for the parting with her husband there would be time all too much time for thought when the moment of action was over there would be hours of suspense to be borne and another sufferer to console as she came out upon the gallery she heard persons talking and moving in the hall below and distinguished her husband's voice saying i ought to be with him soon after one o'clock words which revived her courage and she descended to find darcy georgiana and mr bertram standing by the hearth darcy completely equipped for his journey and the servants waiting by the front door georgiana who had been enduring keen anxiety during elizabeth's absence and had been exerting herself to keep the gentlemen occupied in eating and talking so that elizabeth might not be interrupted too soon by darcy's haste to depart gave her a nervous glance which was tempered by relief when she saw her sister draw darcy into the library for a few parting words she could scarcely attend to mr bertram's amiable chatter or reply to his inquiries for mr and mrs bingley and the other friends he had met on his previous visit for picturing in her mind what was going on in the library and trying to decide whether elizabeth had been successful in her mission at last the door opened they reappeared darcy was grave but georgiana thought his brow had somewhat lightened since he went in and elizabeth gave her a bright and reassuring look there was no time for more and the carriage was already waiting the farewells were quickly spoken and in another moment darcy had passed out and was gone chapter xxv to elizabeth and georgiana the events of the evening seemed like a dreadful dream less than an hour ago they had been sitting at their occupations as tranquil and secure as if disaster did not exist and now the bolt had fallen scattering them and bringing to each its message of terror and dismay georgiana felt as if it would be the hardest matter in the world to settle to any pretence of the ordinary life again until news reached them from her brother she longed to be able to be alone to think it all over quietly or to go to elizabeth to hear the result of her appeal to miss crawford and instead she was obliged to establish herself in the drawing room with mr bertram who showed no sign of wishing to go to bed but was evidently prepared to sit up talking and drinking tea until midnight georgiana took out her embroidery frame and prepared to be as agreeable a listener as she could for she expected elizabeth who had gone to miss crawford would come back at any minute and she really felt more than a common measure of gratitude to mr bertram for the service he had rendered them this gratitude she again endeavoured to express when mr bertram began discussing the heavy state of the roads and the consequent delays to which darcy might be subjected pray do not name it miss darcy as i said i am only too glad to have been of the slightest assistance it was a mere chance that i was there for i should have returned home this week but the open weather tempted me to stay on for a day or two longer it was indeed fortunate for us for we should have had no information until to morrow if we had had to wait for a letter tom bertram repeated that he was very glad looking into the fire in an absent minded way that georgiana scarcely noticed so absorbed was she in her thoughts she paid but little more attention when he suddenly rose stationed himself with his back to the fire and a little nearer her and began to speak apparently on the same topic for in the first few minutes she could only gather an impression of his sharing in the events following the accident his telling mr ashley that he was a friend of colonel fitzwilliam's and knew all his relatives and would be the fittest person to bear the news to them of mr ashley's heartily agreeing and of his haste to get home and order his carriage and start the narrative went on georgiana hearing very little after leicestershire was left behind for her thoughts had lingered with the poor sufferer there when with a start she became aware that all this was directed at her that mr bertram was trying to explain that he had welcomed the opportunity of hurrying to pemberley because it would doing her and her family a service than which he could have no greater satisfaction and because it would afford him the privilege of being in her presence once more georgiana amazed and horrified endeavoured to stop him but tom was not to be prevented from making a speech which he had been rehearsing for at least four hours on his journey some words which fell from her lips an appeal to have some respect for this sad occasion which she had snatched at as the argument most likely to move him were of no avail that he could address her at such a time he immediately pointed out to be a proof of his ardour which merited pardon by reason of its unquenchable nature for he had intended he explained to wait until he came to desborough at the end of the month and then to have sought an interview but his impatience to throw himself at her feet and declare his passion would brook no delay nothing could have been more distasteful to georgiana than such sentiments to hear the words admiration and devotion uttered by mr bertram was not only an outrage upon the present hour occupied as it was with the gravest solicitude for the life of a friend but also upon the past when similar words had been spoken to her by william price from no one else could she bear to hear them coming from his cousin she could almost have called them an insult of course he could not know that but it almost seemed like trading upon having placed them under an obligation to him that he should presume to speak in a manner so repugnant to her too vexed to choose her words when mr bertram stopped for breath having brought his peroration to a close by an offer in correct form of his hand and heart she replied coldly that she was much honoured by his proposals but it was entirely out of her power to accept them bertram had not expected a favourable reply on the instant but he had hardly expected so decisive an unfavorable one he stepped forward with outstretched hands and an eager but miss darcy to which her only response was to move haughtily away and at that moment to the relief of the lady and the chagrin of the gentleman elizabeth entered the room only the good manners habitual to both could have helped them to carry off the situation tom bertram checked in one of his flights of eloquence descended to earth again with an observation on the weather and for the next few minutes the temperature and the prospects of rain were debated with great earnestness elizabeth could hardly have failed to guess what kind of interview she had interrupted and out of compassion to georgiana she soon recommended her to go to bed the young girl needed no second bidding bertram opened the door to her with great ceremony which was acknowledged by the slightest of bows and she gladly sought the shelter of her room astonished to find that it was not more than half past nine o'clock could it be possible that it was barely two hours since mr bertram's arrival would this interminable evening with its shocks surprises and disturbances and yet more surprises ever draw to a close georgiana was so unnerved that she sat down and shed a few tears but a few only for with such a real grief ever present she could not spare much consideration for mr bertram's unwelcome attack it had been bewildering and annoying but she was not going to worry about it he had acted on some silly impulse and could not possibly be serious he scarcely knew her a week's acquaintance and he talked of heartfelt devotion and expected her to be ready to listen to such nonsense she could not conceive what had actuated him and resented greatly that merely because he was heir to a title and fortune and had ridden forty five miles in a great hurry he should suppose himself to be an acceptable suitor some expressions he had used showing that he was confident of having the approval of her family roused her special indignation if only she had not so unluckily been alone with him if mrs grant had not gone upstairs mrs grant georgiana started violently for until that moment she had completely forgotten the association of mr bertram with their two guests she had supposed mary's agitation to be caused merely by the news of colonel fitzwilliam and now perceived that the sight of the messenger must have been painful enough apart from all else what miserable complications had resulted from the fact that it should have been tom bertram of all their acquaintance who had happened to be hunting with the belvoir hounds that day but she could not wish his deed of kindness undone nor she believed could miss crawford or anyone else whatever the present inconvenience to themselves for everything was unimportant compared with what his coming had effected and now it would not matter if only he would go away again immediately georgiana sat meditating schemes by which she mary and mrs grant might all avoid seeing him again when a knock at her door was followed by the entrance of elizabeth yes georgiana elizabeth said smiling in response to the girl's shy glance mr bertram has made me his confidante i am sorry if you were upset my dear he seems to be afraid it was something of a surprise to you but he hopes you will take time and do him the honour of thinking it over oh no no elizabeth georgiana burst out her cheeks crimsoning i do not want time i shall not think it over i do not care for mr bertram in the least and i never shall please tell him to go away and forget all about it why my dear this is very determined he began in the wrong way i think and certainly at the wrong time but he is very anxious to be allowed to come back and set about his wooing more gradually i told him i thought you were quite unaware of his feelings so i was but i do not want to hear about them said georgiana more quietly for she was beginning to be a little ashamed of her anger i am very much obliged to mr bertram i know it is very kind of him and everything but i cannot possibly marry him are you sure it is entirely out of the question asked elizabeth you were a little startled perhaps it is true we have not seen much of him but he is very agreeable and his position is unexceptionable above all he bears a high character as far as we know and has a good heart as his action of to day proves his cousin mr price spoke very warmly of him unless you are quite certain i think your brother would like you to give the matter due consideration as at any other time than this you might feel more in a mood for such subjects pray pray elizabeth exclaimed georgiana nervously do not ask me even if we were not in trouble to day as we are it would make no difference i am sure mr bertram is excellent and amiable but i do not i cannot i hope fitzwilliam will not be angry but i dislike the idea so very much if that is so my dear georgiana you shall not be tormented about it any more i do not know if i am glad or sorry it has all happened so quickly but it is right that you should judge for yourself mr bertram will be greatly disappointed still that cannot be helped i suppose i am to be deputed to get rid of the poor man if you would be so very kind elizabeth well i must break it to him early to morrow morning since i really think we have had agitations enough for one evening in any case i should have had to ask him to cut his visit short for from what i have heard i do not think that miss crawford would care to see him again no no indeed that must be prevented if possible and now do tell me for i have been longing for an opportunity to ask you what was the result of your conversation if i may be allowed to hear it elizabeth related briefly what had passed between them and told how her husband could scarcely believe at first that miss crawford had yielded and had voluntarily sent the message that he was asked to deliver but on being convinced of her sincerity he willingly promised that if his cousin's state permitted it he would convey to him the words of hope and comfort and would endeavour to make anything clear that fitzwilliam might not be able to understand of course we had so few minutes together said elizabeth and your brother had not thought of it all for so long he quite believed that all was over between them he did not even know that she had owned to caring for him once it was difficult for him to realize that she always had cared though he did not need me to tell him what happiness it would be to poor robert to know it if he reached him in time i am so glad so very glad cried georgiana the tears of joy standing in her eyes it is as it should be my brother will see it all plainly when he thinks it over poor miss crawford how she must have suffered she did not realize it herself i suppose and that was why she would not meet him again i do not quite understand how it all happened but it does not signify now if he lives nothing need keep them apart and at all events he will have her message nothing will make me believe that it is too late for that this naturally led them back to a discussion of the accident the condition of the victim and all the chances and possibilities of the case which could not be gone over often enough elizabeth at last prepared to leave the room as the hour was late but struck by a passing recollection she looked back from the door to say with a smile i must tell you georgiana that your attitude has surprised me more than mr bertram's lately when you have been looking so pale and unlike yourself it has occurred to me that there must be some person of whom you were thinking a great deal with a disturbing effect and i confess that when i interrupted you and mr bertram this evening it crossed my mind that he might be that person elizabeth how could you think such a thing exclaimed georgiana turning away blushing and confused and thankful that elizabeth had not directly asked her whether any such person was in existence chapter xxvi the disconsolate mr bertram duly took his leave the following morning having seen no one besides mrs darcy and mrs grant but a brief interview with the former had convinced him of the futility of any second application to her sister in law he was quite unable to account for his rebuff and his vexation combined with the awkwardness that he felt in mrs grant's presence made their party round the breakfast table an exceedingly uncomfortable one tom bertram was possessed of a great deal more conscience than mr yates and could never have used miss crawford's name as freely as that gentleman had done moreover he was quite conscious that his own family deserved a share of the blame for the esclandre which was usually borne by the two chief culprits consequently a meeting with any of the crawfords was quite as unwelcome to him as to them and he was greatly relieved when after an exchange of formal civilities he could betake himself to his carriage and give directions to be conveyed to desborough park to be sure he was antedating his visit there by ten or twelve days but he knew that he would be welcomed by the hospitable bingleys and they would all be eager to hear the shocking news the ladies at pemberley passed the next few hours in the deepest anxiety and suspense they tried to talk of other things but they could think of little but the one subject georgiana would have forgotten mr bertram as soon as he was out of the house for she could not believe his regard for her to be very genuine or his wound very deep but that she so dreaded the disapprobation of her brother when he should come to hear of what had happened even elizabeth would not have been surprised if she had wished to accept him it was mortifying in a way though a relief in another that no one ever supposed it was possible that mr price could have cared for her darcy had promised to send off an express letter as early as he could and a servant had gone to the neighbouring town to meet it and so avoid delay dinner was just over a meal which they could only make a pretence of eating when the butler entered and they saw that he had brought the longed for dispatch it was taken to mrs darcy and she lost not a moment in communicating its contents the news was not what they had dreaded indeed the account was as good as could be expected darcy found his cousin's condition to be grave but not hopeless for colonel fitzwilliam had recovered consciousness before his arrival he was not permitted to talk but was able to understand what was said to him the surgeon had enjoined perfect quiet and though at present he could scarcely diagnose all the injuries he believed that the head had escaped the danger was not over but the patient's good constitution would help him materially and the fact that he was enduring severe pain was not considered to be an altogether unfavorable symptom the report was in general an intense relief though anxiety still prevailed and deep compassion and concern must still possess those who listened still it was much to be thankful for on reflection it seemed to be the best they could have hoped georgiana remained with mrs grant talking it over while elizabeth drew miss crawford into her boudoir and said i know you will like to hear the rest of my husband's letter it is meant for you only he writes 'as soon as i was allowed to speak to fitzwilliam and had ascertained that he was comfortable as he could be made i told him what you desired me to say respecting miss crawford's presence in our house and the confidence she made to you it seemed to be a great surprise to him and i feared would excite him too much but when i repeated her message in the exact words which you gave me i could perceive an immediate effect on him for good he seemed slow to believe it and murmured a few syllables about its being too great a happiness but after about half an hour he signed that he wished to speak to me again and whispered send her my love tell her that she has given me something to live for he was not able to say more and soon after fell asleep you must recollect that there is a great deal of fever and consequent weakness still he is decidedly not worse and i am more than half inclined to think that the stimulus his mind has received may help towards his recovery you know i am not given to conjecture but he is surprisingly ready to do everything he is told and anxious to think himself better if i am right the responsibility will be miss crawford's and it is one which i think she will not be unwilling to bear pray give her my warmest regards and tell her i hope the time is not far distant when we shall be happily reunited at pemberley' such a letter could not all at once be realized or recovered from mary crawford tried to utter some words of thanks but tears impeded her speech only when the joy burst upon her was she fully conscious of all the misery of the last few months the light served to make the darkness more visible looking back upon the mists of pride of resentfulness and misunderstanding from which she had emerged it seemed almost incredible for a time that she had reached the clearer air the sunshine of love and mutual comprehension she longed to turn to her kind friend to talk freely with her over all that had seemed puzzling and when after a very few anxious days better accounts from leicestershire began to come in and the gloom lifted they could venture to let their minds dwell on hopeful possibilities once more it was satisfactory that the whole situation was already known to the other members of their little party and that georgiana as well as mrs grant could freely offer the affection and sympathy of a sister mrs darcy said mary one day i am possessed with a curiosity to know which you think worst of me for my keeping colonel fitzwilliam at arm's length while in london or my confession of weakness the other day after the bold assertions i made when you spoke to me during our walk indeed i do not think ill of you for any of those things returned elizabeth they seem to me to have been most natural but what do i think was a little bit foolish was your allowing sir walter elliot to be so attentive that the world concluded you were engaged your friends ought to have warned you that it might deter persons you really esteemed from approaching you i was afraid you were going to say something about that exclaimed miss crawford holding her hands to her ears in mock dismay i quite expect that colonel fitzwilliam and i shall spend some hours in violent mutual recrimination when he arrives and that will be one of our subjects but seriously mrs darcy although i know now it was unpardonably foolish i was not conscious then of the comments that were being made our friendship with the elliots had quite another aspect for me other possibilities connected with my brother but that will not interest you i tolerated sir walter elliot but i never liked him and i never thought of him as having any serious intentions until a good natured friend mrs palmer called to congratulate me on my supposed engagement by the way she told me that her mother mrs jennings had meant to come by with her but had been prevented i did not know the worthy mrs jennings then but since i have met her i have felt thankful she was not present on that occasion it would have been rather overwhelming she must have been sorry to miss such an opportunity said elizabeth with a smile yes poor mrs jennings but congratulations on a thing that has not happened are rather difficult to receive at any time are they not from that moment i do assure you i got a horrid fright and determined to change my attitude towards sir walter elliot completely i must have been partly successful for it precipitated things to such an extent at all events the result was not agreeable it really was a wretched time and colonel fitzwilliam disappeared and no one knew where or why elizabeth had long realized that her cousin had not been the only sufferer in the past year and she knew that miss crawford's lively manner of talking was often assumed to hide deeper emotions she truly rejoiced that whatever fears and anxieties might have to be endured before the lovers met again nothing could shake the foundations of their happiness after about ten days darcy's letters made it clear that the danger was past and steady if slow progress might be looked for he was of course quite unable to visit and georgiana who had written to mrs wentworth to postpone her visit consulted elizabeth as to whether it would be better to abandon it altogether but elizabeth thought that it would be unnecessary to do so and also a pity for georgiana's sake and darcy on being applied to give his consent to her journeying to london with the escort of two servants as had been originally proposed the plan therefore was to stand a date was arranged with captain wentworth and on a cold windy evening of the second week in february mr darcy's carriage with mr darcy's sister drove up to the hotel in st james's street where her host was to meet her the said carriage was to return through leicestershire for it was hoped that in the course of the next few days colonel fitzwilliam might be well enough to be brought back in it to pemberley the inclement weather solitude and fatigue had sent georgiana's spirits down to a low ebb as she looked out at the wet streets and recalled her last visit to london under such very different circumstances it was impossible for her not to be thinking of william price and the occasion when they had been together there and wondering if he was in town at that minute she would have liked to know that he was even though it was so utterly improbable that they should meet since neither of them could know what the other's movements were such thoughts were bad companions for georgiana but the arrival of captain wentworth kind and cheerful as ever and with the heartiest of welcomes did much to disperse the gloom and he proved such an enlivening companion on the following day that when they reached winchester in time for a late dinner she did not feel as bad as if she had been travelling for so many hours to see mrs wentworth again was a keen pleasure the letters they had exchanged formed the groundwork of a more intimate friendship for despite anne's seniority in years their natures were thoroughly congenial and within a few hours georgiana felt completely at home in the charming little house not far from the cathedral which captain wentworth had purchased soon after his marriage she and her hostess were sitting together the first day of her visit exchanging inquiries after their mutual friends and georgiana was half hoping to hear some mention of william price's name as from what she had seen at mrs hurst's dinner party she judged that the wentworths knew him tolerably well yes mrs wentworth referred to that evening said that she had seen mrs hurst when last she was in town miss darcy had heard more lately probably did she remember the young officer captain price now who had been present on that occasion georgiana could reply in quite her ordinary manner that she had frequently seen mr price since and told of his visits to desborough and pemberley mrs wentworth listened with interest i am very glad you have seen something in him for i am sure you must all have liked him do you not she said but now what an odd creature he is never to have mentioned it to be sure i have not seen him since or he would probably have done so but hearing from a friend that he was in england again and knowing you had met i wrote to ask him to come and spend a few days here during your visit it was a great liberty i know dear miss darcy but he is a first favourite with captain wentworth and me and we thought it would have been pleasant for him to have come just now young people always amuse each other he has so little time on shore and up to last week i believed he was still abroad georgiana's heart beat as if it would suffocate her but she managed to return her friend's look and say in a steady voice yes it would have been very nice is captain price not able to come no most unfortunately not i am very sorry more so than ever now i know he has been to your part of the world but he writes to say he fears he ought not to come all sorts of regrets and to tell miss darcy he is very sorry not to see her again it is not at all clear why he cannot come for he only repeats that he is sailing again some time next month and thinks he had better stay in london or go down to see his sister until he goes georgiana sat perfectly silent gazing into the fire even from mrs wentworth's first words she had not expected that william price was coming but to feel that the opportunity had been within his reach and he could not her heart told her that it was would not avail himself of it was very hard to bear he was right not to come if he believed that the reason for his rejection still existed georgiana honoured him for that but was there anything else had he changed his mind was he ceasing to care georgiana hardly knew until that bitter moment how much she had been pinning her hopes upon seeing him again some day and she thought with something like bitterness that it had not been much use to picture him in london and consequently somewhat nearer to her when as things stood he was immeasurably far away whether in london or in derbyshire or on the north sea her want of response passed unnoticed as captain wentworth entered the room proposing to take the ladies out his wife observed that she had been telling miss darcy of captain price's refusal of their invitation and of their puzzle to account for it yes it is a very ungallant thing is it not miss darcy particularly when he has been told what an attraction we had for him i thought he would have come as he is so often up and down this road between southampton and london but i suppose he has got some other irons in the fire georgiana was glad to be able to leave the room passing off the subject with a smile and a vague expression of regret but the tumult of her mind was so painfully great that it was some days before she could find anything like the quiet enjoyment in her surroundings which she had promised herself all those feelings which she had striven to repress were rising up again with renewed force she struggled with herself alone for she could not bear to tell mrs wentworth the whole story it was different for miss crawford with elizabeth but in this case the best intentioned friend could not disentangle the skein not long after her arrival she had the delight of hearing from elizabeth that the engagement of fitzwilliam and mary was an accomplished fact he was at home again none the worse for the journey and gaining strength rapidly under so many efficient nurses which of course means one wrote elizabeth her pleasure was enhanced a few days later by receiving a letter from her cousin himself the first he had been allowed to write in which he spoke with gratitude of the happiness he had so nearly missed and thanked georgiana affectionately for her share in bringing it about indeed he said we owe to the kindness and patience of our friends a debt we can never repay how cantankerous and troublesome you must have thought me when we were in london and yet you bore with me then and always with unfailing sweetness i can wish you nothing better my dearest cousin than to be as happy as i am though i do not know who is fit by fortune and merit to deserve you mary wrote in much the same strain and georgiana could read their letters without a pang of selfish envy with no feeling but that of rejoicing on her friends' behalf this was heartily shared in by mrs wentworth who proved the most sympathetic of listeners having seen the early stages of the affair at bath and knowing from her own observation and by what she had collected from mrs darcy's letter more than georgiana of the obstacles which had hindered its progress up to now but both preferred to talk only of its happy conclusion and of the strange and unexpected means by which it had been brought about chapter xxvii about five weeks after he had posted his letter to mrs wentworth william price was walking along wigmore street on his way to the yates's house in cavendish square it was a cold foggy evening in march and the murky gloom of the wet streets which the oil lamps at intervals rather emphasized than relieved seemed to william to be a fit surrounding for anyone in his dreary frame of mind he could not wish the letter unwritten it was better not to see georgiana as long as there was the barrier between them raised by what she had told him in november that she had never thought of caring for him believing that he returned kitty's affection and yet it was too hard a task not to wish to see her again since he was leaving england the following day on a voyage which would last for many months he had no longer any fear of his cousin's rivalry for during his last visit to mansfield tom bertram had replied with great coolness when anxiously interrogated that on the occasion of his going to pemberley with the news of colonel fitzwilliam's accident he had come to the conclusion that he and miss darcy would not suit but even if by some dispensation of providence she had not married anyone else in the course of a year how could the situation be sufficiently elucidated to set william free ever to address her again during the three months that had elapsed since the pemberley ball his simple and straightforward nature had wrestled with the most difficult problem he had ever been called upon to face the great events of his life the various steps in his career his sister's marriage his father's death and the providing for the family had all come in the natural order of things and for him the right line of conduct as of feeling had been at the same time the obvious one and so he had supposed it would be when it came to affairs of the heart if a man fell in love he would try to win the affection of the woman he had chosen and ask her to marry him and if she did not care for him enough he must either give it up or wait awhile before making another effort but to be refused because another woman happened to have fallen in love with him william had accepted his dismissal at the time in sheer bewilderment but the more he thought it over the more inadequate the reason seemed for separating him and georgiana she had not absolutely said that it was impossible to care for him she had only refused to listen to him or talk of it which was only natural if she thought him in honour bound to kitty but william's conscience was perfectly clear towards kitty and he tormented himself incessantly with the thought of all that he might have done towards gaining georgiana's affection during the weeks that they were together had it not been for this wretched misunderstanding she had taken it all as intended for kitty why had they not seen the truth kitty might have seen everyone might have seen everyone was deserving of blame except georgiana one moment william was marvelling that anyone could have misunderstood what to him was the simplest most natural thing in the world and the next had dropped back with despair into the thought she might have cared if she had only known and now she will not even have forgiven me for making miss kitty unhappy and i have no chance of setting that right it is just like a ship that has run aground on a sandbank in the fog mused william you can't do anything until it has cleared at least i can't if she had refused me out and out i would have gone down to winchester and had another good try a fellow who has only three months on shore to every nine at sea deserves that i think but i can't face her again as long as i can imagine her saying to herself 'what about my poor kitty' oh what a blind fool i was and how i wasted those ten days he was so deep in thought that in crossing a side street he almost ran into a gentleman who was going towards portman square recognition followed on the mutual apologies and mr knightley exclaimed why william i am glad to see you again if it can be called seeing in this atmosphere i thought you were gone no sir but i sail to morrow from portsmouth the medusa you know they altered our destination at the last minute and what is it to be nova scotia first sir we are taking out a draft to increase the garrison there lucky fellow that you are you will have seen the whole world in a year or two i'm afraid it sounds like a long absence this time but you never mind that do you well sir william hesitated then looked up with a frank smile it won't be any good but for once in a way i wish i could get to a home station for a bit mr knightley waited but perceiving that he was not to hear any more said kindly unless you are in a great hurry come in and say good bye to mrs knightley she would be sorry to miss you especially as you are so near william readily turned back for apart from the kindness of the knightleys their house had a special attraction for him and when a few minutes later they entered the drawing room his thoughts flew back to the moment when he had first seen georgiana she had been standing by that very chair that velvet screen had been the background to the lovely figure in the white ball dress it was necessary to put such thoughts as these resolutely away and give his attention to mrs knightley whom they found alone reading some letters which had just arrived by the country post she greeted william cordially without any surprise at seeing him still in england it was always a little difficult for emma to realize that people had important affairs of their own and that they should have had any existence apart from that which she had chosen to imagine for them constituted the surprise therefore she looked earnestly and inquiringly at william as he sat down and made so long a pause that he began to wonder what he was expected to say until mr knightley came in from the hall where he had been ordering the servant to bring in lamps and explained the circumstances of william's call it was then emma's turn to be astonished going to sea again captain price that is indeed a sad thing i thought you were going to settle in england for a time your friends have seen nothing of you there's no such thing as settling in england for a sailor mrs knightley returned william trying to speak cheerily at least not at twenty four and i have been home for a long time now the north sea cruise this winter counts for nothing you know the north sea repeated emma still more overwhelmed i thought you were with your mother or in derbyshire oh no replied william in as indifferent a tone as he could i have not been to derbyshire since the middle of november we were at copenhagen for three weeks the rest of the time moving about and i have just come from spending a week at mansfield emma was then almost speechless with disappointment mr knightley regretful but amused drew his chair up to the fire and began asking about william's plans which were to leave london on the following morning by the twelve o'clock coach thus allowing ample time to reach portsmouth and bestow himself and his baggage on board before the ship sailed at seven in the evening mr knightley inquired what would happen if he arrived too late but william could hardly picture the consequences of such a breach of discipline he had never known it to happen he supposed the culprit would be court martialled and probably degraded three years he imagined that no circumstances could possibly be allowed to extenuate so grievous a crime mr knightley suggested that a breakdown of the coach or other conveyance might cause inevitable delay and william's answer to this was that one took the risk of these things in putting off one's return to the very last day of one's leave some accident of course might occur but in general those officers who were not obliged to be on board earlier spent every moment of their leave of absence on shore i probably should have gone back yesterday however he added but the mother of a friend of mine cooper who is on board the queen charlotte at southampton is very ill in london and he cannot come to see her so he asked me to call at the house and bring him the latest reports i was returning from there when i met you this evening i intended going earlier in the day but i am glad now that i was prevented from doing so emma my dear said mr knightley you are not appreciating our friend's pretty speeches emma started smiled then tried to rouse herself and say something to william in the nature of cordial good wishes for his voyage and in moving her chair the letters she had been reading fell from her knee to the floor william as he picked them up reflected that probably something in their contents was occupying mrs knightley's mind and he was beginning to think about making his adieux when mr knightley continued speaking to his wife have you any interesting news there as a parting gift for a traveler no i think not replied emma this is from mrs weston but there is nothing but highbury gossip in it which captain price would not and this other one i have not read i thought it was harriet's writing no holding it up to a candle it is not after all it is well i can hardly it looks like in fact i believe it is from kitty bennet indeed said mr knightley and added after a momentary pause we have not heard anything of her for a great while emma could not help glancing towards william price but her glance told her nothing for he sat perfectly passive looking at no one with perhaps a trifle deeper tinge of colour in his cheeks the pause threatened to grow embarrassing so she began to open the letter hurriedly saying miss bennet seems still to be in derbyshire i should have thought she would have returned home before this you stayed at pemberley did you not william as well as at mr bingley's inquired mr knightley yes said william mr and mrs darcy were so kind as to invite me there with the rest for their ball what a beautiful place it is even at that time of year one was struck with it and you have not seen any of them since i conclude as you have been abroad proceeded mr knightley william was replying in the negative when stopped by an exclamation from mrs knightley who was reading the letter with every sign of astonishment george she cried what do you think has happened you will never guess it is perfectly amazing i can hardly believe it myself well as she turned over a page if she had not told me herself i could never was there ever anything so unexpected we shall know better when you have told us what this astounding news is my dear said her husband has miss bennett become engaged to be married by any chance how could you have guessed it exclaimed mrs knightley dropping the letter to gaze at him it is the very last thing i should have thought of oh captain price remembering her visitor in some confusion but i am sure you might know it as she does not say it is private the reason i guessed it said mr knightley smiling is because no other intelligence causes quite the same amount of excitement as you must admit emma may we hear some more particulars now that we have got over the first shock mr knightley was talking partly in order to spare his young friend thinking it just possible that the news of kitty's engagement might not be very welcome to the young man william however was leaning forward with an expression of eager interest and mrs knightley looking at her letter went on she is engaged to a mr james morland the rector of the parish in which mr and mrs bingley live he is quite young only appointed last year she met him first when she went down there in june perfectly charming the most agreeable man she has ever met does not disapprove of dancing mr bingley and her sister so delighted a lovely old house so near to dear jane exquisitely happy she is going home directly and hopes to come to town and see me william could contain himself no longer he sprang up looked at the clock took a few quick steps through the room then coming back he abruptly asked is this really true mrs knightley quite true captain price i am afraid at least i mean there can be no doubt of it in fact they are going to be married in june she says i assure you i had not the slightest suspicion i have only heard the gentleman's name once or twice no more it is so odd so inexplicable mr knightley could not forbear smiling at his wife's perplexity for he perceived that for some reason or other william was in no need of commiseration and indeed could hardly wait for mrs knightley to finish holding out his hand he said pray give miss bennet my congratulations and a thousand good wishes for her happiness i fear i must not stay longer now so will say good bye mrs knightley with many thanks for all your kindness i am indeed grateful for all you have done for me but captain price you are not going already exclaimed emma now completely bewildered do not i beg let me drive you away we will not talk about anything disagreeable we were just going to have dinner it is late to night on account of mr knightley's having had to go out and i hoped you would have stayed to dine with us mr knightley seconded the invitation but william unhesitatingly declined you are very good but i must not delay so long it is only six and i think i can catch the eight o'clock coach if i hurry as my things are nearly packed the eight o'clock coach repeated mr knightley helping his guest into his coat when it became evident that he was determined to go i thought you said you were not returning until to morrow morning yes i did but i find now that i shall have to go to winchester i shall just have time it is the most fortunate thing that could have happened it is not very fortunate for us said emma but you surely will not attempt to get to winchester to night no but i shall get as far as guilford in all probability i beg your pardon mrs knightley i am shockingly ill mannered what must you be thinking of me do overlook it just this once nothing but the most urgent affairs would carry me away from here so much sooner than i had intended his smile and winning manner were irresistible and emma was obliged to let him go saying she would expect to hear all about the urgent affairs some day william seemed to get to the front door in two strides and was fumbling with the lock before his host could reach him with offers of refreshment which he would not stay to accept mr knightley shook hands with him saying kindly well william i am sorry you had to run away especially as we shall not see you for so long besides it is really too cruel after having whetted our curiosity by this mysterious change of plan oh sir i know it is too bad if i only had a little more time but it is the sailing to morrow that is the very mischief if you knew you would understand that my only chance is to go now as quickly as i can i will write and tell you how i get on please make my apologies to mrs knightley the only thing mrs knightley will not forgive is your having no dinner to night yes indeed we shall look forward to hearing good bye and good luck be with you the good luck had begun already william thought as he plunged into the streets which no longer appeared dark and foggy since the aspect of the whole world had changed to him in the last few minutes was it not the most extraordinary stroke of good fortune which had led him to meet mr knightley that evening he had not intended to call for he had believed them to be at their house in the country and he would have heard nothing and would have passed through winchester the next day within a mile of georgiana without knowing that he was free a day later the horror of it was almost too great to contemplate would have been too late too late to speak or write even if anyone had troubled to send him the information mrs knightley herself had not suspected that miss bennet's engagement was a matter of such stupendous importance to him william did not trouble to think of what she had suspected his only idea being to make his way to georgiana with all speed he must see her before he sailed that was the pressing necessity everything else would right itself what if he did not find her if she were ill or out of the house or gone home again every kind of apprehension sprang up in his mind to be reasoned away or fought down by vigorous action his impatience was so great that he hardly knew how he got through the journey beginning with the hasty drive to the coach office the finding there was a seat still vacant booking it and tramping about till the time of starting the innumerable frets and delays along the road the arrival at guilford the bespeaking of a post chaise and descending before daylight the next morning to claim it the hurried breakfast at farnham and the last interminable twenty miles until the moment when he drove down the long hill into winchester and heard the cathedral clock striking eleven leaving his portmanteaux at the george he walked straight to the wentworths' house which he knew well from previous visits and was shown into a room where captain and mrs wentworth sat together his early appearance created some surprise and excessive pleasure they were totally unsuspicious of its real cause and concluded only that he had reconsidered his refusal his eager inquiry as to whether miss darcy were still with them and whether he could see her aroused a momentary fear that he had brought bad news for her but it speedily became evident that he was on quite a different errand oho william you sly fellow so it is miss darcy you are come to see exclaimed captain wentworth well we congratulate you upon your good sense do we not anne but why in the world did you not come down weeks ago when you had the chance william avoided answering this and as his friends still did not understand the urgency of the case he was obliged again to go through the particulars of the medusa and portsmouth and seven o'clock now indeed were the precious moments not to be wasted anne left the room but returned directly saying captain price i am very sorry but i find miss darcy has gone out she talked of wishing to do some errands in the town but i did not know she had already started what is to be done william was quite clear that there was only one thing to be done namely to go in search of miss darcy and asked which shops she was likely to have visited mrs wentworth named one or two and called after him as he was hurrying away to suggest that if he was not successful in finding her in either it was possible she might as the day was so fine have gone to finish her walk in the grounds of wolvesey palace a favourite spot of hers for a stroll armed with information william was gone on the instant it was fortunate that he had obtained it for his inquiries in the high street were fruitless and he thereupon retraced his steps under the archway and past the cathedral turned along college street and finally found himself in the old palace gardens where seated with a book among a quiet part of the ruins he presently came upon georgiana she did not see him until he was close at hand when she sprang up scarce able to believe her eyes and the colour deepening in her cheeks and william forgetting all the lengthy explanations he had intended to make darted towards her impulsively exclaiming oh how glad i am to see you again i came back i could not help it everything is all right you will let me speak now am i too late have i the least chance any chance at all georgiana unconsciously yielded her hand to his but shrank back a little as she faltered but but kitty breathless from haste and full of anxiety as to his reception william hardly knew whether he had been intelligible but there was something in georgiana's look which showed him even while she hesitated that he was understood even more welcomed her very question was an answer to him and that he quickly disposed of it and yet in a manner entirely satisfactory to her could not be doubted making thereby the glorious discovery that his cause was won when he had been almost ready to despair of achieving anything in the short time at his command it seemed at first impossible that it could be true but the surprise of receiving a good fortune beyond one's deserts is one to which it is easy to grow accustomed the fact of kitty's engagement once realized could be put aside as something delightful to be thought over at leisure but for the present moment there were only two people in the world and those two could give themselves up unchecked by any sense of guilt or responsibility to the exquisite happiness of love acknowledged and returned perfect confidence might now exist between them william might repeat and far more eloquently all that he had said in the picture gallery at pemberley and georgiana might now venture to confess the feelings which in that interview had awakened to life to her indeed it was easier to listen than to talk for after her long self repression the relief the wonderful change were almost overwhelming her heart had been too deeply stirred and her habitual shyness was not soon to be overcome but william's joy in the fruition of his hopes so infinitely more complete than any he had dared to hope for and his gratitude to herself had to be put into words in his own frank and eager way touched now with the earnest gravity befitting so great an occasion it was one of those beautiful mornings which sometimes occur in the ungenial early months of the year as a reminder that spring is actually on its way by noon the pale sunshine had some warmth and the lovers paced to and fro or sat in the sheltered corner which had seen their meeting while a soft breeze rustled in the ivy and the murmuring of the stream could be heard just beyond the old wall georgiana lifted a face of delight to the blue sky and watched the rooks busy in the elm trees near while occasionally other sounds came to them unnoticed at the time but being woven into the picture which their memories would always hold of that hour voices gay with youth and spirits of the college boys as they passed in and out of their gateway and the slow sweet chimes from the tower of the cathedral georgiana knew something of william's plans but to learn that their parting must take place almost immediately was indeed a blow until consoling reflections came and they reminded each other of what a trial of faith and patience his departure in other circumstances would have meant of course it would have made no real difference neither would admit the possibility of its having caused any change in their feelings but there was comfort in knowing that now theirs was an attachment which separations could only strengthen and in the light of which misunderstandings could no longer exist both lamented william's being unable to see mr and mrs darcy before he sailed but georgiana anticipated no opposition on their part and this thought gave perhaps the crowning touch to a felicity so intense that she could hardly believe it to be hers captain and mrs wentworth's warmth of kindness was to be expected in view of their affection for both the young people william stayed with them until four o'clock which gave time for many plans to be made and the more important letters to be written and when at last he said his farewells he buoyed himself and georgiana up with the promise that it should be no more than six months before he returned to claim her when he had actually gone she went to her room feeling in need of solitude to compose her mind after a day of such wonders it was impossible that she should not let fall a few tears at the thought of william's going every moment farther and farther from her when they had only just begun to realize the delight the security of their new relation to each other but they were not the bitter tears of hopelessness that she had so often shed in the last few months whatever the period of his absence it would be long and the lot of the one left behind inactive would be the hardest but georgiana was willing to wait in thankfulness and quiet trust for whatever the future might bring that there might be anxieties and alarms she knew but the heart which had once and for all been given to william price was strong in courage as in tenderness and the remembrance of the vows they had exchanged had glorified her life elizabeth and mr darcy came to winchester shortly afterwards to take her home her news while explaining many things had been a considerable surprise to them and darcy deemed it necessary to make further inquiries about the young man who it appeared now desired to be even more closely connected with his family than had at first been thought though regretting for his sister's sake the profession of the man she had chosen he could not withhold his approval when she had convinced him how completely her happiness was bound up in the affair and indeed he could hear nothing on any side but what was in captain price's favour so while lady catherine who had made a show of objection was appeased by the substantial fortune and the relationship with the bertrams darcy and elizabeth found contentment in their knowledge of his character and position all went as delightfully as georgiana could have wished darcy who had been inclined to regret mr bertram's dismissal when he first heard of it became so entirely reconciled to the idea of his cousin as a substitute that georgiana never heard a word of the dreaded scolding and captain wentworth promised that all his own and his brother in law admiral croft's interest should be used towards hastening william's promotion and shortening his absence for he declared it would be impossible to do too much for a lady who in spite of early prejudices was venturing to trust so far in the fidelity of sailors as actually to be going to marry one of them georgiana had many questions to ask about kitty's engagement and from what elizabeth told her of the particulars given by jane she was able to piece the story together for herself morland had sincerely tried to forget kitty but her return to desborough more bewitching than ever had shown him how vain had been his efforts and when the intimacy between the rectory and the park had been renewed under his sister's auspices what wonder if kitty's feelings towards him changed somewhat with the changed circumstances if touched by his continued devotion and a little piqued by the want of appreciation in another quarter she had allowed him to see that a second attempt would not be treated like the first georgiana rejoiced to think that kitty had the power of consoling herself and that she was at that moment adoring mr morland as whole heartedly as she had ever adored mr price the two girls exchanged letters of congratulations but it was no longer possible to write with quite the same openness as of old though georgiana's good wishes lacked nothing of affectionate sincerity kitty declared herself too busy with the preparation of her wedding clothes to send a long letter and perhaps also a small feeling of resentment lingered in her mind and prompted the remark i thought you must have been in love with him all the time though you would not admit it she had however nothing to envy georgiana for had she not achieved the distinction of being the first of the three brides the ceremony at the parish church near longbourn was fixed for midsummer and was attended by a number of relatives and friends while the darcys soon after had the pleasure of witnessing the marriage of mary crawford and colonel fitzwilliam which took place in london in the following month the latter couple settled in town but also possessed themselves of a small hunting lodge in leicestershire whence the road to pemberley and back was frequently traversed though it is to be hoped with less haste and agitation than by two persons who made the journey on a certain melancholy day in january it was long before william learned the true history of his cousin's second visit to pemberley but georgiana could afford to smile at the recollection of it when some three months after the announcement of her engagement the families of darcy and bingley received the wedding cards of mr thomas bertram and miss isabella thorpe the end
