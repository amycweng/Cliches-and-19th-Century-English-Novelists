a terrible temptation a story of to day by charles reade chapter i the morning room of a large house in portman square london a gentleman in the prime of life stood with his elbow on the broad mantel piece and made himself agreeable to a young lady seated a little way off playing at work to the ear he was only conversing but his eyes dwelt on her with loving admiration all the time her posture was favorable to this furtive inspection for she leaned her fair head over her work with a pretty modest demure air that seemed to say i suspect i am being admired i will not look to see i might have to check it the gentleman's features were ordinary except his brow that had power in it but he had the beauty of color his sunburned features glowed with health and his eye was bright on the whole rather good looking when he smiled but ugly when he frowned for his frown was a scowl and betrayed a remarkable power of hating miss arabella bruce was a beauty she had glorious masses of dark red hair and a dazzling white neck to set it off large dove like eyes and a blooming oval face which would have been classical if her lips had been thin and finely chiseled but here came in her anglo saxon breed and spared society a minerva by giving her two full and rosy lips they made a smallish mouth at rest but parted ever so wide when they smiled and ravished the beholder with long even rows of dazzling white teeth her figure was tall and rather slim but not at all commanding there are people whose very bodies express character and this tall supple graceful frame of bella bruce breathed womanly subservience so did her gestures she would take up or put down her own scissors half timidly and look around before threading her needle as if to see whether any soul objected her favorite word was may i with a stress on the may and she used it where most girls would say i will or nothing and do it mr richard bassett was in love with her and also conscious that her fifteen thousand pounds would be a fine addition to his present income which was small though his distant expectations were great as he had known her but one month and she seemed rather amiable than inflammable he had the prudence to proceed by degrees and that is why though his eyes gloated on her he merely regaled her with the gossip of the day not worth recording here but when he had actually taken his hat to go bella bruce put him a question that had been on her mind the whole time for which reason she had reserved it to the very last moment is sir charles bassett in town said she mighty carelessly but bending a little lower over her embroidery don't know said richard bassett with such a sudden brevity and asperity that miss bruce looked up and opened her lovely eyes mr richard bassett replied to this mute inquiry we don't speak then after a pause he has robbed me of my inheritance oh mr bassett yes miss bruce the bassett and huntercombe estates were mine by right of birth my father was the eldest son and they were entailed on him but sir charles's father persuaded my old doting grandfather to cut off the entail and settle the estates on him and his heirs and so they robbed me of every acre they could luckily my little estate of highmore was settled on my mother and her issue too tight for the villains to undo these harsh expressions applied to his own kin and the abruptness and heat they were uttered with surprised and repelled his gentle listener she shrank a little away from him he observed it she replied not to his words but to her own thought but after all it does seem hard she added with a little fervor but it wasn't poor sir charles's doing after all he is content to reap the benefit said richard bassett sternly then finding he was making a sorry impression he tried to get away from the subject i say tried for till a man can double like a hare he will never get away from his hobby excuse me said he i ought never to speak about it let us talk of something else you cannot enter into my feelings it makes my blood boil oh miss bruce you can't conceive what a disinherited man feels and i live at the very door his old trees that ought to be mine fling their shadows over my little flower beds the sixty chimneys of huntercombe hall look down on my cottage his acres of lawn run up to my little garden and nothing but a ha ha between us it is hard said miss bruce composedly not that she entered into a hardship of this vulgar sort but it was her nature to soothe and please people hard cried richard bassett encouraged by even this faint sympathy it would be unendurable but for one thing i shall have my own some day i am glad of that said the lady but how by outliving the wrongful heir miss bruce turned pale she had little experience of men's passions oh mr bassett said she and there was something pure and holy in the look of sorrow and alarm she cast on the presumptuous speaker pray do not cherish such thoughts they will do you harm and remember life and death are not in our hands besides well' sir charles might well might he not marry and have children this with more hesitation and a deeper blush than appeared absolutely necessary oh there's no fear of that property ill gotten never descends charles is a worn out rake he was fast at eton fast at oxford fast in london why he looks ten years older than i and he is three years younger he had a fit two years ago besides he is not a marrying man bassett and huntercombe will be mine and oh miss bruce if ever they are mine sir charles bassett trumpeted a servant at the door and then waited prudently to know whether his young lady whom he had caught blushing so red with one gentleman would be at home to another wait a moment said miss bruce to him then discreetly ignoring what bassett had said last and lowering her voice almost to a whisper she said hurriedly you should not blame him for the faults of others there i have not been long acquainted with either and am little entitled to inter but it is such a pity you are not friends he is very good i assure you and very nice let me reconcile you two may i this well meant petition was uttered very sweetly and indeed if i may be permitted in a way to dissolve a bear but this was not a bear nor anything else that is placable it was a man with a hobby grievance so he replied in character that is impossible so long as he keeps me out of my own he had the grace however to add half sullenly excuse me i feel i have been too vehement miss bruce thus repelled answered rather coldly oh never mind that it was very natural i am at home then said she to the servant mr bassett took the hint but turned at the door and said with no little agitation i was not aware he visits you one word don't let his ill gotten acres make you quite forget the disinherited one and so he left her with an imploring look she felt red with all this so she slipped out at another door to cool her cheeks and imprison a stray curl for sir charles he strolled into the empty room with the easy languid air of fashion his features were well cut and had some nobility but his sickly complexion and the lines under his eyes told a tale of dissipation he appeared ten years older than he was and thoroughly blase yet when miss bruce entered the room with a smile and a little blush he brightened up and looked handsome and greeted her with momentary warmth after the usual inquiries she asked him if he had met any body where here just now no what nobody at all only my sulky cousin i don't call him anybody drawled sir charles who was now relapsing into his normal condition of semi apathy oh said miss bruce gayly you must expect him to be a little cross it is not so very nice to be disinherited let me tell you and who has disinherited the fellow i forget but you disinherited him among you never mind it can't be helped now when did you come back to town i didn't see you at lady d'arcy's ball did i you did not unfortunately for me but you would if i had known you were to be there but about richard he may tell you what he likes but he was not disinherited he was bought out the fact is his father was uncommonly fast my grandfather paid his debts again and again but at last the old gentleman found he was dealing with the jews for his reversion then there was an awful row it ended in my grandfather outbidding the jews he bought the reversion of his estate from his own son for a large sum of money he had to raise it by mortgages then they cut off the entail between them and he entailed the mortgaged estate on his other son and his grandson that was me and on my heir at law richard's father squandered his thirty thousand pounds before he died my father husbanded the estates got into parliament and they put a tail to his name sir charles delivered this version of the facts with a languid composure that contrasted deliciously with richard's heat in telling the story his way to be sure sir charles had got huntercombe and bassett and it is easier to be philosophical on the right side of the boundary hedge and wound up with a sort of corollary dick bassett suffers by his father's vices and i profit by mine's virtues where's the injustice nowhere and the sooner you are reconciled the better sir charles demurred oh i don't want to quarrel with the fellow but he is a regular thorn in my side with his little trumpery estate all in broken patches he shoots my pheasants in the unfairest way here the landed proprietor showed real irritation but only for a moment he concluded calmly the fact is he is not quite a gentleman fancy his coming and whining to you about our family affairs and then telling you a falsehood no no he did not mean it was his way of looking at things you can afford to forgive him yes but not if he sets you against me but he cannot do that the more any one was to speak against you the more i of course this admission fired sir charles he drew nearer and thanks to his cousin's interference spoke the language of love more warmly and directly than he had ever done before the lady blushed and defended herself feebly sir charles grew warmer and at last elicited from her a timid but tender avowal that made him supremely happy when he left her this brief ecstasy was succeeded by regrets on account of the years he had wasted in follies and intrigues he smoked five cigars and pondered the difference between the pure creature who now honored him with her virgin affections and beauties of a different character who had played their parts in his luxurious life after profound deliberation he sent for his solicitor they lighted the inevitable cigars and the following observations struggled feebly out along with the smoke mr oldfield i'm going to be married glad to hear it sir charles vision of settlements it is a high time you were puff puff want your advice and assistance first certainly must put down my pony carriage now you know a very proper retrenchment but you can do that without my assistance there would be sure to be a row if i did i dare say there will be as it is at any rate i want to do the thing like a gentleman send 'em to tattersall's puff and the girl that drives them in the park and draws all the duchesses and countesses at her tail am i to send her to tattersall's puff oh it is her you want to put down then why of course chapter ii sir charles and mr oldfield settled that lady's retiring pension and mr oldfield took the memoranda home with instructions to prepare a draft deed for miss somerset's approval meantime sir charles visited miss bruce every day her affections for him grew visibly for being engaged gave her the courage to love mr bassett called pretty often but one day he met sir charles on the stairs and scowled that scowl cost him dear for sir charles thereupon represented to bella that a man with a grievance is a bore to the very eye and asked her to receive no more visits from his scowling cousin the lady smiled and said with soft complacency i obey sir charles's gallantry was shocked no don't say 'obey' it is a little favor i ventured to ask it is like you to ask what you have a right to command i shall be out to him in future and to every one who is disagreeable to you what does 'obey' frighten you from my lips to me it is the sweetest in the language oh please let me 'obey' you may i upon this as vanity is seldom out of call sir charles swelled like a turkey cock and loftily consented to indulge bella bruce's strange propensity from that hour she was never at home to mr bassett he began to suspect and one day after he had been kept out with the loud stolid not at home of practiced mendacity he watched and saw sir charles admitted he divined it all in a moment and turned to wormwood what was he to be robbed of the lady he loved and her fifteen thousand pounds by the very man who had robbed him of his ancestral fields he dwelt on the double grievance till it nearly frenzied him but he could do nothing it was his fate his only hope was that sir charles the arrant flirt would desert this beauty after a time as he had the others but one afternoon in the smoking room of his club a gentleman said to him so your cousin charles is engaged to the yorkshire beauty bell bruce he is flirting with her i believe said richard no no said the other they are engaged i know it for a fact they are to be married next month mr richard bassett digested this fresh pill in moody silence while the gentlemen of the club discussed the engagement with easy levity they soon passed to a topic of wider interest viz who was to succeed sir charles with la somerset bassett began to listen attentively and learned for the first time sir charles bassett's connection with that lady and also that she was a woman of a daring nature and furious temper at first he was merely surprised but soon hatred and jealousy whispered in his ear that with these materials it must be possible to wound those who had wounded him mr marsh a young gentleman with a receding chin and a mustache between hay and straw had taken great care to let them all know he was acquainted with miss somerset so richard got marsh alone and sounded him could he call upon the lady without ceremony you won't get in her street door is jolly well guarded i can tell you i am very curious to see her in her own house so are a good many fellows could you not give me an introduction marsh shook his head sapiently for a considerable time and with all this shaking as it appeared out fell words of wisdom don't see it i'm awfully spooney on her myself and you know when a fellow introduces another fellow that fellow always cuts the other out then descending from the words of the wise and their dark sayings to a petty but pertinent fact he added besides i'm only let in myself about once in five times she gives herself wonderful airs it seems said bassett rather bitterly marsh fired up so would any woman that was as beautiful and as witty and as much run after as she is why she is a leader of fashion look at all the ladies following her round the park they used to drive on the north side of the serpentine she just held up her finger and now they have cut the serpentine and followed her to the south drive oh indeed said bassett ah then this is a great lady a poor country squire must not venture into her august presence he turned savagely on his heel and marsh went and made sickly mirth at his expense by this means the matter soon came to the ears of old mr woodgate the father of that club and a genial gossip he got hold of bassett in the dinner room and examined him so you want an introduction to la somerset and marsh refuses marsh hitherto celebrated for his weak head rather than his hard heart richard bassett nodded rather sullenly he had not bargained for this rapid publicity the venerable chief resumed we all consider marsh's conduct unclubable and a thing to be combined against wanted an anti dog in the manger league i'll introduce you to the somerset what do you visit her asked bassett in some astonishment the old gentleman held up his hands in droll disclaimer and chuckled merrily no no i enjoy from the shore the disasters of my youthful friends that sacred pleasure is left me do you see that elegant creature with the little auburn beard and mustache waiting sweetly for his dinner he launched the somerset launched her yes but for him she might have wasted her time breaking hearts and slapping faces in some country village he it was set her devastating society and with his aid she shall devastate you vandeleur will you join bassett and me mr vandeleur with ready grace said he should be delighted and they dined together accordingly mr vandeleur six feet high lank but graceful as a panther and the pink of politeness was beneath his varnish one of the wildest young men in london gambler horse racer libertine what not but in society charming and his manners singularly elegant and winning he never obtruded his vices in good company in fact you might dine with him all your life and not detect him the young serpent was torpid in wine but he came out a bit at a time in the sunshine of cigar after a brisk conversation on current topics the venerable chief told him plainly they were both curious to know the history of miss somerset and he must tell it them oh with pleasure said the obliging youth let us go into the smoking room let me see i picked her up by the sea side she promised well at first we put her on my chestnut mare and she showed lots of courage so she soon learned to ride but she kicked even down there kicked whom kicked all round i mean showed temper and when she got to london and had ridden a few times in the park and swallowed flattery there was no holding her i stood her cheek for a good while but at last i told the servants they must not turn her out but they could keep her out they sided with me for once she had ridden over them as well the first time she went out they bolted the doors and handed her boxes up the area steps how did she take that easier than we expected she said 'lucky for you beggars that i'm a lady or i'd break every d d window in the house' this caused a laugh it subsided the historian resumed next day she cooled and wrote a letter to you no to my groom would you like to see it it is a curiosity he sent one of the club waiters for his servant and his servant for his desk and produced the letter there said vandeleur she looks like a queen and steps like an empress and this is how she writes 'dear jorge i have got the sak an' praps your turn nex dear jorge he alwaies promise me the grey oss which now an oss is life an death to me if you was to ast him to lend me the grey he wouldn't refuse you 'yours respecfully 'rhoda somerset' when the letter and the handwriting which unfortunately i cannot reproduce had been duly studied and approved vandeleur continued now you know she had her good points after all if any creature was ill she'd sit up all night and nurse them and she used to go to church on sundays and come back with the sting out of her only then she would preach to a fellow and bore him she is awfully fond of preaching her dream is to jump on a first rate hunter and ride across country and preach to the villages so when george came grinning to me with the letter i told him to buy a new side saddle for the gray and take her the lot with my compliments i had noticed a slight spavin in his near foreleg she rode him that very day in the park all alone and made such a sensation that next day my gray was standing in lord hailey's stables but she rode hailey like my gray with a long spur and he couldn't stand it none of 'em could except sir charles bassett and he doesn't play fair never goes near her and that gives him an unfair advantage over his fascinating predecessors inquired the senior slyly of course it does said vandeleur stoutly you ask a girl to dine at richmond once a month and keep out of her way all the rest of the time and give her lots of money she will never quarrel with you profit by this information young man said old woodgate severely it comes too late for me in my day there existed no sure method of pleasing the fair but now that is invented along with everything else richmond and absence equivalent to 'richmond and victory' now bassett we have heard the truth from the fountain head and it is rather serious she swears she kicks she preaches do you still desire an introduction as for me my manly spirit is beginning to quake at vandeleur's revelations and some lines of scott recur to my gothic memory 'from the chafed tiger rend his prey bar the fell dragon's blighting way but shun that lovely snare' bassett replied gravely that he had no such motive as mr woodgate gave him credit for but still desired the introduction with pleasure said vandeleur but it will be no use to you she hates me like poison says i have no heart that is what all ill tempered women say notwithstanding his misgivings the obliging youth called for writing materials and produced the following epistle dear miss somerset mr richard bassett a cousin of sir charles wishes very much to be introduced to you and has begged me to assist in an object so laudable i should hardly venture to present myself and therefore shall feel surprised as well as flattered if you will receive mr bassett on my introduction and my assurance that he is a respectable country gentleman and bears no resemblance in character to yours faithfully arthur vandeleur next day bassett called at miss somerset's house in may fair and delivered his introduction he was admitted after a short delay and entered the lady's boudoir it was luxury's nest the walls were rose colored satin padded and puckered the voluminous curtains were pale satin with floods and billows of real lace the chairs embroidered the tables all buhl and ormolu and the sofas felt like little seas the lady herself in a delightful peignoir sat nestled cozily in a sort of ottoman with arms her finely formed hand clogged with brilliants was just conveying brandy and soda water to a very handsome mouth when richard bassett entered she raised herself superbly but without leaving her seat and just looked at a chair in a way that seemed to say i permit you to sit down and that done she carried the glass to her lips with the same admirable firmness of hand she showed in driving her lofty manner coupled with her beautiful but rather haughty features smacked of imperial origin yet she was the writer to jorge and four years ago a shrimp girl running into the sea with legs as brown as a berry so swiftly does merit rise in this world which nevertheless some morose folk pretend is a wicked one i ought to explain however that this haughty reception was partly caused by a breach of propriety vandeleur ought first to have written to her and asked permission to present richard bassett he had no business to send the man and the introduction together this law a parliament of sirens had passed and the slightest breach of it was a bitter offense equilibrium governs the world these ladies were bound to be overstrict in something or other being just a little lax in certain things where other ladies are strict now bassett had pondered well what he should say but he was disconcerted by her superb presence and demeanor and her large gray eyes that rested steadily upon his face however he began to murmur mellifluously said he had often seen her in public and admired her and desired to make her acquaintance etc etc then why did you not ask sir charles to bring you here said miss somerset abruptly and searching him with her eyes that were not to say bold but singularly brave and examiners pointblank i am not on good terms with sir charles he holds the estates that ought to be mine and now he has robbed me of my love he is the last man in the world i would ask a favor of you came here to abuse him behind his back eh asked the lady with undisguised contempt bassett winced but kept his temper no miss somerset but you seem to think i ought to have come to you through sir charles i would not enter your house if i did not feel sure i shall not meet him here miss somerset looked rather puzzled sir charles does not come here every day but he comes now and then and he is always welcome you surprise me thank you now some of my gentlemen friends think it is a wonder he does not come every minute you mistake me what surprises me is that you are such good friends under the circumstances circumstances what circumstances oh you know you are in his confidence i presume this rather satirically so the lady answered defiantly yes i am he knows i can hold my tongue so he tells me things he tells nobody else then if you are in his confidence you know he is about to be married married sir charles married in three weeks it's a lie you get out of my house this moment mr bassett colored at this insult he rose from his seat with some little dignity made her a low bow and retired but her blood was up she made a wonderful rush sweeping down a chair with her dress as she went and caught him at the door clutched him by the shoulder and half dragged him back and made him sit down again while she stood opposite him with the knuckles of one hand resting on the table now said she panting you look me in the face and say that again excuse me you punish me too severely for telling the truth well i beg your pardon there now tell me this instant can't you speak man and her knuckles drummed the table he is to be married in three weeks oh who to a young lady i love her name miss arabella bruce where does she live portman square i'll stop that marriage how asked richard eagerly i don't know that i'll think over but he shall not marry her never bassett sat and looked up with almost as much awe as complacency at the fury he had evoked for this woman was really at times a poetic impersonation of that fiery passion she was so apt to indulge she stood before him her cheek pale her eyes glittering and roving savagely and her nostrils literally expanding while her tall body quivered with wrath and her clinched knuckles pattered on the table he shall not marry her i'll kill him first chapter iii richard bassett eagerly offered his services to break off the obnoxious match but miss somerset was beginning to be mortified at having shown so much passion before a stranger what have you to do with it said she sharply everything i love miss bruce oh yes i forgot that anything else there is now i see it in your eye what is it sir charles's estates are mine by right and they will return to my line if he does not marry and have issue oh i see that is so like a man it's always love and something more important with you well give me your address i'll write if i want you highly flattered said bassett ironically wrote his address and left her miss somerset then sat down and wrote dear sir charles please call here i want to speak to you yours respecfuly rhoda somerset sir charles obeyed this missive and the lady received him with a gracious and smiling manner all put on and catlike she talked with him of indifferent things for more than an hour still watching to see if he would tell her of his own accord when she was quite sure he would not she said do you know there's a ridiculous report about that you are going to be married indeed they even tell her name miss bruce do you know the girl yes is she pretty very modest as an angel and are you going to marry her yes then you are a villain the deuce i am you are to abandon a woman who has sacrificed all for you sir charles looked puzzled and then smiled but was too polite to give his thoughts vent nor was it necessary miss somerset whose brave eyes never left the person she was speaking to fired up at the smile alone and she burst into a torrent of remonstrance not to say vituperation sir charles endeavored once or twice to stop it but it was not to be stopped so at last he quietly took up his hat to go he was arrested at the door by a rustle and a fall he turned round and there was miss somerset lying on her back grinding her white teeth and clutching the air he ran to the bell and rang it violently then knelt down and did his best to keep her from hurting herself but as generally happens in these cases his interference made her more violent he had hard work to keep her from battering her head against the floor and her arms worked like windmills hearing the bell tugged so violently a pretty page ran headlong into the room saw and without an instant's diminution of speed described a curve and ran headlong out screaming polly polly the next moment the housekeeper an elderly woman trotted in at the door saw her mistress's condition and stood stock still calling polly but with the most perfect tranquillity the mind can conceive in ran a strapping house maid with black eyes and brown arms went down on her knees and said firmly though respectfully give her me sir she got behind her struggling mistress pulled her up into her own lap and pinned her by the wrists with a vigorous grasp the lady struggled and ground her teeth audibly and flung her arms abroad the maid applied all her rustic strength and harder muscle to hold her within bounds the four arms went to and fro in a magnificent struggle and neither could the maid hold the mistress still nor the mistress shake off the maid's grasp nor strike anything to hurt herself sir charles thrust out of the play looked on with pity and anxiety and the little page at the door combining art and nature stuck stock still in a military attitude and blubbered aloud as for the housekeeper she remained in the middle of the room with folded arms and looked down on the struggle with a singular expression of countenance there was no agitation whatever but a sort of thoughtful examination half cynical half admiring however as soon as the boy's sobs reached her ear she wakened up and said tenderly what is the child crying for run and get a basin of water and fling it all over her that will bring her to in a minute the page departed swiftly on this benevolent errand then the lady gave a deep sigh and ceased to struggle next she stared in all their faces and seemed to return to consciousness next she spoke but very feebly help me up she sighed sir charles and polly raised her and now there was a marvelous change the vigorous vixen was utterly weak and limp as a wet towel a woman of jelly as such they handled her and deposited her gingerly on the sofa now the page ran in hastily with the water up jumps the poor lax sufferer with flashing eyes you dare come near me with it then to the female servants call yourselves women and water my lilac silk not two hours old then to the housekeeper you old monster you wanted it for your polly get out of my sight the lot then suddenly remembering how feeble she was she sank instantly down and turned piteously and languidly to sir charles they eat my bread and rob me and hate me said she faintly i have but one friend on earth she leaned tenderly toward sir charles as that friend but before she quite reached him she started back her eyes filled with sudden horror and he forsakes me she cried and so turned away from him despairingly and began to cry bitterly with head averted over the sofa and one hand hanging by her side for sir charles to take and comfort her he tried to take it it resisted and under cover of that little disturbance the other hand dexterously whipped two pins out of her hair the long brown tresses all her own fell over her eyes and down to her waist and the picture of distressed beauty was complete even so did the women of antiquity conquer male pity solutis crinibus the females interchanged a meaning glance and retired then the boy followed them with his basin sore perplexed but learning life in this admirable school sir charles then with the utmost kindness endeavored to reconcile the weeping and disheveled fair to that separation which circumstances rendered necessary but she was inconsolable and he left the house perplexed and grieved not but what it gratified his vanity a little to find himself beloved all in a moment and the somerset unvixened he could not help thinking how wide must be the circle of his charms which had won the affections of two beautiful women so opposite in character as bella bruce and la somerset the passion of this latter seemed to grow she wrote to him every day and begged him to call on her she called on him she who had never called on a man before she raged with jealousy she melted with grief she played on him with all a woman's artillery and at last actually wrung from him what she called a reprieve richard bassett called on her but she would not receive him so then he wrote to her urging co operation and she replied frankly that she took no interest in his affairs but that she was devoted to sir charles and should keep him for herself vanity tempted her to add that he sir charles was with her every day and the wedding postponed this last seemed too good to be true so richard bassett set his servant to talk to the servants in portman square he learned that the wedding was now to be on the th of june instead of the st of may convinced that this postponement was only a blind and that the marriage would never be he breathed more freely at the news but the fact is although sir charles had yielded so far to dread of scandal he was ashamed of himself and his shame became remorse when he detected a furtive tear in the dove like eyes of her he really loved and esteemed he went and told his trouble to mr oldfield i am afraid she will do something desperate he said mr oldfield heard him out and then asked him had he told miss somerset what he was going to settle on her not i she is not in a condition to be influenced by that at present let me try her the draft is ready i'll call on her to morrow he did call and was told she did not know him you tell her i am a lawyer and it is very much to her interest to see me said mr oldfield to the page he was admitted but not to a tete a tete polly was kept in the room the somerset had peeped and oldfield was an old fellow with white hair if he had been a young fellow with black hair she might have thought that precaution less necessary first madam said oldfield i must beg you to accept my apologies for not coming sooner press of business etc why have you come at all that is the question inquired the lady bluntly i bring the draft of a deed for your approval shall i read it to you yes if it is not very long he began to read it the lady interrupted him characteristically it's a beastly rigmarole what does it mean in three words sir charles bassett secures to rhoda somerset four hundred pounds a year while single this is reduced to two hundred if you marry the deed further assigns to you without reserve the beneficial lease of this house and all the furniture and effects plate linen wine etc i see a bribe nothing of the kind madam when sir charles instructed me to prepare this deed he expected no opposition on your part to his marriage but he thought it due to him and to yourself to mark his esteem for you and his recollection of the pleasant hours he has spent in your company miss somerset's eyes searched the lawyer's face he stood the battery unflinchingly she altered her tone and asked politely and almost respectfully whether she might see that paper mr oldfield gave it her she took it and ran her eye over it in doing which she raised it so that she could think behind it unobserved she handed it back at last with the remark that sir charles was a gentleman and had done the right thing he has and you will do the right thing too will you not i don't know i am just beginning to fall in love with him myself jealousy madam not love said the old lawyer come now i see you are a young lady of rare good sense look the thing in the face sir charles is a landed gentleman he must marry and have heirs he is over thirty and his time has come he has shown himself your friend why not be his he has given you the means to marry a gentleman of moderate income or to marry beneath you if you prefer it and most of us do then why not make his path smooth why distress him with your tears and remonstrances he continued in this strain for some time appealing to her good sense and her better feelings when he had done she said very quietly how about the ponies and my brown mare are they down in the deed i think not but if you will do your part handsomely i'll guarantee you shall have them you are a good soul then after a pause now just you tell me exactly what you want me to do for all this oldfield was pleased with this question he said i wish you to abstain from writing to sir charles and him to visit you only once more before his marriage just to shake hands and part with mutual friendship and good wishes you are right said she softly best for us both and only fair to the girl then with sudden and eager curiosity is she very pretty i don't know what hasn't he told you he says she is lovely and every way adorable but then he is in love the chances are she is not half so handsome as yourself and yet he is in love with her over head and ears i don't believe it if he was really in love with one woman he couldn't be just to another i couldn't he'll be coming back to me in a few months god forbid thank you old gentleman mr oldfield began to stammer excuses she interrupted him oh bother all that i like you none the worse for speaking your mind then after a pause now excuse me but suppose sir charles should change his mind and never sign this paper i pledge my professional credit that is enough sir i see i can trust you well then i consent to break off with sir charles and only see him once more as a friend poor sir charles i hope he will be happy she squeezed out a tear for him happier than i am and when he does come he can sign the deed you know mr oldfield left her and joined sir charles at long's as had been previously agreed it is all right sir charles she is a sensible girl and will give you no further trouble how did you get over the hysterics we dispensed with them she saw at once it was to be business not sentiment you are to pay her one more visit to sign and part friends if you please i'll make that appointment with both parties as soon as the deed is engrossed oh by the by she did shed a tear or two but she dried them to ask me for the ponies and the brown mare sir charles's vanity was mortified but he laughed it off and said she should have them of course so now his mind was at ease his conscience was at rest and he could give his whole time where he had given his heart richard bassett learned through his servant that the wedding dresses were ordered he called on miss somerset she was out polly opened the door and gave him a look of admiration due to his fresh color that encouraged him to try and enlist her in his service he questioned her and she told him in a general way how matters were going but said she why not come and talk to her yourself ten to one but she tells you she is pretty outspoken my pretty dear said richard she never will receive me oh but i'll make her said polly and she did exert her influence as follows lookee here the cousin's a coming to morrow and i've been and promised he should see you what did you do that for why he's a well looking chap and a beautiful color fresh from the country like me and he's a gentleman and got an estate belike and why not put yourn to hisn and so marry him and be a lady you might have me about ye all the same till my turn comes no no said rhoda that's not the man for me if ever i marry it must be one of my own sort or else a fool like marsh that i can make a slave of well any way you must see him not to make a fool of me for i did promise him which now i think on't 'twas very good of me for i could find in my heart to ask him down into the kitchen instead of bringing him upstairs to you all this ended somehow in mr bassett's being admitted to his anxious inquiry how matters stood she replied coolly that sir charles and herself were parted by mutual consent what after all your protestations said bassett bitterly but miss somerset was not in an irascible humor just then she shrugged her shoulders and said yes i remember i put myself in a passion and said some ridiculous things but one can't be always a fool i have come to my senses this sort of thing always does end you know most of them part enemies but he and i part friends and well wishers and you throw me over as if i was nobody said richard white with anger why what are you to me said the somerset oh i see you thought to make a cat's paw of me well you won't then in other words you have been bought off no i have not i am not to be bought by anybody and i am not to be insulted by you you ruffian how dare you come here and affront a lady in her own house a lady whose shoestrings your betters are ready to tie you brute if you want to be a landed proprietor go and marry some ugly old hag that's got it and no eyesight left to see you're no gentleman sir charles's land you'll never have a better man has got it and means to keep it for him and his here polly polly polly take this man down to the kitchen and teach him manners if you can he is not fit for my drawing room by a long chalk polly arrived in time to see the flashing eyes the swelling veins and to hear the fair orator's peroration what you are in your tantrums again said she come along sir needs must when the devil drives you'll break a blood vessel some day my lady like your father afore ye and with this homely suggestion which always sobered miss somerset and indeed frightened her out of her wits she withdrew the offender she did not take him into the kitchen but into the dining room and there he had a long talk with her and gave her a sovereign she promised to inform him if anything important should occur he went away pondering and scowling deeply chapter iv sir charles bassett was now living in elysium never was rake more thoroughly transformed every day he sat for hours at the feet of bella bruce admiring her soft feminine ways and virgin modesty even more than her beauty and her visible blush whenever he appeared suddenly and the soft commotion and yielding in her lovely frame whenever he drew near betrayed his magnetic influence and told all but the blind she adored him she would decline all invitations to dine with him and her father a strong minded old admiral whose authority was unbounded only to bella's regret very rarely exerted nothing would have pleased her more than to be forbidden this and commanded that but no the admiral was a lion with an enormous paw only he could not be got to put it into every pie in this charming society the hours glided and the wedding day drew close so deeply and sincerely was sir charles in love that when mr oldfield's letter came appointing the day and hour to sign miss somerset's deed he was unwilling to go and wrote back to ask if the deed could not be sent to his house mr oldfield replied that the parties to the deed and the witnesses must meet and it would be unadvisable for several reasons to irritate the lady's susceptibility previous to signature the appointment having been made at her house it had better remain so that day soon came sir charles being due in mayfair at pm compensated himself for the less agreeable business to come by going earlier than usual to portman square by this means he caught miss bruce and two other young ladies inspecting bridal dresses bella blushed and looked ashamed and to the surprise of her friends sent the dresses away and set herself to talk rationally with sir charles as rationally as lovers can the ladies took the cue and retired in disgust sir charles apologized this is too bad of me i come at an unheard of hour and frighten away your fair friends but the fact is i have an appointment at two and i don't know how long they will keep me so i thought i would make sure of two happy hours at the least and delightful hours they were bella bruce excited by this little surprise leaned softly on his shoulder and prattled her maiden love like some warbling fountain sir charles transfigured by love answered her in kind three months ago he could not and they compared pretty little plans of wedded life and had small differences and ended by agreeing complete and prompt accord upon two points first they would not have a single quarrel like other people their love should never lose its delicate bloom second they would grow old together and die the same day the same minute if possible if not they must be content with the same day but on that inexorable but soon after this came a skirmish each wanted to obey t'other sir charles argued that bella was better than he and therefore more fit to conduct the pair bella who thought him divinely good pounced on this reason furiously he defended it he admitted with exemplary candor that he was good now awfully good but he assured her that he had been anything but good until he knew her now she had been always good therefore he argued as his goodness came originally from her for her to obey him would be a little too much like the moon commanding the sun that is too ingenious for me charles said bella and for shame nobody was ever so good as you are i look up to you and now i could stop your mouth in a minute i have only to remind you that i shall swear at the altar to obey you and you will not swear to obey me but i will not crush you under the prayer book no dearest but indeed to obey is a want of my nature and i marry you to supply that want and that's a story for i marry you because i love and honor and worship and adore you to distraction my own own own with this she flung herself passionately yet modestly on his shoulder and being there murmured coaxingly you will let me obey you charles thereupon sir charles felt highly gelatinous and lost for the moment all power of resistance or argument ah you will and then you will remind me of my dear mother she knew how to command but as for poor dear papa he is very disappointing in selecting an admiral for my parent i made sure of being ordered about instead of that now i'll show you there he is in the next room inventing a new system of signals poor dear she threw the folding doors open papa dear shall i ask charles to dinner to day as you please my dear do you think i had better walk or ride this afternoon whichever you prefer there said bella i told you so that is always the way papa dear you used always to be firing guns at sea do please fire one in this house just one before i leave it and make the very windows rattle i beg your pardon bella i never wasted powder at sea if the convoy sailed well and steered right i never barked at them you are a modest sensible girl and have always steered a good course why should i hoist a petticoat and play the small tyrant wait till i see you going to do something wrong or silly ah then you would fire a gun papa ay a broadside well that is something said bella as she closed the door softly no no it amounts to just nothing said sir charles for you never will do anything wrong or silly i'll accommodate you i have thought of a way i shall give you some blank cards you shall write on them 'i think i should like to do so and so' you shall be careless and leave them about i'll find them and bluster and say 'i command you to do so and so bella bassett' the very thing on the card you know bella colored to the brow with pleasure and modesty after a pause she said how sweet the worst of it is i should get my own way now what i want is to submit my will to yours a gentle tyrant that is what you must be to bella bassett oh you sweet sweet for calling me that these projects were interrupted by a servant announcing luncheon this made sir charles look hastily at his watch and he found it was past two o'clock how time flies in this house said he i must go dearest i am behind my appointment already what do you do this afternoon whatever you please my own i could get away by four then i will stay at home for you he left her reluctantly and she followed him to the head of the stairs and hung over the balusters as if she would like to fly after him he turned at the street door saw that radiant and gentle face beaming after him and they kissed hands to each other by one impulse as if they were parting for ever so long he had gone scarcely half an hour when a letter addressed to her was left at the door by a private messenger any answer inquired the servant no the letter was sent up and delivered to her on a silver salver she opened it it was a thing new to her in her young life an anonymous letter miss bruce i am almost a stranger to you but i know your character from others and cannot bear to see you abused you are said to be about to marry sir charles bassett i think you can hardly be aware that he is connected with a lady of doubtful repute called somerset and neither your beauty nor your virtue has prevailed to detach him from that connection if on engaging himself to you he had abandoned her i should not have said a word but the truth is he visits her constantly and i blush to say that when he leaves you this day it will be to spend the afternoon at her house i inclose you her address and you can learn in ten minutes whether i am a slanderer or what i wish to be a friend of injured innocence chapter v sir charles was behind his time in mayfair but the lawyer and his clerk had not arrived and miss somerset was not visible she appeared however at last in a superb silk dress the broad luster of which would have been beautiful only the effect was broken and frittered away by six rows of gimp and fringe but why blame her this is a blunder in art as universal as it is amazing when one considers the amount of apparent thought her sex devotes to dress they might just as well score a fair plot of velvet turf with rows of box or tattoo a blooming and downy cheek she held out her hand like a man and talked to sir charles on indifferent topics till mr oldfield arrived she then retired into the background and left the gentlemen to discuss the deed when appealed to she evaded direct replies and put on languid and imperial indifference when she signed it was with the air of some princess bestowing a favor upon solicitation but the business concluded she thawed all in a moment and invited the gentlemen to luncheon with charming cordiality indeed her genuine bonhomie after her affected indifference was rather comic everybody was content champagne flowed the lady with her good mother wit kept conversation going till the lawyer was nearly missing his next appointment he hurried away and sir charles only lingered out of good breeding to bid miss somerset good by in the course of leave taking he said he was sorry he left her with people about her of whom he had a bad opinion those women have no more feeling for you than stones when you lay in convulsions your housekeeper looked on as philosophically as if you had been two kittens at play you and polly i saw her indeed you appeared hardly in a condition to see anything i did though and heard the old wretch tell the young monkey to water my lilac dress that was to get it for her polly she knew i'd never wear it afterward then why don't you turn her off who'd take such a useless old hag if i turned her off you carry a charity a long way i carry everything what's the use doing things by halves good or bad well but that polly she is young enough to get her living elsewhere and she is extremely disrespectful to you that she is if i wasn't a lady i'd have given her a good hiding this very day for her cheek then why not turn her off this very day for her cheek well i'll tell you since you and i are parted forever no i don't like oh come no secrets between friends well then the old hag is my mother what and the young jade is my sister good heavens and the page is my little brother ha ha ha what you are not angry angry no ha ha ha see what a hornets' nest you have escaped from my dear friend those two women rob me through thick and thin they steal my handkerchiefs and my gloves and my very linen they drink my wine like fishes they'd take the hair off my head if it wasn't fast by the roots for a wonder why not give them a ten pound note and send them home they'd pocket the note and blacken me in our village that was why i had them up here first time i went home after running about with that little scamp vandeleur do you know him i have not the honor then your luck beats mine one thing he is going to the dogs as fast as he can some day he'll come begging to me for a fiver you mark my words now well but you were saying yes i went off about van polly says i've a mind like running water well then when i went home the first time after van mother and polly raised a virtuous howl 'all right' said i for of course i know how much virtue there is under their skins virtue of the lower orders tell that to gentlefolks that don't know them i do i've been one of 'em 'i know all about that' says i 'you want to share the plunder that is the sense of your virtuous cry' so i had 'em up here and then there was no more virtuous howling but a deal of virtuous thieving and modest drinking and pure minded selling of my street door to the highest male bidder and they will corrupt the boy and if they do i'll cuts their black hearts out with my riding whip but i suppose i must keep them on they are my own flesh and blood and if i was to be ill and dying they'd do all they knew to keep me alive for their own sakes i'm their milch cow these country innocents sir charles groaned aloud and said my poor girl you deserve a better fate than this marry some honest fellow and cut the whole thing i'll see about it you try it first and let us see how you like it and so they parted gayly in the hall polly intercepted him all smiles he looked at her smiled in his sleeve and gave her a handsome present if you please sir said she an old gentleman called for you when about an hour ago leastways he asked if sir charles bassett was there i said yes but you wouldn't see no one who could it be why surely you never told anybody i was to be here to day la no sir how could i said polly with a face of brass sir charles thought this very odd and felt a little uneasy about it all to portman square he puzzled over it and at last he was driven to the conclusion that miss somerset had been weak enough to tell some person male or female of the coming interview and so somebody had called there doubtless to ask him a favor at five o'clock he reached portman square and was about to enter as a matter of course but the footman stopped him i beg pardon sir charles said the man looking pale and agitated but i have strict orders my young lady is very ill ill let me go to her this instant i daren't sir charles i daren't i know you are a gentleman pray don't lose me my place you would never get to see her we none of us know the rights but there's something up sorry to say it sir charles but we have strict orders not to admit you haven't you the admiral's letter sir no what letter he has been after you sir and when he came back he sent roger off to your house with a letter a cold chill began to run down sir charles bassett he hailed a passing hansom and drove to his own house to get the admiral's letter and as he went he asked himself with chill misgivings what on earth had happened what had happened shall be told the reader precisely but briefly in the first place bella had opened the anonymous letter and read its contents to which the reader is referred there are people who pretend to despise anonymous letters pure delusion they know they ought to and so fancy they do but they don't the absence of a signature gives weight if the letter is ably written and seems true as for poor bella bruce a dove's bosom is no more fit to rebuff a poisoned arrow than she was to combat that foulest and direst of all a miscreant's weapons an anonymous letter she in her goodness and innocence never dreamed that any person she did not know could possibly tell a lie to wound her the letter fell on her like a cruel revelation from heaven the blow was so savage that at first it stunned her she sat pale and stupefied but beneath the stupor were the rising throbs of coming agonies after that horrible stupor her anguish grew and grew till it found vent in a miserable cry rising and rising and rising in agony mamma mamma mamma yes her mother had been dead these three years and her father sat in the next room yet in her anguish she cried to her mother a cry the which if your mother had heard she would have expected bella's to come to her even from the grave admiral bruce heard this fearful cry the living calling on the dead and burst through the folding doors in a moment white as a ghost he found his daughter writhing on the sofa ghastly and grinding in her hand the cursed paper that had poisoned her young life my child my child oh papa see see and she tried to open the letter for him but her hands trembled so she could not he kneeled down by her side the stout old warrior and read the letter while she clung to him moaning now and quivering all over from head to foot why there's no signature the writer is a coward and perhaps a liar stop he offers a test i'll put him to it this minute he laid the moaning girl on the sofa ordered his servants to admit nobody into the house and drove at once to mayfair he called at miss somerset's house saw polly and questioned her he drove home again and came into the drawing room looking as he had been seen to look when fighting his ship but his daughter had never seen him so my girl said he solemnly there's nothing for you to do but to be brave and hide your grief as well as you can for the man is unworthy of your love that coward spoke the truth he is there at this moment oh papa papa let me die the world is too wicked for me let me die die for an unworthy object for shame go to your own room my girl and pray to your god to help you since your mother has left us oh how i miss her now go and pray and let no one else know what we suffer be your father's daughter fight and pray poor bella had no longer to complain that she was not commanded she kissed him and burst into a great passion of weeping but he led her to the door and she tottered to her own room a blighted girl the sight of her was harrowing under its influence the admiral dashed off a letter to sir charles calling him a villain and inviting him to go to france and let an indignant father write scoundrel on his carcass but when he had written this his good sense and dignity prevailed over his fury he burned the letter and wrote another this he sent by hand to sir charles's house and ordered his servants but that the reader knows sir charles found the admiral's letter in his letter rack it ran thus sir we have learned your connection with a lady named somerset and i have ascertained that you went from my daughter to her house this very day miss bruce and myself withdraw from all connection with you and i must request you to attempt no communication with her of any kind such an attempt would be an additional insult i am sir your obedient servant john urquhart bruce at first sir charles bassett was stunned by this blow then his mind resisted the admiral's severity and he was indignant at being dismissed for so common an offense this gave way to deep grief and shame at the thought of bella and her lost esteem but soon all other feelings merged for a time in fury at the heartless traitor who had destroyed his happiness and had dashed the cup of innocent love from his very lips boiling over with mortification and rage he drove at once to that traitor's house polly opened the door he rushed past her and burst into the dining room breathless and white with passion he found miss somerset studying the deed by which he had made her independent for life she started at his strange appearance and instinctively put both hands flat upon the deed you vile wretch cried sir charles you heartless monster enjoy your work and he flung her the admiral's letter but he did not wait while she read it he heaped reproaches on her and for the first time in her life she did not reply in kind are you mad she faltered what have i done you have told admiral bruce that's false you told him i was to be here to day charles i never did believe me you did nobody knew it but you he was here to day at the very hour may i never get up alive off this chair if i told a soul yes our polly i'll ring for her no you will not she is your sister do you think i'll take the word of such reptiles against the plain fact you have parted my love and me parted us on the very day i had made you independent for life an innocent love was waiting to bless me and an honest love was in your power thanks to me your kind forgiving friend and benefactor i have heaped kindness on you from the first moment i had the misfortune to know you i connived at your infidelities charles don't say that i never was i indulged your most expensive whims and instead of leaving you with a curse as all the rest did that ever knew you and as you deserve i bought your consent to lead a respectable life and be blessed with a virtuous love you took the bribe but robbed me of the blessing viper you have destroyed me body and soul monster perhaps blighted her happiness as well you she devils hate an angel worse than heaven hates you but you shall suffer with us not your heart for you have none but your pocket you have broken faith with me and sent all my happiness to hell i'll send your deed to hell after it with this he flung himself upon the deed and was going to throw it into the fire now up to that moment she had been overpowered by this man's fury whom she had never seen the least angry before but when he laid hands on her property it acted like an electric shock no no she screamed and sprang at him like a wildcat then ensued a violent and unseemly struggle all about the room chairs were upset and vases broken to pieces and the man and woman dragged each other to and fro one fighting for her property as if it was her life and the other for revenge sir charles excited by fury was stronger than himself and at last shook off one of her hands for a moment and threw the deed into the fire she tried to break from him and save it but he held her like iron yet not for long while he was holding her back and she straining every nerve to get to the fire he began to show sudden symptoms of distress he gasped loudly and cried oh oh i'm choking and then his clutch relaxed she tore herself from it and plunging forward rescued the smoking parchment at that moment she heard a great stagger behind her and a pitiful moan and sir charles fell heavily striking his head against the edge of the sofa she looked round as she knelt and saw him black in the face rolling his eyeballs fearfully while his teeth gnashed awfully and a little jet of foam flew through his lips then she shrieked with terror and the blackened deed fell from her hands at this moment polly rushed into the room she saw the fearful sight and echoed her sister's scream but they were neither of them women to lose their heads and beat the air with their hands they got to him and both of them fought hard with the unconscious sufferer whose body in a fresh convulsion now bounded away from the sofa and bade fair to batter itself against the ground they did all they could to hold him with one arm apiece and to release his swelling throat with the other their nimble fingers whipped off his neck tie in a moment but the distended windpipe pressed so against the shirt button they could not undo it then they seized the collar and pulling against each other wrenched the shirt open so powerfully that the button flew into the air and tinkled against a mirror a long way off a few more struggles somewhat less violent and then the face from purple began to whiten the eyeballs fixed the pulse went down the man lay still oh my god cried rhoda somerset he is dying to the nearest doctor there's one three doors off no bonnet it's life and death this moment fly polly obeyed and doctor andrews was actually in the room within five minutes he looked grave and kneeled down by the patient and felt his pulse anxiously miss somerset sat down and being from the country though she did not look it began to weep bitterly and rock herself in rustic fashion the doctor questioned her kindly and she told him between her sobs how sir charles had been taken the doctor however instead of being alarmed by those frightful symptoms she related took a more cheerful view directly then do not alarm yourself unnecessarily he said it was only an epileptic fit only sobbed miss somerset oh if you had seen him and he lies like death yes said dr andrews a severe epileptic fit is really a terrible thing to look at but it is not dangerous in proportion is he used to have them oh no doctor never had one before here she was mistaken i think you must keep him quiet and give him a moderate stimulant as soon as he can swallow comfortably the quietest room in the house and don't let him be hungry night or day have food by his bedside and watch him for a day or two i'll come again this evening the doctor went to his dinner tranquil not so those he left miss somerset resigned her own luxurious bedroom and had the patient laid just as he was upon her bed she sent the page out to her groom and ordered two loads of straw to be laid before the door and she watched by the sufferer with brandy and water by her side sir charles now might have seemed to be in a peaceful slumber but for his eyes they were open and showed more white and less pupil than usual however in time he began to sigh and move and even mutter and gradually some little color came back to his pale cheeks then miss somerset had the good sense to draw back out of his sight and order polly to take her place by his side polly did so and some time afterward at a fresh order put a teaspoonful of brandy to his lips which were still pale and even bluish the doctor returned and brought his assistant they put the patient to bed his life is in no danger said he i wish i was as sure about his reason at one o'clock in the morning as polly was snoring by the patient's bedside a hand was laid on her shoulder it was rhoda go to bed polly you are no use here you'd be sleepy if you worked as hard as i do very likely said rhoda with a gentleness that struck polly as very singular good night rhoda spent the night watching and thinking harder than she had ever thought before next morning early polly came into the sick room there sat her sister watching the patient out of sight la rhoda have you sat there all night yes don't speak so loud come here you've set your heart on this lilac silk i'll give it to you for your black merino not you my lady you are not so fond of mereeny nor of me neither i'm not a liar like you said the other becoming herself for a moment and what i say i'll do you put out your merino for me in the dressing room all right said polly joyfully and bring me two buckets of water instead of one i have never closed my eyes poor soul and now you be going to sluice yourself all the same whatever you can see in cold water to run after it so i can't think if i was to flood myself like you it would soon float me to my long home how do you know you never gave it a trial come no more chat give me my bath and then you may wash yourself in a tea cup if you like only don't wash my spoons in the same water for mercy's sake thus affectionately stimulated in her duties polly brought cold water galore and laid out her new merino dress in this sober suit with plain linen collar and cuffs the somerset dressed herself and resumed her watching by the bedside she kept more than ever out of sight for the patient was now beginning to mutter incoherently yet in a way that showed his clouded faculties were dwelling on the calamity which had befallen him about noon the bell was rung sharply and on polly entering rhoda called her to the window and showed her two female figures plodding down the street look said she those are the only women i envy sisters of charity run you after them and take a good look at those beastly ugly caps then come and tell me how to make one here's a go said polly but executed the commission promptly it needed no fashionable milliner to turn a yard of linen into one of those ugly caps which are beautiful banners of christian charity and womanly tenderness to the sick and suffering the monster cap was made in an hour and miss somerset put it on and a thick veil and then she no longer thought it necessary to sit out of the patient's sight the consequence was that in the middle of his ramblings he broke off and looked at her the sister puzzled him at last he called to her in french she made no reply je suis a l'hopital n'est ce pas bonne soeur i am english said she softly chapter vi english said sir charles then tell me how did i come here where am i you had a fit and the doctor ordered you to be kept quiet and i am here to nurse you a fit ay i remember that vile woman don't think of her give your mind to getting well remember there is somebody who would break her heart if you oh my poor bella my sweet timid modest loving bella he was so weakened that he cried like a child miss somerset rose and laid her forehead sadly upon the window sill why do i cry for her like a great baby muttered sir charles she wouldn't cry for me she has cast me off in a moment not she it is her father's doing have a little patience the whole thing shall be explained to them and then she will soon soften the old man 'it is not as if you were really to blame no more i was it is all that vile woman oh don't she is so sorry she has taken it all to heart she had once shammed a fit on the very place and when you had a real fit there on the very spot oh it was so fearful and lay like one dead she saw god's finger and it touched her hard heart don't say anything more against her just now she is trying so hard to be good and besides it is all a mistake she never told that old admiral she never breathed a word out of her own house her own people have betrayed her and you she has made me promise two things to find out who told the admiral and well the second thing i have to do well that is a secret between me and that unhappy woman she is bad enough but not so heartless as you think sir charles shook his head incredulously but said no more and soon after fell asleep in the evening he woke and found the sister watching she now turned her head away from him and asked him quietly to describe miss bella bruce to her he described her in minute and glowing terms but oh sister said he it is not her beauty only but the beauty of her mind so gentle so modest so timid so docile she would never have had the heart to turn me off but she will obey her father she looked forward to obey me sweet dove did she say so yes that is her dream of happiness to obey the sister still questioned him with averted head and he told her what had passed between bella and him the last time he saw her and all their innocent plans of married happiness he told her with the tear in his eye and she listened with the tear in hers and then said he laying his hand on her shoulder is it not hard i just went to mayfair not to please myself but to do an act of justice of more than justice and then for that to have her door shut in my face only two hours between the height of happiness and the depth of misery the sister said nothing but she hid her face in her hands and thought the next morning by her order polly came into the room and said you are to go home the carriage is at the door with this she retired and sir charles's valet entered the room soon after to help him dress where am i james miss somerset's house sir charles then get me out of it directly yes sir charles the carriage is at the door who told you to come james miss somerset sir charles that is odd yes sir charles when he got home he found a sofa placed by a fire with wraps and pillows his cigar case laid out and a bottle of salts and also a small glass of old cognac in case of faintness which of you had the gumption to do all this miss somerset sir charles what has she been here yes sir charles curse her yes sir charles chapter vii love lies bleeding bella bruce was drinking the bitterest cup a young virgin soul can taste illusion gone the wicked world revealed as it is how unlike what she thought it was love crushed in her and not crushed out of her as it might if she had been either proud or vain frail men and women should see what a passionate but virtuous woman can suffer when a revelation of which they think but little comes and blasts her young heart and bids her dry up in a moment the deep well of her affection since it flows for an unworthy object and flows in vain i tell you that the fair head severed from the chaste body is nothing to her compared with this the fair body pierced with heathen arrows was nothing to her in the days of old compared with this in a word for nowadays we can but amplify and so enfeeble what some old dead master of language immortal though obscure has said in words of granite here love lay bleeding no fainting no vehement weeping but oh such deep desolation such weariness of life such a pitiable restlessness appetite gone the taste of food almost lost sleep unwilling to come and oh the torture of waking for at that horrible moment all rushed back at once the joy that had been the misery that was the blank that was to come she never stirred out except when ordered and then went like an automaton pale sorrow stricken and patient she moved about the ghost of herself and lay down a little and then tried to work a little and then to read a little and could settle to nothing but sorrow and deep despondency not that she nursed her grief she had been told to be brave and she tried but her grief was her master it came welling through her eyes in a moment of its own accord she was deeply mortified too but in her gentle nature anger could play but a secondary part her indignation was weak beside her grief and did little to bear her up yet her sense of shame was vivid and she tried hard not to let her father see how deeply she loved the man who had gone from her to miss somerset besides he had ordered her to fight against a love that now could only degrade her he had ordered and it was for her to obey as soon as sir charles was better he wrote her a long humble letter owning that before he knew her he had led a free life but assuring her that ever since that happy time his heart and his time had been solely hers as to his visit to miss somerset it had been one of business merely and this he could prove if she would receive him the admiral could be present at that interview and sir charles hoped to convince him he had been somewhat hasty and harsh in his decision now the admiral had foreseen sir charles would write to her so he had ordered his man to bring all letters to him first he recognized sir charles's hand and brought the latter in to bella now my child said he be brave here is a letter from that man oh papa i thought he would i knew he would and the pale face was flushed with joy and hope all in a moment do what write and explain explain a thing that is clear as sunshine he has written to throw dust in your eyes again you are evidently in no state to judge i shall read this letter first yes papa said bella faintly he did read it and she devoured his countenance all the time there is nothing in it he offers no real explanation but only says he can explain and asks for an interview to play upon your weakness if i give you this letter it will only make you cry and render your task more difficult i must be strong for your good and set you an example i loved this young man too but now i know him then he actually thrust the letter into the fire but this was too much bella shrieked at the act and put her hand to her heart and shrieked again ah you'll kill us you'll kill us both she cried poor charles poor bella you don't love your child you have no pity and for the first time her misery was violent she writhed and wept and at last went into violent hysterics and frightened that stout old warrior more than cannon had ever frightened him and presently she became quiet and wept at his knees and begged his forgiveness and said he was wiser than she was and she would obey him in everything only he must not be angry with her if she could not live then the stout admiral mingled his tears with hers and began to realize what deep waters of affliction his girl was wading in yet he saw no way out but firmness he wrote to sir charles to say that his daughter was too ill to write but that no explanation was possible and no interview could be allowed sir charles who after writing had conceived the most sanguine hopes was now as wretched as bella only now that he was refused a hearing he had wounded pride to support him a little under wounded love admiral bruce fearing for his daughter's health and even for her life she pined so visibly now ordered her to divide her day into several occupations and exact divisions of time an hour for this an hour for that an hour by the clock and here he showed practical wisdom try it ye that are very unhappy and tell me the result as a part of this excellent system she had to walk round the square from eleven to twelve a m but never alone he was not going to have sir charles surprising her into an interview he always went with her and as he was too stiff to walk briskly he sat down and she had to walk in sight he took a stout stick with him for sir charles but sir charles was proud and stayed at home with his deep wound one day walking round the square with a step of mercury and heart of lead bella bruce met a sister of charity pacing slow and thoughtful their eyes met and drank in a moment every feature of each other the sister apparently had seen the settled grief on that fair face for the next time they met she eyed her with a certain sympathy which did not escape bella this subtle interchange took place several times and bella could not help feeling a little grateful ah she thought to herself how kind religious people are i should like to speak to her and the next time they met she looked wistfully in the sister's face she did not meet her again for she went and rested on a bench in sight of her father but at some distance from him unconsciously to herself his refusal even to hear sir charles repelled her that was so hard on him and her it looked like throwing away the last chance the last little chance of happiness by and by the sister came and sat on the same bench bella was hardly surprised but blushed high for she felt that her own eyes had invited the sympathy of a stranger and now it seemed to be coming the timid girl felt uneasy the sister saw that and approached her with tact you look unwell said she gently but with no appearance of extravagant interest or curiosity i am a little said bella very reservedly excuse my remarking it we are professional nurses and apt to be a little officious i fear no reply i saw you were unwell but i hope it is not serious i can generally tell when the sick are in danger a peculiar look i am glad not to see it in so young and good a face you are young too very young and she was going to say beautiful but she was too shy to be a sister of charity but i am sure you never regret leaving such a world as this is never i have lost the only thing i ever valued in it i have no right to ask you what that was you shall know without asking one i loved proved unworthy the sister sighed deeply and then hiding her face with her hands for a moment rose abruptly and left the square ashamed apparently of having been betrayed into such a confession bella when she was twenty yards off put out a timid hand as if to detain her but she had not the courage to say anything of the kind she never told her father a word she had got somebody now who could sympathize with her better than he could next day the sister was there and bella bowed to her when she met her this time it was the sister who went and sat on the bench bella continued her walk for some time but at last could not resist the temptation she came and sat down on the bench and blushed as much as to say i have the courage to come but not to speak upon a certain subject which shall be nameless the sister as may be imagined was not so shy she opened a conversation i committed a fault yesterday i spoke to you of myself and of the past it is discouraged by our rules we are bound to inquire the griefs of others not to tell our own this was a fair opening but bella was too delicate to show her wounds to a fresh acquaintance the sister having failed at that tried something very different but i could tell you a pitiful case about another some time ago i nursed a gentleman whom love had laid on a sick bed a gentleman what can they love as we do said bella bitterly not many of them but this was an exception but i don't know whether i ought to tell these secrets to so young a lady oh yes please what else is there in this world worth talking about tell me about the poor man who could love as we can the sister seemed to hesitate but at last decided to go on well he was a man of the world and he had not always been a good man but he was trying to be he had fallen in love with a young lady and seen the beauty of virtue and was going to marry her and lead a good life but he was a man of honor and there was a lady for whom he thought it was his duty to provide he set his lawyer to draw a deed and his lawyer appointed a day for signing it at her house the poor man came because his lawyer told him do you think there was any great harm in that no of course not well then he lost his love for that miss bruce's color began to come and go and her supple figure to crouch a little she said nothing the sister continued some malicious person went and told the young lady's father the gentleman was in the habit of visiting that lady and would be with her at a certain hour and so he was but it was the lawyer's appointment you know you seem agitated no no not agitated said bella but astonished it is so like a story i know a young lady a friend of mine had an anonymous letter telling her that one she loved and esteemed was unworthy but what you have told me shows me how deceitful appearances may be what was your patient's name it is against our rules to tell that but you said an 'anonymous letter' was your friend so weak as to believe an anonymous letter the writer of such a letter is a coward and a coward always is a liar show me your friend's anonymous letter i may perhaps be able to throw a light on it the conversation was interrupted by admiral bruce who had approached them unobserved excuse me said he but you ladies seem to have hit upon a very interesting theme yes papa said bella i took the liberty to question this lady as to her experiences of sick beds and she was good enough to give me some of them having uttered this with a sudden appearance of calmness that first amazed the sister then made her smile she took her father's arm bowed politely and a little stiffly to her new friend and drew the admiral away oh thought the sister i am not to speak to the old gentleman he is not in her confidence yet she is very fond of him how she hangs on his arm simplicity candor we are all tarred with the same stick we women that night bella was a changed girl exalted and depressed by turns and with no visible reason her father was pleased anything better than that deadly languor the next day bella sat by her father's side in the square longing to go to the sister yet patiently waiting to be ordered at last the admiral finding her dull and listless said why don't you go and talk to the sister she amuses you i'll join you when i have smoked this cigar the obedient bella rose and went toward the sister as if compelled but when she got to her her whole manner changed she took her warmly by the hand and said trembling and blushing and all on fire i have brought you the anonymous letter the elder actress took it and ran her eye over it an eye that now sparkled like a diamond humph said she and flung off all the dulcet tones of her assumed character with mighty little ceremony this hand is disguised a little but i think i know it i am sure i do the dirty little rascal madam cried bella aghast with surprise at this language i tell you i know the writer and his rascally motive you must lend me this for a day or two must i said bella excuse me papa would be so angry very likely but you will lend it to me for all that for with this i can clear miss bruce's lover and defeat his enemies bella uttered a faint cry and trembled and her bosom heaved violently she looked this way and that like a frightened deer but papa his eye is on us never deceive your father said the sister almost sternly but darting her gray eyes right into those dove like orbs give me five minutes' start if you really love sir charles bassett with these words she carried off the letter and bella ran blushing panting trembling to her father and clung to him he questioned her but could get nothing from her very intelligible until the sister was out of sight and then she told him all without reserve i was unworthy of him to doubt him an anonymous slander i'll never trust appearances again poor charles oh my darling what he must have suffered if he loves like me then came a shower of happy tears then a shower of happy kisses the admiral groaned but for a long time he could not get a word in when he did it was chilling my poor girl said he this unhappy love blinds you what don't you see the woman is no nun but some sly hussy that man has sent to throw dust in your eyes nothing she could say prevailed to turn him from this view and he acted upon it with resolution he confined her excursions to a little garden at the back of the house and forbade her on any pretense to cross the threshold miss somerset came to the square in another disguise armed with important information but no bella bruce appeared to meet her all this time richard bassett was happy as a prince so besotted was he with egotism and so blinded by imaginary wrongs that he rejoiced in the lovers' separation rejoiced in his cousin's attack polly who now regarded him almost as a lover told him all about it and already in anticipation he saw himself and his line once more lords of the two manors bassett and huntercombe on the demise of sir charles bassett bart deceased without issue and in fact sir charles was utterly defeated he lay torpid but there was a tough opponent in the way all the more dangerous that she was not feared one fine day miss somerset electrified her groom by ordering her pony carriage to the door at ten a m she took the reins on the pavement like a man jumped in light as a feather and away rattled the carriage into the city the ponies were all alive the driver's eye keen as a bird's her courage and her judgment equal she wound in and out among the huge vehicles with perfect composure and on those occasions when the traffic being interrupted the oratorical powers were useful to fill up the time she shone with singular brilliance the west end is too often in debt to the city but in the matter of chaff it was not so this day for whenever she took a peck she returned a bushel and so she rattled to the door of solomon oldfield solicitor old jewry she penetrated into the inner office of that worthy and told him he must come with her that minute to portman square impossible madam and as they say in the law reports gave his reasons certain sir and gave no reasons he still resisted thereupon she told him she should sit there all day and chaff his clients one after another and that his connection with the bassett and huntercombe estates should end then he saw he had to do with a termagant and consented with a sigh she drove him westward wincing every now and then at her close driving and told him all and showed him what she was pleased to call her little game he told her it was too romantic said he you ladies read nothing but novels but the real world is quite different from the world of novels having delivered this remonstrance which was tolerably just for she never read anything but novels and sermons he submitted like a lamb and received her instructions she drove as fast as she talked so that by this time they were at admiral bruce's door now mr oldfield took the lead as per instructions mr oldfield solicitor and a lady on business the porter delivered this to the footman with the accuracy which all who send verbal messages deserve and may count on mr oldfield and lady the footman who represented the next step in oral tradition without which form of history the heathen world would never have known that hannibal softened the rocks with vinegar nor the christian world that eleven thousand virgins dwelt in a german town the size of putney announced the pair as mr and mrs hautville i don't know them i think well i will see them they entered and the admiral stared a little and wondered how this couple came together the keen but plain old man with clothes hanging on him and the dashing beauty with her dress in the height of the fashion and her gauntleted hands however he bowed ceremoniously and begged his visitors to be seated now the folding doors were ajar and the soi disant mrs oldfield peeped she saw bella bruce at some distance seated by the fire in a reverie judge that young lady's astonishment when she looked up and observed a large white well shaped hand sparkling with diamonds and rubies beckoning her furtively the owner of that sparkling hand soon heard a soft rustle of silk come toward the door the very rustle somehow was eloquent and betrayed love and timidity and something innocent yet subtle the jeweled hand went in again directly chapter viii meantime mr oldfield began to tell the admiral who he was and that he was come to remove a false impression about a client of his sir charles bassett that sir said the admiral sternly is a name we never mention here he rose and went to the folding doors and deliberately closed them the somerset thus defeated bit her lip and sat all of a heap like a cat about to spring looking sulky and vicious mr oldfield persisted and as he took the admiral's hint and lowered his voice he was interrupted no more but made a simple statement of those facts which are known to the reader admiral bruce heard them and admitted that the case was not quite so bad as he had thought then mr oldfield proposed that sir charles should be re admitted no said the old admiral firmly turn it how you will it is too ugly the bloom of the thing is gone why should my daughter take that woman's leavings why should i give her pure heart to a man about town because you will break it else said miss somerset with affected politeness give her credit for more dignity madam if you please replied admiral bruce with equal politeness oh bother dignity cried the somerset at this free phrase from so well dressed a lady admiral bruce opened his eyes and inquired of oldfield rather satirically who was this lady that did him the honor to interfere in his family affairs oldfield looked confused but somerset full of mother wit was not to be caught napping i'm a by stander and they always see clearer than the folk themselves you are a man of honor sir and you are very clever at sea no doubt and a fighter and all that but you are no match for land sharks you are being made a dupe and a tool of who do you think wrote that anonymous letter to your daughter a friend of truth a friend of injured innocence nothing of the sort one richard bassett sir charles's cousin here mr oldfield please compare these two handwritings closely and you will see i am right she put down the anonymous letter and richard bassett's letter to herself but she could not wait for mr oldfield to compare the documents now her tongue was set going yes gentlemen this is new to you but you'll find that little scheming rascal wrote them both and with as base a motive and as black a heart as any other anonymous coward's his game is to make sir charles bassett die childless and so then this dirty fellow would inherit the estate and owing to you being so green and swallowing an anonymous letter like pure water from the spring he very nearly got his way sir charles has been at death's door along of all this hush madam not so loud please whispered admiral bruce looking uneasily toward the folding doors why not bawled the somerset the truth may be blamed but it can't be shamed i tell you that your precious letter brought sir charles bassett to the brink of the grave soon as ever he got it he came tearing in his cab to miss somerset's house and accused her of telling the lie to keep him and he might have known better for the jade never did a sneaking thing in her life but any way he thought it must be her doing miscalled her like a dog and raged at her dreadful and at last what with love and fury and despair he had the terriblest fit you ever saw he fell down as black as your hat and his eyes rolled and his teeth gnashed and he foamed at the mouth and took four to hold him and presently as white as a ghost and given up for dead no pulse for hours and when his life came back his reason was gone good heavens madam for a time it was how he did rave and 'bella' the only name on his lips and now he lies in his own house as weak as water come old gentleman don't you be too hard you are not a child like your daughter take the world as it is do you think you will ever find a man of fortune who has not had a lady friend why every single gentleman in london that can afford to keep a saddle horse has an article of that sort in some corner or other and if he parts with her as soon as his banns are cried that is all you can expect do you think any mother in belgravia would make a row about that they are downier than you are they would shrug their aristocratic shoulders and decline to listen to the past lives of their sons in law unless it was all in the newspapers mind you if belgravian mothers have mercenary minds that is no reason why i should whose cheeks have bronzed in the service of a virtuous queen and whose hairs have whitened in honor on receiving this broadside the somerset altered her tone directly and said obsequiously that is true sir and i beg your pardon for comparing you to the trash but brave men are pitiful you know then show your pity here pity a gentleman that repented his faults as soon as your daughter showed him there was a better love within reach and now lies stung by an anonymous viper and almost dying of love and mortification and pity your own girl that will soon lose her health and perhaps her life if you don't give in she is not so weak madam she is in better spirits already ay but then she didn't know what he had suffered for her she does now for i heard her moan and she will die for him now or else she will give you twice as many kisses as usual some day and cry a bucketful over you and then run away with her lover i know women better than you do i am one of the precious lot the admiral replied only with a look of superlative scorn this incensed the somerset and that daring woman whose ear was nearer to the door and had caught sounds that escaped the men actually turned the handle and while her eye flashed defiance her vigorous foot spurned the folding doors wide open in half a moment bella bruce lay with her head sidewise on the table and her hands extended moaning and sobbing piteously for poor sir charles for shame madam to expose my child cried the admiral bursting with indignation and grief he rushed to her and took her in his arms she scarcely noticed him for the moment he turned her she caught sight of miss somerset and recognized her face in a moment ah the sister of charity she cried and stretched out her hands to her with a look and a gesture so innocent confiding and imploring that the somerset already much excited by her own eloquence took a turn not uncommon with termagants and began to cry herself but she soon stopped that for she saw her time was come to go and avoid unpleasant explanations she made a dart and secured the two letters settle it among yourselves said she wheeling round and bestowing this advice on the whole party then shot a sharp arrow at the admiral as she fled if you must be a tool of richard bassett don't be a tool and a dupe by halves he is in love with her too marry her to the blackguard and then you will be sure to kill sir charles having delivered this with such volubility that the words pattered out like a roll of musketry she flounced out with red cheeks and wet eyes rushed down the stairs and sprang into her carriage whipped the ponies and away at a pace that made the spectators stare mr oldfield muttered some excuses and retired more sedately all this set bella bruce trembling and weeping and her father was some time before he could bring her to anything like composure her first words when she could find breath were he is innocent he is unhappy oh that i could fly to him innocent what proof that brave lady said so brave lady a bold hussy most likely a friend of the woman somerset and a bird of the same feather sir charles has done himself no good with me by sending such an emissary no papa it was the lawyer brought her and then her own good heart made her burst out ah she is not like me she has courage what a noble thing courage is especially in a woman pray did you hear the language of this noble lady every word nearly and i shall never forget them they were diamonds and pearls of the sort you can pick up at billingsgate ah papa she pleaded for him as i cannot plead and yet i love him it was true eloquence oh how she made me shudder only think he had a fit and lost his reason and all for me what shall i do what shall i do this brought on a fit of weeping her father pitied her and gave her a crumb of sympathy said he was sorry for sir charles but said he recovering his resolution it cannot be helped he must expiate his vices like other men do pray pluck up a little spirit and sense now try and keep to the point this woman came from him and you say you heard her language and admire it quote me some of it she said he fell down as black as his hat and his eyes rolled and his poor teeth gnashed and oh my darling my darling oh oh oh there there i mean about other things bella complied but with a running accompaniment of the sweetest little sobs she said i must be very green to swallow an anonymous letter like spring water oh oh green there was a word oh oh but it is the right word you can't mend it try and you will see you can't of course i was green oh and she said every gentleman who can afford to keep a saddle horse has a female friend till his banns are called in church oh oh a pretty statement to come to your ears but if it is the truth 'the truth may be blamed but it can't be shamed' ah i'll not forget that i'll pray every night i may remember those words of the brave lady oh yes take her for your oracle i mean to i always try to profit by my superiors she has courage i have none i beat about the bush and talk skim milk she uses the very word she said we have been the dupe and the tool of a little scheming rascal an anonymous coward with motives as base as his heart is black oh oh ay that is the way to speak of such a man i can't do it myself but i reverence the brave lady who can and she wasn't afraid even of you dear papa 'come old gentleman' ha ha ha 'take the world as it is belgravian mothers would not break both their hearts for what is past and gone' what hard good sense a thing i always did admire because i've got none but her heart is not hard after all her words of fire that went so straight instead of beating the bush she ended by crying for me oh oh oh bless her bless her if ever there was a good woman in the world that is one she was not born a lady i am afraid but that is nothing she was born a woman and i mean to make her acquaintance and take her for my example in all things no dear papa women are not so pitiful to women without cause she is almost a stranger yet she cried for me can you be harder to me than she is no pity your poor girl who will lose her health and perhaps her life pity poor charles stung by an anonymous viper and laid on a bed of sickness for me oh oh oh i do pity you bella when you cry like this my heart bleeds i'll try not to cry papa oh oh but most of all i pity your infatuation your blindness poor innocent dove that looks at others by the light of her own goodness and so sees all manner of virtues in a brazen hussy now answer me one plain question you called her 'the sister' is she not the same woman that played the sister of charity bella blushed to the temples and said hesitatingly she was not quite sure come bella i thought you were going to imitate the jade and not beat about the bush yes or no the features are very like bella you know it is the same woman you recognized her in a moment that speaks volumes but she shall find i am not to be made 'a dupe and a tool of' quite so easily as she thinks i'll tell you what this is some professional actress sir charles has hired to waylay you little simpleton he said no more at that time but after dinner he ruminated and took a very serious indeed almost a maritime view of the crisis i'm overmatched now thought he they will cut my sloop out under the very guns of the flagship if we stay much longer in this port a lawyer against me and a woman too there's nothing to be done but heave anchor hoist sail and run for it he sent off a foreign telegram and then went upstairs bella my dear said he pack up your clothes for a journey we start to morrow a journey papa a long one no we shan't double the horn this time brighton paris oh farther than that the grave that is the journey i should like to take so you shall some day but just now it is a foreign port you are bound for go and pack i obey and she was creeping off but he called her back and kissed her and said now i'll tell you where you are going but you must promise me solemnly not to write one line to sir charles she promised but cried as soon as she had promised whereat the admiral inferred he had done wisely to exact the promise well my dear said he we are going to baden your aunt molineux is there she is a woman of great delicacy and prudence and has daughters of her own all well married thanks to her motherly care she will bring you to your senses better than i can next evening they left england by the mail and the day after richard bassett learned this through his servant and went home triumphant and indeed wondering at his success he ascribed it however to the nemesis which dogs the heels of those who inherit the estate of another such was the only moral reflection he made though the business in general and particularly his share in it admitted of several miss somerset also heard of it and told mr oldfield he told sir charles bassett that gentleman sighed deeply and said nothing he had lost all hope the whole matter appeared stagnant for about ten days and then a delicate hand stirred the dead waters cautiously mr oldfield of all people in the world received a short letter from bella bruce konigsberg hotel baden miss bruce presents her compliments to mr oldfield and will feel much obliged if he will send her the name and address of that brave lady who accompanied him to her father's house miss bruce desires to thank that lady personally for her noble defense of one with whom it would be improper for her to communicate but she can never be indifferent to his welfare nor hear of his sufferings without deep sorrow confound it said solomon oldfield what am i to do i mustn't tell her it is miss somerset so the wary lawyer had a copy of the letter made and sent to miss somerset for instructions miss somerset sent for mr marsh who was now more at her beck and call than ever and told him she had a ticklish letter to write i can talk with the best said she but the moment i sit down and take up a pen something cold runs up my shoulder and then down my backbone and i'm palsied now you are always writing and can't say 'bo' to a goose in company let us mix ourselves i'll walk about and speak my mind and then you put down the cream and send it from this ingenious process resulted the following composition she whom miss bruce is good enough to call 'the brave lady' happened to know the truth and that tempted her to try and baffle an anonymous slanderer who was ruining the happiness of a lady and gentleman being a person of warm impulses she went great lengths but she now wishes to retire into the shade she is flattered by miss bruce's desire to know her and some day perhaps may remind her of it but at present she must deny herself that honor if her reasons were known miss bruce would not be offended nor hurt she would entirely approve them soon after this as sir charles bassett sat by the fire disconsolate his servant told him a lady wanted to see him who is it don't know sir charles but it is a kind of a sort of a nun sir charles oh a sister of charity perhaps the one that nursed me admit her by all means the sister came in she had a large veil on sir charles received her with profound respect and thanked her with some little hesitation for her kind attention to him she stopped him by saying that was merely her duty but said she softly words fell from you on the bed of sickness that touched my heart and besides i happen to know the lady you know my bella cried sir charles ah then no wonder you speak so kindly you can feel what i have lost she has left england to avoid me all the better where she is the door cannot be closed in your face she is at baden follow her there she has heard the truth from mr oldfield and she knows who wrote the anonymous letter and who did mr richard bassett this amazed sir charles the scoundrel said he after a long silence well then why let that fellow defeat you for his own ends i would go at once to baden your leaving england would be one more proof to her that she has no rival stick to her like a man sir and you will win her i tell you these words from a nun amazed and fired him he rose from his chair flushed with sudden hope and ardor i'll leave for baden to morrow morning the sister rose to retire no no cried sir charles i have not thanked you i ought to go down on my knees and bless you for all this to whom am i so indebted no matter sir but it does matter you nursed me and perhaps saved my life and now you give me back the hopes that make life sweet you will not trust me with your name we have no name your voice at times sounds very like no i will not affront you by such a comparison i'm her sister said she like lightning this announcement quite staggered sir charles and he was silent and uncomfortable it gave him a chill the sister watched him keenly but said nothing sir charles did not know what to say so he asked to see her face it must be as beautiful as your heart the sister shook her head my face has been disfigured by a frightful disorder sir charles uttered an ejaculation of regret and pity i could not bear to show it to one who esteems me as you seem to do but perhaps it will not always be so i hope not you are young and heaven is good can i do nothing for you who have done so much for me nothing unless said she feigning vast timidity you could spare me that ring of yours as a remembrance of the part i have played in this affair sir charles colored it was a ruby of the purest water and had been two centuries in his family he colored but was too fine a gentleman to hesitate he said by all means but it is a poor thing to offer you i shall value it very much say no more i am fortunate in having anything you deign to accept and so the ring changed hands the sister now put it on her middle finger and held up her hand and her bright eyes glanced at it through her veil with that delight which her sex in general feel at the possession of a new bauble she recovered herself however and told him soberly the ring should return to his family at her death if not before i will give you a piece of advice for it said she miss bruce has foxy hair and she is very timid don't you take her advice about commanding her she would like to be your slave don't let her coax her to speak her mind make a friend of her don't you put her to this that she must displease you or else deceive you she might choose wrong especially with that colored hair it is not in her nature to deceive it is not in her nature to displease excuse me i am too fanciful and look at women too close but i know your happiness depends on her all your eggs are in that one basket well i have told you how to carry the basket good by sir charles saw her out and bowed respectfully to her in the hall while his servant opened the street door he did her this homage as his benefactress when admiral and miss bruce reached baden mrs molineux was away on a visit and this disappointed admiral bruce who had counted on her assistance to manage and comfort bella bella needed the latter very much a glance at her pale pensive lovely face was enough to show that sorrow was rooted at her heart she was subjected to no restraint but kept the house of her own accord thinking as persons of her age are apt to do that her whole history must be written in her face still of course she did go out sometimes and one cold but bright afternoon she was strolling languidly on the parade when all in a moment she met sir charles bassett face to face she gave an eloquent scream and turned pale a moment and then the hot blood came rushing and then it retired and she stood at bay with heaving bosom and great eyes sir charles held out both hands pathetically don't you be afraid of me when she found he was so afraid of offending her she became more courageous how dare you come here said she but with more curiosity than violence for it had been her dream of hope he would come how could i keep away when i heard you were here you must not speak to me sir i am forbidden pray do not condemn me unheard if i listen to you i shall believe you i won't hear a word gentlemen can do things that ladies cannot even speak about talk to my aunt molineux our fate depends on her this will teach you not to be so wicked what business have gentlemen to be so wicked ladies are not no it is no use i will not hear a syllable i am ashamed to be seen speaking to you you are a bad character oh charles is it true you had a fit yes and have you been very ill you look ill i am better now dearest dearest don't call me names how dare you keep speaking to me when i request you not but i can't excuse myself and obtain my pardon and recover your love unless i am allowed to speak oh you can speak to my aunt molineux and she will read you a fine lesson where is she nobody knows but there is her house the one with the iron gate get her ear first if you really love me and don't you ever waylay me again if you do i shall say something rude to you sir oh i'm so happy having let this out she hid her face with her hands and fled like the very wind at dinner time she was in high spirits the admiral congratulated her brava bell youth and health and a foreign air will soon cure you of that folly bella blushed deeply and said nothing the truth struggled within her too but she shrank from giving pain and receiving expostulation she kept the house though for two days partly out of modesty partly out of an honest and pious desire to obey her father as much as she could the third day mrs molineux arrived and sent over to the admiral he invited bella to come with him she consented eagerly but was so long in dressing that he threatened to go without her she implored him not to do that and after a monstrous delay the motive of which the reader may perhaps divine father and daughter called on mrs molineux she received them very affectionately but when the admiral with some hesitation began to enter on the great subject she said quietly bella my dear go for a walk and come back to me in half an hour aunt molineux said bella extending both her hands imploringly to that lady mrs molineux was proof against this blandishment and bella had to go when she was gone this lady who both as wife and mother was literally a model rather astonished her brother the admiral she said i am sorry to tell you that you have conducted this matter with perfect impropriety both you and bella she had no business to show you that anonymous letter and when she did show it you you should have taken it from her and told her not to believe a word of it and married my daughter to a libertine why charlotte i am ashamed of you mrs molineux colored high but she kept her temper and ignored the interruption then if you decided to go into so indelicate a question at all and really you were not bound to do so on anonymous information why then you should have sent for sir charles and given him the letter and put him on his honor to tell you the truth he would have told you the fact instead of a garbled version and the fact is that before he knew bella he had a connection which he prepared to dissolve on terms very honorable to himself as soon as he engaged himself to your daughter what is there in that why it is common universal among men of fashion i am so vexed it ever came to bella's knowledge really it is dreadful to me as a mother that such a thing should have been discussed before that child complete innocence means complete ignorance and that is how all my girls went to their husbands however what we must do now is to tell her sir charles has satisfied me he was not to blame and after that the subject must never be recurred to sir charles has promised me never to mention it and no more shall bella and now my dear john let me congratulate you your daughter has a high minded lover who adores her with a fine estate he has been crying to me poor fellow as men will to a woman of my age and if you have any respect for my judgment ask him to dinner she added that it might be as well if after dinner he were to take a little nap admiral bruce did not fall into these views without discussion i spare the reader the dialogue since he yielded at last only he stipulated that his sister should do the dinner and the subsequent siesta bella returned looking very wistful and anxious come here niece said mrs molineux kneel you at my knee now look me in the face sir charles has loved you and you only from the day he first saw you he loves you now as much as ever do you love him oh aunt aunt a shower of kisses and a tear or two that is enough then dry your eyes and dress your beautiful hair a little better than that for he dines with me to day who so bright and happy now as bella bruce the dreaded aunt did not stop there she held that after the peep into real life bella bruce had obtained for want of a mother's vigilance she ought to be a wife as soon as possible so she gave sir charles a hint that baden was a very good place to be married in and from that moment sir charles gave bella and her father no rest till they consented little did richard bassett in england dream what was going on at baden he now surveyed the chimneys of huntercombe hall with resignation and even with growing complacency as chimneys that would one day be his since their owner would not be in a hurry to love again he shot sir charles's pheasants whenever they strayed into his hedgerows and he lived moderately and studied health in a word content with the result of his anonymous letter he confined himself now to cannily out living the wrongful heir his cousin one fine frosty day the chimneys of huntercombe began to show signs of life vertical columns of blue smoke rose in the air one after another till at last there were about forty going old servants flowed down from london new ones trickled in with their boxes from the country carriages were drawn out into the stable yard horses exercised and a whisper ran that sir charles was coming to live on his estates and not alone richard bassett went about inquiring cautiously the rumor spread and was confirmed by some little facts at last one fine day when the chimneys were all smoking the church bells began to peal richard bassett heard and went out scowling deeply he found the village all agog with expectation presently there was a loud cheer from the steeple and a flag floated from the top of huntercombe house murmurs distant cheers approaching cheers the clatter of horses' feet the roll of wheels huntercombe gates flung wide open by a cluster of grooms and keepers then on came two outriders ushered by loud hurrahs and followed by a carriage and four that dashed through the village amid peals of delight from the villagers the carriage was open and in it sat sir charles and bella bassett she was lovelier than ever she dazzled the very air with her beauty and her glorious hair the hurrahs of the villagers made her heart beat she pressed sir charles's hand tenderly and literally shone with joy and pride and so she swept past richard bassett she saw him directly shuddered a moment and half clung to her husband then on again and passed through the open gates amid loud cheers she alighted in her own hall and walked nodding and smiling sunnily through two files of domestics and retainers and thought no more of richard bassett than some bright bird that has flown over a rattlesnake and glanced down at him but a gorgeous bird cannot always be flying a snake can sometimes creep under her perch and glare and keep hissing till she shudders and droops and lays her plumage in the dust chapter ix generally deliberate crimes are followed by some great punishment but they are also often attended in their course by briefer chastisements single strokes from the whip that holds the round dozen in reserve these precursors of the grand expiation are sharp but kindly lashes for they tend to whip the man out of the wrong road such a stroke fell on richard bassett he saw bella bruce sweep past him clinging to her husband and shuddering at himself for this then he had plotted and intrigued and written an anonymous letter the only woman he had ever loved at all went past him with a look of aversion and was his enemy's wife and would soon be the mother of that enemy's children and blot him forever out of the coveted inheritance the man crept home and sat by his little fireside crushed indeed from that hour he disappeared and drank his bitter cup alone after a while it transpired in the village that he was very ill the clergyman went to visit him but was not admitted the only person who got to see him was his friend wheeler a small but sharp attorney by whose advice he acted in country matters this wheeler was very fond of shooting and could not get a crack at a pheasant except on highmore and that was a bond between him and its proprietor it was wheeler who had first told bassett not to despair of possessing the estates since they had inserted sir charles's heir at law in the entail this wheeler found him now so shrunk in body so pale and haggard in face and dejected in mind that he was really shocked and asked leave to send a doctor from a neighboring town what to do said richard moodily it's my mind it's not my body ah wheeler it is all over i and mine shall never have huntercombe now i'll tell you what it is said wheeler almost angrily you will have six feet by two of it before long if you go on this way was ever such folly to fret yourself out of this jolly world because you can't get one particular slice of its upper crust why one bit of land is as good as another and i'll show you how to get land in this neighborhood too ay right under sir charles's nose show me that said bassett gloomily and incredulously leave off moping then and i will i advise the bank you know and 'splatchett's' farm is mortgaged up to the eyes it is not the only one i go to the village inns and pick up all the gossip i hear there how am i to find money to buy land i'll put you up to that too but you must leave off moping hang it man never say die there are plenty of chances on the cards get your color back and marry a girl with money and turn that into land the first thing is to leave off grizzling why you are playing the enemy's game that can't be right can it this remark was the first that really roused the sick man wheeler had too few clients to lose one he now visited bassett almost daily and being himself full of schemes and inventions he got bassett by degrees out of his lethargy and he emerged into daylight again but he looked thin and yellow as a guinea and he had turned miser he kept but one servant and fed her and himself at sir charles bassett's expense he wired that gentleman's hares and rabbits in his own hedges he went out with his gun every sunny afternoon and shot a brace or two of pheasants without disturbing the rest for he took no dog with him to run and yelp but a little boy who quietly tapped the hedgerows and walked the sunny banks and shaws they never came home empty handed but on those rarer occasions when sir charles and his friends beat the bassett woods richard was sure to make a large bag for he was a cool unerring shot and flushed the birds in hedgerows slips of underwood etc to which the fairer sportsmen had driven them these birds and the surplus hares he always sold in the market town and put the money into a box the rabbits he ate and also squirrels and above all young hedgehogs a gypsy taught him how to cook them viz by inclosing them in clay and baking them in wood embers then the bristles adhere to the burned clay and the meat is juicy he was his own gardener and vegetables cost him next to nothing so he went on through all the winter months and by the spring his health and strength were restored then he turned woodman cut down every stick of timber in a little wood near his house and sold it and then set to work to grub up the roots for fires and cleared it for tillage the sum he received for the wood was much more than he expected and this he made a note of he had a strong body that could work hard all day a big hate and a mania for the possession of land and so he led a truly spartan life and everybody in the village said he was mad while he led this hard life sir charles and lady bassett were the gayest of the gay she was the beauty and the bride visits and invitations poured in from every part of the country sir charles flattered by the homage paid to his beloved made himself younger and less fastidious to indulge her and the happy pair often drove twelve miles to dinner and twenty to dine and sleep an excellent custom in that country one of whose favorite toasts is worth recording may you dine where you please and sleep where you dine they were at every ball and gave one or two themselves above all they enjoyed society in that delightful form which is confined to large houses they would have numerous and well assorted visitors staying at the house for a week or so and all dining at a huge round table but two o'clock pm was the time to see how hosts and guests enjoyed themselves the hall door of huntercombe was approached by a flight of stone steps easy of ascent and about twenty four feet wide at the riding hour the county ladies used to come one after another holding up their riding habits with one hand and perch about this gigantic flight of steps like peacocks and chatter like jays while the servants walked their horses about the gravel esplanade and the four in hand waited a little in the rear a fine champing of bits and fidgeting of thoroughbreds there was till all were ready then the ladies would each put out her little foot with charming nonchalance to the nearest gentleman or groom with a slight preference for the grooms who were more practiced the man lifted the lady sprang at the same time and into her saddle like a bird lady bassett on a very quiet pony or in the carriage to please some dowager and away they clattered in high spirits a regular cavalcade it was a hunting county and the ladies rode well square seat light hand on the snaffle the curb reserved for cases of necessity and when they had patted the horse on the neck at starting as all these coaxing creatures must they rode him with that well bred ease and unconsciousness of being on a horse which distinguishes ladies who have ridden all their lives from the gawky snobbesses in hyde park who ride if riding it can be called with their elbows uncouthly fastened to their sides as if by a rope their hands at the pit of their stomachs and both those hands as heavy as a housemaid's sawing the poor horse with curb and snaffle at once while the whole body breathes pretension and affectation and seems to say look at me i am on horseback be startled at that as i am and i have had lessons from a riding master he has taught me how a lady should ride in his opinion poor devil the champing the pawing the mounting and the clattering of these bright cavalcades with the music of the women excited by motion furnished a picture of wealth and gayety and happy country life that cheered the whole neighborhood and contrasted strangely with the stern spartan life of him who had persuaded himself he was the rightful owner of huntercombe hall sir charles bassett was a magistrate and soon found himself a bad one one day he made a little mistake which owing to his popularity was very gently handled by the bench at their weekly meeting but still sir charles was ashamed and mortified he wrote directly to oldfield for law books and that gentleman sent him an excellent selection bound in smooth calf sir charles now studied three hours every day except hunting days when no squire can work and as his study was his justice room he took care to find an authority before he acted he was naturally humane and rustic offenders especially poachers and runaway farm servants used to think themselves fortunate if they were taken before him and not before squire powys who was sure to give them the sharp edge of the law so now sir charles was useful as well as ornamental thus passed fourteen months of happiness with only one little cloud there was no sign yet of a son and heir but let a man be ever so powerful it is an awkward thing to have a bitter inveterate enemy at his door watching for a chance sir charles began to realize this in the sixteenth month of his wedded bliss a small estate called splatchett's lay on his north side and a marginal strip of this property ran right into a wood of his this strip was wretched land and the owner unable to raise any wheat crop on it had planted it with larches sir charles had made him a liberal offer for splatchett's about six years ago but he had refused point blank being then in good circumstances sir charles now received a hint from one of his own gamekeepers that the old farmer was in a bad way and talked of selling so sir charles called on him and asked him if he would sell splatchett's now why i can't sell it twice said the old man testily you ha' got it han't ye it turned out that richard bassett had been beforehand the bank had pressed for their money and threatened foreclosure then bassett had stepped in with a good price and although the conveyance was not signed a stamped agreement was and neither vender nor purchaser could go back what made it more galling the proprietor was not aware of the feud between the bassetts and had thought to please sir charles by selling to one of his name sir charles bassett went home seriously vexed he did not mean to tell his wife but love's eye read his face love's arm went round his neck and love's soft voice and wistful eyes soon coaxed it out of him dear charles said she never mind it is mortifying but think how much you have and how little that wicked man has let him have that farm he has lost his self respect and that is worth a great many farms for my part i pity the poor wretch let him try to annoy you your wife will try against him to make you happy my own beloved and i think i may prove as strong as mr bassett said she with a look of inspiration her sweet and tender sympathy soon healed so slight a scratch but they had not done with splatchett's yet just after christmas sir charles invited three gentlemen to beat his more distant preserves their guns bellowed in quick succession through the woods and at last they reached north wood here they expected splendid shooting as a great many cock pheasants had already been seen running ahead but when they got to the end of the wood they found lawyer wheeler standing against a tree just within splatchett's boundary and one of their own beaters reported that two boys were stationed in the road each tapping two sticks together to confine the pheasants to that strip of land on which the low larches and high grass afforded a strong covert sir charles halted on his side of the boundary then wheeler told his man to beat and up got the cock pheasants one after another whenever a pheasant whirred up the man left off beating the lawyer knocked down four brace in no time and those that escaped him and turned back for the wood were brought down by bassett firing from the hard road only those were spared that flew northward into splatchett's it was a veritable slaughter planned with judgment and carried out in a most ungentlemanlike and unsportsmanlike manner it goaded sir charles beyond his patience after several vain efforts to restrain himself he shouldered his gun and followed by his friends went bursting through the larches to richard bassett mr bassett said he this is most ungentlernanly conduct what is the matter sir am i on your ground no but you are taking a mean advantage of our being out who ever heard of a gentleman beating his boundaries the very day a neighbor was out shooting and filling them with his game oh that is it is it when justice is against you you can talk of law and when law is against you you appeal to justice let us be in one story or the other please the huntercombe estates belong to me by birth you have got them by legal trickery keep them while you live they will come to me one day you know meantime leave me my little estate of 'splatchett's' for shame sir you have robbed me of my inheritance and my sweetheart do you grudge me a few cock pheasants why you have made me so poor they are an object to me now oh said sir charles if you are stealing my game to keep body and soul together i pity you in that case perhaps you will let my friends help you fill your larder richard bassett hesitated a moment but wheeler who had drawn near at the sound of the raised voices made him a signal to assent by all means said he adroitly mr markham your father often shot with mine over the bassett estates you are welcome to poor little 'splatchett's' keep your men off sir charles they are noisy bunglers and do more harm than good here tom bill beat for the gentlemen they shall have the sport i only want the birds sir charles drew back and saw pheasant after pheasant thunder and whiz into the air then collapse at a report and fall like lead followed by a shower of feathers his friends seemed to be deserting him for richard bassett he left them in charge of his keepers and went slowly home he said nothing to lady bassett till night and then she got it all from him she was very indignant at many of the things but as for sir charles all his cousin's arrows glided off that high minded gentleman except one and that quivered in his heart yes bella said he he told me he should inherit these estates that is because we are not blessed with children lady bassett sighed but we shall be some day shall we not god knows said sir charles gloomily i wonder whether there was really anything unfair done on our side when the entail was cut off is that likely dearest why heaven seems to be on his side on the side of a wicked man but he may be the father of innocent children why he is not even married he will marry he will not throw a chance away it makes my head dizzy and my heart sick bella now i can understand two enemies meeting alone in some solitary place and one killing the other in a moment of rage for when this scoundrel insulted me i remembered his anonymous letter and all his relentless malice bella i could have raised my gun and shot him like a weasel lady bassett screamed faintly and flung her arms round his neck oh charles pray to god against such thoughts you shall never go near that man again don't think of our one disappointment think of all the blessings we enjoy never mind that wretched man's hate think of your wife's love have i not more power to make you happy than he has to afflict you my adored these sweet words were accompanied by a wife's divine caresses with the honey of her voice and the liquid sunshine of her loving eyes sir charles slept peacefully that night and forgot his one grief and his one enemy for a time not so lady bassett she lay awake all night and thought deeply of richard bassett and his unrelenting impenitent malice women of her fine fiber when they think long and earnestly on one thing have often divinations the dark future seems to be lit a moment at a time by flashes of lightning and they discern the indistinct form of events to come and so it was with lady bassett in the stilly night a terror of the future and of richard bassett crept over her a terror disproportioned to his past acts and apparent power perhaps she was oppressed by having an enemy she who was born to be loved at all events she was full of feminine divinations and forebodings and saw by flashes many a poisoned arrow fly from that quiver and strike the beloved breast it had already discharged one that had parted them for a time and nearly killed sir charles daylight cleared away much of this dark terror but left a sober dread and a strange resolution this timid creature stimulated by love determined to watch the foe and defend her husband with all her little power all manner of devices passed through her head but were rejected because if love said do wonders timidity said do nothing that you have not seen other wives do so she remained scheming and longing and fearing and passive all day but the next day she conceived a vague idea and all in a heat rang for her maid while the maid was coming she fell to blushing at her own boldness and just as the maid opened the door her thermometer fell so low that she sent her upstairs for a piece of work oh lame and impotent conclusion just before luncheon she chanced to look through a window and to see the head gamekeeper crossing the park and coming to the house now this was the very man she wanted to speak to the sudden temptation surprised her out of her timidity she rang the bell again and sent for the man that colossus wondered in his mind and felt uneasy at an invitation so novel however he clattered into the morning room in his velveteen coat and leathern gaiters up to his thigh pulled his front hair bobbed his head and then stood firm in body as was he of rhodes but in mind much abashed at finding himself in her ladyship's presence the lady however did not prove so very terrible may i inquire your name sir said she very respectfully moses moss my lady mr moss i wish to ask you a question or two may i that you may my lady i want you to explain if you will be so good how the proprietor of 'splatchett's' can shoot all sir charles's pheasants lord my lady we ain't come down to that but he do shoot more than his share that's sure an' sartain well my lady if you please game is just like christians it will make for sunny spots highmore has got a many of them there with good cover so we breeds for him as for 'splatchett's' that don't hurt we my lady it is all arable land and dead hedges with no bottom only there's one little tongue of it runs into north wood and planted with larch and if you please my lady there is always a kind of coarse grass grows under young larches and makes a strong cover for game so beat north wood which way you will them artful old cocks will run ahead of ye or double back into them larches and you see mr bassett is not a gentleman like sir charles he is always a mouching about and the biggest poacher in the parish and so he drops on to 'em out of bounds is there no way of stopping all this sir we might station a dozen beaters ahead they would most likely get shot but i don't think as they'd mind that much if you had set your heart on it my lady dall'd if i would for one oh mr moss heaven forbid that any man should be shot for me no not for all the pheasants in the world i'll try and think of some other way i should like to see the place may i yes my lady and welcome how shall i get to it sir you can ride to the 'woodman's rest' my lady and it is scarce a stone's throw from there but 'tis baddish traveling for the likes of you she appointed an hour rode with her groom to the public house and thence was conducted through bush through brier to the place where her husband had been so annoyed moss's comments became very intelligible to her the moment she saw the place she said very little however and rode home next day she blushed high and asked sir charles for a hundred pounds to spend upon herself sir charles smiled well pleased and gave it her and a kiss into the bargain ah but said she that is not all i am glad of it you spend too little money on yourself a great deal too little that is a complaint you won't have long to make i want to cut down a few trees may i going to build don't ask me it is for myself that is enough cut down every stick on the estate if you like the barer it leaves us the better ah charles you promised me not i shall cut with great discretion i assure you as you please said sir charles if you want to make me happy deny yourself nothing mind i shall be angry if you do soon after this a gaping quidnunc came to sir charles and told him lady bassett was felling trees in north wood and pray who has a better right to fell trees in any wood of mine but she is building a wall and who has a better right to build a wall with the delicacy of a gentleman he would not go near the place after this till she asked him and that was not long she came into his study all beaming and invited him to a ride she took him into north wood and showed him her work richard bassett's plantation hitherto divided from north wood only by a boundary scarcely visible was now shut off by a brick wall on sir charles's side of that wall every stick of timber was felled and removed for a distance of fifty yards and about twenty yards from the wall a belt of larches was planted a little higher than cabbages sir charles looked amazed at first but soon observed how thoroughly his enemy was defeated my poor bella said he to think of your taking all this trouble about such a thing he stopped to kiss her very tenderly and she shone with joy and innocent pride and i never thought of this you astonish me bella ay said she in high spirits now and what is more i have astonished mr moss he said 'i wish i had your head piece my lady' i could have told him love sharpens a woman's wits but i reserved that little adage for you it's all mighty fine fair lady but you have told me a fib you said it was to be all for yourself and got a hundred pounds out of me and so it was for myself you silly thing are you not myself and the part of myself i love the best and her supple wrist was round his neck in a moment they rode home together like lovers and comforted each other richard bassett with wheeler's assistance had borrowed money on highmore to buy splatchett's he now borrowed money on splatchett's and bought dean's wood a wood with patches of grass that lay on the east of sir charles's boundary he gave seventeen hundred pounds for it and sold two thousand pounds' worth of timber off it the first year this sounds incredible but owing to the custom of felling only ripe trees landed proprietors had no sure clew to the value of all the timber on an acre richard bassett had found this out and bought dean's wood upon the above terms ie the vender gave him the soil and three hundred pounds gratis he grubbed the roots and sold them for fuel and planted larches to catch the overflow of sir charles's game the grass grew beautifully now the trees were down and he let it for pasture he then still under wheeler's advice came out into the world again improved his dress and called on several county families with a view to marrying money now in the country they do not despise a poor gentleman of good lineage and bassett was one of the oldest names in the county so every door was open to him and indeed his late hermit life had stimulated some curiosity this he soon turned to sympathy by telling them that he was proud but poor robbed of the vast estates that belonged to him by birth he had been unwilling to take a lower position however heaven had prospered him the wrongful heir was childless he was the heir at law and felt he owed it to the estate which must return to his line to assume a little more public importance than he had done wherever he was received he was sure to enlarge upon his wrongs and he was believed for he was notoriously the direct heir to bassett and huntercombe but the family arrangement by which his father had been bought out was known only to a few he readily obtained sympathy and many persons were disgusted at sir charles's illiberality in not making him some compensation to use the homely expression of govett a small proprietor the baronet might as well have given him back one pig out of his own farrow ie one of the many farms comprised in that large estate sir charles learned that richard was undermining him in the county but was too proud to interfere he told lady bassett he should say nothing until some gentleman should indorse mr bassett's falsehoods one day sir charles and lady bassett were invited to dine and sleep at mr hardwicke's distance fifteen miles they went and found richard bassett dining there by mrs hardwicke's invitation who was one of those ninnies that fling guests together with no discrimination richard had expected this to happen sooner or later so he was comparatively prepared and bowed stiffly to sir charles sir charles stared at him in return this was observed people were uncomfortable especially mrs hardwicke whose thoughtlessness was to blame for it all at a very early hour sir charles ordered his carriage and drove home instead of staying all night mrs hardwicke being a fool must make a little more mischief she blubbered to her husband and he wrote sir charles a remonstrance sir charles replied that he was the only person aggrieved mr hardwicke ought not to have invited a blackguard to meet him mr hardwicke replied that he had never heard a bassett called a blackguard before and had seen nothing in mr bassett to justify an epithet so unusual among gentlemen and to be frank with you sir charles said he i think this bitterness against a poor gentleman whose estates you are so fortunate as to possess is not consistent with your general character and is indeed unworthy of you to this sir charles bassett replied dear mr hardwick you have applied some remarks to me which i will endeavor to forget as they were written in entire ignorance of the truth but if we are to remain friends i expect you to believe me when i tell you that mr richard bassett has never been wronged by me or mine but has wronged me and lady bassett deeply he is a dishonorable scoundrel not entitled to be received in society and if after this assurance you receive him i shall never darken your doors again so please let me know your decision i remain yours truly charles dyke bassett mr hardwicke chafed under this but prudence stepped in he was one of the county members and sir charles could command three hundred votes he wrote back to say he had received sir charles's letter with pain but of course he could not disbelieve him and therefore he should invite mr bassett no more till the matter was cleared but mr hardwicke thus brought to book was nettled at his own meanness so he sent sir charles's letter to mr richard bassett bassett foamed with rage and wrote a long letter raving with insults to sir charles he was in the act of directing it when wheeler called on him bassett showed him sir charles's letter wheeler read it now read what i say to him in reply wheeler read bassett's letter threw it into the fire and kept it there with the poker lucky i called said he dryly saved you a thousand pounds or so you must not write a letter without me what am i to sit still and be insulted you're a pretty friend i am a wise friend this is a more serious matter than you seem to think libel of course why if sir charles had consulted me i could not have dictated a better letter it closes every chink a defendant in libel can creep out by now take your pen and write to mr hardwicke dear sir i have received your letter containing a libel written by sir charles bassett my reply will be public yours very truly richard bassett is that all every syllable now mind you never go to hardwicke house again sir charles has got you banished from that house special damage there never was a prettier case for a jury the rightful heir foully slandered by the possessor of his hereditary estates this picture excited bassett and he walked about raving with malice and longing for the time when he should stand in the witness box and denounce his enemy no no said wheeler leave that to counsel you must play the mild victim in the witness box who is the defendant solicitor we ought to serve the writ on him at once no no serve it on himself what for much better proceed like gentlemen bassett got in a passion at being contradicted in everything i tell you said he the more i can irritate and exasperate this villain the better besides he slandered me behind my back and i'll have the writ served upon himself i'll do everything i can to take him down if a man wants to be my lawyer he must enter into my feelings a little wheeler to whom he was more valuable than ever now consented somewhat reluctantly and called at huntercombe hall next day with the writ and sent in his card lady bassett heard of this and asked if it was mr bassett's friend the butler said he thought it was lady bassett went to sir charles in his study oh my dear said she here is mr bassett's lawyer well why does he come here i don't know don't see him why not i am so afraid of mr bassett he is our evil genius let me see this person instead of you may i certainly not might i see him first love you will not see him at all charles no bella i cannot have these animals talking to my wife but dear love i am so full of forebodings you know charles i don't often presume to meddle but i am in torture about this man if you receive him may i be with you then we shall be two to one no no said sir charles testily then seeing her beautiful eyes fill at the refusal and the unusual tone he relented you may be in hearing if you like open that door and sit in the little room oh thank you she stepped into the room a very small sitting room she had never been in it before and while she was examining it and thinking how she could improve its appearance mr wheeler was shown into the study sir charles received him standing to intimate that the interview must be brief this and the time he had been kept waiting in the hall roused wheeler's bile and he entered on his subject more bruskly than he had intended sir charles bassett you wrote a letter to mr hardwicke reflecting on my client mr bassett a most unjustifiable letter keep your opinion to yourself sir i wrote a letter calling him what he is no sir that letter is a libel it is the truth it is a malicious libel sir and we shall punish you for it i hereby serve you with this copy of a writ damages five thousand pounds a sigh from the next room passed unnoticed by the men for their voices were now raised in anger and so that is what you came here for why did you not go to my solicitor you must be as great a blackguard as your client to serve your paltry writs on me in my own house not blackguard enough to insult a gentleman in my own house if you had been civil i might have accommodated matters but now i'll make you smart ugh nothing provokes a high spirited man more than a menace sir charles threatened in his wife's hearing shot out his right arm with surprising force and rapidity and knocked wheeler down in a moment in came lady bassett with a scream and saw the attorney lying doubled up and sir charles standing over him blowing like a grampus with rage and excitement but the next moment be staggered and gasped and she had to support him to a seat she rang the bell for aid then kneeled and took his throbbing temples to her wifely bosom wheeler picked himself up and seated on his hams eyed the pair with concentrated fury aha you have hurt yourself more than me two suits against you now instead of one conduct this person from the house said lady bassett to a servant who entered at that moment all right my lady said wheeler i'll remind you of that word when this house belongs to us chapter x with this bitter reply wheeler retired precipitately the shaft pierced but one bosom for the devoted wife with the swift ingenuity of woman's love had put both her hands right over her husband's ears that he might hear no more insults sir charles very nearly had a fit but his wife loosened his neckcloth caressed his throbbing head and applied eau de cologne to his nostrils he got better but felt dizzy for about an hour she made him come into her room and lie down she hung over him curling as a vine and light as a bird and her kisses lit softly as down upon his eyes and her words of love and pity murmured music in his ears till he slept and that danger passed for a day or two after this both sir charles and lady bassett avoided the unpleasant subject but it had to be faced so mr oldfield was summoned to huntercombe and all engagements given up for the day that he might dine alone with them and talk the matter over sir charles thought he could justify but when it came to the point he could only prove that richard had done several ungentleman like things of a nature a stout jury would consider trifles mr oldfield said of course they must enter an appearance and this done the wisest course would be to let him see wheeler and try to compromise the suit it will cost you a thousand pounds sir charles i dare say but if it teaches you never to write of an enemy or to an enemy without showing your lawyer the letter first the lesson will be cheap somebody in the bible says 'oh that mine enemy would write a book' i say 'oh that he would write a letter without consulting his solicitor it was lady bassett's cue now to make light of troubles what does it matter mr oldfield all they want is money yes offer them a thousand pounds to leave him in peace so next day mr oldfield called on wheeler all smiles and civility and asked him if he did not think it a pity cousins should quarrel before the whole county a great pity said wheeler but my client has no alternative no gentleman in the county would speak to him if he sat quiet under such contumely after beating about the bush the usual time oldfield said that sir charles was hungry for litigation but that lady bassett was averse to it in short mr wheeler i will try and get mr bassett a thousand pounds to forego this scandal i will consult him and let you know said wheeler he happens to be in the town oldfield called again in an hour wheeler told him a thousand pounds would be accepted with a written apology oldfield shook his head sir charles will never write an apology right or wrong he is too sincere in his conviction he will never get a jury to share it you must not be too sure of that you don't know the defense oldfield said this with a gravity which did him credit do you know it yourself said the other keen hand mr oldfield smiled haughtily but said nothing wheeler had hit the mark by the by said the latter there is another little matter sir charles assaulted me for doing my duty to my client i mean to sue him here is the writ will you accept service oh certainly mr wheeler and i am glad to find you do not make a habit of serving writs on gentlemen in person of course not i did it on a single occasion contrary to my own wish and went in person to soften the blow instead of sending my clerk after this little spar the two artists in law bade each other farewell with every demonstration of civility sir charles would not apologize the plaintiff filed his declaration the defendant pleaded not guilty but did not disclose a defense the law allows a defendant in libel this advantage plaintiff joined issue and the trial was set down for the next assizes sir charles was irritated but nothing more lady bassett with a woman's natural shrinking from publicity felt it more deeply she would have given thousands of her own money to keep the matter out of court but her very terror of richard bassett restrained her she was always thinking about him and had convinced herself he was the ablest villain in the wide world and she thought to herself if with his small means he annoys charles so what would he do if i were to enrich him he would crush us as the trial drew near she began to hover about sir charles in his study like an anxious hen the maternal yearnings were awakened in her by marriage and she had no child so her charles in trouble was husband and child sometimes she would come in and just kiss his forehead and run out again casting back a celestial look of love at the door and though it was her husband she had kissed she blushed divinely at last one day she crept in and said very timidly charles dear the anonymous letter is not that an excuse for libeling him as they call telling the truth why of course it is have you got it dearest the brave lady took it away the brave lady who is that why the lady that came with mr oldfield and pleaded your cause with papa oh so eloquently sometimes when i think of it now i feel almost jealous who is she from what you have always told me i think it was the sister of charity who nursed me you silly thing she was no sister of charity that was only put on charles tell me the truth what does it matter now it was some lady who loved you loved me and set her wits to work to marry me to you women's love is so disinterested sometimes no no she told me she was a sister of and no doubt that is the truth a sister of whom no matter don't remind me of the past it is odious to me and on second thoughts rather than stir up all that mud it would be better not to use the anonymous letter even if you could get it again lady bassett begged him to take advice on that meantime she would try to get the letter and also the evidence that richard bassett wrote it i see no harm in that said sir charles only confine your communication to mr oldfield i will not have you speaking or writing to a woman i don't know and the more i think of her conduct the less i understand it there are people who do good by stealth suggested bella timidly fiddledeedee replied sir charles you are a goose i mean an angel lady bassett complied with the letter but goose or not evaded the spirit of sir charles's command with considerable dexterity dear mr oldfield you may guess what trouble i am in sir charles will soon have to appear in open court and be talked against by some great orator that anonymous letter mr bassett wrote me was very base and is surely some justification of the violent epithets my dear husband in an unhappy moment of irritation has applied to him the brave lady has it i am sure she will not refuse to send it me i wish i dare ask her to give it me with her own hand but i must not i suppose pray tell her how unhappy i am and perhaps she will favor us with a word of advice as well as the letter i remain yours faithfully bella bassett this letter was written at the brave lady and mr oldfield did what was expected he sent miss somerset a copy of lady bassett's letter and some lines in his own hand describing sir charles's difficulty in a more businesslike way in due course miss somerset wrote him back that she was in the country hunting at no very great distance from huntercombe hall she would sent up to town for her desk the letter would be there if she had kept it at all oldfield groaned at this cool conjecture and wrote back directly urging expedition this produced an effect that he had not anticipated one morning lord harrowdale's foxhounds met at a large covert about five miles from huntercombe and sir charles told lady bassett she must ride to cover yes dear charles love i have no spirit to appear in public we shall soon have publicity enough that is my reason i have not done nor said anything i am ashamed of and you will meet the county on this and on every public occasion i obey said bella and look your best i will dearest and be in good spirits must i yes i will try oh oh oh why you poor spirited little goose dry your eyes this moment there oh and kiss me there ah kissing you is a great comfort it is one you are particularly welcome to now run away and put on your habit i'll have two grooms out one with a fresh horse for me and one to look after you oh charles pray don't make me hunt no no not so tyrannical as that hang it all do you know what i do while you are hunting i pray all the time that you may not get a fall and be hurt and i pray god to forgive you and all the gentlemen for your cruelty in galloping with all those dogs after one poor little inoffensive thing to hunt it and kill it kill it twice indeed once with terror and then over again with mangling its poor little body this is cheerful said sir charles rather ruefully we cannot all be angels like you it is a glorious excitement there you are too good for this world i'll let you off going oh no dear i won't be let off now i know your wish only i beg to ride home as soon as the poor thing runs away you wouldn't get me out of the thick covers if i were a fox i'd run round and round and call on all my acquaintances to set them running as she said this her eyes turned toward each other in a peculiar way and she looked extremely foxy but the look melted away directly the hounds met and lady bassett who was still the beauty of the county was surrounded by riders at first but as the hounds began to work and every now and then a young hound uttered a note they cantered about and took up different posts as experience suggested at last a fox was found at the other end of the cover and away galloped the hunters in that direction all but four persons lady bassett and her groom who kept respectfully aloof and a lady and gentleman who had reined their horses up on a rising ground about a furlong distant lady bassett thus left alone happened to look round and saw the lady level an opera glass toward her and look through it as a result of this inspection the lady cantered toward her she was on a chestnut gelding of great height and bone and rode him as if they were one so smoothly did she move in concert with his easy magnificent strides when she came near lady bassett she made a little sweep and drew up beside her on the grass there was no mistaking that tall figure and commanding face it was the brave lady her eyes sparkled her cheek was slightly colored with excitement she looked healthier and handsomer than ever and also more feminine for a reason the sagacious reader may perhaps discern if he attends to the dialogue so said she without bowing or any other ceremony that little rascal is troubling you again lady bassett colored and panted and looked lovingly at her before she could speak at last she said yes and you have come to help us again well the lawyer said there was no time to lose so i have brought you the anonymous letter oh thank you madam thank you but i'm afraid it will be of no use unless you can prove mr bassett wrote it it is in a disguised hand but you found him out by means of another letter yes but i can't give you that other letter to have it read in a court of law because do you see that gentleman there yes that is marsh oh is it he is a fool but i am going to marry him i have been very ill since i saw you and poor marsh nursed me talk of women nurses if ever you are ill in earnest as i was write to me and i'll send you marsh oh i have no words to tell you his patience his forbearance his watchfulness his tenderness to a sick woman it is no use i must marry him and i could have no letter published that would give him pain of course not oh madam do you think i am capable of doing anything that would give you pain or dear mr marsh either no no you are a good woman not half so good as you are you don't know what you are saying oh yes i do then i say no more it is rude to contradict good by lady bassett must you leave me so soon will you not visit us may i not know the name of so good a friend next week i shall be mrs marsh and you will give me the great pleasure of having you at my house you and your husband the lady showed some agitation at this an unusual thing for her she faltered some day perhaps if i make him as good a wife as i hope to what a lady you are vulgar people are ashamed to be grateful but you are a born lady good by before i make a fool of myself and they are all coming this way by the dogs' music won't you kiss me after bringing me this kiss you and she opened her eyes if you please said lady bassett bending toward her with eyes full of gratitude and tenderness then the other woman took her by the shoulders and plunged her great gray orbs into bella's they kissed each other at that contact the stranger seemed to change her character all in a moment she strained bella to her bosom and kissed her passionately and sobbed out wildly o god you are good to sinners this is the happiest hour of my life it is a forerunner bless you sweet dove of innocence you will be none the worse and i am all the better ah sir charles not one word about me to him and with these words uttered with sudden energy she spurred her great horse leaped the ditch and burst through the dead hedge into the wood and winded out of sight among the trees sir charles came up astonished why who was that bella's eyes began to rove as i have before described but she replied pretty promptly the brave lady herself she brought me the anonymous letter for your defense why how came she to know about it she did not tell me that she was in a great hurry her fiance was waiting for her was it necessary to kiss her in the hunting field said sir charles with something very like a frown i'd kiss the whole field grooms and all if they did you a great service as that dear lady has said bella the words were brave but the accent piteous you are excited bella you had better ride home said sir charles gently enough but moodily thank you charles said bella glad to escape further examination about this mysterious lady she rode home accordingly there she found mr oldfield and showed him the anonymous letter he read it and said it was a defense but a disagreeable one suppose he says he wrote it and the facts were true but i don't think he will confess it he is not a gentleman he is very untruthful can we not make this a trap to catch him sir he has no scruples oldfield looked at her in some surprise at her depth we must get hold of his handwriting said he we must ransack the local banks find his correspondents leave all that to me said lady bassett in a low voice mr oldfield thought he might as well please a beautiful and loving woman if he could so he gave her something to do for her husband very well collect all the materials of comparison you can letters receipts etc meantime i will retain the two principal experts in london and we will submit your materials to them the night before the trial lady bassett thus instructed drove to all the banks but found no clerk acquainted with mr bassett's handwriting he did not bank with anybody in the county she called on several persons she thought likely to possess letters or other writings of richard bassett not a scrap then she began to fear the case looked desperate then she began to think and she thought very hard indeed especially at night in the dead of night she had an idea she got up and stole from her husband's side and studied the anonymous letter next day she sat down with the anonymous letter on her desk and blushed and trembled and looked about like some wild animal scared she selected from the anonymous letter several words character abused sir charles bassett lady abandoned friend whether ten slanderer etc and wrote them on a slip of paper then she locked up the anonymous letter then she locked the door then she sat down to a sheet of paper and after some more wild and furtive glances all around she gave her whole mind to writing a letter and to whom did she write think you to richard bassett chapter xi mr bassett i am sure both yourself and my husband will suffer in public estimation unless some friend comes between you and this unhappy lawsuit is given up do not think me blind nor presumptuous sir charles when he wrote that letter had reason to believe you had done him a deep injury by unfair means many will share that opinion if this cause is tried you are his cousin and his heir at law i dread to see an unhappy feud inflamed by a public trial is there no personal sacrifice by which i can compensate the affront you have received without compromising sir charles bassett's veracity who is the soul of honor i am yours obediently bella bassett she posted this letter and richard bassett had no sooner received it than he mounted his horse and rode to wheeler's with it that worthy's eyes sparkled capital said he we must draw her on and write an answer that will read well in court he concocted an epistle just the opposite of what richard bassett left to himself would have written bassett copied and sent it as his own lady bassett i thank you for writing to me at this moment when i am weighed down by slander your own character stands so high that you would not deign to write to me if you believed the abuse that has been lavished on me with you i deplore this family feud it is not of my seeking and as for this lawsuit it is one in which the plaintiff is really the defendant sir charles has written a defamatory letter which has closed every house in this county to his victim if as i now feel sure you disapprove the libel pray persuade him to retract it the rest our lawyers can settle yours very respectfully richard bassett when lady bassett read this she saw she had an adroit opponent yet she wrote again mr bassett there are limits to my influence with sir charles i have no power to make him say one word against his convictions but my lawyer tells me you seek pecuniary compensation for an affront i offer you out of my own means which are ample that which you seek offer it freely and heartily and i honestly think you had better receive it from me than expose yourself to the risks and mortifications of a public trial i am yours obediently bella bassett lady bassett you have fallen into a very natural error it is true i sue sir charles bassett for money but that is only because the law allows me my remedy in no other form what really brings me into court is the defense of my injured honor how do you meet me you say virtually 'never mind your character here is money' permit me to decline it on such terms a public insult cannot be cured in private strong in my innocence and my wrongs i court what you call the risks of a public trial whatever the result you have played the honorable and womanly part of peacemaker and it is unfortunate for your husband that your gentle influence is limited by his vanity which perseveres in a cruel slander instead of retracting it while there is yet time i am madam yours obediently richard bassett mr bassett i retire from a correspondence which appears to be useless and might if prolonged draw some bitter remark from me as it has from you after the trial which you court and i deprecate you will perhaps review my letters with a more friendly eye i am yours obediently bella bassett in this fencing match between a lawyer and a lady each gained an advantage the lawyer's letters as might have been expected were the best adapted to be read to a jury but the lady subtler in her way obtained at a small sacrifice what she wanted and that without raising the slightest suspicion of her true motive in the correspondence she announced her success to mr oldfield but in the midst of it she quaked with terror at the thought of what sir charles would say to her for writing to mr bassett at all she now with the changeableness of her sex hoped and prayed mr bassett would admit the anonymous letter and so all her subtlety and pains prove superfluous quaking secretly but with a lovely face and serene front she took her place at the assizes before the judge and got as near him as she could the court was crowded and many ladies present bassett v bassett was called in a loud voice there was a hum of excitement then a silence of expectation and the plaintiff's counsel rose to address the jury chapter xii may it please your lordship gentlemen of the jury the plaintiff in this case is richard bassett esquire the direct and lineal representative of that old and honorable family whose monuments are to be seen in several churches in this county and whose estates are the largest i believe in the county he would have succeeded as a matter of course to those estates but for an arrangement made only a year before he was born by which contrary to nature and justice he was denuded of those estates and they passed to the defendant the defendant is nowise to blame for that piece of injustice but he profits by it and it might be expected that his good fortune would soften his heart toward his unfortunate relative i say that if uncommon tenderness might be expected to be shown by anybody to this deserving and unfortunate gentleman it would be by sir charles bassett who enjoys his cousin's ancestral estates and can so well appreciate what that cousin has lost by no fault of his own hear hear silence in the court the judge i must request that there may be no manifestation of feeling counsel i will endeavor to provoke none my lord it is a very simple case and i shall not occupy you long well gentlemen mr bassett is a poor man by no fault of his but if he is poor he is proud and honorable he has met the frowns of fortune like a gentleman like a man he has not solicited government for a place he has not whined nor lamented he has dignified unmerited poverty by prudence and self denial and unable to forget that he is a bassett he has put by a little money every year and bought a small estate or two and had even applied to the lord lieutenant to make him a justice of the peace when a most severe and unexpected blow fell upon him among those large proprietors who respected him in spite of his humbler circumstances was mr hardwicke one of the county members well gentlemen on the st of last may mr bassett received a letter from mr hardwicke inclosing one purporting to be from sir charles bassett the judge does sir charles bassett admit the letter defendant's counsel after a word with oldfield yes my lord plaintiff's counsel a letter admitted to be written by sir charles bassett that letter shall be read to you the letter was then read the counsel resumed conceive if you can the effect of this blow just as my unhappy and most deserving client was rising a little in the world i shall prove that it excluded him from mr hardwicke's house and other houses too he is a man of too much importance to risk affronts he has never entered the door of any gentleman in this county since his powerful relative published this cruel libel he has drawn his spartan cloak around him and he awaits your verdict to resume that place among you which is due to him in every way due to him as the heir in direct line to the wealth and above all to the honor of the bassetts due to him as sir charles bassett's heir at law and due to him on account of the decency and fortitude with which he has borne adversity and with which he now repels foul mouthed slander hear hear silence in the court i have done gentlemen for the present indeed eloquence even if i possessed it would be superfluous the facts speak for themselves call james hardwicke esq mr hardwicke proved the receipt of the letter from sir charles and that he had sent it to mr bassett and that mr bassett had not entered his house since then nor had he invited him mr bassett was then called and being duly trained by wheeler abstained from all heat and wore an air of dignified dejection his counsel examined him and his replies bore out the opening statement everybody thought him sure of a verdict he was then cross examined defendant's counsel pressed him about his unfair way of shooting the judge interfered and said that was trifling if there was no substantial defense why not settle the matter there is a defense my lord then it is time you disclosed it very well my lord mr bassett did you ever write an anonymous letter not that i remember oh that appears to you a trifle it is not so considered the judge be more particular in your question i will my lord did you ever write an anonymous letter to make mischief between sir charles and lady bassett never said the witness but he turned pale do you mean to say you did not write this letter to miss bruce look at the letter mr bassett before you reply bassett cast one swift glance of agony at wheeler then braced himself like iron he examined the letter attentively turned it over lived an age and said it was not his writing do you swear that certainly defendant's counsel i shall ask your lordship to take down that reply if persisted in my client will indict the witness for perjury plaintiff's counsel don't threaten the witness as well as insult him please the judge he is an educated man and knows the duty he owes to god and the defendant take time mr bassett and recollect did you write that letter no my lord counsel waited for the judge to note the reply then proceeded you have lately corresponded with lady bassett i think yes her ladyship opened a correspondence with me it is a lie roared sir charles bassett from the door of the grand jury room silence in the court the judge who made that unseemly remark sir charles i did my lord my wife never corresponded with the cur the plaintiff it is only one insult more gentlemen and as false as the rest permit me my lord my own counsel would never have put the question i would not for the world give lady bassett pain but sir charles and his counsel have extorted the truth from me her ladyship did open a correspondence with me and a friendly one the plaintiff's counsel will your lordship ask whether that was after the defendant had written the libel the question was put and answered in the affirmative lady bassett hid her face in her hands sir charles saw the movement and groaned aloud the judge i beg the case may not be encumbered with irrelevant matter counsel replied that the correspondence would be made evidence in the case to the witness you wrote this letter to lady bassett yes and every word in it and every word in it faltered bassett now ashy pale for he began to see the trap then you wrote this word 'character' and this word 'injured' and this word the judge peevishly he tells you he wrote every word in those letters to lady bassett what more would you have counsel if your lordship will be good enough to examine the correspondence and compare those words in it i have underlined with the same words in the anonymous letter you will perhaps find i know my business better than you seem to think the counsel who ventured on this remonstrance was a sergeant brother eitherside said the judge with a charming manner you satisfied me of that to my cost long ago whenever i had you against me in a case please hand me the letters while the judge was making a keen comparison counsel continued the cross examination you are aware that this letter caused a separation between sir charles bassett and the lady he was engaged to i know nothing about it indeed well were you acquainted with the miss somerset mentioned in this letter slightly you have been at her house once or twice which twice is double as often as once you know twice no more not that i recollect you wrote to her i may have did you or did you not i did what was the purport of that letter i can't recollect at this distance of time on your oath sir did you not write urging her to co operate with you to keep sir charles bassett from marrying his affianced miss bella bruce to whom that anonymous letter was written with the same object the perspiration now rolled in visible drops down the tortured liar's face yet still by a gigantic effort he stood firm and even planted a blow i did not write the anonymous letter but i believe i told miss somerset i loved miss bruce and that her lover was robbing me of mine as he had robbed me of everything else and that was all you said on your oath all i can recollect with this the strong man cowed terrified expecting his letter to somerset to be produced and so the iron chain of evidence completed gasped out man you tear open all my wounds at once and with this burst out sobbing and lamenting aloud that he had ever been born counsel waited calmly till he should be in a condition to receive another dose oh will nobody stop this cruel trial said lady bassett with the tears trickling down her face the judge heard this remark without seeming to do so he said to defendant's counsel whatever the truth may be you have proved enough to show sir charles bassett might well have an honest conviction that mr bassett had done a dastardly act whether a jury would ever agree on a question of handwriting must always be doubtful looking at the relationship of the parties is it advisable to carry this matter further if i might advise the gentlemen they would each consent to withdraw a juror upon this suggestion the counsel for both parties put their heads together in animated whispers and during this the judge made a remark to the jury intended for the public since lady bassett's name has been drawn into this i must say that i have read her letters to mr bassett and they are such as she could write without in the least compromising her husband indeed now the defense is disclosed they appear to me to be wise and kindly letters such as only a good wife a high bred lady and a true christian could write in so delicate a matter plaintiff's counsel my lord we are agreed to withdraw a juror defendant's counsel out of respect for your lordship's advice and not from any doubt of the result on our part the crier wace v haliburton and so the car of justice rolled on till it came to wheeler v bassett this case was soon disposed of sir charles bassett was dignified and calm in the witness box and treated the whole matter with high bred nonchalance as one unworthy of the attention the court was good enough to bestow on it the judge disapproved the assault but said the plaintiff had drawn it on himself by unprofessional conduct and by threatening a gentleman in his own house verdict for the plaintiff s the judge refused to certify for costs lady bassett her throat parched with excitement drove home and awaited her husband's return with no little anxiety as soon as she heard him in his dressing room she glided in and went down on her knees to him pray pray don't scold me i couldn't bear you to be defeated charles sir charles raised her but did not kiss her you think only of me said he rather sadly it is a sorry victory too dearly bought then she began to cry sir charles begged her not to cry but still he did not kiss her nor conceal his mortification he hardly spoke to her for several days she accepted her disgrace pensively and patiently she thought it all over and felt her husband was right and loved her like a man but she thought also that she was not very wrong to love him in her way wrong or not she felt she could not sit idle and see his enemy defeat him the coolness died away by degrees with so much humility on one side and so much love on both but the subject was interdicted forever a week after the trial lady bassett wrote to mrs marsh under cover to mr oldfield and told her how the trial had gone and with many expressions of gratitude invited her and her husband to huntercombe hall she told sir charles what she had done and he wore a very strange look might i suggest that we have them alone said he dryly by all means said lady bassett i don't want to share my paragon with anybody in due course a reply came mr and mrs marsh would avail themselves some day of lady bassett's kindness at present they were going abroad the letter was written by a man's hand about this time oldfield sent sir charles miss somerset's deed canceled and told him she had married a man of fortune who was devoted to her and preferred to take her without any dowry bassett and wheeler went home crestfallen and dined together they discussed the two trials and each blamed the other they quarreled and parted and wheeler sent in an enormous bill extending over five years eighty five items began thus attending you at your house for several hours on which occasion you asked my advice as to whether etc now as a great many of these attendances had been really to shoot game and dine on rabbits at bassett's expense he thought it hard the conversation should be charged and the rabbits not disgusted with his defeat and resolved to evade this bill he discharged his servant and put a retired soldier into his house armed him with a blunderbuss and ordered him to keep all doors closed and present the weapon aforesaid at all rate collectors tax collectors debt collectors and applicants for money to build churches or convert the heathen but not to fire at anybody except his friend wheeler nor at him unless he should try to shove a writ in at some chink of the building this done he went on his travels third class with his eyes always open and his heart full of bitterness nothing happened to richard bassett on his travels that i need relate until one evening when he alighted at a small commercial inn in the city of york and there met a person whose influence on the events i am about to relate seems at this moment incredible to me though it is simple fact he found the commercial room empty and rang the bell in came the waiter a strapping girl with coal black eyes and brows to match and a brown skin but glowing cheeks they both started at sight of each other it was polly somerset why polly how d'ye do how do you come here it's along of you i'm here young man said polly and began to whimper she told him her sister had found out from the page she had been colloguing with him and had never treated her like a sister after that and when she married a gentleman she wouldn't have me aside her for all i could say but she did pack me off into service and here i be the girl was handsome and had a liking for him bassett was idle and time hung heavy on his hands he stayed at the inn a fortnight more for polly's company than anything and at last offered to put her into a vacant cottage on his own little estate of highmore but the girl was shrewd and had seen a great deal of life this last three years she liked richard in her way but she saw he was all self and she would not trust him nay said she i'll not break with rhoda for any young man in britain if i leave service she will never own me at all she is as hard as iron well but you might come and take service near me and then we could often get a word together oh i'm agreeable to that you find me a good place i like an inn best one sees fresh faces bassett promised to manage that for her on reaching home he found a conciliatory letter from wheeler coupled with his permission to tax the bill according to his own notion of justice this and other letters were in an outhouse the old soldier had not permitted them to penetrate the fortress he had entered into the spirit of his instructions and to him a letter was a probable hand grenade bassett sent for wheeler the bill was reduced and a small payment made the rest postponed till better times wheeler was then consulted about polly and he told his client the landlady of the lamb wanted a good active waitress he thought he could arrange that little affair in due course thanks to this artist mary wells hitherto known as polly somerset landed with her boxes at the lamb and with her quick foot her black eyes and ready tongue soon added to the popularity of the inn richard bassett esq for one used to sup there now and then with his friend wheeler and even sleep there after supper by and by the vicar of huntercombe wanted a servant and offered to engage mary wells she thought twice about that she could neither write nor read and therefore was dreadfully dull without company the bustle of an inn and people coming and going amused her however it was a temptation to be near richard bassett so she accepted at last unable to write she could not consult him and she made sure he would be delighted but when she got into the village the prudent mr bassett drew in his horns and avoided her she was mortified and very angry she revenged herself on her employer broke double her wages the vicar had never been able to convert a smasher so he parted with her very readily to lady bassett with a hint that she was rather unfortunate in glass and china in that large house her spirits rose and having a hearty manner and a clapper tongue she became a general favorite one day she met mr bassett in the village and he seemed delighted at the sight of her and begged her to meet him that night at a certain place where sir charles's garden was divided from his own by a ha ha it was a very secluded spot shut out from view even in daylight by the trees and shrubs and the winding nature of the walk that led to it yet it was scarcely a hundred yards from huntercombe hall mary wells came to the tryst but in no amorous mood she came merely to tell mr bassett her mind viz that he was a shabby fellow and she had had her cry and didn't care a straw for him now and she did tell him so in a loud voice and with a flushed cheek but he set to work humbly and patiently to pacify her he represented that in a small house like the vicarage every thing is known he should have ruined her character if he had not held aloof but it is different now said he you can run out of huntercombe house and meet me here and nobody be the wiser not i said mary wells with a toss the worse thing a girl can do is to keep company with a gentleman she must meet him in holes and corners and be flung off like an old glove when she has served his turn that will never happen to you polly dear we must be prudent for the present but i shall be more my own master some day and then you will see how i love you seeing is believing said the girl sullenly you be too fond of yourself to love the likes o' me such was the warning her natural shrewdness gave her but perseverance undermined it bassett so often threw out hints of what he would do some day mixed with warm protestations of love that she began almost to hope he would marry her she really liked him his fine figure and his color pleased her eye and he had a plausible tongue to boot as for him her rustic beauty and health pleased his senses but for his heart she had little place in that what he courted her for just now was to keep him informed of all that passed in huntercombe hall his morbid soul hung about that place and he listened greedily to mary wells's gossip he had counted on her volubility it did not disappoint him she never met him without a budget one half of it lies or exaggerations she was a born liar one night she came in high spirits and greeted him thus what d'ye think i'm riz mrs eden that dresses my lady's hair she took ill yesterday and i told the housekeeper i was used to dress hair and she told my lady if you didn't please our rhoda at that 'twas as much as your life was worth you mustn't be thinking of your young man with her hair in your hand or she'd rouse you with a good crack on the crown with a hair brush so i dressed my lady's hair and handled it like old chaney by the same token she is so pleased with me you can't think she is a real lady not like our rhoda speaks as civil to me as if i was one of her own sort and says she 'i should like to have you about me if i might' i had it on my tongue to tell her she was mistress but i was a little skeared at her at first you know but she will have me about her i see it in her eye bassett was delighted at this news but he did not speak his mind all at once the time was not come he let the gypsy rattle on and bided his time he flattered her and said he envied lady bassett to have such a beautiful girl about her i'll let my hair grow said he ay do said she and then i'll pull it for you this challenge ended in a little struggle for a kiss the sincerity of which was doubtful polly resisted vigorously to be sure but briefly and having given in returned it one day she told him sir charles had met her plump and had given a great start this made bassett very uneasy confound it he will turn you away he will say 'this girl knows too much' how simple you be said the girl d'ye think i let him know says he 'i think i have seen you before' 'yes sir' says i 'i was housemaid here before my lady had me to dress her' 'no' says he 'i mean in london in mayfair you know' i declare you might ha' knocked me down wi' a feather so i looks in his face as cool as marble and i said 'no sir i never had the luck to see london sir' says i 'all the better for you' says he and he swallowed it like spring water as sister rhoda used to say when she told one and they believed it you are a clever girl said bassett he would have turned you out of the house if he had known who you were she disappointed him in one thing she was bad at answering questions morally she was not quite so great an egotist as himself but intellectually a greater her volubility was all egotism she could scarcely say ten words except about herself so when bassett questioned her about sir charles and lady bassett she said yes or no or i don't know and was off at a tangent to her own sayings and doings bassett however by great patience and tact extracted from her at last that sir charles and lady bassett were both sore at not having children and that lady bassett bore the blame that is a good joke said he the smoke dried rake polly you might do me a good turn you have got her ear open her eyes for me what might not happen his eyes shone fiendishly the young woman shook her head me meddle between man and wife i'm too fond of my place ah you don't love me as i love you you think only of yourself and what do you think of do you love me well enough to find me a better place if you get me turned out of huntercombe hall yes i will a much better that is a bargain mary wells was silly in some things but she was very cunning too and she knew richard bassett's hobby she told him to mind himself as well as sir charles or perhaps he would die a bachelor and so his flesh and blood would never inherit huntercombe this remark entered his mind the trial though apparently a drawn battle had been fatal to him he was cut he dared not pay his addresses to any lady in the county and he often felt very lonely now so everything combined to draw him toward mary wells her swarthy beauty which shone out at church like a black diamond among the other women his own loneliness and the pleasure these stolen meetings gave him custom itself is pleasant and the company of this handsome chatterbox became a habit and an agreeable one the young woman herself employed a woman's arts she was cold and loving by turns till at last he gave her what she was working for a downright promise of marriage she pretended not to believe him and so led him further he swore he would marry her he made one stipulation however she really must learn to read and write first when he had sworn this mary became more uniformly affectionate and as women who have been in service learn great self government and can generally please so long as it serves their turn she made herself so agreeable to him that he began really to have a downright liking for her a liking bounded of course by his incurable selfishness but as for his hobby that was on her side now learning to read and write was wormwood to mary wells but the prize was so great she knew all about the huntercombe estates partly from her sister partly from bassett himself he must tell his wrongs even to this girl so she resolved to pursue matrimony even on the severe condition of becoming a scholar she set about it as follows one day that she was doing lady bassett's hair she sighed several times this was to attract the lady's attention and it succeeded is there anything the matter mary no my lady i think there is well my lady i am in a little trouble but it is my own people's fault for not sending of me to school i might be married to morrow if i could only read and write and can you not no my lady dear me i thought everybody could read and write nowadays la no my lady not half of them in our village your parents are much to blame my poor girl well but it is not too late now i think of it there is an adult school in the village shall i arrange for you to go to it thank you my lady but then well all my fellow servants would have a laugh against me the person you are engaged to will he not instruct you oh he have no time to teach me besides i don't want him to know either but i won't be his wife to shame him another sigh mary said lady bassett in the innocence of her heart you shall not be mortified and you shall not lose a good marriage i will try and teach you myself mary was profuse in thanks lady bassett received them rather coldly she gave her a few minutes' instruction in her dressing room every day and mary who could not have done anything intellectual for half an hour at a stretch gave her whole mind for those few minutes she was quick and learned very fast in two months she could read a great deal more than she could understand and could write slowly but very clearly now by this time lady bassett had become so interested in her pupil that she made her read letters and newspapers to her at those parts of the toilet when her services were not required mary wells though a great chatterbox was the closest girl in england limpet never stuck to a rock as she could stick to a lie she never said one word to bassett about lady bassett's lessons she kept strict silence till she could write a letter and then she sent him a line to say she had learned to write for love of him and she hoped he would keep his promise bassett's vanity was flattered by this but on reflection he suspected it was a falsehood he asked her suddenly at their next meeting who had written that note for her you shall see me write the fellow to it when you like was the reply bassett resolved to submit the matter to that test some day at present however he took her word for it and asked her who had taught her i had to teach myself nobody cares enough for me to teach me well i'll forgive you if you will write me a nice letter for mine what when we can meet here and say everything no matter i have written to you and you might write to me they all get letters except me and the jades hold 'em up to me they see i never get one when you are out post me a letter now and then it will only cost you a penny i'm sure i don't ask you for much bassett humored her in this and in one of his letters called her his wife that was to be this pleased her so much that the next time they met she hung round his neck with a good deal of feminine grace richard bassett was a man who now lived in the future everybody in the county believed he had written that anonymous letter and he had no hope of shining by his own light it was bitter to resign his personal hopes but he did and sullenly resolved to be obscure himself but the father of the future heirs of huntercombe he would marry mary wells and lay the blame of the match upon sir charles who had blackened him in the county and put it out of his power to win a lady's hand he told wheeler he was determined to marry but he had not the courage to tell him all at once what a wife he had selected the consequence of this half confession was that wheeler went to work to find him a girl with money and not under county influence one of wheeler's clients was a retired citizen living in a pretty villa near the market town mr wright employed him in little matters and found him active and attentive there was a miss wright a meek little girl palish on whom her father doted wheeler talked to this girl of his friend bassett his virtues and his wrongs and interested the young lady in him this done he brought him to the house and the girl being slight and delicate gazed with gentle but undisguised admiration on bassett's torso wheeler had told richard miss wright was to have seven thousand pounds on her wedding day and that excited a corresponding admiration in the athletic gentleman after that bassett often called by himself and the father encouraged the intimacy he was old and wished to see his daughter married before he left her and this seemed an eligible match though not a brilliant one a bit of land and a good name on one side a smart bit of money on the other the thing went on wheels richard bassett was engaged to jane wright almost before he was aware now he felt uneasy about mary wells very uneasy but it was only the uneasiness of selfishness he began to try and prepare he affected business visits to distant places etc in order to break off by degrees by this means their meetings were comparatively few when they did meet which was now generally by written appointment he tried to prepare by telling her he had encountered losses and feared that to marry her would be a bad job for her as well as for him especially if she should have children mary replied she had been used to work and would rather work for a husband than any other master on another occasion she asked him quietly whether a gentleman ever broke his oath never said richard in short she gave him no opening she would not quarrel she adhered to him as she had never adhered to anything but a lie before then he gave up all hope of smoothing the matter he coolly cut her never came to the trysting place did not answer her letters and being a reckless egotist married jane wright all in a hurry by special license he sent forward to the clerk of huntercombe church and engaged the ringers to ring the church bells from six o'clock till sundown this was for sir charles's ears it was a balmy evening in may lady bassett was commencing her toilet in an indolent way with mary wells in attendance when the church bells of huntercombe struck up a merry peal ah said lady bassett what is that for do you know mary no my lady shall i ask no i dare say it is a village wedding no my lady there's nobody been married here this six weeks our kitchen maid and the baker was the last you know i'll send and know what it is for mary went out and dispatched the first house maid she caught for intelligence the girl ran into the stable to her sweetheart and he told her directly meantime lady bassett moralized upon church bells they are always sad saddest when they seem to be merriest poor things they are trying hard to be merry now but they sound very sad to me sadder than usual somehow the girl knocked at the door mary half opened it and the news shot in 'tis for squire bassett he is bringing of his bride home to highmore to day mr bassett married that is sudden who could he find to marry him there was no reply the house maid had flown off to circulate the news and mary wells was supporting herself by clutching the door sick with the sudden blow close as she was her distress could not have escaped another woman's eye but lady bassett never looked at her after the first surprise she had gone into a reverie and was conjuring up the future to the sound of those church bells she requested mary to go and tell sir charles but she did not lift her head even to give this order mary crept away and knocked at sir charles's dressing room come in said sir charles thinking of course it was his valet mary wells just opened the door and held it ajar my lady bids me tell you sir the bells are ringing for mr bassett he's married and brings her home tonight a dead silence marked the effect of this announcement on sir charles mary wells waited may heaven's curse light on that marriage and no child of theirs ever take my place in this house a a men said mary wells thank you sir said sir charles he took her voice for a man's so deep and guttural was her a a men with concentrated passion she closed the door and crept back to her mistress lady bassett was seated at her glass with her hair down and her shoulders bare mary clinched her teeth and set about her usual work but very soon lady bassett gave a start and stared into the glass mary said she what is the matter you look ghastly and your hands are as cold as ice are you faint no then you are ill very ill i have taken a chill said mary doggedly go instantly to the still room maid and get a large glass of spirits and hot water quite hot mary who wanted to be out of the room fastened her mistress's back hair with dogged patience and then moved toward the door mary said lady bassett in a half apologetic tone my lady i should like to hear what the bride is like i'll know that to night said mary grinding her teeth i shall not require you again till bedtime mary left the room and went not to the still room but to her own garret and there she gave way she flung herself with a wild cry upon her little bed and clutched her own hair and the bedclothes and writhed all about the bed like a wild cat wounded in this anguish she passed an hour she never forgot nor forgave she got up at last and started at her own image in the glass hair like a savage's cheek pale eyes blood shot she smoothed her hair washed her face and prepared to go downstairs but now she was seized with a faintness and had to sit down and moan she got the better of that and went to the still room and got some spirits but she drank them neat gulped them down like water they sent the devil into her black eye but no color into her pale cheek she had a little scarlet shawl she put it over her head and went into the village she found it astir with expectation mr bassett's house stood near the highway but the entrance to the premises was private and through a long white gate by this gate was a heap of stones and mary wells got on that heap and waited when she had been there about half an hour richard bassett drove up in a hired carriage with his pale little wife beside him at his own gate his eye encountered mary wells and he started she stood above him with her arms folded grandly her cheek so swarthy and ruddy was now pale and her black eyes glittered like basilisks at him and his bride the whole woman seemed lifted out of her low condition and dignified by wrong he had to sustain her look for a few seconds while the gate was being opened and it seemed an age he felt his first pang of remorse when he saw that swarthy ruddy cheek so pale then came admiration of her beauty and disgust at the woman for whom he had jilted her and that gave way to fear the hater looked into those glittering eyes and saw he had roused a hate as unrelenting as his own chapter xiii for the first few days richard bassett expected some annoyance from mary wells but none came and he began to flatter himself she was too fond of him to give him pain this impression was shaken about ten days after the little scene i have described he received a short note from her as follows sir you must meet me to night at the same place eight o'clock if you do not come it will be the worse for you m w richard bassett's inclination was to treat this summons with contempt but he thought it would be wiser to go and see whether the girl had any hostile intentions accordingly he went to the tryst he waited for some time and at last he heard a quick firm foot and mary wells appeared she was hooded with her scarlet shawl that contrasted admirably with her coal black hair and out of this scarlet frame her dark eyes glittered she stood before him in silence he said nothing she was silent too for some time but she spoke first well sir you promised one and you have married another now what are you going to do for me what can i do mary i'm not the first that wanted to marry for love but money came in his way and tempted him no you are not the first but that's neither here nor there sir that chalk faced girl has bought you away from me with her money and now i mean to have my share on't oh if that is all said richard we can soon settle it i was afraid you were going to talk about a broken heart and all that stuff you are a good sensible girl and too beautiful to want a husband long i'll give you fifty pounds to forgive me fifty pounds said mary wells contemptuously what when you promised me i should be your wife to day and lady of huntercombe hall by and by fifty pounds no not five fifties well i'll give you seventy five and if that won't do you must go to law and see what you can get what han't you had your bellyful of law mind it is an unked thing to forswear yourself and that is what you done at the 'sizes i have seen what you did swear about your letter to my sister sir charles have got it all wrote down in his study and you swore a lie to the judge as you swore a lie to me here under heaven you villain she raised her voice very loud don't you gainsay me or i'll soon have you by the heels in jail for your lies you'll do as i bid you and very lucky to be let off so cheap you was to be my master but you chose her instead well then you shall be my servant you shall come here every saturday at eight o'clock and bring me a sovereign which i never could keep a lump o' money and i have had one or two from rhoda so i'll take it a sovereign a week till i get a husband of my own sort and then you'll have to come down handsome once for all bassett knitted his brows and thought hard his natural impulse was to defy her but it struck him that a great many things might happen in a few months so at last he said humbly i consent i have been to blame only i'd rather pay you this money in some other way my way or none very well then i will bring it you as you say mind you do then said mary wells and turned haughtily on her heel bassett never ventured to absent himself at the hour and at first the blackmail was delivered and received with scarcely a word but by and by old habits so far revived that some little conversation took place then after a while bassett used to tell her he was unhappy and she used to reply she was glad of it then he began to speak slightingly of his wife and say what a fool he had been to marry a poor silly nonentity when he might have wedded a beauty mary wells being intensely vain listened with complacency to this although she replied coldly and harshly by and by her natural volubility overpowered her and she talked to bassett about herself and huntercombe house but always with a secret reserve later such is the force of habit each used to look forward with satisfaction to the saturday meeting although each distrusted and feared the other at bottom later still that came to pass which mary wells had planned from the first with deep malice and that shrewd insight into human nature which many a low woman has the cooler she was the warmer did richard bassett grow till at last contrasting his pale meek little wife with this glowing hebe he conceived an unholy liking for the latter she met it sometimes with coldness and reproaches sometimes with affected alarm sometimes with a half yielding manner and so tormented him to her heart's content and undermined his affection for his wife thus she revenged herself on them both to her heart's content but malice so perverse is apt to recoil on itself and women in particular should not undertake a long and subtle revenge of this sort since the strongest have their hours of weakness and are surprised into things they never intended the subsequent history of mary wells will exemplify this meantime however meek little mrs bassett was no match for the beauty and low cunning of her rival yet a time came when she defended herself unconsciously she did something that made her husband most solicitous for her welfare and happiness he began to watch her health with maternal care to shield her from draughts to take care of her diet to indulge her in all her whims instead of snubbing her and to pet her till she was the happiest wife in england for a time she deserved this at his hands for she assisted him there where his heart was fixed she aided his hobby did more for it than any other creature in england could to return to huntercombe hall the loving couple that owned it were no longer happy the hope of offspring was now deserting them and the disappointment was cruel they suffered deeply with this difference that lady bassett pined and sir charles bassett fretted the woman's grief was more pure and profound than the man's if there had been no richard bassett in the world still her bosom would have yearned and pined and the great cry of nature give me children or i die would have been in her heart though it would never have risen to her lips sir charles had of course less of this profound instinct than his wife but he had it too only in him the feeling was adulterated and at the same time imbittered by one less simple and noble an enemy sat at his gate that enemy whose enduring malice had at last begotten equal hostility in the childless baronet was now married and would probably have heirs and if so that hateful brood the spawn of an anonymous letter writer would surely inherit bassett and huntercombe succeeding to sir charles bassett deceased without issue this chafed the childless man and gradually undermined a temper habitually sweet though subject as we have seen to violent ebullitions where the provocation was intolerable sir charles then smarting under his wound spoke now and then rather unkindly to the wife he loved so devotedly that is to say his manner sometimes implied that he blamed her for their joint calamity lady bassett submitted to these stings in silence they were rare and speedily followed by touching regrets and even had it not been so she would have borne them with resignation for this motherless wife loved her husband with all a wife's devotion and a mother's unselfish patience let this be remembered to her credit it is the truth and she may need it her own yearning was too deep and sad for fretfulness yet though unlike her husband's it never broke out in anger the day was gone by when she could keep it always silent it welled out of her at times in ways that were truly womanly and touching when she called on a wife the lady was sure to parade her children the boasted tact of women a quality the narrow compass of which has escaped their undiscriminating eulogists was sure to be swept away by maternal egotism and then poor lady bassett would admire the children loudly and kiss them to please the cruel egotist and hide the tears that rose to her own eyes but she would shorten her visit when a child died in the village mary wells was sure to be sent with words of comfort and substantial marks of sympathy scarcely a day passed that something or other did not happen to make the wound bleed but i will confine myself to two occasions on each of which her heart's agony spoke out and so revealed how much it must have endured in silence since the day when sir charles allowed her to sit in a little room close to his study while he received mr wheeler's visit she had fitted up that room and often sat there to be near sir charles and he would sometimes call her in and tell her his justice cases one day she was there when the constable brought in a prisoner and several witnesses the accused was a stout florid girl with plump cheeks and pale gray eyes she seemed all health stupidity and simplicity she carried a child on her left arm no dweller in cities could suspect this face of crime as well indict a calf yet the witnesses proved beyond a doubt that she had been seen with her baby in the neighborhood of a certain old well on a certain day at noon that soon after noon she had been seen on the road without her baby and being asked what had become of it had said she had left it with her aunt ten miles off and that about an hour after that a faint cry had been heard at the bottom of the old well it was ninety feet deep people had assembled and a brave farmer's boy had been lowered in the bight of a cart rope and had brought up a dead hen and a live child bleeding at the cheek having fallen on a heap of fagots at the bottom of the well which child was the prisoner's sir charles had the evidence written down and then told the accused she might make a counter statement if she chose but it would be wiser to say nothing at all thereupon the accused dropped him a little short courtesy looked him steadily in the face with her pale gray eyes and delivered herself as follows if you please sir i was a sitting by th' old well with baby in my arms and i was mortal tired i was wi' carring of him he be uncommon heavy for his age and if you please sir he is uncommon resolute and while i was so he give a leap right out of my arms and fell down th' old well i screams and runs away to tell my brother's wife as lives at top of the hill but she was gone into north wood for dry sticks to light her oven and when i comes back they had got him out of the well and i claims him directly and the constable said we must come before you sir so here we be this she delivered very glibly without tremulousness hesitation or the shadow of a blush and dropped another little courtesy at the end to sir charles thereupon he said not one word to her but committed her for trial and gave the farmer's boy a sovereign the people were no sooner gone than lady bassett came in with the tears streaming and threw herself at her husband's knees oh charles can such things be does god give a child to a woman that has the heart to kill it and refuse one to me who would give my heart's blood to save a hair of its little head oh what have we done that he singles us out to be so cruel to us then sir charles tried to comfort her but could not and the childless ones wept together it began to be whispered that mrs bassett was in the family way neither sir charles nor lady bassett mentioned this rumor it would have been like rubbing vitriol into their own wounds but this reserve was broken through one day it was a sunny afternoon in june just thirteen months after mr bassett's wedding lady bassett was with her husband in his study settling invitations for a ball and writing them when the church bells struck up a merry peal they both left off and looked at each other eloquently lady bassett went out but soon returned looking pale and wild yes said she with forced calmness then suddenly losing her self command she broke out pointing through the window at highmore he has got a fine boy to take our place here kill me charles send me to heaven to pray for you and take another wife that will love you less but be like other wives that villain has married a fruitful vine and lifting both arms to heaven with a gesture unspeakably piteous poetic and touching i am a barren stock chapter xiv of all the fools nature produces with the help of society fathers of first borns are about the most offensive the mothers of ditto are bores too flinging their human dumplings at every head but considering the tortures they have suffered and the anguish the little egotistical viper they have just hatched will most likely give them and considering further that their love of their firstborn is greater than their pride and their pride unstained by vanity one must make allowances for them but the male parent is not so excusable his fussy vanity is an inferior article to the mother's silly but amiable pride his obtrusive affection is two thirds of it egotism and blindish egotism too for if at the very commencement of the wife's pregnancy the husband is sent to india or hanged the little angel as they call it lord forgive them is nurtured from a speck to a mature infant by the other parent and finally brought into the world by her just as effectually as if her male confederate had been tied to her apron string all the time instead of expatriated or hanged therefore the law for want i suppose of studying medicine is a little inconsiderate in giving children to fathers and taking them by force from such mothers as can support them and therefore let gallina go on clucking over her first born but gallus be quiet or sing a little smaller with these preliminary remarks let me introduce to you a character new in fiction but terribly old in history the clucking cock upon the birth of a son and heir mr richard bassett was inflated almost to bursting he became suddenly hospitable collected all his few friends about him and showed them all the boy at great length and talked boy and little else he went out into the world and made calls on people merely to remind them he had a son and heir his self gratulation took a dozen forms perhaps the most amusing and the richest food for satire was the mock querulous style of which he showed himself a master don't you ever marry said he to wheeler and others look at me do you think i am the master of my own house not i i am a regular slave first there is a monthly nurse who orders me out of my wife's presence or graciously lets me in just as she pleases that is queen then there's a wet nurse queen whom i must humor in everything or she will quarrel with me and avenge herself by souring her milk but these are mild tyrants compared with the young king himself if he does but squall we must all skip and find out what he ails or what he wants as for me i am looked upon as a necessary evil the women seem to admit that a father is an incumbrance without which these little angels could not exist but that is all he had a christening feast and it was pretty well attended for he reminded all he asked that the young christian was the heir to the bassett estates they feasted and the church bells rang merrily he had his pew in the church new lined with cloth and took his wife to be churched the nurse was in the pew too with his son and heir it squalled and spoiled the liturgy thereat gallus chuckled he made a gravel walk all along the ha ha that separated his garden from sir charles's and called it the heir's walk here the nurse and child used to parade on sunny afternoons he got an army of workmen and built a nursery fit for a duke's nine children it occupied two entire stories and rose in the form of a square tower high above the rest of his house which indeed was as humble as the heir's tower was pretentious the heir's tower had a flat lead roof easy of access and from it you could inspect huntercombe hall and see what was done on the lawn or at some of the windows here in the august afternoons mr and mrs bassett used to sit drinking their tea with nurse and child and bassett would talk to his unconscious boy and tell him that the great house and all that belonged to it should be his in spite of the arts that had been used to rob him of it now of course the greater part of all this gratulation was merely amusing and did no harm except stirring up the bile of a few old bachelors and imbittering them worse than ever against clucking cocks crowing hens inflated parents and matrimony in general but the overflow of it reached huntercombe hall and gave cruel pain to the childless ones over whom this inflated father was in fact exulting as for the christening and the bells that pealed for it and the subsequent churching they bore these things with sore hearts and bravely being things of course but when it came to their ears that bassett and his family called his new gravel walk the heir's walk and his ridiculous nursery the heir's tower this roused a bitter animosity and indeed led to reprisals sir charles built a long wall at the edge of his garden shutting out the heir's walk and intercepting the view of his own premises from that walk then mr bassett made a little hill at the end of his walk so that the heir might get one peep over the wall at his rich inheritance then sir charles began to fell timber on a gigantic scale he went to work with several gangs of woodmen and all his woods which were very extensive rang with the ax and the trees fell like corn he made no secret that he was going to sell timber to the tune of several thousand pounds and settle it on his wife then richard bassett through wheeler his attorney remonstrated in his own name and that of his son against this excessive fall of timber on an entailed estate sir charles chafed like a lion stung by a gad fly but vouchsafed no reply the answer came from mr oldfield he said sir charles had a right under the entail to fell every stick of timber and turn his woods into arable ground if he chose and even if he had not looking at his age and his wife's it was extremely improbable that richard bassett would inherit the estates the said richard bassett was not personally named in the entail and his rights were all in supposition if mr wheeler thought he could dispute both these positions the court of chancery was open to his client then wheeler advised bassett to avoid the court of chancery in a matter so debatable and sir charles felled all the more for the protest the dead bodies of the trees fell across each other and daylight peeped through the thick woods it was like the clearing of a primeval forest richard bassett went about with a witness and counted the fallen the poor were allowed the lopwood they thronged in for miles round and each built himself a great wood pile for the winter the poor blessed sir charles he gave the proceeds thirteen thousand pounds to his wife for her separate use he did not tie it up he restricted her no further than this she undertook never to draw above pounds at a time without consulting mr oldfield as to the application sir charles said he should add to this fund every year his beloved wife should not be poor even if the hated cousin should outlive him and turn her out of huntercombe and so passed the summer of that year then the autumn and then came a singularly mild winter there was more hunting than usual and richard bassett whom his wife's fortune enabled to cut a better figure than before was often in the field mounted on a great bony horse that was not so fast as some being half bred but a wonderful jumper even in this pastime the cousins were rivals sir charles's favorite horse was a magnificent thoroughbred who was seldom far off at the finish over good ground richard's cocktail had no chance with him but sometimes if toward the close of the run they came to stiff fallows and strong fences the great strength of the inferior animal and that prudent reserve of his powers which distinguishes the canny cocktail from the higher blooded animal would give him the advantage of this there occurred on a certain th of november an example fraught with very serious consequences that day the hounds met on sir charles's estate sir charles and lady bassett breakfasted in pink he had on his scarlet coat white tie irreproachable buckskins and top boots it seemed a pity a speck of dirt should fall on them lady bassett was in her riding habit and when she mounted her pony and went to cover by his side with her blue velvet cap and her red brown hair she looked more like a brilliant flower than a mere woman a veteran fox was soon found and went away with unusual courage and speed and lady bassett paced homeward to wait her lord's return with an anxiety men laugh at but women can appreciate it was a form of quiet suffering she had constantly endured and never complained nor even mentioned the subject to sir charles but once and then he pooh poohed her fancies the hunt had a burst of about forty minutes that left richard bassett's cocktail in the rear and the fox got into a large beech wood with plenty of briars and kept dodging about it for two hours and puzzled the scent repeatedly richard bassett elected not to go winding in and out among trees risk his horse's legs in rabbit holes and tire him for nothing he had kept for years a little note book he called statistics of foxes and that told him an old dog fox of uncommon strength if dislodged from that particular wood would slip into bellman's coppice and if driven out of that would face the music again would take the open country for higham gorse and probably be killed before he got there but once there a regiment of scythes might cut him out but bleeding sneezing fox hounds would never work him out at the tail of a long run so richard bassett kept out of the wood and went gently on to bellman's coppice and waited outside his book proved an oracle after two hours' dodging and maneuvering the fox came out at the very end of bellman's coppice with nothing near him but richard bassett pug gave him the white of his eye in an ugly leer and headed straight as a crow for higham gorse richard bassett blew his horn collected the hunt and laid the dogs on away they went close together thunder mouthed on the hot scent after a three miles' gallop they sighted the fox for a moment just going over the crest of a rising ground two furlongs off then the hullabbaloo and excitement grew furious and one electric fury animated dogs men and horses another mile and the fox ran in sight scarcely a furlong off but many of the horses were distressed the bassetts however kept up one by his horse being fresh the other by his animal's native courage and speed then came some meadows bounded by a thick hedge and succeeded by a plowed field of unusual size eighty acres when the fox darted into this hedge the hounds were yelling at his heels the hunt burst through the thin fence expecting to see them kill close to it but the wily fox had other resources at his command than speed appreciating his peril he doubled and ran sixty yards down the ditch and the impetuous hounds rushed forward and overran the scent they raved about to and fro till at last one of the gentlemen descried the fox running down a double furrow in the middle of the field he had got into this and so made his way more smoothly than his four footed pursuers could the dogs were laid on and away they went helter skelter at the end of this stiff ground a stiffish leap awaited them an old quickset had been cut down and all the elm trees that grew in it and a new quickset hedge set on a high bank with double ditches the huntsman had an irish horse that laughed at this fence he jumped on to the bank and then jumped off it into the next field richard bassett's cocktail came up slowly rose high and landed his forefeet in the field and so scrambled on sir charles went at it rather rashly his horse tried hard by the fallow caught his heels against the edge of the bank and went headlong into the other ditch throwing sir charles over his head into the field unluckily some of the trees were lying about and sir charles's head struck one of these in falling the horse blundered out again and galloped after the hounds but the rider lay there motionless nobody stopped at first the pace was too good to inquire but presently richard bassett who had greeted the accident with a laugh turned round in his saddle and saw his cousin motionless and two or three gentlemen dismounting at the place these were newcomers then he resigned the hunt and rode back sir charles's cap was crushed in and there was blood on his white waistcoat he was very pale and quite insensible the gentlemen raised him with expressions of alarm and kindly concern and inquired of each other what was best to be done richard bassett saw an opportunity to conciliate opinion and seized it he must be taken home directly said he we must carry him to that farmhouse and get a cart for him he helped carry him accordingly the farmer lent them a cart with straw and they laid the insensible baronet gently on it richard bassett supporting his head gentlemen said he rather pompously at such a moment everything but the tie of kindred is forgotten which resounding sentiment was warmly applauded by the honest squires they took him slowly and carefully toward huntercombe distant about two miles from the scene of the accident this th november lady bassett passed much as usual with her on hunting days she was quietly patient till the afternoon and then restless and could not settle down in any part of the house till she got to a little room on the first floor with a bay window commanding the country over which sir charles was hunting in this she sat with her head against one of the mullions and eyed the country side as far as she could see presently she heard a rustle and there was mary wells standing and looking at her with evident emotion what is the matter mary said lady bassett oh my lady said mary and she trembled and her hands worked lady bassett started up with alarm painted in her countenance my lady there's something wrong in the hunting field sir charles an accident they say lady bassett put her hand to her heart with a faint cry mary wells ran to her come with me directly cried lady bassett she snatched up her bonnet and in another minute she and mary wells were on their road to the village questioning every body they met but nobody they questioned could tell them anything the stable boy who had told the report in the kitchen of huntercombe said he had it from a gentleman's groom riding by as he stood at the gates the ill news thus flung in at the gate by one passing rapidly by was not confirmed by any further report and lady bassett began to hope it was false but a terrible confirmation came at last in the outskirts of the village mistress and servant encountered a sorrowful procession the cart itself followed by five gentlemen on horseback pacing slowly and downcast as at a funeral in the cart sir charles bassett splashed all over with mud and his white waistcoat bloody lay with his head upon richard bassett's knee his hair was wet with blood some of which had trickled down his cheek and dried even richard's buckskins were slightly stained with it at that sight lady bassett uttered a scream which those who heard it never forgot and flung herself heaven knows how into the cart but she got there and soon had that bleeding head on her bosom she took no notice of richard bassett but she got sir charles away from him and the cart took her embracing him tenderly and kissing his hurt head and moaning over him all through the village to huntercombe hall four years ago they passed through the same village in a carriage and four bells pealing rustics shouting to take possession of huntercombe and fill it with pledges of their great and happy love and as they flashed past the heir at law shrank hopeless into his little cottage now how changed the pageant a farmer's cart a splashed and bleeding and senseless form in it supported by a childless despairing woman one weeping attendant walking at the side and among the gentlemen pacing slowly behind the heir at law with his head lowered in that decent affectation of regret which all heirs can put on to hide the indecent complacency within chapter xv at the steps of huntercombe hall the servants streamed out and relieved the strangers of the sorrowful load sir charles was carried into the hall and richard bassett turned away with one triumphant flash of his eye quickly suppressed and walked with impenetrable countenance and studied demeanor into highmore house even here he did not throw off the mask it peeled off by degrees he began by telling his wife gravely enough sir charles had met with a severe fall and he had attended to him and taken him home ah i am glad you did that richard said mrs bassett and is he very badly hurt i am afraid he will hardly get over it he never spoke he just groaned when they took him down from the cart at huntercombe poor lady bassett ay it will be a bad job for her jane yes dear there is a providence in it the fall would never have killed him but his head struck a tree upon the ground and that tree was one of the very elms he had just cut down to rob our boy indeed yes he was felling the very hedgerow timber and this was one of the old elms in a hedge he must have done it out of spite for elm wood fetches no price it is good for nothing i know of except coffins well he has cut down his poor man richard death reconciles enemies surely you can forgive him now i mean to try richard bassett seemed now to have imbibed the spirit of quicksilver his occupations were not actually enlarged yet somehow or other he seemed full of business he was all complacent bustle about nothing he left off inveighing against sir charles and indeed if you are one of those weak spirits to whom censure is intolerable there is a cheap and easy way to moderate the rancor of detraction you have only to die let me comfort genius in particular with this little recipe why on one occasion bassett actually snubbed wheeler for a mere allusion that worthy just happened to remark no more felling of timber on bassett manor for a while for shame said richard the man had his faults but he had his good qualities too a high spirited gentleman beloved by his friends and respected by all the county his successor will find it hard to reconcile the county to his loss wheeler stared and then grinned satirically this eulogy was never repeated for sir charles proved ungrateful he omitted to die after all attended by first rate physicians tenderly nursed and watched by lady bassett and mary wells he got better by degrees and every stage of his slow but hopeful progress was communicated to the servants and the village and to the ladies and gentlemen who rode up to the door every day and left their cards of inquiry the most attentive of all these was the new rector a young clergyman who had obtained the living by exchange he was a man highly gifted both in body and mind a swarthy adonis whose large dark eyes from the very first turned with glowing admiration on the blonde beauties of lady bassett he came every day to inquire after her husband and she sometimes left the sufferer a minute or two to make her report to him in person at other times mary wells was sent to him that artful girl soon discovered what had escaped her mistress's observation the bulletins were favorable and welcomed on all sides richard bassett alone was incredulous i want to see him about again said he sir charles is not the man to lie in bed if he was really better as for the doctors they flatter a fellow till the last moment let me see him on his legs and then i'll believe he is better strange to say obliging fate granted richard bassett this moderate request one frosty but sunny afternoon as he was inspecting his coming domain from the heir's tower he saw the hall door open and a muffled figure come slowly down the steps between two women it was sir charles feeble but convalescent he crept about on the sunny gravel for about ten minutes and then his nurses conveyed him tenderly in again this sight which might have touched with pity a more generous nature startled richard bassett and then moved his bile i was a fool said he nothing will ever kill that man he will see me out see us all out and that mary wells nurses him and i dare say in love with him by this time the fools can't nurse a man without curse the whole pack of ye he yelled and turned away in rage and disgust that same night he met mary wells and in a strange fit of jealousy began to make hot protestations of love to her he knew it was no use reproaching her so he went on the other tack she received his vows with cool complacency but would only stay a minute and would only talk of her master and mistress toward whom her heart was really warming in their trouble she spoke hopefully and said 'tisn't as if he was one of your faint hearted ones as meet death half way why the second day when he could scarce speak he sees me crying by the bed and says he almost in a whisper 'what are you crying for' 'sir' says i ''tis for you to see you lie like a ghost' 'then you be wasting of salt water' says he 'i wish i may sir' says i so then he raised himself up a little bit 'look at me' says he 'i'm a bassett i am not the breed to die for a crack on the skull and leave you all to the mercy of them that would have no mercy' which he meant you i suppose so he ordered me to leave crying which i behooved to obey for he will be master mind ye while he have a finger to wag poor dear gentleman he will and soon after this she resisted all his attempts to detain her and scudded back to the house leaving bassett to his reflections which were exceedingly bitter sir charles got better and at last used to walk daily with lady bassett their favorite stroll was up and down the lawn close under the boundary wall he had built to shut out the heir's walk the afternoon sun struck warm upon that wall and the walk by its side on the other side a nurse often carried little dicky bassett the heir but neither of the promenaders could see each other for the wall richard bassett on the contrary from the heir's tower could see both these little parties and as some men cannot keep away from what causes their pain he used to watch these loving walks and see sir charles get stronger and stronger till at last instead of leaning on his beloved wife he could march by her side or even give her his arm yet the picture was in a great degree delusive for except during these blissful walks when the sun shone on him and love and beauty soothed him sir charles was not the man he had been the shake he had received appeared to have damaged his temper strangely he became so irritable that several of his servants left him and to his wife he repined and his childless condition which had been hitherto only a deep disappointment became in his eyes a calamity that outweighed his many blessings he had now narrowly escaped dying without an heir and this seemed to sink into his mind and co operating with the concussion his brain had received brought him into a morbid state he brooded on it and spoke of it and got back to it from every other topic in a way that distressed lady bassett unspeakably she consoled him bravely but often when she was alone her gentle courage gave way and she cried bitterly to herself her distress had one effect she little expected it completed what her invariable kindness had begun and actually won the heart of a servant those who really know that tribe will agree with me that this was a marvelous conquest yet so it was mary wells conceived for her a real affection and showed it by unremitting attention and a soft and tender voice that soothed lady bassett and drew many a silent but grateful glance from her dove like eyes mary listened and heard enough to blame sir charles for his peevishness and she began to throw out little expressions of dissatisfaction at him but these were so promptly discouraged by the faithful wife that she drew in again and avoided that line but one day coming softly as a cat she heard sir charles and lady bassett talking over their calamity sir charles was saying that it was heaven's curse that all the poor people in the village had children that richard bassett's weak puny little wife had brought him an heir and was about to make him a parent again he alone was marked out and doomed to be the last of his race and yet said he if i had married any other woman and you had married any other man we should have had children by the dozen i suppose upon the whole though he said nothing palpably unjust he had the tone of a man blaming his wife as the real cause of their joint calamity under which she suffered a deeper nobler and more silent anguish than himself this was hard to bear and when sir charles went away mary wells ran in with an angry expression on the tip of her tongue she found lady bassett in a pitiable condition lying rather than leaning on the table with her hair loose about her sobbing as if her heart would break all that was good in mary wells tugged at her heart strings she flung herself on her knees beside her and seizing her mistress's hand and drawing it to her bosom fell to crying and sobbing along with her this canine devotion took lady bassett by surprise she turned her tearful eyes upon her sympathizing servant and said oh mary and her soft hand pressed the girl's harder palm gratefully mary spoke first oh my lady she sobbed it breaks my heart to see you so and what a shame to blame you for what is no fault of yourn if i was your husband the cradles would soon be full in this house but these fine gentlemen they be old before their time with smoking of tobacco and then to come and lay the blame on we mary i value you very much more than i ever did a servant in my life but if you speak against your master we shall part la my lady i wouldn't for the world sir charles is a perfect gentleman why he gave me a sovereign only the other day for nursing of him but he didn't ought to blame you for no fault of yourn and to make you cry it tears me inside out to see you cry you that is so good to rich and poor i wouldn't vex myself so for that dear heart 'twas always so god sends meat to one house and mouths to another i could be patient if poor sir charles was not so unhappy sighed lady bassett but if ever you are a wife mary you will know how wretched it makes us to see a beloved husband unhappy then i'd make him happy said mary ah if i only could oh i could tell you a way for i have known it done and now he is as happy as a prince you see my lady some men are like children to make them happy you must give them their own way and so if i was in your place i wouldn't make two bites of a cherry for sometimes i think he will fret himself out of the world for want on't heaven forbid it is my belief you would not be long behind him no mary why should i then whisper my lady and although lady bassett drew slightly back at this freedom mary wells poured into her ear a proposal that made her stare and shiver as for the girl's own face it was as unmoved as if it had been bronze lady bassett drew back and eyed her askant with amazement and terror what is this you have dared to say why it is done every day by people of your class perhaps no i don't believe it mary i have been mistaken in you i am afraid you are a vicious girl leave me please i can't bear the sight of you mary went away very red and the tear in her eye in the evening lady bassett gave mary wells a month's warning and mary accepted it doggedly and thought herself very cruelly used after this mistress and maid did not exchange an unnecessary word for many days this notice to leave was very bitter to mary wells for she was in the very act of making a conquest young drake a very small farmer and tenant of sir charles had fallen in love with her and she liked him and had resolved he should marry her with which view she was playing the tender but coy maiden very prettily but drake though young and very much in love was advised by his mother and evidently resolved to go the old fashioned way keep company a year and know the girl before offering the ring just before her month was out a more serious trouble threatened mary wells her low artful amour with richard bassett had led to its natural results by degrees she had gone further than she intended and now the fatal consequences looked her in the face she found herself in an odious position for her growing regard for young drake though not a violent attachment was enough to set her more and more against richard bassett and she was preparing an entire separation from the latter when the fatal truth dawned on her then there was a temporary revulsion of feeling she told her condition to bassett and implored him with many tears to aid her to disappear for a time and hide her misfortune especially from her sister mr bassett heard her and then gave her an answer that made her blood run cold why do you come to me said he why don't you go to the right man young drake he then told her he had had her watched and she must not think to make a fool of him she was as intimate with the young farmer as with him and was in his company every day mary wells admitted that drake was courting her but said he was a civil respectful young man who desired to make her his wife you have lost me that said she bursting into tears and so for god's sake show yourself a man for once and see me through my trouble the egotist disbelieved or affected not to believe her and said when there are two it is always the gentleman you girls deceive but you can't make a fool of me mrs drake marry the farmer and i'll give you a wedding present that is all i can do for any other man's sweetheart i have got my own family to provide for and it is all i can contrive to make both ends meet he was cold and inflexible to her prayers then she tried threats he laughed at them said he the time is gone by for that if you wanted to sue me for breach of promise you should have done it at once not waited eighteen months and taken another sweetheart first come come you played your little game you made me come here week after week and bleed a sovereign a woman that loved a man would never have been so hard on him as you were on me i grinned and bore it but when you ask me to own another man's child a man of your own sort that you are in love with you hate me that is a little too much no mrs drake if that is your game we will fight it out before the public if you like and having delivered this with a tone of harsh and loud defiance he left her left her forever she sat down upon the cold ground and rocked herself despair was cold at her heart she sat in that forlorn state for more than an hour then she got up and went to her mistress's room and sat by the fire for her limbs were cold as well as her heart she sat there gazing at the fire and sighing heavily till lady bassett came up to bed she then went through her work like an automaton and every now and then a deep sigh came from her breast lady bassett heard her sigh and looked at her her face was altered a sort of sullen misery was written on it lady bassett was quick at reading faces and this look alarmed her mary said she kindly is there anything the matter no reply are you unwell no are you in trouble ay with a burst of tears lady bassett let her cry thinking it would relieve her and then spoke to her again with the languid pensiveness of a woman who has also her trouble you have been very attentive to sir charles and a kind good servant to me mary you are mocking me my lady said mary bitterly you wouldn't have turned me off for a word if i had been a good servant lady bassett colored high and was silenced for a moment at last she said i feel it must seem harsh to you you don't know how wicked it was to tempt me but it is not as if you had done anything wrong i do not feel bound to mention mere words i shall give you an excellent character mary indeed i have i think i have got a good place for you i shall know to morrow and when it is settled we will look over my wardrobe together this proposal implied a boxful of presents and would have made mary's dark eyes flash with delight at another time but she was past all that now she interrupted lady bassett with this strange speech you are very kind my lady will you lend me the key of your medicine chest lady bassett looked surprised but said certainly mary and held out the keys but before mary could take them she considered a moment and asked her what medicine she required only a little laudanum no mary not while you look like that and refuse to tell me your trouble i am your mistress and must exert my authority for your good tell me at once what is the matter i'd bite my tongue off sooner you are wrong mary i am sure i should be your best friend i feel much indebted to you for the attention and the affection you have shown me and i am grieved to see you so despondent make a friend of me there think it over and talk to me again to morrow mary wells took the true servant's view of lady bassett's kindness she looked at it as a trap not indeed set with malice prepense but still a trap she saw that lady bassett meant kindly at present but for all that she was sure that if she told the truth her mistress would turn against her and say oh i had no idea your trouble arose out of your own imprudence i can do nothing for a vicious girl she resolved therefore to say nothing or else to tell some lie or other quite wide of the mark deplorable as this young woman's situation was the duplicity and coarseness of mind which had brought her into it would have somewhat blunted the mental agony such a situation must inflict but it was aggravated by a special terror she knew that if she was found out she would lose the only sure friend she had in the world the fact is mary wells had seen a great deal of life during the two years she was out of the reader's sight rhoda had been very good to her had set her up in a lodging house at her earnest request she misconducted it and failed threw it up in disgust and begged rhoda to put her in the public line rhoda complied mary made a mess of the public house then rhoda showed her she was not fit to govern anything and drove her into service again and in that condition having no more cares than a child and plenty of work to do and many a present from rhoda she had been happy but rhoda though she forgave blunders incapacity for business and waste of money had always told her plainly there was one thing she never would forgive rhoda marsh had become a good christian in every respect but one the male rake reformed is rather tolerant but the female rake reformed is as a rule bitterly intolerant of female frailty and rhoda carried this female characteristic to an extreme both in word and in deed they were only half sisters after all and mary knew that she would be cast off forever if she deviated from virtue so far as to be found out besides the general warning there had been a special one when she read mary's first letter from huntercombe hall rhoda was rather taken aback at first but on reflection she wrote to mary saying she could stay there on two conditions she must be discreet and never mention her sister rhoda in the house and she must not be tempted to renew her acquaintance with richard bassett mind said she if ever you speak to that villain i shall hear of it and i shall never notice you again this was the galling present and the dark future which had made so young and unsentimental a woman as mary wells think of suicide for a moment or two and it now deprived her of her rest and next day kept her thinking and brooding all the time her now leaden limbs were carrying her through her menial duties the afternoon was sunny and sir charles and lady bassett took their usual walk mary wells went a little way with them looking very miserable lady bassett observed and said kindly mary you can give me that shawl i will not keep you go where you like till five o'clock mary never said so much as thank you she put the shawl round her mistress and then went slowly back she sat down on the stone steps and glared stupidly at the scene and felt very miserable and leaden she seemed to be stuck in a sort of slough of despond and could not move in any direction to get out of it while she sat in this somber reverie a gentleman walked up to the door and mary wells lifted her head and looked at him notwithstanding her misery her eyes rested on him with some admiration for he was a model of a man six feet high and built like an athlete his face was oval and his skin dark but glowing his hair eyebrows and long eyelashes black as jet his gray eyes large and tender he was dressed in black with a white tie and his clothes were well cut and seemed superlatively so owing to the importance and symmetry of the figure they covered it was the new vicar mr angelo he smiled on mary graciously and asked her how sir charles was she said he was better then mr angelo asked more timidly was lady bassett at home she is just gone out sir a look of deep disappointment crossed mr angelo's face it did not escape mary wells she looked at him full and lowering her voice a little said she is only in the grounds with sir charles she will be at home about five o'clock mr angelo hesitated and then said he would call again at five he evidently preferred a duet to a trio he then thanked mary wells with more warmth than the occasion seemed to call for and retired very slowly he had come very quickly mary wells looked after him and asked herself wildly if she could not make some use of him and his manifest infatuation but before her mind could fix on any idea and indeed before the young clergyman had taken twenty steps homeward loud voices were heard down the shrubbery these were followed by an agonized scream mary wells started up and the young parson turned they looked at each other in amazement then came wild and piercing cries for help in a woman's voice the young clergyman cried out her voice her voice and dashed into the shrubbery with a speed mary wells had never seen equaled he had won the yard race at oxford in his day the agonized screams were repeated and mary wells screamed in response as she ran toward the place chapter xvi sir charles bassett was in high spirits this afternoon indeed a little too high bella my love said he now i'll tell you why i made you give me your signature this morning the money has all come in for the wood and this very day i sent oldfield instructions to open an account for you with a london banker lady bassett looked at him with tears of tenderness in her eyes dearest said she i have plenty of money but the love to which i owe this present that is my treasure of treasures well i accept it charles but don't ask me to spend it on myself i should feel i was robbing you it is nothing to me how you spend it i have saved it from the enemy now that very enemy heard these words he had looked from the heir's tower and seen sir charles and lady bassett walking on their side the wall and the nurse carrying his heir on the other side he had come down to look at his child in the sun but he walked softly on the chance of overhearing sir charles and lady bassett say something or other about his health his design went no further than that but the fate of listeners is proverbial lady bassett endeavored to divert her husband from the topic he seemed to be approaching it always excited him now and did him harm do not waste your thoughts on that enemy he is powerless at this moment perhaps but his turn is sure to come again and i shall provide for it i mean to live on half my income and settle the other half on you i shall act on the clause in the entail and sell all the timber on the estate except about the home park and my best covers it will take me some years to do this i must not glut the market and spoil your profits but every year i'll have a fall till i have denuded mr bassett's inheritance as he calls it and swelled your banker's account to a plum bella i have had a shake even now that i am better such a pain goes through my head like a bullet crushing through it whenever i get excited i don't think i shall be a long lived man but never mind i'll live as long as i can and while i do live i'll work for you and against that villain charles cried lady bassett i implore you to turn your thoughts away from that man and to give up these idle schemes were you to die i should soon follow you so pray do not shorten your life by these angry passions or you will shorten mine this appeal acted powerfully on sir charles and he left off suddenly with flushed cheeks and tried to compose himself but his words had now raised a corresponding fury on the other side of that boundary wall richard bassett stung with rage and unlike his high bred cousin accustomed to mix cunning even with his fury gave him a terrible blow a very coup de jarnac he spoke at him he ran forward to the nurse and said very loud let me see the little darling he does you credit what fat cheeks what arms an infant hercules there take him up the mound now lift him in your arms and let him see his inheritance higher nurse higher ay crow away youngster all that is yours house and land and all they may steal the trees they can't make away with the broad acres ha i believe he understands every word nurse see how he smiles and crows at the sound of bassett's voice sir charles started and at the first taunt he uttered something between a moan and a roar as of a wounded lion come away cried lady bassett he is doing it on purpose but the stabs came too fast sir charles shook her off and looked wildly round for a weapon to strike his insulter with curse him and his brat he cried they shall neither of them i'll kill them both he sprang fiercely at the wall and notwithstanding his weakly condition raised himself above it and glared over with a face so full of fury that richard bassett recoiled in dismay for a moment and said run run he'll hurt the child but the next moment sir charles's hands lost their power he uttered a miserable moan and fell gasping under the wall in an epileptic fit with all the terrible symptoms i have described in a previous portion of this story these were new to his poor wife and as she strove in vain to control his fearful convulsions her shrieks rent the air indeed her screams were so appalling that bassett himself sprang at the wall and by a great effort of strength drew himself up and peered down with white face at the glaring eyes clinched teeth purple face and foaming lips of his enemy and his body that bounded convulsively on the ground with incredible violence at that moment humanity prevailed over every thing and he flung himself over the wall and in his haste got rather a heavy fall himself it is a fit he cried and running to the brook close by filled his hat with water and was about to dash it over sir charles's face but lady bassett repelled him with horror don't touch him you villain you have killed him and then she shrieked again at this moment mr angelo dashed up and saw at a glance what it was for he had studied medicine a little he said it is epilepsy leave him to me he managed by his great strength to keep the patient's head down till the face got pale and the limbs still then telling lady bassett not to alarm herself too much he lifted sir charles and actually proceeded to carry him toward the house lady bassett weeping proffered her assistance and so did mary wells but this athlete said a little bruskly no no i have practiced this sort of thing and partly by his rare strength partly by his familiarity with all athletic feats carried the insensible baronet to his own house as i have seen my accomplished friend mr henry neville carry a tall actress on the mimic stage only the distance being much longer the perspiration rolled down mr angelo's face with so sustained an effort he laid him gently on the floor of his study while lady bassett sent two grooms galloping for medical advice and half a dozen servants running for this and that stimulant as one thing after another occurred to her agitated mind the very rustling of dresses and scurry of feet overhead told all the house a great calamity had stricken it lady bassett hung over the sufferer sighing piteously and was for supporting his beloved head with her tender arm but mr angelo told her it was better to keep the head low that the blood might flow back to the vessels of the brain she cast a look of melting gratitude on her adviser and composed herself to apply stimulants under his direction and advice thus judiciously treated sir charles began to recover consciousness in part he stared and muttered incoherently lady bassett thanked god on her knees and then turned to mr angelo with streaming eyes and stretched out both hands to him with an indescribable eloquence of gratitude he gave her his hands timidly and she pressed them both with all her soul unconsciously she sent a rapturous thrill through the young man's body he blushed and then turned pale and felt for a moment almost faint with rapture at that sweet and unexpected pressure of her soft hands but at this moment sir charles broke out in a sort of dry business like voice i'll kill the viper and his brood then he stared at mr angelo and could not make him out at first ah said he complacently this is my private tutor a man of learning i read homer with him but i have forgotten it all but one line greek that's a beautiful verse homer old boy i'll take your advice i'll kill the heir at law and his brat as well and when they are dead and well seasoned i'll sell them to that old timber merchant the devil to make hell hotter order my horse somebody this minute during this tirade lady bassett's hands kept clutching as if to stop it and her eyes filled with horror mr angelo came again to her rescue he affected to take it all as a matter of course and told the servants they need not wait sir charles was coming to himself by degrees and the danger was all over but when the servants were gone he said to lady bassett seriously i would not let any servant be about sir charles except this one she is evidently attached to you suppose we take him to his own room he then made mary wells a signal and they carried him upstairs sir charles talked all the while with pitiable vehemence indeed it was a continuous babble like a brook mary wells was taking him into his own room but lady bassett said no into my room oh i will never let him out of my sight again then they carried him into lady bassett's bedroom and laid him gently down on a couch there he looked round observed the locality and uttered a little sigh of complacency he left off talking for the present and seemed to doze the place which exerted this soothing influence on sir charles had a contrary and strange effect on mr angelo it was of palatial size and lighted by two side windows and an oriel window at the end the delicate stone shafts and mullions were such as are oftener seen in cathedrals than in mansions the deep embrasure was filled with beautiful flowers and luscious exotic leaf plants from the hot houses the floor was of polished oak and some feet of this were left bare on all sides of the great aubusson carpet made expressly for the room by this means cleanliness penetrated into every corner the oak was not only cleaned but polished like a mirror the curtains were french chintzes of substance and exquisite patterns and very voluminous on the walls was a delicate rose tinted satin paper to which french art unrivaled in these matters had given the appearance of being stuffed padded and divided into a thousand cozy pillows by gold headed nails the wardrobes were of satin wood the bedsteads one small one large were plain white and gold in moderation all this however was but the frame to the delightful picture of a wealthy young lady's nest the things that startled and thrilled mr angelo were those his imagination could see the fair mistress using the exquisite toilet table the dresden mirror with its delicate china frame muslined and ribboned the great ivory handled brushes the array of cut glass gold mounted bottles and all the artillery of beauty the baths of various shapes and sizes in which she laved her fair body the bath sheets and the profusion of linen fine and coarse the bed with its frilled sheets its huge frilled pillows and its eider down quilt covered with bright purple silk a delicate perfume came through the wardrobes where strata of fine linen from hamburg and belfast lay on scented herbs and this permeating the room seemed the very perfume of beauty itself and intoxicated the brain imagination conjured pictures proper to the scene a goddess at her toilet that glorious hair lying tumbled on the pillow and burning in contrasted color with the snowy sheets and with the purple quilt from this reverie he was awakened by a soft voice that said how can i ever thank you enough sir mr angelo controlled himself and said by sending for me whenever i can be of the slightest use then comprehending his danger he added hastily and i fear i am none whatever now then he rose to go lady bassett gave him both her hands again and this time he kissed one of them all in a flurry he could not resist the temptation then he hurried away with his whole soul in a tumult lady bassett blushed and returned to her husband's side doctor willis came heard the case looked rather grave and puzzled and wrote the inevitable prescription for the established theory is that man is cured by drugs alone sir charles wandered a little while the doctor was there and continued to wander after he was gone then mary wells begged leave to sleep in the dressing room lady bassett thanked her but said she thought it unnecessary a good night's rest she hoped would make a great change in the sufferer mary wells thought otherwise and quietly brought her little bed into the dressing room and laid it on the floor her judgment proved right sir charles was no better the next day nor the day after he brooded for hours at a time and when he talked there was an incoherence in his discourse above all he seemed incapable of talking long on any subject without coming back to the fatal one of his childlessness and when he did return to this it was sure to make him either deeply dejected or else violent against richard bassett and his son he swore at them and said they were waiting for his shoes lady bassett's anxiety deepened strange fears came over her she put subtle questions to the doctor he returned obscure answers and went on prescribing medicines that had no effect she looked wistfully into mary wells's face and there she saw her own thoughts reflected mary said she one day in a low voice what do they say in the kitchen some say one thing some another what can they say they never see him and never shall while i am here this reminded lady bassett that mary's time was up the idea of a stranger taking her place and seeing sir charles in his present condition was horrible to her oh mary said she piteously surely you will not leave me just now do you wish me to stay my lady can you ask it how can i hope to find such devotion as yours such fidelity and above all such secrecy ah mary i am the most unhappy lady in all england this day then she began to cry bitterly and mary wells cried with her and said she would stay as long as she could but said she i gave you good advice my lady and so you will find lady bassett made no answer whatever and that disappointed mary for she wanted a discussion the days rolled on and brought no change for the better sir charles continued to brood on his one misfortune he refused to go out of doors even into the garden giving as his reason that he was not fit to be seen i don't mind a couple of women said he gravely but no man shall see charles bassett in his present state no patience patience i'll wait till heaven takes pity on me after all it would be a shame that such a race as mine should die out and these fine estates go to blackguards and poachers and anonymous letter writers lady bassett used to coax him to walk in the corridor but even then he ordered mary wells to keep watch and let none of the servants come that way from words he let fall it seems he thought childlessness was written on his face and that it had somehow degraded his features now a wealthy and popular baronet could not thus immure himself for any length of time without exciting curiosity and setting all manner of rumors afloat visitors poured into huntercombe to inquire lady bassett excused herself to many but some of her own sex she thought it best to encounter this subjected her to the insidious attacks of curiosity admirably veiled with sympathy the assailants were marvelously subtle but so was the devoted wife she gave kiss for kiss and equivoque for equivoque she seemed grateful for each visit but they got nothing out of her except that sir charles's nerves were shaken by his fall and that she was playing the tyrant for once and insisting on absolute quiet for her patient one visitor she never refused mr angelo he from the first had been her true friend had carried sir charles away from the enemy and then had dismissed the gaping servants she saw that he had divined her calamity and she knew from things he said to her that he would never breathe a word out of doors she confided in him she told him mr bassett was the real cause of all this misery he had insulted sir charles the nature of this insult she suppressed and oh mr angelo said she that man is my terror night and day i don't know what he can do but i feel he will do something if he ever learns my poor husband's condition i trust lady bassett you are convinced he will learn nothing from me indeed i will tell the ruffian anything you like he has been sounding me a little called to inquire after his poor cousin the hypocrite how good you are please tell him absolute repose is prescribed for a time but there is no doubt of sir charles's ultimate recovery mr angelo promised heartily mary wells was not enough a woman must have a man to lean on in trouble and lady bassett leaned on mr angelo she even obeyed him one day he told her that her own health would fail if she sat always in the sick room she must walk an hour every day must i said she sweetly yes even if it is only in your own garden from that time she used to walk with him nearly every day richard bassett saw this from his tower of observation saw it and chuckled aha said he husband sick in bed wife walking in the garden with a young man a parson too he is dark she is fair something will come of this ha ha lady bassett now talked of sending to london for advice but mary wells dissuaded her physic can't cure him there's only one can cure him and that is yourself my lady ah would to heaven i could try my way and you will see my lady what that way oh no no well then if you won't nobody else can such speeches as these often repeated on the one hand and sir charles's melancholy on the other drove lady bassett almost wild with distress and perplexity meanwhile her vague fears of richard bassett were being gradually realized bassett employed wheeler to sound dr willis as to his patient's condition dr willis true to the honorable traditions of his profession would tell him nothing but dr willis had a wife she pumped him and wheeler pumped her by this channel wheeler got a somewhat exaggerated account of sir charles's state he carried it to bassett and the pair put their heads together the consultation lasted all night and finally a comprehensive plan of action was settled wheeler stipulated that the law should not be broken in the smallest particular but only stretched four days after this conference mr bassett mr wheeler and two spruce gentlemen dressed in black sat upon the heir's tower watching huntercombe hall they watched and watched until they saw mr angelo make his usual daily call then they watched and watched until lady bassett and the young clergyman came out and strolled together into the shrubbery then the two gentlemen went down the stairs and were hastily conducted by bassett to huntercombe hall they rang the bell and the taller said in a business like voice dr mosely from dr willis mary wells was sent for and dr mosely said dr willis is unable to come to day and has sent me mary wells conducted him to the patient the other gentleman followed who is this said mary i can't let all the world in to see him it is mr donkyn the surgeon dr willis wished the patient to be examined with the stethoscope you can stay outside mr donkyn this new doctor announced himself to sir charles felt his pulse and entered at once into conversation with him sir charles was in a talking mood and very soon said one or two inconsecutive things dr mosely looked at mary wells and said he would write a prescription as soon as he had written it he said very loud mr donkyn the door instantly opened and that worthy appeared on the threshold oblige me said the doctor to his confrere by seeing this prescription made up and you can examine the patient yourself but do not fatigue him with this he retired swiftly and strolled down the corridor to wait for his companion he had not to wait long mr donkyn adopted a free and easy style with sir charles and that gentleman marked his sense of the indignity by turning him out of the room and kicking him industriously half way down the passage messrs mosely and donkyn retired to highmore bassett was particularly pleased at the baronet having kicked donkyn so was wheeler so was dr mosely donkyn alone did not share the general enthusiasm when sir charles had disposed of mr donkyn he turned on mary wells and rated her soundly for bringing strangers into his room to gratify their curiosity and when lady bassett came in he made his formal complaint concluding with a proposal that one of two persons should leave huntercombe forever that afternoon mary wells or sir charles bassett mary replied not to him but to her mistress he came from dr willis my lady it was dr mosely and the other gent was a surgeon two medical men sent by dr willis said lady bassett knitting her brow with wonder and a shade of doubt a couple of her own sweethearts sent by herself suggested sir charles lady bassett sat down and wrote a hasty letter to dr willis send a groom with it as fast as he can ride said she and she was much discomposed and nervous and impatient till the answer came bade dr willis came in person i sent no one to take my place said he i esteem my patient too highly to let any stranger prescribe for him or even see him for a few days to come lady bassett sank into a chair and her eloquent face filled with an undefinable terror mary wells being on her defense put in her word i am sure he was a doctor for he wrote a prescription and here 'tis dr willis examined the prescription with no friendly eye acetate of morphia the very worst thing that could be given him this is the favorite of the specialists this fatal drug has eaten away a thousand brains for one it has ever benefited ah said lady bassett 'specialists' what are they medical men who confine their practice to one disease mad doctors he means said the patient very gravely lady bassett turned very pale then those were mad doctors never you mind bella said sir charles i kicked the fellow handsomely i am sorry to hear it sir charles why dr willis looked at lady bassett as much as to say i shall not give him my real reason and then said i think it very undesirable you should be excited and provoked until your health is thoroughly restored dr willis wrote a prescription and retired lady bassett sank into a chair and trembled all over her divining fit was on her she saw the hand of the enemy and filled with vague fears mary wells tried to comfort her i'll take care no more strangers get in here said she and my lady if you are afraid why not have the keepers and two or three more to sleep in the house for as for them footmen they be too soft to fight i will said lady bassett but i fear it will be no use our enemy has so many resources unknown to me how can a poor woman fight with a shadow that comes in a moment and strikes and then is gone and leaves his victim trembling then she slipped into the dressing room and became hysterical out of her husband's sight and hearing mary wells nursed her and when she was better whispered in her ear lose no more time then cure him you know the way chapter xvii in the present condition of her mind these words produced a strange effect on lady bassett she quivered and her eyes began to rove in that peculiar way i have already noticed and then she started up and walked wildly to and fro and then she kneeled down and prayed and then alarmed perplexed exhausted she went and leaned her head on her patient's shoulder and wept softly a long time some days passed and no more strangers attempted to see sir charles lady bassett was beginning to breathe again when she was afflicted by an unwelcome discovery mary wells fainted away so suddenly that but for lady bassett's quick eye and ready hand she would have fallen heavily lady bassett laid her head down and loosened her stays and discovered her condition she said nothing till the young woman was well and then she taxed her with it mary denied it plump but seeing her mistress's disgust at the falsehood she owned it with many tears being asked how she could so far forget herself she told lady bassett she had long been courted by a respectable young man he had come to the village bound on a three years' voyage to bid her good by and what with love and grief at parting they had been betrayed into folly and now he was on the salt seas little dreaming in what condition he had left her and said she before ever he can write to me and i to him i shall be a ruined girl that is why i wanted to put an end to myself i will too unless i can find some way to hide it from the world lady bassett begged her to give up those desperate thoughts she would think what could be done for her lady bassett could say no more to her just then for she was disgusted with her but when she came to reflect that after all this was not a lady and that she appeared by her own account to be the victim of affection and frailty rather than of vice she made some excuses and then the girl had laid aside her trouble her despair and given her sorrowful mind to nursing and comforting sir charles this would have outweighed a crime and it made the wife's bowels yearn over the unfortunate girl mary said she others must judge you i am a wife and can only see your fidelity to my poor husband i don't know what i shall do without you but i think it is my duty to send you to him if possible you are sure he really loves you me cross the seas after a young man said mary wells i'd as lieve hang myself on the nighest tree and make an end no my lady if you are really my friend let me stay here as long as i can i will never go downstairs to be seen and then give me money enough to get my trouble over unbeknown to my sister she is all my fear she is married to a gentleman and got plenty of money and i shall never want while she lives and behave myself but she would never forgive me if she knew she is a hard woman she is not like you my lady i'd liever cut my hand off than i'd trust her as i would you lady bassett was not quite insensible to this compliment but she felt uneasy what help you to deceive your sister for her good why if any one was to go and tell her about me now she'd hate them for telling her almost as much as she would hate me lady bassett was sore perplexed unable to see quite clear in the matter she naturally reverted to her husband and his interest that dictated her course she said well stay with us mary as long as you can and then money shall not be wanting to hide your shame from all the world but i hope when the time comes you will alter your mind and tell your sister may i ask what her name is mary after a moment's hesitation said her name was marsh i know a mrs marsh said lady bassett but of course that is not your sister my mrs marsh is rather fair so is my sister for that matter and tall yes but you never saw her you'd never forget her it you had she has got eyes like a lion ah does she ride oh she is famous for that and driving and all indeed but no i see no resemblance oh she is only my half sister this is very strange lady bassett put her hand to her brow and thought mary said she all this is very mysterious we are wading in deep waters mary wells had no idea what she meant the day was not over yet just before dinner time a fly from the station drove to the door and mr oldfield got out he was detained in the hall by sentinel moss lady bassett came down to him at the very sight of him she trembled and said richard bassett yes said mr oldfield he is in the field again he has been to the court of chancery ex parte and obtained an injunction ad interim to stay waste not another tree must be cut down on the estate for the present thank heaven it is no worse than that not another tree shall be felled on the grounds of course not but they will not stop there if we do not move to dissolve the injunction i fear they will go on and ask the court to administer the estate with a view to all interests concerned especially those of the heir at law and his son what while my husband lives if they can prove him dead in law i don't understand you mr oldfield they have got affidavits of two medical men that he is insane lady bassett uttered a faint scream and put her hand to her heart and of course they will use that extraordinary fall of timber as a further proof and also as a reason why the court should interfere to protect the heir at law their case is well got up and very strong said mr oldfield regretfully well but you are a lawyer and you have always beaten them hitherto i had law and fact on my side it is not so now to be frank lady bassett i don't see what i can do but watch the case on the chance of some error or illegality it is very hard to fight a case when you cannot put your client forward and i suppose that would not be safe how unfortunate that you have no children children how could they help us what a question how could richard bassett move the court if he was not the heir at law after a long conference mr oldfield returned to town to see what he could do in the way of procrastination and lady bassett promised to leave no stone unturned to cure sir charles in the meantime mr oldfield was to write immediately if any fresh step was taken when mr oldfield was gone lady bassett pondered every word he had said and mild as she was her rage began to rise against her husband's relentless enemy her wits worked her eyes roved in that peculiar half savage way i have described she became intolerably restless and any one acquainted with her sex might see that some strange conflict was going on in her troubled mind every now and then she would come and cling to her husband and cry over him and that seemed to still the tumult of her soul a little she never slept all that night and next day clinging in her helpless agony to the nearest branch she told mary wells what bassett was doing and said what shall i do he is not mad but he is in so very precarious a state that if they get at him to torment him they will drive him mad indeed my lady said mary wells i can't go from my word 'tis no use in making two bites of a cherry we must cure him and if we don't you'll never rue it but once and that will be all your life i should look on myself with horror afterward were i to deceive him now no my lady you are too fond of him for that once you saw him happy you'd be happy too no matter how it came about that richard bassett will turn him out of this else i am sure he will he is a hard hearted villain lady bassett's eyes flashed fire then her eyes roved then she sighed deeply her powers of resistance were beginning to relax as for mary wells she gave her no peace she kept instilling her mind into her mistress's with the pertinacity of a small but ever dripping fount and we know both by science and poetry that small incessant drops of water will wear a hole in marble gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed saepe cadendo and in the midst of all a letter came from mr oldfield to tell her that mr bassett threatened to take out a commission de lunatico and she must prepare sir charles for an examination for if reported insane the court would administer the estates but the heir at law mr bassett would have the ear of the court and the right of application and become virtually master of huntercombe and bassett and perhaps considering the spirit by which he was animated would contrive to occupy the very hall itself lady bassett was in the dressing room when she received this blow and it drove her almost frantic she bemoaned her husband she prayed god to take them both and let their enemy have his will she wept and raved and at the height of her distress came from the other room a feeble cry childless childless childless lady bassett heard that and in one moment from violent she became unnaturally and dangerously calm she said firmly to mary wells this is more than i can bear you pretend you can save him do it mary wells now trembled in her turn but she seized the opportunity my lady whatever i say you'll stand to whatever you say i'll stand to chapter xviii mary wells like other uneducated women was not accustomed to think long and earnestly on any one subject to use an expression she once applied with far less justice to her sister her mind was like running water but gestation affects the brains of such women and makes them think more steadily and sometimes very acutely added to which the peculiar dangers and difficulties that beset this girl during that anxious period stimulated her wits to the very utmost often she sat quite still for hours at a time brooding and brooding and asking herself how she could turn each new and unexpected event to her own benefit now so much does mental force depend on that exercise of keen and long attention in which her sex is generally deficient that this young woman's powers were more than doubled since the day she first discovered her condition and began to work her brains night and day for her defense gradually as events i have related unfolded themselves she caught a glimpse of this idea that if she could get her mistress to have a secret her mistress would help her to keep her own hence her insidious whispers and her constant praises of mr angelo who she saw was infatuated with lady bassett yet the designing creature was actually fond of her mistress and so strangely compounded is a heart of this low kind that the extraordinary step she now took was half affectionate impulse half egotistical design she made a motion with her hand inviting lady bassett to listen and stepped into sir charles's room childless childless childless hush sir said mary wells don't say so we shan't be many mouths without one please heaven sir charles shook his head sadly don't you believe me no what did ever i tell you a lie no but you are mistaken she would have told me well sir my lady is young and shy and i think she is afraid of disappointing you after all for you know sir there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip but 'tis as i tell you sir sir charles was much agitated and said he would give her a hundred guineas if that was true where is my darling wife why do i hear this through a servant mary wells cast a look at the door and said for lady bassett to hear she is receiving company now sir i have told you good news will you do something to oblige me you shouldn't speak of it direct to my lady just yet and if you want all to go well you mustn't vex my lady as you are doing now what i mean you mustn't be so downhearted there's no reason for't and you mustn't coop yourself up on this floor it sets the folks talking and worries my lady you should give her every chance being the way she is sir charles said eagerly he would not vex her for the world i'll walk in the garden said he but as for going abroad you know i am not in a fit condition yet my mind is clouded not as i see oh not always but sometimes a cloud seems to get into my head and if i was in public i might do or say something discreditable i would rather die la sir said mary wells in a broad hearty way a cloud in your head you've had a bad fall and a fit at top on't and no wonder your poor head do ache at times you'll outgrow that if you take the air and give over fretting about the t'other thing i tell you you'll hear the music of a child's voice and little feet a pattering up and down this here corridor before so very long if so be you take my advice and leave off fretting my lady with fretting of yourself you should consider she is too fond of you to be well when you be ill i'll get well for her sake said sir charles firmly at this moment there was a knock at the door mary wells opened it so that the servant could see nothing mr angelo has called my lady will be down directly mary wells then slipped into the dressing room and found lady bassett looking pale and wild she had heard every word there he is better already said mary wells he shall walk in the garden with you this afternoon what have you done i can't look him in the face now suppose he speaks to me he will not i'll manage that you won't have to say a word only listen to what i say and don't make a liar of me he is better already how will this end cried lady bassett helplessly what shall i do you must go downstairs and not come here for an hour at least or you'll spoil my work mr angelo is in the drawing room i will go to him lady bassett slipped out by the other door and it was three hours instead of one before she returned for the first time in her life she was afraid to face her husband chapter xix meantime mary wells had a long conversation with her master and after that she retired into the adjoining room and sat down to sew baby linen clandestinely after a considerable tune lady bassett came in and sinking into a chair covered her face with her hands she had her bonnet on mary wells looked at her with black eyes that flashed triumph after so surveying her for some time she said i have been at him again and there's a change for the better already he is not the same man you go and see else lady bassett now obeyed her servant she rose and crept like a culprit into sir charles's room she found him clean shaved dressed to perfection and looking more cheerful than she had seen him for many a long day ah bella said he you have your bonnet on let us have a walk in the garden lady bassett opened her eyes and consented eagerly though she was very tired they walked together and sir charles being a man that never broke his word put no direct question to lady bassett but spoke cheerfully of the future and told her she was his hope and his all she would baffle his enemy and cheer his desolate hearth she blushed and looked confused and distressed then he smiled and talked of indifferent matters until a pain in his head stopped him then he became confused and putting his hand piteously to his head proposed to retire at once to his own room lady bassett brought him in and he reposed in silence on the sofa the next day and indeed many days afterward presented similar features mary wells talked to her master of the bright days to come of the joy that would fill the house if all went well and of the defeat in store for richard bassett she spoke of this man with strange virulence said she would think no more of sticking a knife into him than of eating her dinner and in saying this she showed the white of her eye in a manner truly savage and vindictive to hurt the same person is a surer bond than to love the same person and this sentiment of mary wells coupled with her uniform kindness to himself gave her great influence with sir charles in his present weakened condition moreover the young woman had an oily persuasive tongue and she who persuades us is stronger than he who convinces us thus influenced sir charles walked every day in the garden with his wife and forbore all direct allusion to her condition though his conversation was redolent of it he was still subject to sudden collapses of the intellect but he became conscious when they were coming on and at the first warning he would insist on burying himself in his room after some days he consented to take short drives with lady bassett in the open carriage this made her very joyful sir charles refused to enter a single house so high was his pride and so great his terror lest he should expose himself but it was a great point gained that she could take him about the county and show him in the character of a mere invalid every thing now looked like a cure slow perhaps but progressive and lady bassett had her joyful hours yet not without a bitter alloy her divining mind asked itself what she should say and do when sir charles should be quite recovered this thought tormented her and sometimes so goaded her that she hated mary wells for her well meant interference and by a natural recoil from the familiarity circumstances had forced on her treated that young woman with great coldness and hauteur the artful girl met this with extreme meekness and servility the only reply she ever hazarded was an adroit one she would take this opportunity to say how much better master do get ever since i took in hand to cure him this oblique retort seldom failed lady bassett would look at her husband and her face would clear and she would generally end by giving mary a collar or a scarf or something thus did circumstances enable the lower nature to play with the higher lady bassett's struggles were like those of a bird in a silken net they led to nothing when it came to the point she could neither do nor say any thing to retard his cure any day the court of chancery set in motion by richard bassett might issue a commission de lunatico and if sir charles was not cured by that time richard bassett would virtually administer the estate so mr oldfield had told her and that she felt sure would drive sir charles mad for life so there was no help for it she feared she writhed she hated herself but sir charles got better daily and so she let herself drift along mary wells made it fatally easy to her she was the agent lady bassett was silent and passive after all she had a hope of extrication sir charles once cured she would make him travel europe with her money would relieve her of mary wells and distance cut all the other cords and indeed a time came when she looked back on her present situation with wonder at the distress it had caused her i was in shallow water then said she but now chapter xx sir charles observed that he was never trusted alone he remarked this and inquired with a peculiar eye why that was lady bassett had the tact to put on an innocent look and smile and say that is true dearest i have tied you to my apron string without mercy but it serves you right for having fits and frightening me you get well and my tyranny will cease at once however after this she often left him alone in the garden to remove from his mind the notion that he was under restraint from her mr bassett observed this proceeding from his tower one day mr angelo called and lady bassett left sir charles in the garden to go and speak to him she had not been gone many minutes when a boy ran to sir charles and said oh sir please come to the gate the lady has had a fall and hurt herself sir charles much alarmed followed the boy who took him to a side gate opening on the high road sir charles rushed through this and was passing between two stout fellows that stood one on each side the gate when they seized him and lifted him in a moment into a close carriage that was waiting on the spot he struggled and cried loudly for assistance but they bundled him in and sprang in after him a third man closed the door and got up by the side of the coachman he drove off avoiding the village soon got upon a broad road and bowled along at a great rate the carriage being light and drawn by two powerful horses so cleverly and rapidly was it done that but for a woman's quick ear the deed might not have been discovered for hours but mary wells heard the cry for help through an open window recognized sir charles's voice and ran screaming downstairs to lady bassett she ran wildly out with mr angelo to look for sir charles he was nowhere to be found then she ordered every horse in the stables to be saddled and she ran with mary to the place where the cry had been heard for some time no intelligence whatever could be gleaned but at last an old man was found who said he had heard somebody cry out and soon after that a carriage had come tearing by him and gone round the corner but this direction was of little value on account of the many roads any one of which it might have taken however it left no doubt that sir charles had been taken away from the place by force terror stricken and pale as death lady bassett never lost her head for a moment indeed she showed unexpected fire she sent off coachman and grooms to scour the country and rouse the gentry to help her she gave them money and told them not to come back till they had found sir charles mr angelo said eagerly i'll go to the nearest magistrate and we will arrest richard bassett on suspicion god bless you dear friend sobbed lady bassett oh yes it is his doing murderer off went mr angelo on his errand he was hardly gone when a man was seen running and shouting across the fields lady bassett went to meet him surrounded by her humble sympathizers it was young drake he came up panting with a double barreled gun in his hand for he was allowed to shoot rabbits on his own little farm and stammered out oh my lady sir charles they have carried him off against his will who where did you see him ay and heerd him and all i was ferreting rabbits by the side of the turnpike road yonder and a carriage came tearing along and sir charles put out his head and cried to me' drake they are kidnapping me shoot' but they pulled him back out of sight oh my poor husband and did you let them oh couldn't catch 'em my lady so i did as i was bid got to my gun as quick as ever i could and gave the coachman both barrels hot what kill him lord no 'twas sixty yards off but made him holler and squeak a good un put thirty or forty shots into his back i know give me your hand mr drake i'll never forget that shot then she began to cry doant ye my lady doant ye said the honest fellow and was within an ace of blubbering for sympathy we ain't a lot o' babies to see our squire kidnaped if you would lend abel moss there and me a couple o' nags we'll catch them yet my lady that we will cried abel you take me where you fired that shot and we'll follow the fresh wheel tracks they can't beat us while they keep to a road the two men were soon mounted and in pursuit amid the cheers of the now excited villagers but still the perpetrators of the outrage had more than an hour's start and an hour was twelve miles and now lady bassett who had borne up so bravely was seized with a deadly faintness and supported into the house all this spread like wild fire and roused the villagers and they must have a hand in it parson had said mr bassett was to blame and that passed from one to another and so fermented that in the evening a crowd collected round highmore house and demanded mr bassett the servants were alarmed and said he was not at home then the men demanded boisterously what he had done with sir charles and threatened to break the windows unless they were told and as nobody in the house could tell them the women egged on the men and they did break the windows but they no sooner saw their own work than they were a little alarmed at it and retired talking very loud to support their waning courage and check their rising remorse at their deed they left a house full of holes and screams and poor little mrs bassett half dead with fright as for lady bassett she spent a horrible night of terror suspense and agony she could not lie down nor even sit still she walked incessantly wringing her hands and groaning for news mary wells did all she could to comfort her but it was a situation beyond the power of words to alleviate her intolerable suspense lasted till four o'clock in the morning and then in the still night horses' feet came clattering up to the door lady bassett went into the hall it was dimly lighted by a single lamp the great door was opened and in clattered moss and drake splashed and weary and downcast well cried lady bassett clasping her hands my lady said moss we tracked the carriage into the next county to a place thirty miles from here to a lodge and there they stopped us the place is well guarded with men and great big dogs we heerd 'em bark didn't us will ay said drake dejectedly the man as kept the lodge was short but civil says he 'this is a place nobody comes in but by law and nobody goes out but by law if the gentleman is here you may go home and sleep he is safe enough' a prison no a 'sylum my lady chapter xxi the lady put her hand to her heart and was silent a long time at last she said doggedly but faintly you will go with me to that place to morrow one of you i'll go my lady said moss will here had better not show his face they might take the law on him for that there shot drake hung his head and his ardor was evidently cooled by discovering that sir charles had been taken to a mad house lady bassett saw and sighed and said she would take moss to show her the way at eleven o'clock next morning a light carriage and pair came round to the hall gate and a large basket a portmanteau and a bag were placed on the roof under care of moss smaller packages were put inside and lady bassett and her maid got in both dressed in black they reached bellevue house at half past two the lodge gate was open to lady bassett's surprise and they drove through some pleasant grounds to a large white house the place at first sight had no distinctive character great ingenuity had been used to secure the inmates without seeming to incarcerate them there were no bars to the lower front windows and the side windows with their defenses were shrouded by shrubs the sentinels were out of sight or employed on some occupation or other but within call some patients were playing at cricket some ladies looking on others strolling on the gravel with a nurse dressed very much like themselves who did not obtrude her functions unnecessarily all was apparent indifference and argus eyed vigilance so much for the surface of course even at this moment some of the locked rooms had violent and miserable inmates the hall door opened as the carriage drew up a respectable servant came forward lady bassett handed him her card and said i am come to see my husband sir the man never moved a muscle but said you must wait if you please till i take your card in he soon returned and said dr suaby is not here but the gentleman in charge will see you lady bassett got out and beckoning mary wells followed the servant into a curious room half library half chemist's shop they called it the laboratory here she found a tall man leaning on a dirty mantelpiece who received her stiffly he had a pale mustache very thin lips and altogether a severe manner his head bald rather prematurely and whiskers abundant lady bassett looked him all over with one glance of her woman's eye and saw she had a hard and vain man to deal with are you the gentleman to whom this house belongs she faltered no madam i am in charge during dr suaby's absence that comes to the same thing sir i am come to see my dear husband have you an order an order sir i am his wife mr salter shrugged his shoulders a little and said i have no authority to let any visitor see a patient without an order from the person by whose authority he is placed here or else an order from the commissioners but that cannot apply to his wife to her who is one with him for better for worse in sickness or health it seems hard but i have no discretion in the matter the patient only came yesterday much excited he is better to day and an interview with you would excite him again oh no no no i can always soothe him i will be so mild so gentle you can be present and hear every word i say i will only kiss him and tell him who has done this and to be brave for his wife watches over him and sir i will beg him to be patient and not blame you nor any of the people here very proper very proper but really this interview must be postponed till you have an order or dr suaby returns he can violate his own rules if he likes but i cannot and indeed i dare not dare not let a lady see her husband then you are not a man oh can this be england it is too inhuman then she began to cry and wring her hands this is very painful said mr salter and left the room the respectable servant looked in soon after and lady bassett told him between her sobs that she had brought some clothes and things for her husband surely sir said she they will not refuse me that lord no ma'am said the man you can give them to the keeper and nurse in charge of him lady bassett slipped a guinea into the man's hand directly let me see those people said she the man winked and vanished he soon reappeared and said loudly now madam if you will order the things into the hall lady bassett came out and gave the order a short bull necked man and rather a pretty young woman with a flaunting cap bestirred themselves getting down the things and mr salter came out and looked on lady bassett called mary wells and gave her a five pound note to slip into the man's hand she telegraphed the girl who instantly came near her with an india rubber bath and affecting ignorance asked her what that was lady bassett dropped three sovereigns into the bath and said ten times twenty times that if you are kind to him tell him it is his cousin's doing but his wife watches over him all right said the girl come again when the doctor is here all this passed in swift whispers a few yards from mr salter and he now came forward and offered his arm to conduct lady bassett to the carriage but the wretched heart broken wife forgot her art of pleasing she shrank from him with a faint cry of aversion and got into her carriage unaided mary wells followed her mr salter was unwilling to receive this rebuff he followed and said the clothes shall be given with any message you may think fit to intrust to me lady bassett turned away sharply from him and said to mary wells tell him to drive home home i have none now its light is torn from me the carriage drove away as she uttered these piteous words she cried at intervals all the way home and could hardly drag herself upstairs to bed mr angelo called next day with bad news not a magistrate would move a finger against mr bassett he had the law on his side sir charles was evidently insane it was quite proper he should be put in security before he did some mischief to himself or lady bassett they say why was he hidden for two months if there was not something very wrong lady bassett ordered the carriage and paid several calls to counteract this fatal impression she found to her horror she might as well try to move a rock there was plenty of kindness and pity but the moment she began to assure them her husband was not insane she was met with the dead silence of polite incredulity one or two old friends went further and said my dear we are told he could not be taken away without two doctors' certificates now consider they must know better than you have patience and let them cure him lady bassett withdrew her friendship on the spot from two ladies for contradicting her on such a subject she returned home almost wild herself in the village her carriage was stopped by a woman with her hair all flying who told her in a lamentable voice that squire bassett had sent nine men to prison for taking sir charles's part and ill treating his captors my lawyer shall defend them at my expense said lady bassett with a sigh at last she got home and went up to her own room and there was mary wells waiting to dress her she tottered in and sank into a chair but after this temporary exhaustion came a rising tempest of passion her eyes roved her fingers worked and her heart seemed to come out of her in words of fire i have not a friend in all the county that villain has only to say 'mad' and all turn from me as if an angel of truth had said 'criminal' we have no friend but one and she is my servant now go and envy wealth and titles no wife in this parish is so poor as i powerless in the folds of a serpent i can't see my husband without an order from him he is all power i and mine all weakness she raised her clinched fists she clutched her beautiful hair as if she would tear it out by the roots i shall go mad i shall go mad no said she all of a sudden that will not do that is what he wants and then my darling would be defenseless i will not go mad then suddenly grinding her white teeth i'll teach him to drive a lady to despair i'll fight she descended almost without a break from the fury of a pythoness to a strange calm oh then it is her sex are dangerous don't look so pale said she and she actually smiled all is fair against so foul a villain you and i will defeat him dress me mary mary wells carried away by the unusual violence of a superior mind was quite bewildered lady bassett smiled a strange smile and said i'll show you how to dress me and she did give her a lesson that astonished her and now said lady bassett i shall dress you and she took a loose full dress out of her wardrobe and made mary wells put it on but first she inserted some stuffing so adroitly that mary seemed very buxom but what she wished to hide was hidden not so lady bassett herself her figure looked much rounder than in the last dress she wore with all this she was late for dinner and when she went down mr angelo had just finished telling mr oldfield of the mishap to the villagers lady bassett came in animated and beautiful dinner was announced directly and a commonplace conversation kept up till the servants were got rid of she then told mr oldfield how she had been refused admittance to sir charles at bellevue house a plain proof to her mind they knew her husband was not insane and begged him to act with energy and get sir charles out before his reason could be permanently injured by the outrage and the horror of his situation this led to a discussion in which mr angelo and lady bassett threw out various suggestions and mr oldfield cooled their ardor with sound objections he was familiar with the statutes de lunatico and said they had been strictly observed both in the capture of sir charles and in mr salter's refusal to let the wife see the husband in short he appeared either unable or unwilling to see anything except the strong legal position of the adverse party mr oldfield was one of those prudent lawyers who search for the adversary's strong points that their clients may not be taken by surprise and that is very wise of them but wise things require to be done wisely he sometimes carried this system so far as to discourage his client too much it is a fine thing to make your client think his case the weaker of the two and then win it for him easily that gratifies your own foible professional vanity but suppose with your discouraging him so he flings up or compromises a winning case suppose he takes the huff and goes to some other lawyer who will warm him with hopes instead of cooling him with a one sided and hostile view of his case in the present discussion mr oldfield's habit of beginning by admiring his adversaries together with his knowledge of law and little else and his secret conviction that sir charles was unsound of mind combined to paralyze him and not being a man of invention he could not see his way out of the wood at all he could negative mr angelo's suggestions and give good reasons but he could not or did not suggest anything better to be done lady bassett listened to his negative wisdom with a bitter smile and said at last with a sigh it seems then we are to sit quiet and do nothing while mr bassett and his solicitor strike blow upon blow there i'll fight my own battle and do you try and find some way of defending the poor souls that are in trouble because they did not sit with their hands before them when their benefactor was outraged command my purse if money will save them from prison then she rose with dignity and walked like a camelopard all down the room on the side opposite to mr oldfield angelo flew to open the door and in a whisper begged a word with her in private she bowed ascent and passed on from the room what a fine creature said mr oldfield how she walks mr angelo made no reply to this but asked him what was to be done for the poor men they will be up before the bench to morrow stung a little by lady bassett's remark mr oldfield answered promptly we must get some tradesmen to bail them with our money it will only be a few pounds apiece if the bail is accepted they shall offer pecuniary compensation and get up a defense find somebody to swear sir charles was sane that sort of evidence is always to be got counsel must do the rest simple natives benefactor outraged honest impulse regretted the moment they understood the capture had been legally made then throw dirt on the plaintiff he is malicious and can be proved to have forsworn himself in bassett v bassett a tap at the door and mary wells put in her head if you please sir my lady is tired and she wishes to say a word to you before she goes upstairs excuse me one minute said mr angelo and followed mary wells she ushered him into a boudoir where he found lady bassett seated in an armchair with her head on her hand and her eyes fixed sadly on the carpet she smiled faintly and said well what do you wish to say to me it is about mr oldfield he is clearly incompetent i don't know i snubbed him poor man but if the law is all against us how does he know that he assumes it because he is prejudiced in favor of the enemy how does he know they have done everything the act of parliament requires and if they have law is not invincible when law defies morality it gets baffled and trampled on in all civilized communities i never heard that before but you would if you had been at oxford said he smiling ah what we want is a man of genius of invention a man who will see every chance take every chance lawful or unlawful and fight with all manner of weapons lady bassett's eye flashed a moment ah said she but where can i find such a man with knowledge to guide his zeal i think i know of a man who could at all events advise you if you would ask him ah who he is a writer and opinions vary as to his merit some say he has talent others say it is all eccentricity and affectation one thing is certain his books bring about the changes he demands and then he is in earnest he has taken a good many alleged lunatics out of confinement is it possible then let us apply to him at once he lives in london but i have a friend who knows him may i send an outline to him through that friend and ask him whether he can advise you in the matter you may and thank you a thousand times a mind like that with knowledge zeal and invention must surely throw some light one would think so dear friend i'll write to night and send a letter to greatrex we shall perhaps get an answer the day after to morrow ah you are not the one to go to sleep in the service of a friend a writer did you say what does he write fiction what novels and dramas and all lady bassett sighed incredulously i should never think of going to fiction for wisdom when the family calas were about to be executed unjustly with the consent of all the lawyers and statesmen in france one man in a nation saw the error and fought for the innocent and saved them and that one wise man in a nation of fools was a writer of fiction oh a learned oxonian can always answer a poor ignorant thing like me one swallow does not make summer for all that but this writer's fictions are not like the novels you read they are works of laborious research besides he is a lawyer as well as a novelist oh if he is a lawyer then i may write yes said lady bassett despondingly what is to become of oldfield send him to the drawing room i will go down and endure him for another hour you can write your letter here and then please come and relieve me of mr negative she rang and ordered coffee and tea into the drawing room and mr oldfield found her very cold company in half an hour mr angelo came down looking flushed and very handsome and lady bassett had some fresh tea made for him this done she bade the gentlemen goodnight and went to her room here she found mary wells full of curiosity to know whether the lawyer would get sir charles out of the asylum lady bassett gave loose to her indignation and said nothing was to be expected from such a nullity mary he could not see i gave him every opportunity i walked slowly down the room before him after dinner and i came into the drawing room and moved about and yet he could not see then you will have to tell him that is all never no more shall you i'll not trust my fate and sir charles's to a man that has no eyes for this feminine reason she took a spite against poor oldfield but to mr angelo she suppressed the real reason and entered into that ardent gentleman's grounds of discontent though these alone would not have entirely dissolved her respect for the family solicitor next afternoon angelo came to her in great distress and ire beaten beaten and all through our adversaries having more talent mr bassett did not appear at first wheeler excused him on the ground that his wife was seriously ill through the fright bassett's servants were called and swore to the damage and to the men all but one he got off then oldfield made a dry speech and a tradesman he had prepared offered bail the magistrates were consulting when in burst mr bassett all in black and made a speech fifty times stronger than oldfield's and sobbed and told them the rioters had frightened his wife so she had been prematurely confined and the child was dead could they take bail for a riot a dastardly attack by a mob of cowards on a poor defenseless woman the gentlest and most inoffensive creature in england then he went on 'they were told i was not in the house and then they found courage to fling stones to terrify my wife and kill my child poor soul' he said 'she lies between life and death herself and i come here in an agony of fear but i come for justice the man of straw who offers bail is furnished with the money by those who stimulated the outrage defeat that fraud and teach these cowards who war on defenseless ladies that there is humanity and justice and law in the land' then oldfield tried to answer him with his hems and his haws but bassett turned on him like a giant and swept him away poor woman ah that is true i am afraid i have thought too little of her but you suffer and so must she it is the most terrible feud one would think this was corsica instead of england only the fighting is not done with daggers but after this pray lean no more on that oldfield we were all carried away at first but now i think of it bassett must have been in the court and held back to make the climax oh yes it was another surprise and another success they are all sent to jail superior generalship if wheeler had been our man we should have had eight wives crying for pity each with one child in her arms and another holding on to her apron do pray lady bassett dismiss that nullity oh i cannot do that he is sir charles's lawyer but i have promised you to seek advice elsewhere and so i will the conversation was interrupted by the tolling of the church bell the first note startled lady bassett and she turned pale i must leave you said angelo regretfully i have to bury mr bassett's little boy he lived an hour lady bassett sat and heard the bell toll strange sad thoughts passed through her mind is it saddest when it tolls or when it rings that bell he has killed his own child by robbing me of my husband we are in the hands of god after all let wheeler be ever so cunning and oldfield ever so simple and i am not acting by that where is my trust in god's justice oh thou of little faith what shall i do love is stronger in me than faith stronger than anything in heaven or earth god forgive me god help me i will go back but oh to stand still and be good and simple and to see my husband trampled on by a cunning villain why is there a future state where everything is to be different no hate no injustice all love why is it not all of a piece why begin wrong if it is to end all right if i was omnipotent it should be right from the first oh thou of little faith ah me it is hard to see fools and devils and realize angels unseen oh that i could shut my eyes in faith and go to sleep and drift on the right path for i shall never take it with my eyes open and my heart bleeding for him then her head fell languidly back her eyes closed and the tears welled through them they knew the way by this time chapter xxii next morning in came mr angelo with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes i have got a letter a most gratifying one my friend called on mr rolfe and gave him my lines and he replies direct to me may i read you his letter oh yes 'dear sir the case you have sent me of a gentleman confined on certificates by order of an interested relative as you presume for you have not seen the order and on grounds you think insufficient is interesting and some of it looks true but there are gaps in the statement and i dare not advise in so nice a matter till these are filled but that i suspect can only be done by the lady herself she had better call on me in person it may be worth her while at home every day this week as for yourself you need not address me through greatrex i have seen you pull no and afterward stroke in the university boat and you dived in portsmouth harbor and saved a sailor see ryde journal aug p col cited in my day book aug and also in my index hominum in voce angelo ha ha here's a fellow for detail yours very truly 'rolfe' and did you did i what dive and save a sailor no i nailed him just as he was sinking how good and brave you are angelo blushed like a girl it makes me too happy to hear such words from you but i vote we don't talk about me will you call on mr rolfe is he married angelo opened his eyes at the question i think not said he indeed i know he is not could you get him down here angelo shook his head if he knew you perhaps but can you expect him to come here upon your business these popular writers are spoiled by the ladies i doubt if he would walk across the street to advise a stranger candidly why should he no and it was ridiculous vanity to suppose he would but i never called on a gentleman in my life take me with you you can go up at nine and be back to a late dinner i shall never have the courage to go let me have his letter he gave her the letter and she took it away at six o'clock she sent mary wells to mr angelo with a note to say she had studied mr rolfe's letter and there was more in it than she had thought but his going off from her husband to boat racing seemed trivial and she could not make up her mind to go to london to consult a novelist on such a serious matter at nine she sent to say she should go but could not think of dragging him there she should take her maid before eleven she half repented this resolution but her maid kept her to it and at half past twelve next day they reached mr rolfe's door an old fashioned mean looking house in one of the briskest thoroughfares of the metropolis a cabstand opposite to the door and a tide of omnibuses passing it lady bassett viewed the place discontentedly and said to herself what a poky little place for a writer to live in how noisy how unpoetical they knocked at the door it was opened by a maid servant is mr rolfe at home yes ma'am please give me your card and write the business lady bassett took out her card and wrote a line or two on the back of it the maid glanced at it and showed her into a room while she took the card to her master the room was rather long low and nondescript scarlet flock paper curtains and sofas green utrecht velvet woodwork and pillars white and gold two windows looking on the street at the other end folding doors with scarcely any wood work all plate glass but partly hidden by heavy curtains of the same color and material as the others accustomed to large lofty rooms lady bassett felt herself in a long box here but the colors pleased her she said to mary wells what a funny cozy little place for a gentleman to live in mr rolfe was engaged with some one and she was kept waiting this was quite new to her and discouraged her already intimidated by the novelty of the situation she tried to encourage herself by saying it was for her husband she did this unusual thing but she felt very miserable and inclined to cry at last a bell rang the maid came in and invited lady bassett to follow her she opened the glass folding doors and took them into a small conservatory walled like a grotto with ferns sprouting out of rocky fissures and spars sparkling water dripping then she opened two more glass folding doors and ushered them into an empty room the like of which lady bassett had never seen it was large in itself and multiplied tenfold by great mirrors from floor to ceiling with no frames but a narrow oak beading opposite her on entering was a bay window all plate glass the central panes of which opened like doors upon a pretty little garden that glowed with color and was backed by fine trees belonging to the nation for this garden ran up to the wall of hyde park the numerous and large mirrors all down to the ground laid hold of the garden and the flowers and by double and treble reflection filled the room with delightful nooks of verdure and color to confuse the eye still more a quantity of young india rubber trees with glossy leaves were placed before the large central mirror the carpet was a warm velvet pile the walls were distempered a french gray not cold but with a tint of mauve that gave a warm and cheering bloom this soothing color gave great effect to the one or two masterpieces of painting that hung on the walls and to the gilt frames the furniture oak and marqueterie highly polished the curtains scarlet merino through which the sun shone and being a london sun diffused a mild rosy tint favorable to female faces not a sound of london could be heard so far the room was romantic but there was a prosaic corner to shock those who fancy that fiction is the spontaneous overflow of a poetic fountain fed by nature only between the fireplace and the window and within a foot or two of the wall stood a gigantic writing table with the signs of hard labor on it and of severe system three plated buckets each containing three pints full of letters to be answered other letters to be pasted into a classified guard book loose notes to be pasted into various books and classified for this writer used to sneer at the learned men who say i will look among my papers for it he held that every written scrap ought either to be burned or pasted into a classified guard book where it could be found by consulting the index five things like bankers' bill books into whose several compartments ms notes and newspaper cuttings were thrown as a preliminary toward classification in books underneath the table was a formidable array of note books standing upright and labeled on their backs there were about twenty large folios of classified facts ideas and pictures for the very wood cuts were all indexed and classified on the plan of a tradesman's ledger there was also the receipt book of the year treated on the same plan receipts on a file would not do for this romantic creature if a tradesman brought a bill he must be able to turn to that tradesman's name in a book and prove in a moment whether it had been paid or not then there was a collection of solid quartos and of smaller folio guard books called indexes there was index rerum et journalium index rerum et librorum index rerum et hominum and a lot more indeed so many that by way of climax there was a fat folio ledger entitled index ad indices by the side of the table were six or seven thick pasteboard cards each about the size of a large portfolio and on these the author's notes and extracts were collected from all his repertories into something like a focus for a present purpose he was writing a novel based on facts facts incidents living dialogue pictures reflections situations were all on these cards to choose from and arranged in headed columns and some portions of the work he was writing on this basis of imagination and drudgery lay on the table in two forms his own writing and his secretary's copy thereof the latter corrected for the press this copy was half margin and so provided for additions and improvements but for one addition there were ten excisions great and small lady bassett had just time to take in the beauty and artistic character of the place and to realize the appalling drudgery that stamped it a workshop when the author who had dashed into his garden for a moment's recreation came to the window and furnished contrast no for he looked neither like a poet nor a drudge but a great fat country farmer he was rather tall very portly smallish head commonplace features mild brown eye not very bright short beard and wore a suit of tweed all one color such looked the writer of romances founded on fact he rolled up to the window for if he looked like a farmer he walked like a sailor and stepped into the room chapter xxiii mr rolfe surveyed the two women with a mild inoffensive ox like gaze and invited them to be seated with homely civility he sat down at his desk and turning to lady bassett said rather dreamily one moment please let me look at the case and my notes first his homely appearance and now a certain languor about his manner discouraged lady bassett more than it need for all artists must pay for their excitements with occasional languor her hands trembled and she began to gulp and try not to cry mr rolfe observed directly and said rather kindly you are agitated and no wonder he then opened a sort of china closet poured a few drops of a colorless liquid from a tiny bottle into a wine glass and filled the glass with water from a filter drink that if you please she looked at him with her eyes brimming must i yes it will do you good for once in a way it is only ignatia she drank it by degrees and a tear along with it that fell into the glass meantime mr rolfe had returned to his notes and examined them he then addressed her half stiffly half kindly lady bassett whatever may be your husband's condition whether his illness is mental or bodily or a mixture of the two his clandestine examination by bought physicians and his violent capture the natural effect of which must have been to excite him and retard his cure were wicked and barbarous acts contrary to god's law and the common law of england and indeed to all human law except our shallow incautious statutes de lunatico they were an insult to yourself who ought at least to have been consulted for your rights are higher and purer than richard bassett's therefore as a wife bereaved of your husband by fraud and violence and the bare letter of a paltry statute whose spirit has been violated you are quite justified in coming to me or to any public man you think can help your husband and you then with a certain bonhomie so lay aside your nervousness let us go into this matter sensibly like a big man and a little man or like an old woman and a young woman whichever you prefer lady bassett looked at him and smiled assent she felt a great deal more at her ease after this opening i dare not advise you yet i must know more than mr angelo has told me will you answer my questions frankly i will try sir whose idea was it confining sir charles bassett to the house so much his own he felt himself unfit for society did he describe his ailment to you then yes all the better what did he say he said that at times a cloud seemed to come into his head and then he lost all power of mind and he could not bear to be seen in that condition this was after the epileptic seizure yes sir humph now will you tell me how mr bassett by mere words could so enrage sir charles as to give him a fit lady bassett hesitated what did he say to sir charles he did not speak to him his child and nurse were there and he called out loud for sir charles to hear and told the nurse to hold up his child to look at his inheritance malicious fool but did this enrage sir charles so much as to give him a fit yes he must be very sensitive on that subject mr rolfe was silent and now for the first time appeared to think intently his study bore fruit apparently for he turned to lady bassett and said suddenly what is the strangest thing sir charles has said of late the very strangest lady bassett turned red and then pale and made no reply mr rolfe rose and walked up to mary wells what is the maddest thing your master has ever said mary wells instead of replying looked at her mistress the writer instantly put his great body between them come none of that said he i don't want a falsehood i want the truth la sir i don't know my master he is not mad i'm sure the queerest thing he ever said was he did say at one time 'twas writ on his face as he had no children ah and that is why he would not go abroad perhaps that was one reason sir i do suppose mr rolfe put his hands behind his back and walked thoughtfully and rather disconsolately back to his seat humph said he then after a pause well well i know the worst now that is one comfort lady bassett you really must be candid with me consider good advice is like a tight glove it fits the circumstances and it does not fit other circumstances no man advises so badly on a false and partial statement as i do for the very reason that my advice is a close fit even now i can't understand sir charles's despair of having children of his own the writer then turned his looks on the two women with an entire absence of expression the sense of his eyes was turned inward though the orbs were directed toward his visitors with this lack luster gaze and in the tone of thoughtful soliloquy he said has sir charles bassett no eyes and are there women so furtive so secret or so bashful they do not tell their husbands lady bassett turned with a scared look to mary wells and that young woman showed her usual readiness she actually came to mr rolfe and half whispered to him if you please sir gentlemen are blind and my lady she is very bashful but sir charles knows it now he have known it a good while and it was a great comfort to him he was getting better sir when the villains took him ever so much better this solution silenced mr rolfe though it did not quite satisfy him he fastened on mary wells's last statement now tell me between the day when those two doctors got into his apartment and the day of his capture how long about a fortnight and in that particular fortnight was there a marked improvement la yes sir was there not my lady indeed there was sir he was beginning to take walks with me in the garden and rides in an open carriage he was getting better every day and oh sir that is what breaks my heart i was curing my darling so fast and now they will do all they can to destroy him their not letting his wife see him terrifies me i think i can explain that now tell me what time do you expect a certain event lady bassett blushed and cast a hasty glance at the speaker but he had a piece of paper before him and was preparing to take down her reply with the innocent face of a man who had asked a simple and necessary question in the way of business then lady bassett looked at mary wells and this look mr rolfe surprised because he himself looked up to see why the lady hesitated after an expressive glance between the mistress and maid the lady said almost inaudibly more than three months and then she blushed all over mr rolfe looked at the two women a moment and seemed a little puzzled at their telegraphing each other on such a subject but he coolly noted down lady bassett's reply on a card about the size of a foolscap sheet and then set himself to write on the same card the other facts he had elicited while he was doing this very slowly with great care and pains the lady was eying him like a zoologist studying some new animal the simplicity and straightforwardness of his last question won by degrees upon her judgment and reconciled her to her inquisitor the more so as he was quiet but intense and his whole soul in her case she began to respect his simple straightforwardness his civility without a grain of gallantry and his caution in eliciting all the facts before he would advise after he had written down his synopsis looking all the time as if his life depended on its correctness he leaned back and his ordinary but mobile countenance was transfigured into geniality come said he grandmamma has pestered you with questions enough now you retort ask me anything speak your mind these things should be attacked in every form and sifted with every sieve lady bassett hesitated a moment but at last responded to this invitation sir one thing that discourages me cruelly my solicitor seems so inferior to mr bassett's he can think of nothing but objections and so he does nothing and lets us be trampled on it is his being unable to cope with mr bassett's solicitor mr wheeler that has led me in my deep distress to trouble you whom i had not the honor of knowing i understand your ladyship perfectly mr oldfield is a respectable solicitor and wheeler is a sharp country practitioner and to use my favorite americanism you feel like fighting with a blunt knife against a sharp one that is my feeling sir and it drives me almost wild sometimes for your comfort then in my earlier litigations i have had sixteen lawsuits for myself and other oppressed people i had often that very impression but the result always corrected it legal battles are like other battles first you have a skirmish or two and then a great battle in court now sharp attorneys are very apt to win the skirmish and lose the battle i see a general of this stamp in mr wheeler and you need not fear him much of course an antagonist is never to be despised but i would rather have wheeler against you than oldfield an honest man like oldfield blunders into wisdom the lord knows how your wheelers seldom get beyond cunning and cunning does not see far enough to cope with men of real sagacity and forethought in matters so complicated as this oldfield acting for bassett would have pushed rapidly on to an examination by the court you would have evaded it and put yourself in the wrong and the inquiry well urged might have been adverse to sir charles wheeler has taken a more cunning and violent course it strikes more terror does more immediate harm but what does it lead to very little and it disarms them of their sharpest weapon the immediate inquiry for we could now delay and greatly prejudice an inquiry on the very ground of the outrage and unnecessary violence and could demand time to get the patient as well as he was before the outrage and indeed the court is very jealous of those who begin by going to a judge and then alter their minds and try to dispose of the case themselves and to make matters worse here they do it by straining an act of parliament opposed to equity i wish it may prove so sir but meantime mr wheeler is active mr oldfield is passive he has not an idea he is a mere negative ah that is because he is out of his groove a smattering of law is not enough here it wants a smattering of human nature too then sir would you advise me to part with mr oldfield no why make an enemy besides he is the vehicle of communication with the other side you must simply ignore him for a time but is there nothing i can do sir for it is this cruel inactivity that kills me pray advise me you know all now mr rolfe thus challenged begged for a moment's delay let us be silent a minute said he and think hard and to judge by his face he did think with great intensity lady bassett said he very gravely i assume that every fact you and mr angelo have laid before me is true and no vital part is kept back well then your present course is delay not the weak delay of those who procrastinate what cannot be avoided but the wise delay of a general who can bring up overpowering forces only give him time understand me there is more than one game on the cards but i prefer the surest we could begin fighting openly to morrow but that would be risking too much for too little the law's delay the insolence of office the up hill and thorny way would hurt sir charles's mind at present the apathy the cruelty the trickery the routine the hot and cold fits of hope and fear would poison your blood and perhaps lose sir charles the heir he pines for besides if we give battle to day we fight the heir at law but in three or four months we may have him on our side and trustees appointed by you by that time too sir charles will have got over that abominable capture and be better than he was a week ago constantly soothed and consoled as he will be by the hope of offspring when the right time comes that moment we strike and with a sledge hammer no letters to the commissioners then no petitioning chancery to send a jury into the asylum stronghold of prejudice i will cut your husband in two don't be alarmed i will merely give him with your help an alter ego who shall effect his liberation and ruin richard bassett ruin him in damages and costs and drive him out of the country perhaps meantime you are not to be a lay figure or a mere negative oh sir i am so glad of that far from that you will act defensively mr bassett has one chance you must be the person to extinguish it injudicious treatment in the asylum might retard sir charles's cure their leeches and their sedatives administered by sucking apothecaries who reason it a priori instead of watching the effect of these things on the patient might seriously injure your husband for his disorder is connected with a weak circulation of blood in the vessels of the brain we must therefore guard against that at once to work then who keeps this famous asylum dr suaby suaby i know that name he has been here i think i must look in my index rerum et hominum suaby not down try asyla asyla 'suaby see letter book for the year p ' an old letter book i must go elsewhere for that he went out and after some time returned with a folio letter book here are two letters to me from dr suaby detailing his system and inviting me to spend a week at his asylum come come sir charles is with a man who does not fear inspection for at this date i was bitter against private asylums rather indiscriminately so i fear stay he visited me i thought so here's a description of him 'a pale thoughtful man with a remarkably mild eye is against restraint of lunatics and against all punishment of them quixotically so being cross examined declares that if a patient gave him a black eye he would not let a keeper handle him roughly being irresponsible' no more would i if i could give him a good licking myself please study these two letters closely you may get a clew how to deal with the amiable writer in person oh thank you mr rolfe said lady bassett flushing all over she was so transported at having something to do she quietly devoured the letters and after she had read them said a load of fears was now taken off her mind mr rolfe shook his head you must not rely on dr suaby too much in a prison or an asylum each functionary is important in exact proportion to his nominal insignificance and why because the greater his nominal unimportance the more he comes in actual contact with the patient the theoretical scale runs thus st the presiding physician d the medical subordinates d the keepers and nurses the practical scale runs thus st the keepers and nurses d the medical attendants d the presiding physician i am glad to hear you say so sir for when i went to the asylum and the medical attendant mr salter would not let me see my husband i gave his keeper and the nurse a little money to be kind to him in his confinement you did yet you come here for advice this is the way a man discourses and argues and by profound reasoning that is by what he thinks profound and it isn't arrives at the right thing and lo a woman with her understanding heart and her hard good sense goes and does that wise thing humbly without a word sursum corda cheer up loving heart shouted he like the roar of a lion in ecstasies you have done a masterstroke without oldfield or rolfe or any other man lady bassett clasped her hands with joy and some electric fire seemed to run through her veins for she was all sensibilities and this sudden triumphant roaring out of strong words was quite new to her and carried her away well said this eccentric personage cooling quite as suddenly as he had fired the only improvement i can suggest is be a little more precise at your next visit promise his keepers twenty guineas apiece the day sir charles is cured and promise them ten guineas apiece not to administer one drop of medicine for the next two months and of course no leech nor blister the cursed sedatives they believe in are destruction to sir charles bassett his circulation must not be made too slow one day and too fast the next which is the effect of a sedative but made regular by exercise and nourishing food so then you will square the keepers by their cupidity the doctor is on the right side per se shall we rely on these two and ignore the medical attendants no why throw a chance away what is the key to these medical attendants hum try flunkyism i have great faith in british flunkyism pay your next visit with four horses two outriders and blazing liveries don't dress in perfect taste like that go in finer clothes than you ever wore in the morning or ought to wear except at a wedding go not as a petitioner but as a queen and dazzle snobs the which being dazzled then tickle their vanity don't speak of sir charles as an injured man nor as a man unsound in mind but a gentleman who is rather ill 'but now gentlemen i feel your remarkable skill will soon set him right' your husband runs that one risk make him safe a few smiles and a little flattery will do it and if not why fight with all a woman's weapons don't be too nice we must all hold a candle to the devil once in our lives a wife's love sanctifies a woman's arts in fighting with a villain and disarming donkeys oh i wish i was there now you are excited madam said he severely that is out of place in a deliberative assembly no no only i want to be there doing all this for my dear husband you are very excited and it is my fault you must be hungry too you have come a journey there will be a reaction and then you will be hysterical your temperament is of that kind he rang a bell and ordered his maid servant to bring some beef wafers and a pint of dry champagne lady bassett remonstrated but he told her to be quiet for said he i have a smattering of medicine as well as of law and of human nature sir charles must correspond with you probably he has already written you six letters complaining of this monstrous act a sane man incarcerated well that class of letter goes into a letter box in the hall of an asylum but it never reaches its address please take a pen and write a formula he dictated as follows my dear love the trifling illness i had when i came here is beginning to give way to the skill and attention of the medical gentlemen here they are all most kind and attentive the place as it is conducted is a credit to the country lady bassett's eyes sparkled oh mr rolfe is not this rather artful and is it not artful to put up a letter box encourage the writing of letters and then open them and suppress whatever is disagreeable may every man who opens another man's letter find that letter a trap here comes your medicine you never drink champagne in the middle of the day of course oh no then it will be all the better medicine he made both mistress and maid eat the thin slices of beef and drink a glass of champagne while they were thus fortifying themselves he wrote his address on some stamped envelopes and gave them to lady bassett and told her she had better write to him at once if anything occurred you must also write to me if you really cannot get to see your husband then i will come down myself with the public press at my back but i am sure that will not be necessary in dr suaby's asylum he is a better christian than i am confound him for it you went too soon your husband had been agitated by the capture suaby was away salter had probably applied what he imagined to be soothing remedies leeches a blister morphia result the patient was so much worse than he was before they touched him that salter was ashamed to let you see him having really excited him instead of soothing him sawbones salter had to pretend that you would excite him as if creation contained any mineral drug simple leech spanish fly gadfly or showerbath so soothing as a loving wife is to a man in affliction new reading of an old song 'if the heart of a man is oppressed with cares it makes him much worse when a woman appears' go to morrow you will see him he will be worse than he was but not much somebody will have told him that his wife put him in there oh oh and he won't have believed it his father was a bassett his mother a le compton his great great great grandmother was a rolfe there is no cur's blood in him after the first shock he will have found the spirit and dignity of a gentleman to sustain adversity these men of fashion are like that they are better steel than women and writers when he had said this he indicated by his manner that he thought he had exhausted the subject and himself lady bassett rose and said then sir i will take my leave and oh i am sorry i have not your eloquent pen or your eloquent tongue to thank you you have interested yourself in a stranger you have brought the power of a great mind to bear on our distress i came here a widow now i feel a wife again your good words have warmed my very heart i can only pray god to bless you sir pray say no more madam said mr rolfe hastily a gentleman cannot be always writing lies an hour or two given to truth and justice is a wholesome diversion at all events don't thank me till my advice has proved worth it he rang the bell the servant came and showed the way to the street door mr rolfe followed them to the passage only whence he bowed ceremoniously once more to lady bassett as she went out as she passed into the street she heard a fearful clatter it was her counselor tearing back to his interrupted novel like a distracted bullock well i don't think much of he said mary wells lady bassett was mute to that and all the journey home very absorbed and taciturn impregnated with ideas she could not have invented but was more able to execute than the inventor she was absorbed in digesting rolfe's every word and fixing his map in her mind and filling in details to his outline so small talk stung her she gave her companion very short answers especially when she disparaged mr rolfe you couldn't get in a word edgeways said mary wells i went to hear wisdom and not to chatter he doesn't think small beer of hisself anyhow how can he and see other men well i don't think much of him for my part i dare say the queen of sheba's lady's maid thought solomon a silly thing i don't know that was afore my time rather pertly of course it was or you couldn't imitate her on reaching home she ordered a light dinner upstairs and sent directions to the coachman and grooms at nine next morning the four in hand came round and they started for the asylum coachman and two more in brave liveries two outriders twenty miles from huntercombe they changed the wheelers two fresh horses having been sent on at night they drove in at the lodge gate of bellevue house which was left ostentatiously open and soon drew up at the hall door and set many a pale face peeping from the upper windows the door opened the respectable servant came out with a respectful air is mr salter at home sir no madam mr coyne is in charge to day lady bassett was glad to hear that and asked if she might be allowed to see mr coyne certainly madam i'll tell him at once was the reply determined to enter the place lady bassett requested her people to open the carriage door and she was in the act of getting out when mr coyne appeared a little oily bustling man with a good humored vulgar face liable to a subservient pucker he wore it directly at sight of a fine woman fine clothes fine footmen and fine horses mr coyne i believe said lady bassett with a fascinating smile at your service madam may i have a word in private with you sir certainly madam we have come a long way may the horses be fed i am afraid said the little man apologetically i must ask you to send them to the inn it is close by by all means to one of the outriders you will wait here for orders mary wells had been already instructed to wait in the hall and look out sharp for sir charles's keeper and nurse and tell them her ladyship wanted to speak to them privately and it would be money in their way lady bassett closeted with mr coyne began first to congratulate herself mr bassett said she is no friend of mine but he has done me a kindness in sending sir charles here when he might have sent him to some place where he might have been made worse instead of better here i conclude gentlemen of your ability will soon cure his trifling disorder will you not i have good hopes your ladyship he is better to day now i dare say you could tell me to a month when he will be cured oh your ladyship exaggerates my skill too much three months that is a short time to give us but your ladyship may rely on it we will do our best will you then i have no fear of the result oh by the by dr willis wanted me to take a message to you mr coyne he knows you by reputation indeed really i was not aware that my humble then you are better known than you in your modesty supposed let me see what was the message oh it was a peculiarity in sir charles he wished you to know dr willis has attended him from a boy and he wished me to tell you that morphia and other sedatives have some very bad effects on him i told dr willis you would probably find that and every thing else out without a hint from him or any one else yes but i will make a note of it for all that that is very kind of you it will flatter the doctor the more so as he has so high an opinion of you but now mr coyne i suppose if i am very good and promise to soothe him and not excite him i may see my husband to day certainly madam you have an order from the person who i forgot to bring it with me i relied on your humanity that is unfortunate i am afraid i must not he hesitated looked very uncomfortable and said he would consult mr appleton then suddenly puckering his face into obsequiousness would your ladyship like to inspect some of our arrangements for the comfort of our patients lady bassett would have declined the proposal but for the singular play of countenance she was herself all eye and mind so she said gravely i shall be very happy sir mr coyne then led the way and showed her a large sitting room where some ladies were seated at different occupations and amusements they kept more apart from each other than ladies do in general but this was the only sign a far more experienced observer than lady bassett could have discovered the nurses having sprung from authoritative into unobtrusive positions at the sound of mr coyne's footstep outside what said lady bassett are all these ladies she hesitated every one said mr coyne and some incurably oh please let us retire i have no right to gratify my curiosity poor things they don't seem unhappy unhappy said mr coyne we don't allow unhappiness here our doctor is too fond of them he is always contriving something to please them at this moment lady bassett looked up and saw a woman watching her over the rail of a corridor on the first floor she recognized the face directly the woman made her a rapid signal and then disappeared into one of the rooms would there be any objection to our going upstairs mr coyne said lady bassett with a calm voice and a heart thumping violently oh none whatever i'll conduct you but then i am afraid i must leave you for a time he showed her upstairs blew a whistle handed her over to an attendant and bowed and smiled himself away grotesquely jones was the very keeper she had feed last visit she flushed with joy at sight of bull necked burly jones oh mr jones said she putting her hands together with a look that might have melted a hangman jones winked and watched mr coyne out of sight i have seen your ladyship's maid said jones confidentially it is all right mr coyne have got the blinkers on only pass me your word not to excite him oh no sir i will soothe him and she trembled all over sally cried jones the nurse came out of a room and held the door ajar she whispered i have prepared him madam he is all right lady bassett by a great effort kept her feet from rushing her heart from crying out with joy and she entered the room sally closed the door like a shot with a delicacy one would hardly have given her credit for to judge from appearances sir charles stood in the middle of the room beaming to receive her but restraining himself they met he held her to his heart she wept for joy and grief upon his neck neither spoke for a long time chapter xxiv they were seated hand in hand comparing notes and comforting each other then lady bassett met with a great surprise forgetting or rather not realizing sir charles's sex and character she began with a heavy heart to play the consoler but after he had embraced her many times with tender rapture and thanked god for the sight of her lo and behold this doughty baronet claimed his rights of manhood and in spite of his capture his incarceration and his malady set to work to console her instead of lying down to be consoled my darling bella said he don't you make a mountain of a mole hill the moment you told me i should be a father i began to get better and to laugh at richard bassett's malice of course i was terribly knocked over at first by being captured like a felon and clapped under lock and key but i am getting over that my head gets muddled once a day that is all they gave me some poison the first day that made me drunk twelve hours after but they have not repeated it oh cried lady bassett then don't let me lose a moment how could i forget she opened the door and called in mr jones and the nurse mr jones said she the first day my husband came here mr salter gave him a sedative or something and it made him much worse it always do make 'em worse said jones bluntly then why did he give it out o' book ma'am his sort don't see how the medicines work but we do as are always about the patient mr jones said lady bassett if mr salter or anybody prescribes it is you who administer the medicine jones assented with a wink winking was his foible as puckering of the face was coyne's should you be offended if i were to offer you and the nurse ten guineas a month to pretend you had given him mr salter's medicines and not do it oh that is not much to do for a gentleman like sir charles said jones but i didn't ought to take so much money for that to be sure i suppose the lady won't miss it don't be a donkey jones said sir charles cutting short his hypocrisy take whatever you can get only earn it oh what i takes i earns of course said sir charles so that is settled you have got to physic those flower pots instead of me that is all this view of things tickled jones so that he roared with laughter however he recollected himself all of a sudden and stopped with ludicrous abruptness he said to lady bassett with homely kindness you go home comfortable my lady you have taken the stick by the right end he then had the good sense to retire from the room then lady bassett told sir charles of her visit to london and her calling on mr rolfe he looked blank at his wife calling on a bachelor but her description of the man his age and his simplicity reconciled him to that and when she told him the plan and order of campaign mr rolfe had given her he approved it very earnestly he fastened in particular on something that mr rolfe had dwelt lightly on dear as the sight of you is to me sweet as the sound of your loved voice is to my ears and my heart i would rather not see you again until our hopes are realized than jeopardize that lady bassett sighed for this seemed rather morbid sir charles went on so think of your own health first and avoid agitations i am tormented with fear lest that monster should take advantage of my absence to molest you if he does leave huntercombe yes leave it go to london go even for my sake my health and happiness depend on you they cannot be much affected by anything that happens here 'stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage' lady bassett promised but said she could not keep away from him and he must often write to her she gave him rolfe's formula and told him all letters would pass that praised the asylum sir charles made a wry face lady bassett's wrist went round his neck in a moment oh charles dear for my sake hold a little little candle to the devil mr rolfe says we must oblige me in this i am not so noble as you and then i'll be very good and obedient in what your heart is set upon at last sir charles consented then they made haste and told each other everything that had happened and it was late in the afternoon before they parted lady bassett controlled her tears at parting as well as she could mr coyne had slyly hid himself but emerged when she came down to the carriage and she shook him warmly by the hand and he bowed at the door incessantly with his face all in a pucker till the cavalcade dashed away chapter xxv lady bassett timed her next visit so that she found dr suaby at home he received her kindly and showed himself a master told her sir charles's was a mixed case in which the fall the fit and a morbid desire for offspring had all played their parts he hoped a speedy cure but said he counted on her assistance there was no doubt what he meant oh for one thing he said to her rather slyly coyne tells me you have been good enough to supply us with a hint as to his treatment sedatives are opposed to his idiosyncrasy lady bassett blushed high and said something about dr willis oh you are quite right you and dr willis only you are not so very conversant with that idiosyncrasy why have you let him smoke twenty cigars every day of his life the brain is accessible by other roads than the stomach well we have got him down to four cigars and in a month we will have him down to two the effect of that and exercise and simple food and the absence of powerful excitements you will see do your part said he gayly we will do ours he is the most interesting patient in the house and born to adorn society though by a concurrence of unhappy circumstances he is separated from it for a while she spent the whole afternoon with sir charles and they dined together at the doctor's private table with one or two patients who were touched but showed no signs of it on that occasion for the good doctor really acted like oil on the troubled waters sir charles and lady bassett corresponded and so kept their hearts up but after rolfe's hint the correspondence was rather guarded if these letters were read in the asylum the curious would learn that sir charles was far more anxious about his wife's condition than his own but that these two patient persons were only waiting a certain near event to attack richard bassett with accumulated fury that smoldering fire did not smoke by letter but burned deep in both their sore and heavy but enduring anglo saxon hearts lady bassett wrote to mr rolfe thanking him again for his advice and telling him how it worked she had a very short reply from that gentleman but about six weeks after her visit he surprised her a little by writing of his own accord and asking her for a formal introduction to sir charles bassett and begging her to back a request that sir charles would devote a leisure hour or two to correspondence with him not said he on his private affairs but on a matter of general interest i want a few of his experiences and observations in that place i have the less scruple in asking it that whatever takes him out of himself will be salutary lady bassett sent him the required introduction in such terms that sir charles at once consented to oblige his wife by obliging mr rolfe my dear sir in compliance with your wish and lady bassett's i send you a few desultory remarks on what i see here st the lines 'great wits to madness nearly are allied and thin partitions do their bonds divide' are in my opinion exaggerated and untrue taking the people here as a guide the insane in general appear to be people with very little brains and enormous egotism my next observation is that the women have far less imagination than the men they cannot even realize their own favorite delusions for instance here are two young ladies the virgin mary and the queen of england how do they play their parts they sit aloof from all the rest with their noses in the air but gauge their imaginations go down on one knee or both and address them as a saint and a queen they cannot say a word in accordance yet they are cunning enough to see they cannot reply in character so they will not utter a syllable to their adorers they are like the shop boys who go to a masquerade as burleigh or walsingham and when you ask them who is queen bess's favorite just now blush and look offended and pass sulkily on the same class of male lunatics can speak in character and this observation has made me doubt whether philosophers are not mistaken in saying that women generally have more imagination than men i suspect they have infinitely less and i believe their great love of novels which has been set down to imagination arises mainly from their want of it you writers of novels supply that defect for them by a pictorial style by an infinity of minute details and petty aids to realizing all which an imaginative reader can do for himself on reading a bare narrative of sterling facts and incidents i find a monotony in madness so many have inspirations see phantoms are the victims of vast conspiracies principalities and powers combined against a fly their food is poisoned their wine is drugged etc etc these i think are all forms of that morbid egotism which is at the bottom of insanity so is their antipathy for each other they keep apart because a madman is all self and his talk is all self thus egotisms clash and an antipathy arises yet it is not i think pure antipathy though so regarded but a mere form of their boundless egotism if in visiting an asylum you see two or three different patients buttonhole a fourth and pour their grievances into a listening ear you may safely suspect no of sanity on the whole i think the doctor himself and one of his attendants and jones a keeper have more solid eccentricity and variety about them than most of the patients extract from letter written about a fortnight later some insane persons have a way of couching their nonsense in language that sounds rational and has a false air of logical connection their periods seem stolen from sensible books and forcibly fitted to incongruous bosh by this means the ear is confused and a slow hearer might fancy he was listening to sense i have secured you one example of this you must know that in the evening i sometimes collect a few together and try to get them to tell their stories little comes of it in general but interruptions but one night a melancholy bagman responded in good set terms and all in a moment one would have thought i had put a torch to a barrel of powder he went off so quickly in this style 'you ask my story it is briefly told initiated in commerce from my earliest years and traveled in the cotton trade as representative of a large house in manchester i visited the united states 'unfortunately for me that country was then the chosen abode of spirits the very air was thick and humming with supernaturalia ere long spirit voices whispered in my ear and suggested pious aspirations at first that was a blind no doubt for very soon they went on to insinuate things profane and indelicate and urged me to deliver them in mixed companies i forbore with difficulty restrained by the early lessons of a pious mother and a disinclination to be kicked downstairs or flung out o' window 'i consulted a friend a native of the country he said in its beautiful doric old oss i reckon you'd better change the air i grasped his hand muttered a blessing and sailed for england 'on ocean's peaceful bosom the annoyance ceased but under this deceitful calm fresh dangers brooded two doctors had stolen into the ship unseen by human eye and bided their time unable to act at sea owing to the combined effect of wind and current they concealed themselves on deck under a black tarpaulin that is to say it had been black but wind and weather had reduced it to a dirty brown and there adopting for the occasion the habits of the dormouse the bear the caterpillar and other ephemeral productions they lay torpid but the moment the vessel touched the quay profiting by the commotion they emerged and signed certificates with chalk on my portmanteau then vanished in the crowd the custom house read the certificates and seized my luggage as contraband i was too old a traveler to leave my luggage so then they seized me and sent us both down here with sudden and short lived fury that old hell hound at the lodge asked them where i was booked for for the whole journey said a sepulchral voice unseen that means the grave my boys the silent grave' notwithstanding this stern decree suaby expects to turn him out cured in a few months miss wieland a very pretty girl put her arm in mine and drew me mysteriously apart 'so you are collecting the villainies' said she sotto voce 'it will take you all your time i'll tell you mine there's a hideous old man wants me to marry him and i won't and he has put me in here and keeps me prisoner till i will they are all on his side especially that sanctified old guy suaby they drug my wine they stupefy me they give me things to make me naughty and tipsy but it is no use i never will marry that old goat that for his money and him i'll die first' of course my blood boiled but i asked my nurse sally and she assured me there was not one atom of truth in any part of the story 'the young lady was put in here by her mother none too soon neither' i asked her what she meant 'why she came here with her throat cut and strapping on it she is a suicidal' this correspondence led eventually to some unexpected results but i am obliged to interrupt it for a time while i deal with a distinct series of events which began about five weeks after lady bassett's visit to mr rolfe and will carry the reader forward beyond the date we have now arrived at it was the little dining room at highmore a low room of modest size plainly furnished an enormous fire place paved with plain tiles on which were placed iron dogs only wood and roots were burned in this room mrs bassett had just been packed off to bed by marital authority bassett and wheeler sat smoking pipes and sipping whisky and water bassett professed to like the smell of peat smoke in whisky what he really liked was the price after a few silent whiffs said bassett i didn't think they would take it so quietly did you well i really did not but after all what can they do they are evidently afraid to go to the court of chancery and ask for a jury in the asylum and what else can they do humph they might arrange an escape and hide him for fourteen days then we could not recapture him without fresh certificates could we certainly not and the doors would be too well guarded not a crack for two doctors to creep in at you go too fast you know the law from me and you are a daring man that would try this sort of thing but a timid woman advised by a respectable muff like oldfield they will never dream of such a thing oldfield is not her head man she has got another adviser and he is the very man to do something plucky i don't know who you mean why her lover to be sure her lover lady bassett's lover ay the young parson wheeler smiled satirically you certainly are a good hater nothing is too bad for those you don't like if that lady bassett is not a true wife where will you find one she is the most deceitful jade in england oh oh ah you may sneer so you have forgotten how she outwitted us did the devil himself ever do a cunninger thing than that tempting a fellow into a correspondence that seemed a piece of folly on her part yet it was a deep diabolical trick to get at my handwriting did you see her game no more than i did you chuckled at her writing letters to the plaintiff pendente lite we were both children setting our wits against a woman's i tell you i dread her especially when i see her so unnaturally quiet after what we have done when you hook a large salmon and he makes a great commotion but all of a sudden lies like a stone be on your guard he means mischief well said wheeler this is all very true but you have strayed from the point what makes you think she has an improper attachment is it so very unnatural he is the handsomest fellow about she is the loveliest woman he is dark she is fair and they are thrown together by circumstances another thing i have always understood that women admire the qualities they don't possess themselves strength for instance now this parson is a hercules he took sir charles up like a boy and carried him in his arms all the way from where he had the fit lady bassett walked beside them rely on it a woman does not see one man carry another so without making a comparison in favor of the strong and against the weak but what am i talking about they walk like lovers those two what hand in hand he he no side by side but yet like lovers for all that you must have a good eye i have a good opera glass mr wheeler smoked in silence well but said he after a pause if this is so all the better for you don't you see that the lover will never really help her to get the husband out of confinement it is not in the nature of things he may struggle with his own conscience a bit being a clergyman but he won't go too far he won't break the law to get sir charles home and so end these charming duets with his lady love by jove you are right cried bassett convinced in his turn i say old fellow two heads are better than one i think we have got the clew between us yes by heaven it is so for the carriage used to be out twice a week but now she only goes about once in ten days by and by it will be once a fortnight then once a month and the black eyed rector will preach patience and resignation oh it was a master stroke clapping him in that asylum all we have got to do now is to let well alone when she is over head and ears in love with angelo she will come to easy terms with us and so i'll move across the way i shall never be happy till i live at huntercombe and administer the estate the maid servant brought him a note and said it was from her mistress bassett took it rather contemptuously and said the little woman is always in a fidget now when you come here she is all for peace he read the letter it ran thus dearest richard i implore you to do nothing more to hurt sir charles it is wicked and it is useless god has had pity on lady bassett and have you pity on her too jane has just heard it from one of the huntercombe servants what does she mean with her 'its' why surely read it you they looked at each other in doubt and amazement for some time then richard bassett rushed upstairs and had a few hasty words with his wife she told him her news in plainer english and renewed her mild entreaties he turned his back on her in the middle he went out into the nursery and looked at his child the little fellow a beautiful boy slept the placid sleep of infancy he leaned over him and kissed him and went down to the dining room his feet came tramp tramp very slowly and when he opened the door mr wheeler was startled at the change in his appearance he was pale and his countenance fallen why what is the matter said wheeler she has done us ah i was wiser than you i feared her it is the same thing over again a woman against two children this shows how strong she is you can't realize what she has done even when you see it an heir was wanted to those estates love cried out for one hate cried out for one nature denied one she has cut the gordian knot cut it as boldly as the lowest woman in huntercombe would have cut it under such a terrible temptation oh for shame think and use your eyes my eyes have seen the lady i think i see her now kneeling like an angel over her husband and pitying him for having knocked me down i say her only lover is her husband oh that was a long time ago time brings changes you can't take the eyes out of my head suppose it should be only a false alarm is that likely however i will learn whether it is or not that child shall never rob mine of bassett and huntercombe anything is fair against such a woman chapter xxvi that very night after wheeler had gone home richard bassett wrote a cajoling letter to mary wells asking her to meet him at the old place when the girl got this letter she felt a little faint for a moment but she knew the man his treachery and his hard egotism and selfishness so well that she tossed the letter aside and resolved to take no notice her trust was all in her mistress for whom indeed she had more real affection than for any living creature as for richard bassett she absolutely detested him as the day wore on she took another view of matters her deceiver was the enemy of her mistress she might do her a service by going to this rendezvous might learn something from him and use it against him so she went to the rendezvous with a heart full of bitter hate bassett with all his assurance could not begin his interrogatory all in a moment he made a sort of apology said he felt he had been unkind and he had never been happy since he had deserted her she cut that short i have found a better than you said she i am going to london very soon to be married i am glad to hear it no doubt you are i mean for your sake for my sake you think as little of me as i do of you come now what do you want of me without a lie if you can i wanted to see you and talk to you and hear your prospects well i have told you and she pretended to be going don't be in such a hurry tell us the news is it true that lady bassett is expected oh that is no news it is to me 'tain't no news in our house why we have known it for months this took away the man's breath for a minute at last he said with a great deal of intention will it be fair or dark as god pleases i'll bet you five pounds to one that it is dark mary shrugged her shoulders contemptuously as if these speculations were too childish for her it's my lady you want to talk about is it i thought it was to make me a wedding present he actually put his hand in his pocket and gave her two sovereigns she took them with a grim smile he presumed on this to question her minutely she submitted to the interrogatory only as the questions were not always delicate and the answer was invariably an untruth it may be as well to pass over the rest of the dialogue suffice it to say that whenever the girl saw the drift of a question she lied admirably and when she did not still she lied upon principle it must be a good thing to deceive the enemy richard bassett was now perplexed and saw himself in that very position which had so galled lady bassett six weeks or so before he could not make any advantageous move but was obliged to await events all he could do was to spy a little on lady bassett and note how often she went to the asylum after many days' watching he saw something new mr angelo was speaking to her with a good deal of warmth when suddenly she started from him and then turned round upon him in a very commanding attitude and with prodigious fire angelo seemed then to address her very humbly but she remained rigid at last angelo retired and left her so but he was no sooner out of sight than she dropped into a garden seat and taking out her handkerchief cried a long time why doesn't the fool come back said bassett from his tower of observation he related this incident to wheeler and it impressed that worthy more than all he had ever said before on the same subject but in a day or two wheeler who was a great gossip and picked up every thing came and told bassett that the parson was looking out for a curate and going to leave his living for a time on the ground of health that is rather against your theory mr bassett said he not a bit said bassett on the contrary that is just what these artful women do who sacrifice virtue but cling all the more to reputation i read french novels my boy find 'em instructive very they cut deeper into human nature than our writers dare her turning away her lover now is just the act of what the french call a masterly woman maitresse femme she has got rid of him to close the mouth of scandal that is her game well said wheeler you certainly are very ingenious and so fortified in your opinions that with you facts are no longer stubborn things you can twist them all your way if he had stayed and buzzed about her while her husband was incarcerated you would have found her guilty he goes to rome and leaves her and therefore you find her guilty you would have made a fine hanging judge in the good old sanguinary times i use my eyes my memory and my reason she is a monster of vice and deceit anything is fair against such a woman i am sorry to hear you say that said wheeler becoming grave rather suddenly a woman is a woman and i tell you plainly i have gone pretty well to the end of my tether with you abandon me then said bassett doggedly i can go alone wheeler was touched by this and said no no i am not the man to desert a friend but pray do nothing rash do nothing without consulting me bassett made no reply about a week after this as lady bassett was walking sadly in her own garden a great newfoundland dog ran up to her without any warning and put his paws almost on her shoulder she screamed violently and more than once one or two windows flew open and among the women who put their heads out to see what was the matter mary wells was the first the owner of the dog instantly whistled and the sportive animal ran to him but lady bassett was a good deal scared and went in holding her hand to her side mary wells hurried to her assistance and she cried a little from nervousness when the young woman came earnestly to her oh mary he frightened me so i did not see him coming mr moss said mary wells here's a villain come and frightened my lady go and shoot his dog you and your son and get the grooms and fling him in the horse pond directly no said lady bassett firmly you will see that he does not enter the house that is all should he attempt that then you will use force for my protection mary come to my room when they were together alone lady bassett put both hands on the girl's shoulders and made her turn toward her i think you love me mary said she drinking the girl's eyes with her own ah that i do my lady why did you look so pale and your eyes flash and why did you incite those poor men to it might have led to bloodshed it would and that is what i wanted my lady oh mary what don't you see no no i don't want to think so it might have been an accident the poor dog meant no harm it was his way of fawning that was all the beast meant no harm but the man did he is worse than any beast that ever was born he is a cruel cunning selfish devil and if i had been a man he should never have got off alive but are you sure quite i was upstairs and saw it all this was not true she had seen nothing till her mistress screamed then anything is fair against such a villain of course it is let me think she leaned her head upon her hand and that intelligent face of hers quite shone with hard thought at last after long and intense thinking she spoke i'll teach you to be inhuman mr richard bassett said she slowly and with a strange depth of resolution then mary wells and she put their heads together in close discussion but now lady bassett took the lead and revealed to her astonished adviser extraordinary and astounding qualities they had driven her to bay and that is a perilous game to play with such a woman mary wells found herself a child compared with her mistress now that that lady was driven to put out all her powers the conversation lasted about two hours in that time the whole campaign was settled chapter xxvii mary wells by order went down in a loose morning wrapper her mistress had given her and dined in the servants' hall she was welcomed with a sort of shout half ironical and the chief butler said glad to see you come back to us miss wells the same to you sir said mary with more pertness than logic which i'm only come to take leave for to morrow i go to london on business la what's the business i wonder inquired a house maid irreverentially well my business is not your business jane however if you want to know i'm going to be married and none too soon whispered the kitchen maid to a footman speak up my dear said mary there's nothing more vulgarer than whispering in company i said 'what will bill drake say to that' bill drake will say he was a goose not to make up his mind quicker this will learn him beauty won't wait for no man if he cries when i am gone you lend him your apron to wipe his eyes and tell him women can't abide shilly shallying men that's a hexcellent sentiment said john the footman and a solemn warning it is to all such as footmen be said mary we writes it in the fly leaf of our bibles accordingly said john no my man write it somewhere where you'll have a chance to read it this caused a laugh and when it was over the butler who did not feel strong enough to chaff a lady of this caliber inquired obsequiously whether he might venture to ask who was the happy stranger to carry off such a prize a civil question deserves a civil answer mr wright said mary it is a sea faring man the mate of a ship he have known me a few years longer than any man in these parts whenever he comes home from a voyage he tells me what he has made and asks me to marry him i have said 'no' so many times i'm sick and tired so i have said 'yes' for once in a way changes are lightsome you know thus airily did mary wells communicate her prospects and next morning early was driven to the station a cart had gone before with her luggage which tormented the female servants terribly for instead of the droll little servant's box covered with paper she had a large lady's box filled with linen and clothes by the liberality of lady bassett and a covered basket and an old carpet bag with some minor packages of an unintelligible character nor did she make any secret that she had money in both pockets indeed she flaunted some notes before the groom and told him none but her lady knew all she had done for sir charles but said she he is grateful you see and so is she she went off in the train as gay as a lark but she was no sooner out of sight than her face changed its whole expression and she went up to london very grave and thoughtful the traveling carriage was ordered at ten o'clock next day and packed as for a journey lady bassett took her housekeeper with her to the asylum she had an interview with sir charles and told him what mr bassett had done and the construction mary wells had put on it sir charles turned pale with rage and said he could no longer play the patient game he must bribe a keeper make his escape and kill that villain lady bassett was alarmed and calmed it down it was only a servant's construction and she might be wrong but it frightened me terribly and i fear it is the beginning of a series of annoyances and encroachments and i have lost mr angelo he has gone to italy even mary wells left me this morning to be married i think i know a way to turn all this against mr bassett but i will not say it because i want to hear what you advise dearest sir charles did not leave her long in doubt he said there is but one way you must leave huntercombe and put yourself out of that miscreant's way until our child is born that would not grieve me said lady bassett the place is odious to me now you are not there but what would censorious people say what could they say except that you obeyed your husband is it a command then dearest it is a command and although you are free and i am a prisoner although you are still an ornament to society and i pass for an outcast still i expect you to obey me when i assume a husband's authority i have not taken the command of you quite so much as you used to say i must but on this occasion i do you will leave huntercombe and avoid that caitiff until our child is born that ends all discussion said lady bassett oh charles my only regret is that it costs me nothing to obey you but when did it ever my king he had ordered her to do the very thing she wished to do she now gave her housekeeper minute instructions settled the board wages of the whole establishment and sent her home in the carriage retaining her own boxes and packages at the inn richard bassett soon found out that lady bassett had left huntercombe he called on wheeler and told him wheeler suggested she had gone to be near her husband no said bassett she has joined her lover i wonder at our simplicity in believing that fellow was gone to italy this is rich said wheeler a week ago she was guilty and a machiavel in petticoats for why she had quarreled with her angelo and packed him off to italy now she is guilty and why because he is not gone to italy not that you know whether he is or not you reason like a mule as for me i believe none of this nonsense till you find them together and that is just what i mean to do we shall see you will see very soon after this a country gentleman met wheeler on market day and drew him aside to ask him a question do you advise mr richard bassett still yes did you set him to trespass on lady bassett's lawn and frighten her with a great dog in the present state of her health heaven forbid this is the first i've heard of such a thing i am glad to hear you say that tom wheeler there read that your client deserves to be flogged out of the county sir and he pulled a printed paper out of his pocket it was dated from the royal hotel bath and had been printed with blanks as follows but a lady's hand had filled in the dates on the day of while i was walking alone in my garden mr richard bassett the person who has bereaved me by violence of my protector came without leave into my private grounds and brought a very large dog it ran to me and frightened me so that i nearly fainted with alarm mr bassett was aware of my condition next day i consulted my husband and he ordered me to leave huntercombe hall and put myself beyond the reach of trespassers and outrage one motive has governed mr bassett in all his acts from his anonymous letter to me before my marriage which i keep for your inspection together with the proofs that he wrote it to the barbarous seizure of my husband upon certificates purchased beforehand and this last act of violence which has driven me from the county for a time sir charles and i have often been your hosts and your guests we now ask you to watch our property and our legal rights so long as through injustice and cruelty my husband is a prisoner his wife a fugitive there said the gentleman these papers are going all round the county wheeler was most indignant and said he had never been consulted and had never advised a trespass he begged a loan of the paper and took it to bassett's that very same afternoon so you have been acting without advice said he angrily and a fine mess you have made of it and though not much given to violent anger he dashed the paper down on the table and hurt his hand a little anger must be paid for like other luxuries bassett read it and was staggered a moment but he soon recovered himself and said what is the foolish woman talking about he then took a sheet of paper and said he would soon give her a roland for an oliver ay said wheeler grimly let us see how you will put down the foolish woman i'll smoke a cigar in the garden and recover my temper richard bassett's retort ran thus i never wrote an anonymous letter in my life and if i put restraint upon sir charles it was done to protect the estate experienced physicians represented him homicidal and suicidal and i protected both lady bassett and himself by the act she has interpreted so harshly as for her last grievance it is imaginary my dog is gentle as a lamb i did not foresee lady bassett would be there nor that the poor dog would run and welcome her she is playing a comedy the real truth is a gentleman had left huntercombe whose company is necessary to her she has gone to join him and thrown the blame very adroitly upon richard bassett when he had written this bassett ordered his dog cart wheeler came in read the letter and said the last suggestion in it was a libel and an indictable one into the bargain what if it is true true to the letter even then you would not be safe unless you could prove it by disinterested witnesses well if i cannot i consent to cut this sentence out excuse me one minute i must put a few things in my carpetbag what going away of course i am better give me your address then in case anything turns up if you were as sharp as you pass for you would know my address royal hotel bath to be sure he left wheeler staring and was back in five minutes with his carpet bag and wraps wouldn't to morrow morning do for this wild goose chase asked wheeler no said richard i'm not such a fool catch me losing twelve hours in that twelve hours they would shift their quarters it is always so when a fool delays i shall breakfast at the royal hotel bath the dog cart came to the door as he spoke and he rattled off to the railway he managed to get to the royal hotel bath at am took a warm bath instead of bed and then ordered breakfast asked to see the visitors' book and wrote a false name turned the leaves and to his delight saw lady bassett's name but he could not find mr angelo's name in the book he got hold of boots and feed him liberally then asked him if there was a handsome young parson there very dark boots could not say there was then bassett made up his mind that angelo was at another hotel or perhaps in lodgings out of prudence lady bassett here still said he boots was not very sure would inquire at the bar did inquire and brought him word lady bassett had left for london yesterday morning bassett ground his teeth with vexation no train to london for an hour and a half he took a stroll through the town to fill up the time how often when a man abandons or remits his search for a time fate sends in his way the very thing he is after but has given up hunting just then as he walked along the north side of a certain street what should he see but the truly beautiful and remarkable eyes and eyebrows of mr angelo shining from afar that gentleman was standing in a reverie on the steps of a small hotel bassett drew back at first not to be seen looking round he saw he was at the door of a respectable house that let apartments he hurried in examined the drawing room floor took it for a week paid in advance and sent to the royal for his bag he installed himself near the window to await one of two things and act accordingly if angelo left the place he should go by the same train and so catch the parties together if the lady doubled back to bath or had only pretended to leave it he should soon know that by diligent watch and careful following he wrote to wheeler to announce this first step toward success chapter xxviii some days after this mr rolfe received a line from lady bassett to say she was at the adelphi hotel in john street he put some letters into his pocket and called on her directly she received him warmly and told him more fully than she had by letter how she had acted on his advice then she told him of richard bassett's last act and showed him her retort he knitted his brows at first over it but said he thought her proclamation could do no harm as a rule said he i object to flicking with a lady's whip when i am going to crush but yes it is able and gives you a good excuse for keeping out of the way of annoyances till we strike the blow and now i have something to consult you upon may i read you some extracts from your husband's letters to me oh yes forgive a novelist but this is a new situation reading a husband's letters to his wife however i have a motive and so i had in soliciting the correspondence with sir charles he then read her the letters that are already before the reader and also the following extracts mr johnson a broken tradesman has some imagination though not of a poetic kind he is imbued with trade and in the daytime exercises several especially a butcher's when he sees any of us coming he whips before the nearest door or gate and sells meat he sells it very cheap the reason is his friends allow him only a shilling or two in coppers and as every madman is the center of the universe he thinks that the prices of all commodities are regulated by the amount of specie in his pocket this is his style 'come buy buy choice mutton three farthings the carcass retail shop next door ma'am jack serve the lady bill tell him he can send me home those twenty bullocks at three half pence each ' and so on but at night he subsides into an auctioneer and with knocking down lots while others are conversing gets removed occasionally to a padded room sometimes we humor him and he sells us the furniture after a spirited competition and debits the amounts for cash is not abundant here the other night heated with business he went on from the articles of furniture to the company and put us all up in succession having a good many dislikes he sometimes forgot the auctioneer in the man and depreciated some lots so severely that they had to be passed but he set miss wieland in a chair and descanted on her beauty good temper and other gifts in terms florid enough for robins or any other poet sold for eighteen pounds and to a lady this lady had formed a violent attachment to miss w so next week they will be at daggers drawn my turn came and the auctioneer did me the honor to describe me as 'the lot of the evening' he told the bidders to mind what they were about they might never again be able to secure a live baronet at a moderate price owing to the tightness of the money market well sir i was honored with bids from several ladies but they were too timid and too honest to go beyond their means my less scrupulous sex soared above these considerations and i was knocked down for seventy nine pounds fifteen shillings amid loud applause at the spirited result my purchaser is a shop keeper mad after gardening dr suaby has given him a plot to cultivate and he whispered in my ear 'the reason i went to a fancy price was i can kill two birds with one stone with you you'll make a very good statee stuck up among my flowers and you can hallo and keep those plaguy sparrows off' oh what creatures for my darling to live among cried lady bassett piteously mr rolfe stared and said what then you are like all your sex no sense of humor humor when my husband is in misery and degradation and don't you see that the brave writer of these letters is steeled against misery and above degradation such men are not the mere sport of circumstances your husband carries a soul not to be quelled by three months in a well ordered mad house but i will read no more since what gives me satisfaction gives you pain oh yes yes don't let me lose a word my husband has ever uttered well i'll go on but i'm horribly discouraged i'm so sorry for that sir please forgive me mr rolfe read the letter next in date we are honored with one relic of antiquity a pythagorean he has obliged me with his biography he was to use his own words engendered by the sun shining on a dunghill at his father's door' and began his career as a flea but his identity was somehow shifted to a boy of nine years old he has had a long spell of humanity and awaits the great change which is to turn him to a bee it will not find him unprepared he has long practiced humming in anticipation a faithful friend called caffyn used to visit him every week caffyn died last year and the poor pythagorean was very lonely and sad but two months ago he detected his friend in the butcher's horse and is more than consoled for he says caffyn comes six times a week now instead of once' poor soul said lady bassett what a strange world for him to be living in it seems like a dream there is something stranger coming in this last letter i have at last found one madman allied to genius it has taken me a fortnight to master his delusion and to write down the vocabulary he has invented to describe the strange monster of his imagination all the words i write in italics are his own mr williams says that a machine has been constructed for malignant purposes which machine is an air loom it rivals the human machine in this that it can operate either on mind or matter it was invented and is worked by a gang of villains superlatively skillful in pneumatic chemistry physiology nervous influence sympathy and the higher metaphysic men far beyond the immature science of the present era which indeed is a favorite subject of their ridicule the gang are seven in number but williams has only seen the four highest bill the king a master of the art of magnetic impregnation jack the schoolmaster the short hand writer of the gang sir archy chief liar to the association and the glove woman so called from her always wearing cotton mittens this personage has never been known to speak to any one the materials used in the air loom by these pneumatic adepts are infinite but principally effluvia of certain metals poisons soporific scents etc the principal effects are st event working this is done by magnetic manipulation of kings emperors prime ministers and others so that while the world is fearing and admiring them they are in reality mere puppets played by the workers of the air loom d cutting soul from sense this is done by diffusing the magnetic warp from the root of the nose under the base of the skull till it forms a veil so that the sentiments of the heart can have no communication with the operations of the intellect d kiting as boys raise a kite in the air so the air loom can lift an idea into the brain where it floats and undulates for hours together the victim cannot get rid of an idea so insinuated th lobster cracking an external pressure of the magnetic atmosphere surrounding the person assailed williams has been so operated on and says he felt as if he was grasped by an enormous pair of nut crackers with teeth and subjected to a piercing pressure which he still remembers with horror death sometimes results from lobster cracking th lengthening the brain as the cylindrical mirror lengthens the countenance so these assailants find means to elongate the brain this distorts the ideas and subjects the most serious are made silly and ridiculous th thought making while one of these villains sucks at the brain of the assailed and extracts his existing sentiments another will press into the vacuum ideas very different from his real thoughts thus his mind is physically enslaved then sir charles goes on to say poor mr williams seems to me an inventor wasted i thought i would try and reason him out of his delusion i asked if he had ever seen this gang and their machine he said yes they operated on him this morning 'then show them me' said i 'young man' said he satirically 'do you think these assassins and their diabolical machine would be allowed to go on if they could be laid hands on so easily the gang are fertile in disguise the machine operates at considerable distances' to drive him into a corner i said 'will you give me a drawing of it' he seemed to hesitate so i said 'if you can not draw it you never saw it and never will' he assented to that and i was vain enough to think i had staggered him but yesterday he produced the inclosed sketch and explanation after this i sadly fear he is incurable there are three sane patients in this asylum besides myself i will tell you their stories when you come here which i hope will be soon for the time agreed on draws near and my patience and self control are sorely tried as day after day rolls by and sees me still in a madhouse there lady bassett said mr rolfe and now for my motive in reading these letters sir charles may still have a crotchet an inordinate desire for an heir but even if he has the writer of these letters has nothing to fear from any jury and therefore i am now ready to act i propose to go down to the asylum to morrow and get him out as quickly as i can lady bassett uttered an ejaculation of joy then she turned suddenly pale and her countenance fell she said nothing mr rolfe was surprised at this since at their last meeting she was writhing at her inaction he began to puzzle himself she watched him keenly he thought to himself perhaps she dreads the excitement of meeting for herself at last lady bassett asked him how long it would take to liberate sir charles not quite a week if richard bassett is well advised if he fights desperately it may take a fortnight in any case i don't leave the work an hour till it is done i can delay and i can fight but i never mix the two come lady bassett there is something on your mind you don't like to say well what does it matter i will pack my bag and write to dr suaby that he may expect me soon but i will wait till i get a line from you to go ahead then i'll go down that instant and do the work this proposal was clearly agreeable to lady bassett and she thanked him you need not waste words over it said he write one word 'act' that will be the shortest letter you ever wrote the rest of the conversation is not worth recording mr rolfe instructed a young solicitor minutely packed his bag and waited but day after day went by and the order never came to act mr rolfe was surprised at this and began to ask himself whether he could have been deceived in this lady's affection for her husband but he rejected that then he asked himself whether it might have cooled he had known a very short incarceration produce that fatal effect both husband and wife interested him and he began to get irritated at the delay sir charles's letters made him think they had already wasted time at last a letter came from gloucester place will my kind friend now act gratefully bella bassett mr rolfe upon this cast his discontent to the winds and started for bellevue house on the evening of that day a surgeon called boddington was drinking tea with his wife and they were talking rather disconsolately for he had left a fair business in the country and though a gentleman of undoubted skill was making his way very slowly in london the conversation was agreeably interrupted by a loud knock at the door a woman had come to say that he was wanted that moment for a lady of title in gloucester place hard by i will come said he with admirably affected indifference and as soon as the woman was out of sight husband and wife embraced each other pray god it may all go well for your sake and hers poor lady mr boddington hurried to the number in gloucester place the door was opened by the charwoman he asked her with some doubt if that was the house the woman said yes and she believed it was a surprise the lady was from the country and was looking out for some servants this colloquy was interrupted by an intelligent maid who asked over the balusters if that was the medical man and on the woman's saying it was begged him to step upstairs at once he found his patient attended only by her maid but she was all discretion and intelligence she said he had only to direct her she would do anything for her dear mistress mr boddington said a single zealous and intelligent woman who could obey orders was as good as a number or better he then went gently to the bedside and his experience told him at once that the patient was in labor he told the attendant so and gave her his directions chapter xxix me rolfe reached bellevue house in time to make a hasty toilet and dine with dr suaby in his private apartments the other guests were sir charles bassett mr hyam a meek sorrowful patient an exquisite and miss wieland dr suaby introduced him to everybody but the exquisite mr rolfe said sir charles bassett and he were correspondents so i hear he tells you the secrets of the prison house eh the humors of the place you mean yes he has a good eye for character i suppose he has dissected me along with the rest no no he has only dealt with the minor eccentricities his pen failed at you 'you must come and see the doctor' he said so here i am oh said the doctor if your wit and his are both to be leveled at me i had better stop your mouths dinner dinner sir charles will you take miss wieland sorry we have not another lady to keep you company madam are you then i'm not said the lady smartly the dinner passed like any other only rolfe observed that dr suaby took every fair opportunity of drawing the pluckless mr hyam into conversation and that he coldly ignored the exquisite i have seen that young man about town i think said mr rolfe where was it i wonder the argyll rooms or the casino probably thank you doctor oh i forgot you owed me one he is no favorite of yours certainly not and i only invited him medicinally medicinally that's too deep for a layman to flirt with miss wieland flirting does her good medicine embraces a wider range than i thought no doubt you are always talking about medicine but you know very little begging your pardon that is the theory of compensation when you know very little about a thing you must talk a great deal about it well i'm here for instruction thirsting for it all the better we'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart all right but not of your favorite acetate of morphia because that is the draught that takes the reason prisoner it's no favorite of mine indeed experience has taught me that all sedatives excite if they soothe at first they excite next day my antidotes to mental excitement are packing in lukewarm water and best of all hard bodily exercise and the perspiration that follows it to put it shortly prolonged bodily excitement antidotes mental excitement i'll take a note of that it is the wisest thing i ever heard from any learned physician yet many a learned physician knows it but you are a little prejudiced against the faculty only in their business they are delightful out of that but come now nobody hears us confess the system which prescribes drugs drugs drugs at every visit and in every case and does not give a severe selection of esculents the first place but only the second or third must be rotten at the core don't you despise a layman's eye all the professions want it well you are a writer publish a book call it medicina laici and send me a copy to slash in the lancet well i will when novels cease to pay and truth begins to in the course of the evening mr rolfe drew dr suaby apart and said i must tell you frankly i mean to relieve you of one of your inmates only one i was in hopes you would relieve me of all the sane people they say you are ingenious at it all i know is i can't get rid of an inmate if the person who signed the order resists now for instance here's a mrs hallam came here unsound religious delusion has been cured two months i have reported her so to her son in law who signed the order but he will not discharge her he is vicious she scriptural bores him about eternity then i wrote to the commissioners in lunacy but they don't like to strain their powers so they wrote to the affectionate son in law and he politely declines to act sir charles bassett the same three weeks ago i reported him cured and the detaining relative has not even replied to me got a copy of your letter of course but what if i tell you there is a gentleman here who never had any business to come yet he is as much a fixture as the grates i took him blindfold along with the house i signed a deed and it is so stringent i can't evade one of my predecessor's engagements this old rogue committed himself to my predecessor's care under medical certificates the order he signed himself illegal you know of course but where's the remedy the person who signed the order must rescind it but this sham lunatic won't rescind it altogether the tenacity of an asylum is prodigious the statutes are written with bird lime twenty years ago that old skinflint found the rates and taxes intolerable and doesn't everybody find them intolerable to avoid these rates and taxes he shut up his house captured himself and took himself here and here he will end his days excluding some genuine patient unless you sweep him into the street for me sindbad i will try said rolfe solemnly but i must begin with sir charles bassett by the by about his crotchet oh he has still an extravagant desire for children but the cerebral derangement is cured and the other standing by itself is a foible not a mania it is only a natural desire in excess if they brought me rachel merely because she had said 'give me children or i die' and i found her a healthy woman in other respects i should object to receive her on that score alone you are deadly particular compared with some of them said rolfe that evening he made an appointment with sir charles and visited him in his room at a m he told him he had seen lady bassett in london and of course he had to answer many questions he then told him he came expressly to effect his liberation i am grateful to you sir said sir charles with a suppressed and manly emotion here are my instructions from lady bassett short but to the point may i keep that why of course sir charles kissed his wife's line and put the note in his breast the first step said rolfe is to cut you in two that is soon done you must copy in your own hand and then sign this writing and he handed him a paper i charles dyke bassett being of sound mind instruct james sharpe of gray's inn my solicitor to sue the person who signed the order for my incarceration in the court of common pleas and to take such other steps for my relief as may be advised by my counsel mr francis rolfe excuse me said sir charles if i make one objection mr oldfield has been my solicitor for many years i fear it will hurt his feelings if i intrust the matter to a stranger would there be any objection to my inserting mr oldfield's name sir only this he would think he knew better than i do and then i who know better than he does and am very vain and arrogant should throw up the case in a passion and go back to my ms and humdrum oldfield would go to equity instead of law and all the costs would fall on your estate instead of on your enemy and you would be here eighteen months instead of eight or ten days no sir charles you can't mix champagne and ditch water you can't make invention row in a boat with antique twaddle and you mustn't ask me to fight your battle with a blunt knife when i have got a sharp knife that fits my hand mr rolfe said this with more irritation than was justified and revealed one of the great defects in his character sir charles saw his foible smiled and said i withdraw a proposal which i see annoys you he then signed the paper mr rolfe broke out all smiles directly and said now you are cut in two one you is here but sharpe is another you thus one you works out of the asylum and one in and that makes all the difference compare notes with those who have tried the other way yet simple and obvious as this is would you believe it i alone have discovered this method i alone practice it he sent his secretary off to london at once and returned to sir charles the authority will be with sharpe at he will be at whitehall and examine the order he will take the writ out at once and if richard bassett is the man he will serve it on him to morrow in good time and send one of your grooms over here on horseback with the news we serve the writ personally because we have shufflers to deal with and i will not give them a chance now i must go and write a lie or two for the public and then inspect the asylum with suaby before post time i will write to a friend of mine who is a commissioner of lunacy one of the strong minded ones we may as well have two strings to our bow sir charles thanked him gracefully and said it is a rare thing in this selfish world to see one man interest himself in the wrongs of another as you are good enough to do in mine oh said rolfe all work and no play makes jack a dull boy my business is lying and i drudge at it so to escape now and then to the play ground of truth and justice is a great amusement and recreation to poor me besides it gives me fresh vigor to replunge into mendacity and that's the thing that pays with this simple and satisfactory explanation he rolled away leaving for the present matters not essential to this vein of incident i jump to what occurred toward evening just after dinner the servant who waited told dr suaby that a man had walked all the way from huntercombe to see sir charles bassett poor fellow said dr suaby i should like to see him would you mind receiving him here oh no on second thoughts james you had better light a candle in the next room in case a heavy clatter was heard and the burly figure of moses moss entered the room being bareheaded he saluted the company by pulling his head and it bobbed he was a little dazzled by the lights at first but soon distinguished sir charles and his large countenance beamed with simple and affectionate satisfaction how d'ye do moss said sir charles pretty well thank ye sir in my body but uneasy in my mind there be a trifle too many rogues afoot to please me however i told my mistress this morning says i 'before i puts up with this here any longer i must go over there and see him for here's so many lies a cutting about' says i 'i'm fairly mazed' so if you please sir charles will you be so good as to tell me out of your own mouth and then i shall know be you crazy or hain't you ay or no suaby and rolfe had much ado not to laugh right out but sir charles said gravely he was not crazy do i look crazy moss that ye doan't you look twice the man you did why your cheeks did use to be so pasty like now you've got a color but mayhap casting an eye on the decanters ye're flustered a bit wi' drink no no said rolfe we have not commenced our nightly debauch yet only just done dinner then there goes another this will be good news to home dall'd if i would not ha' come them there thirty miles on all fours for't but sir if so be you are not crazy please think about coming home for things ain't as they should be in our parts my lady she is away for her groaning and partly for fear of this very richard bassett and him and his lawyer they have put it about as you are dead in law that is the word and so the servants they don't know what to think and the village folk are skeared with his clapping four brace on 'em in jail and joe and i we wants to fight un but my dame she is timorous and won't let us because of the laayer and th' upshot is this here richard bassett is master after a manner and comes on the very lawn and brings men with a pole measure and uses the place as his'n mostly but our joe bides in the hall with his gun and swears he'll shoot him if he sets foot in the house joe says he have my lady's leave and license so to do but not outside sir charles turned very red and was breathless with indignation dr suaby looked uneasy and said control yourself sir' i am not going to control myself cried rolfe in a rage don't you take it to heart sir charles it shall not last long ah dr suaby can you lend me a gig or a dog cart with a good horse yes i have got a wonderful roadster half irish half norman then mr moss to morrow you and i go to huntercombe you shall show me this bassett and we will give him a pill meantime said dr suaby i take a leaf out of your medicina laici and prescribe a hearty supper a quart of ale and a comfortable bed to mr moss james see him well taken care of poor man said he when moss had retired what simplicity what good sense what ignorance of the world what feudality if i may be allowed the expression sir charles was manifestly discomposed and retired to bed early rolfe drove off with moss at eight o'clock and was not seen again all day indeed sir charles was just leaving dr suaby's room when he came in rather tired and would not say a word till they gave him a cup of tea then he brightened up and told his story we went to the railway to meet sharpe the muff did not come nor send by the first train his clerk arrived by the second we went to huntercombe village together and on the road i gave him some special instructions richard bassett not at home we used a little bad language and threw out a skirmisher moss to wit to find him moss discovered him on your lawn planning a new arrangement of the flower beds with wheeler looking over the boundary wall we went up to bassett and the clerk served his copy of the writ he took it quite coolly but when he saw at whose suit it was he turned pale he recovered himself directly though and burst out laughing 'suit of sir charles bassett why he can't sue he is civiliter mortuus mad as a march hare in confinement' clerk told him he was mistaken sir charles was perfectly sane 'good day sir' so then bassett asked him to wait a little he took the writ away and showed it wheeler no doubt he came back and blustered and said 'some other person has instructed you you will get yourself into trouble i fear' the little clerk told him not to alarm himself mr sharpe was instructed by sir charles bassett in his own handwriting and signature and said 'it is not my business to argue the case with you you had better take the advice of counsel' 'thank you' said bassett 'that would be wasting a guinea' 'a good many thousand guineas have been lost by that sort of economy' says the little clerk solemnly oh and he told him mr sharpe was instructed to indict him for a trespass if he ever came there again and handed him a written paper to that effect which we two had drawn up at the station and so left him to his reflections we went into the house and called the servants together and told them to keep the rooms warm and the beds aired since you might return any day upon this news sir charles showed no premature or undignified triumph but some natural complacency and a good deal of gratitude the next day was blank of events but the next after mr rolfe received a letter containing a note addressed to sir charles bassett mr rolfe sent it to him sir i am desired to inform you that i attended lady bassett last night when she was safely delivered of a son have seen her again this morning mother and child are doing remarkably well w boddington surgeon upper gloucester place sir charles cried thank god thank god he held out the paper to mr rolfe and sat down overpowered by tender emotions mr rolfe devoured the surgeon's letter at one glance shook the baronet's hand eloquently and went away softly leaving him with his happiness sir charles however began now to pine for liberty he longed so to join his wife and see his child and rolfe observing this chafed with impatience he had calculated on bassett advised by wheeler taking the wisest course and discharging him on the spot he had also hoped to hear from the commissioner of lunacy but neither event took place they could have cut the gordian knot by organizing an escape giles and others were to be bought to that but dr suaby's whole conduct had been so kind generous and confiding that this was out of the question indeed sir charles had for the last month been there upon parole yet the thing had been wisely planned as will appear when i come to notice the advice counsel had given to bassett in this emergency but bassett would not take advice he went by his own head and prepared a new and terrible blow which mr rolfe did not foresee but meantime an unlooked for and accidental assistant came into the asylum without the least idea sir charles was there mrs marsh early in her married life converted her husband to religion and took him about the county preaching she was in earnest and had a vein of natural eloquence that really went straight to people's bosoms she was certainly a christian though an eccentric one temper being the last thing to yield to gospel light she still got into rages but now she was very humble and penitent after them well then after going about doing good she decided to settle down and do good as for marsh he had only to obey judge for yourself the mild gray haired vicar of calverly who now leaned on la marsh as on a staff thought it right at the beginning to ascertain that she was not opposing her husband's views he put a query of this kind as delicately as possible my husband cried she if he refused to go to heaven with me i'd take him there by the ear and her eye flashed with the threat well somebody told this lady that mr vandeleur was ruined and in dr suaby's asylum not ten miles from her country seat this intelligence touched her she contrasted her own happy condition both worldly and spiritual with that of this unfortunate reprobate and she felt bound to see if nothing could be done for the poor wretch a timid christian would have sent some man to do the good work but this was a lion like one so she mounted her horse and taking only her groom with her was at bellevue in no time she dismounted and said she must speak to dr suaby sent in her card and was received at once you have a gentleman here called vandeleur the doctor looked disappointed but bowed i wish to see him certainly madam james take mrs marsh into a sitting room and send mr vandeleur to her he is not violent is he said mrs marsh beginning to hesitate when she saw there was no opposition not at all madam the pink of politeness if you have any money about you it might be as well to confide it to me what will he rob me oh no much too well conducted but he will most likely wheedle you out of it no fear of that sir and she followed james he took her to a room commanding the lawn she looked out of the window and saw several ladies and gentlemen walking at their ease reading or working in the sun poor things she thought they are not so very miserable perhaps god comforts them by ways unknown to us i wonder whether preaching would do them any good i should like to try but they would not let me they lean on the arm of flesh her thoughts were interrupted at last by the door opening gently and in came vandeleur with his graceful panther like step and a winning smile he had put on for conquest he stopped he stared he remained motionless and astounded at last he burst out somer was it me you wished to see yes said she very kindly i came to see you for old acquaintance you must call me mrs marsh now i am married by this time he had quite recovered himself and offered her a chair with ingratiating zeal sit down by me said she as if she was petting a child are you sure you remember me says the courtier who could forget you that had ever had the honor mrs marsh drew back with sudden hauteur i did not come here for folly said she then rather naively i begin to doubt your being so very mad mad no of course i am not then what brings you here stumped what have i mistaken the house is it a jail oh no i'll tell you you see i was dipped pretty deep and duns after me and the derby my only chance so i put the pot on but a dark horse won the jews knew i was done so now it was a race which should take me sloman had seven writs out i was in a corner i got a friend that knows every move to sign me into this asylum they thought it was all up then and he is bringing them to a shilling in the pound before he could complete this autobiographical sketch mrs marsh started up in a fury and brought her whip down on the table with a smartish cut you little heartless villain she screamed is this the way you play upon people bringing me from my home to console a maniac and instead of that you are only what you always were a spendthrift and a scamp finely they will laugh at me she clutched the whip in her white but powerful hand till it quivered in the air impatient for a victim oh she cried panting and struggling with her passion if i wasn't a child of god i'd you'd give me a devilish good hiding said vandeleur demurely that i would said she very earnestly you forget that i never told you i was mad how could i imagine you would hear it how could i dream you would come even if you did i should be no christian if i didn't come but i mean we parted bad friends you know yes van but when i asked you for the gray horse you sent me a new sidesaddle a woman does not forget those little things you were a gentleman though a child of belial vandeleur bowed most deferentially as much as to say in both those matters you are the highest authority earth contains so come said she here is plenty of writing paper now tell me all your debts and i will put them down what is the use at a shilling in the pound six hundred will pay them all are you sure as sure as that i am not going to rob you of the money oh i only mean to lend it you that alters the case prodigiously and she smiled satirically now your friend's address that is treating with your creditors must i unless you want to put me in a great passion anything sooner than that then he wrote it for her and now said she grant me a little favor for old acquaintance just kneel you down there and let me wrestle with heaven for you that you may be a brand plucked from the fire even as i am the pink of politeness submitted with a sigh of resignation then she prayed for him so hard so beseechingly so eloquently he was amazed and touched she rose from her knees and laid her head on her hand exhausted a little by her own earnestness he stood by her and hung his head you are very good he said it is a shame to let you waste it on me look here i want to do a little bit of good to another man after you praying so beautifully ah i am so glad tell me well then you mustn't waste a thought on me rhoda i'm a gambler and a fool let me go to the dogs at once it is only a question of time but there's a fellow here that is in trouble and doesn't deserve it and he was a faithful friend to you i believe i never was and he has got a wife and by what i hear you could get him out i think and i am sure you would be angry with me afterward if i didn't tell you you have such a good heart it is sir charles bassett sir charles bassett here oh his poor wife what drove him mad poor poor sir charles oh he is all right they have cured him entirely but there is no getting him out and he is beginning to lose heart they say there's a literary swell here can tell you all about it he has come down expressly but they are in a fix and i think you could help them out i wish you would let me introduce you to him to whom to mr rolfe you used to read his novels i adore him introduce me at once but sir charles must not see me nor know i am here say mrs marsh a friend of lady bassett's begs to be introduced sly vandeleur delivered this to rolfe but whispered out of his own head a character for your next novel a saint with the devil's own temper this insidious addition brought mr rolfe to her directly as might be expected from their go ahead characters these two knew each other intimately in about twelve minutes and rolfe told her all the facts i have related and marsh went into several passions and corrected herself and said she had been a great sinner but was plucked from the burning and therefore thankful to anybody who would give her a little bit of good to do rolfe took prompt advantage of this foible and urged her to see the commissioners in lunacy and use all her eloquence to get one of them down they don't act upon my letters said he but it will be another thing if a beautiful ardent woman puts it to them in person with all that power of face and voice i see in you you are all fire and you can talk saxon oh i'll talk to them said mrs marsh and god will give me words he always does when i am on his side poor lady bassett my heart bleeds for her i will go to london to morrow ay to night if you like to night i'll go this instant what said rolfe is there a lady in the world who will go a journey without packing seven trunks and merely to do a good action you forget penitent sinners must make up for lost time at that rate impenitent ones like me had better lose none so i'll arm you at once with certain documents and you must not leave the commissioners till they promise to send one of their number down without delay to examine him and discharge him if he is as we represent mrs marsh consented warmly and went with rolfe to dr suaby's study they armed her with letters and written facts and she rode off at a fiery pace but not before she and rolfe had sworn eternal friendship the commissioners received mrs marsh coldly she was chilled but not daunted she produced suaby's letter and rolfe's and when they were read she played the orator she argued she remonstrated she convinced she persuaded she thundered fire seemed to come out of the woman mr fawcett on whom mr rolfe had mainly relied caught fire and declared he would go down next day and look into the matter on the spot and he kept his word he came down he saw sir charles and suaby and penetrated the case mr fawcett was a man with a strong head and a good heart but rather an arrogant manner he was also slightly affected with official pomposity and reticence so unfortunately he went away without declaring his good intentions and discouraged them all with the fear of innumerable delays in the matter now if justice is slow injustice is swift the very next day a thunder clap fell on sir charles and his friends arrived at the door a fly and pair with three keepers from an asylum kept by burdoch a layman the very opposite of the benevolent suaby his was a place where the old system of restraint prevailed secretly but largely strait waistcoats muffles hand locks etc here fleas and bugs destroyed the patients' rest and to counteract the insects morphia was administered freely given to the bugs and fleas it would have been an effectual antidote but they gave it to the patients and so the insects won these three keepers came with an order correctly drawn and signed by richard bassett to deliver sir charles to the agents showing the order suaby who had a horror of burdoch turned pale at the sight of the order and took it to rolfe resist said that worthy i have no right on second thoughts do nothing but gain time while i has bassett paid you for sir charles's board no decline to give him up till that is done and be some time making out the bill come what may pray keep sir charles here till i send you a note that i am ready he then hastened to sir charles and unfolded his plans to him sir charles assented eagerly he was quite willing to run risks with the hope of immediate liberation which rolfe held out his own part was to delay and put off till he got a line from rolfe rolfe then borrowed vandeleur on parole and the doctor's dog cart and dashed into the town distant two miles first he went to the little theater and found them just concluding a rehearsal being a playwright he was known to nearly all the people more or less and got five supers and one carpenter to join him for a consideration he then made other arrangements in the town the nature of which will appear in due course meantime suaby had presented his bill one of the keepers got into the fly and took it back to the town there as rolfe had anticipated lurked richard bassett he cursed the delay gave the man the money and urged expedition the money was brought and paid and suaby informed sir charles but sir charles was not obliged to hurry he took a long time to pack and he was not ready till vandeleur brought a note to him from rolfe then sir charles came down suaby made burdoch's keeper sign a paper to the effect that he had the baronet in charge and relieved suaby of all further responsibility then sir charles took an affectionate leave of dr suaby and made him promise to visit him at huntercombe hall then he got into the fly and sat between two keepers and the fly drove off sir charles at that moment needed all his fortitude the least mistake or miscalculation on the part of his friends and what might not be the result to him as the fly went slowly through the gate he saw on his right hand a light carriage and pair moving up but was it coming after him or only bringing visitors to the asylum the fly rolled on even his stout heart began to quake it rolled and rolled sir charles could stand it no longer he tried to look out of the window to see if the carriage was following one of the keepers pulled him in roughly come none of that sir you insolent scoundrel said sir charles ay ay said the man we'll see about that when we get you home then sir charles saw he had offended a vindictive blackguard he sank back in his seat and a cold chill crept over him just then they passed a little clump of fir trees in a moment there rushed out of these trees a number of men in crape masks stopped the horses surrounded the carriage and opened it with brandishing of bludgeons and life preservers and pointing of guns chapter xxx a big man who seemed the leader fired a volley of ferocious oaths at the keepers and threatened to send them to hell that moment if they did not instantly deliver up that gentleman the keepers were thoroughly terrified and roared for mercy hand him out here you scoundrels yes yes man alive we are not resisting what is the use hand down his luggage it was done all in a flutter now get in again turn your horses' heads the other way and don't come back for an hour you with your guns take stations in those trees and shoot them dead if they are back before their time these threats were interlarded with horrible oaths and burdoch's party were glad to get off and they drove away quickly in the direction indicated however as soon as they got over their first surprise they began to smell a hoax and instead of an hour it was scarcely twenty minutes when they came back but meantime the supers were paid liberally among the fir trees by vandeleur pocketed their crape flung their dummy guns into a cornfield dispersed in different directions and left no trace but sir charles was not detained for that the moment he was recaptured he and his luggage were whisked off in the other carriage and with rolfe and his secretary dashed round the town avoiding the main street to a railway eight miles off at a pace almost defying pursuit not that they dreaded it they had numbers arms and a firm determination to fight if necessary and also three tongues to tell the truth instead of one at one in the morning they were in london they slept at mr rolfe's house and before breakfast mr rolfe's secretary was sent to secure a couple of prize fighters to attend upon sir charles till further notice they were furnished with a written paper explaining the case briefly and were instructed to hit first and talk afterward should a recapture be attempted should a crowd collect they were to produce the letter these measures were to provide against his recapture under the statute which allows an alleged lunatic to be retaken upon the old certificates for fourteen days after his escape from confinement but for no longer money is a good friend in such contingencies as these sir charles started directly after breakfast to find his wife and child the faithful pugilists followed at his heels in another cab neither sir charles nor mr rolfe knew lady bassett's address it was the medical man who had written but that did not much matter sir charles was sure to learn his wife's address from mr boddington he called on that gentleman at upper gloucester place mr boddington had just taken his wife down to margate for her health had only been gone half an hour this was truly irritating and annoying apparently sir charles must wait that gentleman's return he wrote a line begging mr boddington to send him lady bassett's address in a cab immediately on his return he told mr rolfe this and then for the first time let out that his wife's not writing to him at the asylum had surprised and alarmed him he was on thorns mr boddington returned in the middle of the night and at breakfast time sir charles had a note to say lady bassett was at gloucester place portman square sir charles bolted a mouthful or two of breakfast and then dashed off in a hansom to gloucester place there was a bill in the window to be let furnished apply to parker ellis he knocked at the door nobody came knocked again a lugubrious female opened the door lady bassett don't live here sir house to be let sir charles went to mr boddington and told him mr boddington said he thought he could not be mistaken but he would look at his address book he did and said it was certainly gloucester place perhaps she has left said he she was very healthy an excellent patient but i should not have advised her to move for a day or two more sir charles was sore puzzled he dashed off to the agents parker ellis they said yes the house was lady bassett's for a few months they were instructed to let it when did she leave i am her husband and we have missed each other somehow the clerk interfered and said lady bassett had brought the keys in her carriage yesterday sir charles groaned with vexation and annoyance did she give you no address yes sir huntercombe hall i mean no address in london no sir none sir charles was now truly perplexed and distressed and all manner of strange ideas came into his head he did not know what to do but he could not bear to do nothing so he drove to the times office and advertised requesting lady bassett to send her present address to mr rolfe at night he talked this strange business over with mr rolfe that gentleman thought she must have gone to huntercombe but by the last post a letter came from suaby inclosing one from lady bassett to her husband gloucester place darling the air here is not good for baby and i cannot sleep for the noise we think of creeping toward home to morrow in an easy carriage pray god you may soon meet us at dear huntercombe our first journey will be to that dear old comfortable inn at winterfield where you and i were so happy but not happier dearest darling than we shall soon be again i hope your devoted wife bella bassett my heartfelt thanks to mr rolfe for all he is doing sir charles wanted to start that night for winterfield but rolfe persuaded him not and mind said he the faithful pugilists must go with you the morning's post rendered that needless it brought another letter from suaby informing mr rolfe that the commissioners had positively discharged sir charles and notified the discharge to richard bassett sir charles took leave of mr rolfe as of a man who was to be his bosom friend for life and proceeded to hunt his wife she had left winterfield but he followed her like a stanch hound and when he stopped at a certain inn some twenty miles from huntercombe a window opened there was a strange loving scream he looked up and saw his wife's radiant face and her figure ready to fly down to him he rushed upstairs into the right room by some mighty instinct and held her panting and crying for joy in his arms that moment almost compensated what each had suffered chapter xxxi so full was the joy of this loving pair that for a long time they sat rocking in each other's arms and thought of nothing but their sorrows past and the sea of bliss they were floating on but presently sir charles glanced round for a moment swift to interpret his every look lady bassett rose took two steps came back and printed a kiss on his forehead and then went to a door and opened it mrs millar said she with one of those tones by which these ladies impregnate with meaning a word that has none at all and then she came back to her husband soon a buxom woman of forty appeared carrying a biggish bank of linen and lace with a little face in the middle the good woman held it up to sir charles and he felt something novel stir inside him he looked at the little thing with a vast yearning of love with pride and a good deal of curiosity and then turned smiling to his wife she had watched him furtively but keenly and her eyes were brimming over he kissed the little thing and blessed it and then took his wife's hands and kissed her wet eyes and made her stand and look at baby with him hand in hand it was a pretty picture the buxom woman swelled her feathers as simple women do when they exhibit a treasure of this sort she lifted the little mite slowly up and down and said oh you beauty and then went off into various inarticulate sounds which i recommend to the particular study of the new philosophers they cannot have been invented after speech that would be retrogression they must be the vocal remains of that hairy sharp eared quadruped our progenitor who by accident discovered language and so turned biped and went ahead of all the other hairy quadrupeds whose ears were too long or not sharp enough to stumble upon language under cover of these primeval sounds lady bassett drew her husband a little apart and looking in his face with piteous wistfulness said you won't mind richard bassett and his baby now not i you will never have another fit while you live i promise you will always be happy i must be an ungrateful scoundrel else my dear then baby is our best friend oh you little angel and she pounced on the mite and kissed it far harder than sir charles had heaven knows what these gentle creatures are so rough with their mouths to children but so it is and now how can a mere male relate all the pretty childish things that were done and said to baby and of baby before the inevitable squalling began and baby was taken away to be consoled by another of his subjects sir charles and lady bassett had a thousand things to tell each other to murmur in each other's ears sitting lovingly close to each other but when all was quiet and everybody else was in bed lady bassett plucked up courage and said charles i am not quite happy there is one thing wanting and then she hid her face in her hands and blushed i cannot nurse him never mind said sir charles kindly you forgive me forgive you my poor girl why is that a crime it leads to so many things you don't know what a plague a nurse is and makes one jealous well but it is only for a time come bella this is a little peevish don't let us be ungrateful to heaven as for me while you and our child live i am proof against much greater misfortunes than that then lady bassett cleared up and the subject dropped but it was renewed next morning in a more definite form sir charles rose early and in the pride and joy of his heart and not quite without an eye to triumphing over his mortal enemy and his cold friends sent a mounted messenger with orders to his servants to prepare for his immediate reception and to send out his landau and four horses to the rose at staveleigh half way between huntercombe and the place where he now was lady bassett had announced herself able for the journey after breakfast he asked her rather suddenly whether mrs millar was not rather an elderly woman to select for a nurse i thought people got a young woman for that office oh said lady bassett why mrs millar is not the nurse of course nurse is young and healthy and from the country and the best i could have in every way for baby but yet oh charles i hope you will not be angry who do you think nurse is it is mary gosport mary wells that was sir charles was a little staggered he put this and that together and said why she must have been playing the fool then hush not so loud dear she is a married woman now and her husband gone to sea and her child dead most wet nurses have a child of their own and don't you think they must hate the stranger's child that parts them from their own now baby is a comfort to mary and the wet nurse is always a tyrant and i thought as this one has got into a habit of obeying me she might be more manageable and then as to her having been imprudent i know many ladies who have been obliged to shut their eyes a little why consider charles would good wives and good mothers leave their own children to nurse a stranger's would their husbands let them and i thought said she piteously we were so fortunate to get a young healthy girl imprudent but not vicious whose fault had been covered by marriage and then so attached to us both as she is poor thing sir charles was in no humor to make mountains of mole hills why my dear bella said he after all this is your department not mine yes but unless i please you in every department there is no happiness for me but you know you please me in everything and the more i look into anything the wiser i always think you you have chosen the best wet nurse possible send her to me lady bassett hesitated you will be kind to her you know the consequence if anything happens to make her fret baby will suffer for it oh i know catch me offending this she potentate till he is weaned dress for the journey my dear and send nurse to me lady bassett went into the next room and after a long time mary came to sir charles with baby in her arms mary had lost for a time some of her ruddy color but her skin was clearer and somehow her face was softened she looked really a beautiful and attractive young woman she courtesied to sir charles and then took a good look at him well nurse said he cheerfully here we are back again both of us that we be sir and she showed her white teeth in a broad smile la sir you be a sight for sore eyes how well you do look to be sure thank you mary i never was better in my life you look pretty well too only a little pale paler than lady bassett does i give my color to the child said mary simply she did not know she had said anything poetic but sir charles was so touched and pleased with her answer that he gave her a five pound note on the spot and he said we'll bring your color back if beef and beer and kindness can do it i ain't afeard o' that sir and i'll arn it 'tis a lovely boy sir and your very image inspection followed and something or other offended young master he began to cackle but this nurse did not take him away as mrs millar had she just sat down with him and nursed him openly with rustic composure and simplicity sir charles leaned his arm on the mantel piece and eyed the pair for all this was a new world of feeling to him his paid servant seemed to him to be playing the mother to his child somehow it gave him a strange twinge a sort of vicarious jealousy he felt for his bella but i think his own paternal pride in all its freshness was hurt a little too at last he shrugged his shoulders and was going out of the room with a hint to mary that she must wrap herself up for it would be an open carriage your own carriage sir and horses certainly and do all the folk know as we are coming sir charles laughed most likely gossip is not dead at huntercombe i dare say nurse's black eyes flashed all the village will be out i hope he will see us ride in the black hearted villain sir charles was too proud to let her draw him into that topic he went about his business lady bassett's carriage duly packed came round and lady bassett was ready soon afterward so was mrs millar so was baby imbedded now in a nest of lawn and lace and white fur they had to wait for nurse lady bassett explained sotto voce to her husband just at the last moment she was seized with a desire to wear a silk gown i gave her i argued with her but she only pouted i was afraid for baby it is very hard upon you dear her face and voice were so piteous that sir charles burst out laughing we must take the bitter along with the sweet don't you think the sweet rather predominates at present lady bassett explored his face with all her eyes my darling is happy now trifles cannot put him out i doubt if anything could shake me while i have you and our child as for that jade keeping us all waiting while she dons silk attire it is simply delicious i wish rolfe was here that is all ha ha ha mrs gosport appeared at last in a purple silk gown and marched to the carriage without the slightest sign of the discomfort she really felt but that was no wonder belonging as she did to a sex which can walk not only smiling but jauntily though dead lame on stilts as you may see any day in regent street sir charles with mock gravity ushered king baby and his attendants in first then lady bassett and got in last himself before they had gone a mile nurse no handed the child over to nurse no with a lofty condescension as who should say you suffice for porterage i the superior artist reserve myself for emergencies no received the invaluable bundle with meek complacency by and by nurse got fidgety and kept changing her position what is the matter mary said lady bassett kindly is the dress too tight no no my lady said mary sharply the gownd's all right and then she was quiet a little but she began again and then lady bassett whispered sir charles i think she wants to sit forward may i certainly not i'll change with her here mary try this side we shall have more room in the landau it is double with wide seats mary was gratified and amused herself looking out of the window indeed she was quiet for nearly half an hour at the expiration of that period the fit took her again she beckoned haughtily for baby which did come at her command as the song says she got tired of baby or something and handed him back again presently she was discovered to be crying general consternation universal but vague consolation lady bassett looked an inquiry at mrs millar mrs millar looked back assent lady bassett assumed the command and took off mary's shawl yes said she to mrs millar now mary be good it is too tight thus urged the idiot contracted herself by a mighty effort while lady bassett attacked the fastenings and with infinite difficulty they unhooked three bottom hooks the fierce burst open that followed and the awful chasm showed what gigantic strength vanity can command and how savagely abuse it to maltreat nature lady bassett loosened the stays too and a deep sigh of relief told the truth which the lying tongue had denied as it always does whenever the same question is put the shawl was replaced and comfort gained till they entered the town of staveleigh nurse instantly exchanged places with sir charles and took the child again he was her banner in all public places when they came up to the inn they were greeted with loud hurrahs it was market day the town was full of sir charles's tenants and other farmers his return had got wind and every farmer under fifty had resolved to ride with him into huntercombe when five or six all shouting together intimated this to sir charles he sent one of his people to order the butchers out to huntercombe with joints a score and then to gallop on with a note to his housekeeper and butler for those that ride so far with me must sup with me said he a sentiment that was much approved he took lady bassett and the women upstairs and rested them about an hour and then they started for huntercombe followed by some thirty farmers and a dozen towns people who had a mind for a lark and to sup at huntercombe hall for once the ride was delightful the carriage bowled swiftly along over a smooth road with often turf at the side and that enabled the young farmers to canter alongside without dusting the carriage party every man on horseback they overtook joined them some they met turned back with them and these were rewarded with loud cheers every eye in the carriage glittered and every cheek was more or less flushed by this uproarious sympathy so gallantly shown and the very thunder of so many horses' feet each carrying a friend was very exciting and glorious why before they got to the village they had fourscore horsemen at their backs as they got close to the village mary gosport held out her arms for young master this was not the time to forego her importance the church bells rang out a clashing peal the cavalcade clattered into the village everybody was out to cheer and at sight of baby the women's voices were as loud as the men's old pensioners of the house were out bareheaded one with hair white as snow was down on his knees praying a blessing on them lady bassett began to cry softly sir charles a little pale but firm as a rock both bowing right and left like royal personages and well they might every house in the village belonged to them but one on approaching that one mary gosport turned her head round and shot a glance round out of the tail of her eye ay there was richard bassett pale and gloomy half hid behind a tree at his gate but hate's quick eye discerned him at the moment of passing she suddenly lifted the child high and showed it him pretending to show it to the crowd but her eye told the tale for with that act of fierce hatred and cunning triumph those black orbs shot a colored gleam like a furious leopardess's a roar of cheers burst from the crowd at that inspired gesture of a woman whose face and eyes seemed on fire lady bassett turned pale the next moment they passed their own gate and dashed up to the hall steps of huntercombe sir charles sent lady bassett to her room for the night she walked through a row of ducking servants bowing and smiling like a gentle goddess mary gosport afraid to march in a long dress with the child for fear of accidents handed him superbly to millar and strutted haughtily after her mistress nodding patronage her follower the meek millar stopped often to show the heir right and left with simple geniality and kindness sir charles stood on the hall steps and invited all to come in and take pot luck already spits were turning before great fires a rump of beef legs of pork and pease puddings boiling in one copper turkeys and fowls in another joints and pies baking in the great brick ovens barrels of beer on tap and magnums of champagne and port marching steadily up from the cellars and forming in line and square upon sideboards and tables supper was laid in the hall the dining room the drawing room and the great kitchen poor villagers trickled in no man or woman was denied it was open house that night as it had been four hundred years ago chapter xxxii when sharpe's clerk retired after serving that writ on bassett bassett went to wheeler and treated it as a jest but wheeler looked puzzled and bassett himself on second thoughts said he should like advice of counsel accordingly they both went up to london to a solicitor and obtained an interview with a counsel learned in the law he heard their story and said the question is can you convince a jury he was insane at the time but he can't get into court said bassett i won't let him oh the court will make you produce him but i thought an insane person was civiliter mortuus and couldn't sue so he is but this man is not insane in law shutting up a man on certificates is merely a preliminary step to a fair trial by his peers whether he is insane or not take the parallel case of a felon a magistrate commits him for trial and generally on better evidence than medical certificates but that does not make the man a felon or disentitle him to a trial by his peers on the contrary it entitles him to a trial and he could get parliament to interfere if he was not brought to trial this plaintiff simply does what he will say you ought to have done he tries himself if he tries you at the same time that is your fault if he is insane now fight if he is not i advise you to discharge him on the instant and then compound wheeler said he was afraid the plaintiff was too vindictive to come to terms well then you can show you discharged him the moment you had reason to think he was cured and you must prove he was insane when you incarcerated him but i warn you it will be uphill work if he is sane now the jury will be apt to go by what they see bassett and wheeler retired the latter did not presume to differ but bassett was dissatisfied and irritated that fellow would only see the plaintiff's side said he the fool forgets there is an act of parliament and that we have complied with its provisions to a t then why did you not ask his construction of the act suggested wheeler because i don't want his construction i've read it and it is plain enough to anybody but a fool well i have consulted counsel to please you and now i'll go my own way to please myself he went to burdoch and struck a bargain and sir charles was to be shifted to burdoch's asylum and nobody allowed to see him there etc etc the old system in short than which no better has as yet been devised for perpetuating or even causing mental aberration rolfe baffled this as described and bassett was literally stunned he now saw that sir charles had an ally full of resources and resolution who could it be he began to tremble he complained to the police and set them to discover who had thus openly and audaciously violated the act of parliament and then he went and threatened dr suaby but rolfe and sir charles who loved suaby as he deserved had provided against that they had not let the doctor into their secret he therefore said with perfect truth that he had no hand in the matter and that sir charles being bound upon his honor not to escape from bellevue would be in the asylum still if mr bassett had not taken him out and invoked brute force in the shape of burdoch well sir said he it seems they have shown you two can play at that game and so bade him good afternoon very civilly bassett went home sickened he remained sullen and torpid for a day or two then he wrote to burdoch to send to london and try and recapture sir charles but next day he revoked his instructions for he got a letter from the commissioners of lunacy announcing the authoritative discharge of sir charles on the strong representation of dr suaby and other competent persons that settled the matter and the poor cousin had kept the rich cousin three months at his own expense with no solid advantage but the prospect of a lawsuit sharpe spurred by rolfe gave him no breathing time with the utmost expedition the declaration in bassett v bassett followed the writ it was short simple and in three counts for violently seizing and confining the plaintiff in a certain place on a false pretense that he was insane for detaining him in spite of evidence that he was not insane for endeavoring to remove him to another place with a certain sinister motive there specified by which several acts the plaintiff had suffered in his health and his worldly affairs and had endured great agony of mind and the plaintiff claimed damages ten thousand pounds bassett sent over for his friend wheeler and showed him the new document with no little consternation but their discussion of it was speedily interrupted by the clashing of triumphant bells and distant shouting they ran out to see what it was bassett half suspecting hung back but mary gosport's keen eye detected him and she held up the heir to him with hate and triumph blazing in her face he crept into his own house and sank into a chair foudroye wheeler however roused him to a necessary effort and next day they took the declaration to counsel to settle their defense in due form what is this said the learned gentleman three counts why i advised you to discharge him at once yes said wheeler and excellent advice it was but my client preferred to go his own road and now i am to cure the error i did what i could to prevent i dare say sir it is not the first time in your experience not by a great many clients in general have a great contempt for the notion that prevention is better than cure he can't hurt me said bassett impatiently he was separately examined by two doctors and all the provisions of the statute exactly complied with but that is no defense to this plaint the statute forbids you to imprison an insane person without certain precautions but it does not give you a right under any circumstances to imprison a sane man that was decided in butcher v butcher the defense you rely on was pleaded as a second plea and the plaintiff demurred to it directly the question was argued before the full court and the judges led by the first lawyer of the age decided unanimously that the provisions of the statute did not affect sane englishmen and their rights under the common law they ordered the plea to be struck off the record and the case was reduced to a simple issue of sane or insane butcher v butcher governs all these cases can you prove him insane if not you had better compound on any terms in butcher's case the jury gave pounds and the plaintiff was a man of very inferior position to sir charles bassett besides the defendant butcher had not persisted against evidence as you have they will award pounds at least in this case he took down a volume of reports and showed them the case he had cited and on reading the unanimous decision of the judges and the learning by which they were supported wheeler said at once mr bassett we might as well try to knock down st paul's with our heads as to go against this decision they then settled to put in a single plea that sir charles was insane at the time of his capture this done to gain time wheeler called on sharpe and after several conferences got the case compounded by an apology a solemn retractation in writing and the payment of four thousand pounds his counsel assured him his client was very lucky to get off so cheap bassett paid the money with the assistance of his wife's father but it was a sickener it broke his spirit and even injured his health for some time sir charles improved the village with the money and gave a copy hold tenement to each of the men bassett had got imprisoned so they and their sons and their grandsons lived rent free no now i think of it they had to pay four pence a year to the lord of the manor defeated at every point and at last punished severely richard bassett fell into a deep dejection and solitary brooding of a sort very dangerous to the reason he would not go out of doors to give his enemies a triumph he used to sit by the fire and mutter blow upon blow blow upon blow my poor boy will never be lord of huntercombe now and so on wheeler pitied him but could not rouse him at last a person for whose narrow attainments and simplicity he had a profound though to do him justice a civil contempt ventured to his rescue mrs bassett went crying to her father and told him she feared the worst if richard's mind could not be diverted from the huntercombe estate and his hatred of sir charles and lady bassett which had been the great misfortune of her life and of his own but nothing would ever eradicate it richard had great abilities was a linguist a wonderful accountant could her dear father find him some profitable employment to divert his thoughts what all in a moment said the old man then i shall have to buy it and if i go on like this i shall not have much to leave you having delivered this objection he went up to london and having many friends in the city and laying himself open to proposals he got scent at last of a new insurance company that proposed also to deal in reversions especially to entailed estates by prompt purchase of shares in bassett's name and introducing bassett himself who by special study had a vast acquaintance with entailed estates and a genius for arithmetical calculation he managed somehow to get him into the direction with a stipend and a commission on all business he might introduce to the office bassett yielded sullenly and now divided his time between london and the country wheeler worked with him on a share of commission and they made some money between them after the bitter lesson he had received bassett vowed to himself he never would attack sir charles again unless he was sure of victory for all this he hated him and lady bassett worse than ever hated them to the death he never moved a finger down at huntercombe nor said a word but in london he employed a private inquirer to find out where lady bassett had lived at the time of her confinement and whether any clergyman had visited her the private inquirer could find out nothing and bassett comparing his advertisements with his performance dismissed him for a humbug but the office brought him into contact with a great many medical men one after another he used to say to each stranger with an insidious smile i think you once attended my cousin lady bassett chapter xxxiii sir charles and lady bassett relieved of their cousin's active enmity led a quiet life and one that no longer furnished striking incidents but dramatic incident is not everything character and feeling show themselves in things that will not make pictures now it was precisely during this reposeful period that three personages of this story exhibited fresh traits of feeling and also of character to begin with sir charles bassett he came back from the asylum much altered in body and mind stopping his cigars had improved his stomach working in the garden had increased his muscular power and his cheeks were healthy and a little sunburned instead of sallow his mind was also improved contemplation of insane persons had set him by a natural recoil to study self control he had returned a philosopher no small thing could irritate him now so far his character was elevated lady bassett was much the same as before except a certain restlessness she wanted to be told every day or twice a day that her husband was happy and although he was visibly so yet as he was quiet over it she used to be always asking him if he was happy this the reader must interpret as he pleases mary gosport gave herself airs respectful to her master and mistress but not so tolerant of chaff in the kitchen as she used to be made an example of one girl who threw a doubt on her marriage complained to lady bassett affected to fret and the girl was dismissed she turned singer she had always sung psalms in church but never a profane note in the house now she took to singing over her nursling she had a voice of prodigious power and mellowness and provided she was not asked would sing lullabies and nursery rhymes from another county that ravished the hearer horsemen have been known to stop in the road to hear her sing through an open window of huntercombe two hundred yards off old mr meyrick a farmer well to do fascinated by mary gosport's singing asked her to be his housekeeper when she should have done nursing her charge she laughed in his face a fanatic who was staying with sir charles bassett offered her three years' education in do ra mi fa preparatory to singing at the opera declined without thanks mr drake after hovering shyly at last found courage to reproach her for deserting him and marrying a sailor teach you not to shilly shally said she beauty won't go a begging mind you look sharper next time this dialogue being held in the kitchen gave the women some amusement at the young farmer's expense one day mr richard bassett from motives of pure affection no doubt not curiosity desired mightily to inspect mr bassett aged eight months and two days so in his usual wily way he wrote to mrs gosport asking her for old acquaintance' sake to meet him in the meadow at the end of the lawn this meadow belonged to sir charles but richard bassett had a right of way through it and could step into it by a postern as mary could by an iron gate he asked her to come at eleven o'clock because at that hour he observed she walked on the lawn with her charge mary gosport came to the tryst but without mr bassett richard was very polite she cold taciturn observant at last he said but where's the little heir she flew at him directly it is him you wanted not me did you think i'd bring him here for you to kill him come i say ay you'd kill him if you had a chance but you never shall or if you didn't kill him you'd cast the evil eye on him for you are well known to have the evil eye no he shall outlive thee and thine and be lord of these here manors when thou is gone to hell thou villain mr richard bassett turned pale but did the wisest thing he could put his hands in his pockets and walked into his own premises followed however by mary gosport who stormed at him till he shut his postern in her face she stood there trembling for a little while then walked away crying but having a mind like running water she was soon seated on a garden chair singing over her nursling like a mavis she had delivered him to millar while she went to speak her mind to her old lover as for richard bassett he was theory bitten and so turned every thing one way to be sure as long as the woman's glaring eyes and face distorted by passion were before him he interpreted her words simply but when he thought the matter over he said to himself the evil eye that is all bosh the girl is in lady bassett's secrets and i am not to see young master some day i shall know the reason why sir charles bassett now belonged to the tribe of clucking cocks quite as much as his cousin had ever done only sir charles had the good taste to confine his clucks to his own first floor here to be sure he richly indemnified himself for his self denial abroad he sat for hours at a time watching the boy on the ground at his knee or in his nurse's arms and while he watched the infant with undisguised delight lady bassett would watch him with a sort of furtive and timid complacency yet at times she suffered from twinges of jealousy a new complaint with her i think i have mentioned that sir charles at first was annoyed at seeing his son and heir nursed by a woman of low condition well he got over that feeling by degrees and as soon as he did get over it his sentiments took quite an opposite turn a woman for whom he did very little in his opinion since what in heaven's name were a servant's wages he saw that woman do something great for him saw her nourish his son and heir from her own veins the child had no other nurture yet the father saw him bloom and thrive and grow surprisingly a weak observer or a less enthusiastic parent might have overlooked all this but sir charles had naturally an observant eye and an analytical mind and this had been suddenly but effectually developed by the asylum and his correspondence with rolfe he watched the nurse then and her maternal acts with a curious and grateful eye and a certain reverence for her power he observed too that his child reacted on the woman she had never sung in the house before now she sang ravishingly sang in low mellow yet sonorous notes some ditties that had lulled mediaeval barons in their cradles and what had made her vocal made her beautiful at times before she had appeared to him a handsome girl with the hardish look of the lower classes but now when she sat in a sunny window and lowered her black lashes on her nursling with the mixed and delicious smile of an exuberant nurse relieving and relieved she was soft poetical sculptorial maternal womanly this species of contemplation though half philosophical half paternal and quite innocent gave lady bassett some severe pangs she hid them however only she bided her time and then suggested the propriety of weaning baby but mrs gosport got sir charles's ear and told him what magnificent children they reared in her village by not weaning infants till they were eighteen months old or so by this means and by crying to lady bassett and representing her desolate condition with a husband at sea she obtained a reprieve coupled however with a good humored assurance from sir charles that she was the greatest baby of the two when the inevitable hour approached that was to dethrone her she took to reading the papers and one day she read of a disastrous wreck the carbrea castle only seven saved out of a crew of twenty three she read the details carefully and two days afterward she received a letter written by a shipmate of mr gosport's in a handwriting not very unlike her own relating the sad wreck of the carbrea castle and the loss of several good sailors james gosport for one then the house was filled with the wailing and weeping of the bereaved widow and at last came consolers and raised doubts but then somebody remembered to have seen the loss of that very ship in the paper the paper was found and the fatal truth was at once established upon this mr bassett was weaned as quickly as possible and the widow clothed in black at lady bassett's expense and everything in reason done to pet her and console her but she cried bitterly and said she would throw herself into the sea and follow her husband huntercombe was nowhere near the coast at last however she relented and concluded to remain on earth as dry nurse to mr bassett sir charles did not approve this it seemed unreasonable to turn a wet nurse into a dry nurse when that office was already occupied by a person her senior and more experienced lady bassett agreed with him but shrugged her shoulders and said two nurses will not hurt and i suspect it will not be for long mary does not feel her husband's loss one bit surely you are mistaken she howls loud enough too loud much said lady bassett dryly her perspicuity was not deceived in a very short time mr meyrick unable to get her for his housekeeper offered her marriage what said she and james gosport not dead a month say the word now and take your own time said he well i might do worse said she about six weeks after this drake came about her and in tender tones of consolation suggested that it is much better for a pretty girl to marry one who plows the land than one who plows the sea that is true said mary with a sigh i have found it to my sorrow after this drake played a bit with her and then relented and one evening offered her marriage expecting her to jump eagerly at his offer you be too late young man said she coolly i'm bespoke doan't ye say that how can ye be bespoke why t'other hain't been dead four months yet what o' that this one spoke for me within a week why our banns are to be cried to morrow come to church and hear 'em that will learn ye not to shilly shally so next time next time cried drake half blubbering then with a sudden roar what be you coming to market again arter this like enough he is a deal older than i be 'tis mr meyrick if ye must know now mr meyrick was well to do and so drake was taken aback mr meyrick said he and turned suddenly respectful but presently a view of a rich widow flitted before his eye well said he you shan't throw it in my teeth again as i speak too late i ask you now and no time lost what am i to stop my banns and jilt farmer meyrick for thee nay nay but i mean i'll marry you if you'll marry me as soon as ever the breath is out of that dall'd old hunks's body well well will drake said mary gravely if i do outlive this one and you bain't married long afore and if you keeps in the same mind as you be now and lets me know it in good time i'll see about it she gave a flounce that made her petticoats whisk like a mare's tail and off to the kitchen where she related the dialogue with an appropriate reflection the company containing several of either sex dilly dally and shilly shally they belongs to us as women be i hate and despise a man as can't make up his mind in half a minnut so the widow gosport became mrs meyrick and lived in a farmhouse not quite a mile from the hall she used often to come to the hall and take a peep at her lamb this was the name she gave mr bassett long after he had ceased to be a child about four years after the triumphant return to huntercombe lady bassett conceived a sudden coldness toward the little boy though he was universally admired she concealed this sentiment from sir charles but not from the female servants and from one to another at last it came round to sir charles he disbelieved it utterly at first but the hint having been given him he paid attention and discovered there was at all events some truth in it he awaited his opportunity and remonstrated my dear bella am i mistaken or do i really observe a falling off in your tenderness for your child lady bassett looked this way and that as if she meditated flight but at last she resigned herself and said yes dear charles my heart is quite cold to him good heavens bella but why is not this the same little angel that came to our help in trouble that comforted me even before his birth when my mind was morbid to say the least i suppose he is the same said she in a tone impossible to convey by description of mine that is a strange answer if he is i am changed and this she said doggedly and unlike herself what said sir charles very gravely and with a sort of awe can a woman withdraw her affection from her child her innocent child if so my turn may come next oh charles charles and the tears began to well why who can be secure after this what is so stable as a mother's love if that is not rooted too deep for gusts of caprice to blow it away in heaven's name what is no answer to that but tears sir charles looked at her very long attentively and seriously and said not another syllable but his dropping so suddenly a subject of this importance was rather suspicious and lady bassett was too shrewd not to see that they watched each other but with this difference sir charles could not conceal his anxiety whereas the lady appeared quite tranquil one day sir charles said cheerfully who do you think dines here to morrow and stays all night dr suaby by invitation dear asked lady bassett quietly sir charles colored a little and said quietly yes lady bassett made no remark and it was impossible to tell by her face whether the visit was agreeable or not some time afterward however she said whom shall i ask to meet dr suaby nobody for heaven's sake will not that be dull for him i hope not you will have plenty to say to him eh darling we never yet lacked topics whether or no his is a mind i choose to drink neat drink him neat undiluted with rural minds oh she uttered that monosyllable very dryly and said no more dr suaby came next day and dined with them and lady bassett was charming but rather earlier than usual she said now i am sure you and dr suaby must have many things to talk about and retired casting back an arch and almost a cunning smile the door closed on her the smile fled and a somber look of care and suffering took its place sir charles entered at once on what was next his heart told dr suaby he was in some anxiety and asked him if he had observed anything in lady bassett nothing new said dr suaby charming as ever then sir charles confided to dr suaby in terms of deep feeling and anxiety what i have coldly told the reader dr suaby looked a little grave and took time to think before he spoke at last he delivered an opinion of which this is the substance though not the exact words it is sudden and unnatural and i cannot say it does not partake of mental aberration if the patient was a man i should fear the most serious results but here we have to take into account the patient's sex her nature and her present condition lady bassett has always appeared to me a very remarkable woman she has no mediocrity in anything understanding keen perception wonderfully swift heart large and sensitive nerves high strung sensibilities acute a person of her sex tuned so high as this is always subject more or less to hysteria it is controlled by her intelligence and spirit but she is now for the time being in a physical condition that has often deranged less sensitive women than she is i believe this about the boy to be a hysterical delusion which will pass away when her next child is born that is to say she will probably ignore her first born and everything else for a time but these caprices springing in reality from the body rather than the mind cannot endure forever when she has several grown up children the first born will be the favorite it comes to that at last my good friend these are the words of wisdom said sir charles god bless you for them after a while he said then what you advise is simply patience no i don't say that with such a large house as this and your resources you might easily separate them before the delusion grows any farther why risk a calamity a calamity and sir charles began to tremble she is only cold to the child as yet she might go farther and fancy she hated it obsta principiis that is my motto not that i really think for a moment the child is in danger lady bassett has mind to control her nerves with but why run the shadow of a chance i will not run the shadow of a chance said sir charles resolutely let us come upstairs my decision is taken the very next day sir charles called on mrs meyrick and asked if he could come to any arrangement with her to lodge mr bassett and his nurse under her roof the boy wants change of air said he mrs meyrick jumped at the proposal but declined all terms no said she the child i have suckled shall never pay me for his lodging why should he sir when i'd pay you to let him come if i wasn't afeard of offending you sir charles was touched at this and being a gentleman of tact said you are very good well then i must remain your debtor for the present he then took his leave but she walked with him a few yards just as far as the wicket gate that separated her little front garden from the high road i hope said she my lady will come and see me when my lamb is with me a sight of her would be good for sore eyes she have never been here but once and then she did not get out of her carriage humph said sir charles apologetically she seldom goes out now you understand oh i've heard sir and i do put up my prayers for her for my lady has been a good friend to me sir and if you will believe me i often sets here and longs for a sight of her and her sweet eyes and her hair like sunshine that i've had in my hand so often well sir i hope it will be a girl this time a little girl with golden hair that's what i wants this time they'll be the prettiest pair in england with all my heart said sir charles girl or boy i don't care which but i'd give a few thousands if it was here and the mother safe he hurried away ashamed of having uttered the feelings of his heart to a farmer's wife to avoid discussion he sent mrs millar and the boy off all in a hurry and then told lady bassett what he had done she appeared much distressed at that and asked what she had done he soothed her and said she was not to blarne at all and she must not blame him either he had done it for the best after all you are the master said she submissively i am said he and men will be tyrants you know then she flung her arm round her tyrant's neck and there was an end of the discussion one day he inquired for her and heard to his no small satisfaction she had driven to mrs meyrick's with a box of things for mr bassett she stayed at the farmhouse all day and sir charles felt sure he had done the right thing mrs meyrick found out to her cost the difference between a nursling and a rampageous little boy her lamb as she called him was now a young monkey vigorous active restless and unfortunately as strong on his pins as most boys of six it took two women to look after him and smart ones too so swiftly did he dash off into some mischief or other at last mrs meyrick simplified matters in some degree by locking the large gate and even the small wicket and ordering all the farm people and milkmaids to keep an eye on him and bring him straight to her if he should stray for he seemed to hate in doors never was such a boy nevertheless such as had not the care of him admired the child for his beauty and his assurance he seemed to regard the whole human race as one family of which he was the rising head the moment he caught sight of a human being he dashed at it and into conversation by one unbroken movement now children in general are too apt to hide their intellectual treasures from strangers by shyness one day this ready converser was standing on the steps of the house when a gentleman came to the wicket gate and looked over into the garden young master darted to the gate directly and getting his foot on the lowest bar and his hands on the spikes gave tongue who are you i'm mr bassett i don't live here i'm only staying my home is huncom hall i'm to have it for myself when papa dies i didn't know dat till i come here how old are you i'm half past four a loud scream a swift rustle and mr bassett was clutched up by mrs meyrick who snatched him away with a wild glance of terror and defiance and bore him swiftly into the house with words ringing in her ears that cost mr bassett dear he being the only person she could punish she sat down on a bench flung young master across her knee in a minute and bestowed such a smacking on him as far transcended his wildest dreams of the weight power and pertinacity of the human arm the words richard bassett had shot her flying with were these too late i've seen the parson's brat richard bassett mounted his horse and rode over to wheeler for he could no longer wheedle the man of law over to highmore and i will very briefly state why st about three years ago an old lady one of his few clients left him three thousand pounds just reward of a very little law and a vast deal of gossip d the head solicitor of the place got old and wanted a partner wheeler bought himself in and thenceforth took his share of a good business and by his energy enlarged it though he never could found one for himself d he married a wife th she was a pretty woman and blessed with jealousy of a just and impartial nature she was equally jealous of women men books business anything that took her husband from her no more sleeping out at highmore no more protracted potations no more bachelor tricks for wheeler he still valued his old client and welcomed him but the venue was changed so to speak richard bassett was kept waiting in the outer office but when he did get in he easily prevailed on wheeler to send the next client or two to his partner and give him a full hearing then he opened his business well said he i've seen him at last seen him seen whom the boy they have set up to rob my boy of the estate i've seen him wheeler seen him close and he's as black as my hat chapter xxxiv wheeler instead of being thunder stricken said quietly oh is he well sir charles is lighter than i am lady bassett has a skin like satin and red hair red say auburn gilt i never saw such lovely hair well said richard impatiently then the boy has eyes like sloes and a brown skin like an italian and black hair almost it will be quite well said wheeler it is not so very uncommon for a dark child to be born of fair parents or vice versa i once saw an urchin that was like neither father nor mother but the image of his father's grandfather that died eighty years before he was born they used to hold him up to the portrait said bassett will you admit that it is uncommon not so uncommon as for a high bred lady living in the country and adored by her husband to trifle with her marriage vow for that is what you are driving at then we have to decide between two improbabilities will you grant me that mr wheeler yes then suppose i can prove fact upon fact and coincidence upon coincidence all tending one way are you so prejudiced that nothing will convince you no but it will take a great deal that lady's face is full of purity and she fought us like one who loved her husband fronti nulla fides and as for her fighting her infidelity was the weapon she defeated us with will you hear me yes yes but pray stick to facts and not conjectures then don't interrupt me with childish arguments fact both reputed parents fair the boy as black as the ace of spades fact a handsome young fellow was always buzzing about her ladyship and he was a parson and ladies are remarkably fond of parsons fact this parson was of italian breed dark like the boy fact this dark young man left huntercombe one week and my lady left it the next and they were both in the city of bath at one time fact the lady went from bath to london the dark young man went from bath to london none of this is new to me said wheeler quietly no but it is the rule in estimating coincidences that each fresh one multiplies the value of the others now the boy looking so italian is a new coincidence and so is what i am going to tell you at last i have found the medical man who attended lady bassett in london ah yes sir and i have learned fact her ladyship rented a house but hired no servants and engaged no nurse she had no attendant but a lady's maid no servant but a sort of charwoman fact she dismissed this doctor unusually soon and gave him a very large fee fact she concealed her address from her husband oh can you prove that certainly sir charles came up to town and had to hunt for her came to this very medical man and asked for the address his wife had not given him but lo when he got there the bird was flown fact following the same system of concealment my lady levanted from london within ten days of her confinement now put all these coincidences together don't you see that she had a lover and that he was about her in london and other places stop fact those two were married for years and had no child but this equivocal one and now four years and a half have passed during all which time they have had none and the young parson has been abroad during that period wheeler was staggered and perplexed by this artful array of coincidences now advise me said bassett it is not so easy of course if sir charles was to die you could claim the estate and give them a great deal of pain and annoyance but the burden of proof would always rest on you my advice is not to breathe a syllable of this but get a good detective and push your inquiries a little further among house agents and the women they put into houses find that charwoman and see if you can pick up anything more do you know such a thing as an able detective i know one that will work if i instruct him instruct him then i will chapter xxxv lady bassett as her time of trial drew near became despondent she spoke of the future and tried to pierce it and in all these little loving speculations and anxieties there was no longer any mention of herself this meant that she feared her husband was about to lose her i put the fear in the very form it took in that gentle breast possessed with this dread so natural to her situation she set her house in order and left her little legacies of clothes and jewels without the help of a lawyer for sir charles she knew would respect her lightest wish to him she left her all except these trifles and above all a manuscript book it was the history of her wedded life not the bare outward history but such a record of a sensitive woman's heart as no male writer's pen can approach it was the nature of her face and her tongue to conceal but here on this paper she laid bare her heart here her very subtlety operated not to hide but to dissect herself and her motives but oh what it cost her to pen this faithful record of her love her trials her doubts her perplexities her agonies her temptations and her crime often she laid down the pen and hid her face in her hands often the scalding tears ran down that scarlet face often she writhed at her desk and wrote on sighing and moaning yet she persevered to the end it was the grave that gave her the power when he reads this she said i shall be in my tomb men make excuses for the dead my charles will forgive me when i am gone he will know i loved him to desperation it took her many days to write it was quite a thick quarto so much may a woman feel in a year or two and need i say that to the reader of that volume the mystery of her conduct was all made clear as daylight clearer far as regards the revelation of mind and feeling than i dealer in broad facts shall ever make it for want of a woman's mental microscope and delicate brush and when this record was finished she wrapped it in paper and sealed it with many seals and wrote on it only for my husband's eye from her who loved him not wisely but too well and she took other means that even the superscription should never be seen of any other eye but his it was some little comfort to her when the book was written she never prayed to live but she used to pray fervently piteously that her child might live and be a comfort and joy to his father the person employed by wheeler discovered the house agent and the woman he had employed but these added nothing to the evidence bassett had collected at last however this woman under the influence of a promised reward discovered a person who was likely to know more about the matter viz the woman who was in the house with lady bassett at the very time but this woman scented gold directly so she held mysterious language declined to say a word to the officer but intimated that she knew a great deal and that the matter was in truth well worth looking into and she could tell some strange tales if it was worth her while this information was sent to bassett he replied that the woman only wanted money for her intelligence and he did not blame her he would see her next time he went to town and felt sure she would complete his chain of evidence this put richard bassett into extravagant spirits he danced his little boy on his knee and said i'll run this little horse against the parson's brat five to one and no takers indeed his exultation was so loud and extravagant that it jarred on gentle mrs bassett as for jessie the scotch servant she shook her head and said the master was fey in the morning he started for london still so exuberant and excited that the scotch woman implored her mistress not to let him go there would be an accident on the railway or something but mrs bassett knew her husband too well to interfere with his journeys before he drove off he demanded his little boy he must kiss me said he for i'm going to work for him d'ye hear that jane this day makes him heir of huntercombe and bassett the nurse brought word that master bassett was not very well this morning let us look at him said bassett he got out of his gig and went to the nursery he found his little boy had a dry cough with a little flushing it is not much said he but i'll send the doctor over from the town he did so and himself proceeded up to london the doctor came and finding the boy labored in breathing administered a full dose of ipecacuanha this relieved the child for the time but about four in the afternoon he was distressed again and began to cough with a peculiar grating sound then there was a cry of dismay the croup the doctor was gone for and a letter posted to richard bassett urging him to come back directly the doctor tried everything even mercury but could not check the fatal discharge it stiffened into a still more fatal membrane when bassett returned next afternoon in great alarm he found the poor child thrusting its fingers into its mouth in a vain attempt to free the deadly obstruction a warm bath and strong emetics were now administered and great relief obtained the patient even ate and drank and asked leave to get up and play with a new toy he had but as often happens in this disorder a severe relapse soon came with a spasm of the glottis so violent and prolonged that the patient at last resigned the struggle then pain ceased forever the heavenly smile came the breath went and nothing was left in the little white bed but a fair piece of tinted clay that must return to the dust and carry thither all the pride the hopes the boasts of the stricken father who had schemed and planned and counted without him in whose hands are the issues of life and death as for the child himself his lot was a happy one if we could but see what the world is really worth he was always a bright child that never cried nor complained his first trouble was his last one day's pain then bliss eternal he never got poisoned by his father's spirit of hate but loved and was beloved during his little lifetime and dying he passed from his noah's ark to an inheritance a thousand times richer than huntercombe bassett and all his cousin's lands the little grave was dug the bell tolled and a man bowed double with grief saw his child and his ambition laid in the dust lady bassett heard the bell tolled and spoke but two words poor woman she might well say so mrs bassett was in the same condition as herself yet this heavy blow must fall on her as for richard bassett he sat at home bowed down and stupid with grief wheeler came one day to console him but at the sight of him refrained from idle words he sat down by him for an hour in silence then he got up and said good by thank you old friend for not insulting me said bassett in a broken voice wheeler took his hand and turned away his head and so went away with a tear in his eye a fortnight after this he came again and found bassett in the same attitude but not in the same leaden stupor on the contrary he was in a state of tremor he had lost under the late blow the sanguine mind that used to carry him through everything the doctor was upstairs and his wife's fate trembled in the balance stay by me said he for all my nerve is gone i'm afraid i shall lose her for i have just begun to value her and that is how god deals with his creatures the merciful god as they call him wheeler thought it rather hard god almighty should be blamed because dick bassett had taken eight years to find out his wife's merit but he forbore to say so he said kindly that he would stay now while they sat in trying suspense the church bells struck up a merry peal bassett started violently and his eyes gave a strange glare that's the other said he for he had heard about lady bassett by this time then he turned pale they ring for him then they are sure to toll for me this foreboding was natural enough in a man so blinded by egotism as to fancy that all creation and the creator himself must take a side in bassett v bassett nevertheless events did not justify that foreboding the bells had scarcely done ringing for the happy event at huntercombe when joyful feet were heard running on the stairs joyful voices clashed together in the passage and in came a female servant with joyful tidings mrs bassett was safe and the child in the world the loveliest little girl you ever saw a girl cried richard bassett with contemptuous amazement even his melancholy forebodings had not gone that length and what have they got at huntercombe oh it is a boy sir there of course the ringers heard and sent one of their number to ask him if they should ring what for asked bassett with a nasty glittering eye and then with sudden fury he seized a large piece of wood from the basket to fling at his insulter i'll teach you to come and mock me the ringer vanished ducking gently said wheeler gently bassett chucked the wood back into the basket and sat down gloomily saying then how dare he come and talk about ringing bells for a girl to think that i should have all this fright and my wife all this trouble for a girl it was no time to talk of business then but about a fortnight afterward wheeler said i took the detective off to save you expense quite right said bassett wearily i gave you the woman's address so the matter is in your hands now i consider yes said bassett wearily move no further in it certainly not and frankly i should be glad to see you abandon it i have abandoned it why should i stir the mud now i and mine are thrown out forever the only question is shall a son of sir charles or the parson's son inherit i'm for the wrongful heir ay he cried starting up and beating the air with his fists in sudden fury since the right bassetts are never to have it let the wrong bassetts be thrown out at all events i'm on my back but sir charles is no better off a bastard will succeed him thanks to that cursed woman who defeated me this turn took wheeler by surprise it also gave him real pain bassett said he i pity you what sort of a life has yours been for the last eight years yet when there's no fuel left for war and hatred you blow the embers you are incurable i am said richard i'll hate those two with my last breath and curse them in my last prayer chapter xxxvi lady bassett's forebodings like most of our insights into the future were confuted by the event she became the happy mother of a flaxen haired boy she insisted on nursing him herself and the experienced persons who attended her raised no objection in connection with this she gave sir charles a peck not very severe but sudden and remarkable as the only one on record he was contemplating her and her nursling with the deepest affection and happened to say my own bella what delight it gives me to see you yes said she we will have only one mother this time will we my darling and it shall be me then suddenly turning her head like a snake oh i saw the looks you gave that woman this was the famous peck administered in return for a look that he had bestowed on mary gosport not more than five years ago sir charles would doubtless have bled to death on the spot but either he had never been aware how he looked or time and business had obliterated the impression for he was unaffectedly puzzled and said what woman do you mean dear no matter darling said lady bassett who had already repented her dire severity all i say is that a nurse is a rival i could not endure now and another thing i do believe those wet nurses give their disposition to the child it is dreadful to think of well if so baby is safe he will be the most amiable boy in england he shall be more amiable than i am scolding my husband of husbands and she leaned toward him baby and all for a kiss from his lips we say at school seniores priores let favor go by seniority but where babies adorn the scene it is juniores priores with that sex to which the very young are confided to this rule as might be expected lady bassett furnished no exception she was absorbed in baby and trusted mr bassett a good deal to his attendant who bore an excellent character for care and attention now mr bassett was strong on his pins and in his will and his nurse maid after all was young so he used to take his walks nearly every day to mrs meyrick's she petted him enough and spoiled him in every way while the nurse maid was flirting with the farm servants out of sight sir charles bassett was devoted to the boy and used always to have him to his study in the morning and to the drawing room after dinner when the party was small and that happened much oftener now than heretofore but at other hours he did not look after him being a business man and considering him at that age to be under his mother's care one day the only guest was mr rolfe he was staying in the house for three days upon a condition suggested by himself viz that he might enjoy his friends' society in peace and comfort and not be set to roll the stone of conversation up some young lady's back and obtain monosyllables in reply faintly lisped amid a clatter of fourteen knives and forks as he would not leave his writing table on any milder terms they took him on these after dinner in came mr bassett erect and a proud nurse with little compton just able to hold his nurse's gown and toddle rolfe did not care for small children he just glanced at the angelic fair haired infant but his admiring gaze rested on the elder boy why what is here an oriental prince the boy ran to him directly who are you rolfe the writer who are you the gipsy king no but i am very fond of gypsies i'm mister bassett and when papa dies i shall be sir charles bassett sir charles laughed at this with paternal fatuity especially as the boy's name happened to be reginald francis after his grandfather rolfe smiled satirically for these little speeches from children did much to reconcile him to his lot meantime said he let us feed off him for it may be forty years before we can dance over his grave first let us see what is the unwholesomest thing on the table he rose and to the infinite delight of mr bassett and even of master compton who pointed and crowed from his mother's lap he got up on his chair and put on a pair of spectacles to look eureka said he behold that dish by lady bassett those are marrons glaces fetch them here and let us go in for a fit of the gout at once gout what's that inquired mr bassett don't ask me you don't know not know what didn't i tell you i was rolfe the writer writers know everything that is what makes them so modest mr bassett was now unnaturally silent for five minutes munching chestnuts this enabled his guests to converse but as soon as he had cleared his plate he cut right across the conversation with that savage contempt for all topics but his own which characterizes gentlemen of his age and says he to rolfe you know everything then what's a parson's brat well that's the one thing i don't know said rolfe but a brat i take to be a boy who interrupts ladies and gentlemen with nonsense when they are talking sense i am very much obliged to you mr rolfe said lady bassett that remark was very much needed then she called reginald to her and lectured him sotto voce to the same tune you old bachelors are rather hard said sir charles not very well pleased we are obliged to be you parents are so soft after all it is no wonder what a superb boy it is here is nurse i'm so sorry now we shall be cabined cribbed confined to rational conversation and i shall not be expected to good night little flaxen angel good by handsome and loquacious demon kiss and be friends expected to know all in a minute what is a parson's brat by the by talking of parsons what has become of angelo he has been away a good many years consumption i hear he was a fine built fellow too was he not lady bassett i don't know but he was beautifully strong i think i see him now carrying dear charles in his arms all down the garden ah you see he was raised in a university that does not do things by halves but trains both body and mind as they did at athens for the union of study and athletic sports is spoken of as a novelty but it is only a return to antiquity here letters were brought by the second post sir charles glanced at his and sent them to his study lady bassett had but one she said may i to both gentlemen and then opened it how strange said she it is from mr angelo just a line to say he is coming home quite cured she began this composedly but blushed afterward blushed quite red may i said she and tossed it delicately half way to rolfe he handed it to sir charles some remarks were then made about the coincidence and nothing further passed worth recording at that time next day lady bassett with instinctive curiosity asked master reginald how he came to put such a question as that to mr rolfe because i wanted to know but what put such words into your head i never heard a gentleman say such words and you must never say them again reginald tell me what it means and i won't said he oh said lady bassett since you bargain with me sir i must bargain with you tell me first where you ever heard such words when i was staying at nurse's ah that was jolly you like that better than being here yes i am sorry for that well dear did nurse say that surely not oh no it was the man what man why the man that came to the gate one morning and talked to me and i talked to him and that nasty nurse ran out and caught us and carried me in and gave me such a hiding and all for nothing a hiding what words the poor child picks up but i don't understand why nurse should beat you for speaking to the man she said he was a bad man and she would kill me if ever i spoke to him again oh it was a bad man and said bad words to somebody he was quarreling with no he said them to nurse because she took me away what did he say reginald asked lady bassett becoming very grave and thoughtful all at once he said 'that's too late i've seen the parson's brat' oh and i've asked nurse again and again what it meant but she won't tell me she only says the man is a liar and i am not to say it again and so i never did say it again for a long time but last night when rolfe the writer said he knew everything it struck my head what is the matter mamma nothing nothing you look so white are you ill mamma and he went to put his arms round her which was a mighty rare thing with him she trembled a good deal and did not either embrace him or repel him she only trembled after some time she recovered herself enough to say in a voice and with a manner that impressed itself at once on this sharp boy reginald your nurse was quite right understand this the man was your enemy and mine the words he said you must not say again it would be like taking up dirt and flinging some on your own face and some on mine i won't do that said the boy firmly are you afraid of the man that you look so white a man with a woman's tongue who can help fearing don't you be afraid as soon as i'm big enough i'll kill him lady bassett looked with surprise at the child he uttered this resolve with such a steady resolution she drew him to her and kissed him on the forehead no reginald said she we must not shed blood it is as wicked to kill our enemies as to kill any one else but never speak to him never even listen to him if he tries to speak to you run away from him and don't let him he is our enemy that same day she went to mrs meyrick to examine her but she found the boy had told her all there was to tell mrs meyrick whose affection for her was not diminished was downright vexed dear me said she i did think i had kept that from vexing of you to think of the dear child hiding it for nigh two years and then to blurt it out like that nobody heard him i hope others heard but didn't heed the lord be praised for that mary said lady bassett solemnly i am not equal to another battle with mr richard bassett and such a battle better tell all and die don't think of it said mary you're safe from richard bassett now times are changed since he came spying to my gate his own boy is gone you have got two he'll lie still if you do but if you tell your tale he must hear on't and he'll tell his for god's sake my lady keep close it is the curse of women that they can't just hold their tongues and see how things turn and is this a time to spill good liquor look at sir charles why he is another man he have got flesh on his bones now and color into his cheeks and 'twas you and i made a man of him it is my belief you'd never have had this other little angel but for us having sense and courage to see what must be done knock down our own work and send him wild again and give that richard bassett a handle you'll never be so mad lady bassett replied the other answered and so powerfully that lady bassett yielded and went home sick at heart but helpless and in a sea of doubt mr angelo did not call sir charles asked lady bassett if he had called on her she said no that is odd said sir charles perhaps he thinks we ought to welcome him home write and ask him to dinner yes dear or you can write very well i will no i will call sir charles called and welcomed him home and asked him to dinner angelo received him rather stiffly at first but accepted his invitation he came looking a good deal older and graver but almost as handsome as ever only somewhat changed in mind he had become a zealous clergyman and his soul appeared to be in his work he was distant and very respectful to lady bassett i might say obsequious seemed almost afraid of her at first that wore off in a few months but he was never quite so much at his ease with her as he had been before he left some years ago and so did time roll on every morning and every night lady bassett used to look wistfully at sir charles and say are you happy dear are you sure you are happy and he used always to say and with truth that he was the happiest man in england thanks to her then she used to relax the wild and wistful look with which she asked the question and give a sort of sigh half content half resignation in due course another fine boy came and filled the royal office of baby in his turn but my story does not follow him reginald was over ten years old and compton nearly six they were as different in character as complexion both remarkable boys reginald sir charles's favorite was a wonderful boy for riding running talking and had a downright genius for melody he whistled to the admiration of the village and latterly he practiced the fiddle in woods and under hedges being aided and abetted therein by a gypsy boy whom he loved and who indeed provided the instrument he rode with sir charles and rather liked him his brother he never noticed except to tease him lady bassett he admired and almost loved her while she was in the act of playing him undeniable melodies but he liked his nurse meyrick better on the whole she flattered him more and was more uniformly subservient with these two exceptions he despised the whole race of women and affected male society only especially of grooms stable boys and gypsies these last welcomed him to their tents and almost prostrated themselves before him so dazzled were they by his beauty and his color it is believed they suspected him of having gypsy blood in his veins they let him into their tents and even into some of their secrets and he promised them they should have it all their own way as soon as he was sir reginald he had outgrown his original theory that he was to be sir charles on his father's death he hated in doors when fixed by command to a book would beg hard to be allowed to take it into the sun and at night would open his window and poke his black head out to wash in the moonshine as he said he despised ladies and gentlemen said they were all affected fools and gave imitations of all his father's guests to prove it and so keen was this child of nature's eye for affectation that very often his disapproving parents were obliged to confess the imp had seen with his fresh eye defects custom had made them overlook or the solid good qualities that lay beneath had overbalanced now all this may appear amusing and eccentric and so on to strangers but after the first hundred laughs or so with which paternal indulgence dismisses the faults of childhood sir charles became very grave the boy was his darling and his pride he was ambitious for him he earnestly desired to solve for him a problem which is as impossible as squaring the circle viz how to transmit our experience to our children the years and the health he had wasted before he knew bella bruce these he resolved his successor should not waste he looked higher for this beautiful boy than for himself he had fully resolved to be member for the county one day but he did not care about it for himself it was only to pave the way for his successor that sir reginald after a long career in the commons might find his way into the house of peers and so obtain dignity in exchange for antiquity for to tell the truth the ancestors of four fifths of the british house of peers had been hewers of wood and drawers of water at a time when these bassetts had already been gentlemen of distinction for centuries all this love and this vicarious ambition were now mortified daily some fathers could do wonders for a brilliant boy and with him they expect him and a dull boy appears that is a bitter pill but this was worse reginald was a sharp boy he could do anything fasten him to a book for twenty minutes he would learn as much as most boys in an hour but there was no keeping him to it unless you strapped him or nailed him for he had the will of a mule and the suppleness of an eel to carry out his will and then his tastes low as his features were refined he was a sort of moral dung fork picked up all the slang of the stable and scattered it in the dining room and drawing room and once or twice he stole out of his comfortable room at night and slept in a gypsy's tent with his arm round a gypsy boy unsullied from his cradle by soap at last sir charles could no longer reply to his wife at night as he had done for this ten years past he was obliged to confess that there was one cloud upon his happiness dear reginald grieves me and makes me dread the future for if the child is father to the man there is a bitter disappointment in store for us he is like no other boy he is like no human creature i ever saw at his age and long after i was a fool i was a fool till i knew you but surely i was a gentleman i cannot see myself again in my first born chapter xxxvii lady bassett was paralyzed for a minute or two by this speech at last she replied by asking a question rather a curious one who nursed you charles what when i was a baby how can i tell yes by the by it was my mother nursed me so i was told and your mother was a le compton this poor boy was nursed by a servant oh she has some good qualities and is certainly devoted to us to this day her face brightens at sight of me but she is essentially vulgar and do you remember charles i wished to wean him early but i was overruled and the poor child drew his nature from that woman for nearly eighteen months it is a thing unheard of nowadays well but surely it is from our parents we draw our nature no i think it is from our nurses if compton or alec ever turn out like reginald blame nobody but their nurse and that is me sir charles smiled faintly at this piece of feminine logic and asked her what he should do she said she was quite unable to advise mr rolfe was coming to see them soon perhaps he might be able to suggest something sir charles said he would consult him but he was clear on one thing the boy must be sent from huntercombe and so separated from all his present acquaintances mr rolfe came and the distressed father opened his heart to him in strict confidence respecting reginald rolfe listened and sympathized and knit his brow and asked time to consider what he had heard and also to study the boy for himself he angled for him next day accordingly a little table was taken out on the lawn and presently mr rolfe issued forth in a uniform suit of dark blue flannel and a sombrero hat and set to work writing a novel in the sun reginald in due course descried this figure and it smacked so of that bohemia to which his own soul belonged that he was attracted thereby but made his approaches stealthily like a little cat presently a fiddle went off behind a tree so close that the novelist leaped out of his seat with an eldrich screech for he had long ago forgotten all about mr reginald and when he got heated in this kind of composition any sudden sound seemed to his tense nerves and boiling brain about ten times as loud as it really was having relieved himself with a yell he sat down with the mien of a martyr expecting tortures but he was most agreeably disappointed the little monster played an english melody and played it in tune this done he whistled a quick tune and played a slow second to it in perfect harmony this done he whistled the second part and played the quick treble a very simple feat but still ingenious for a boy and new to his hearer bravo bravo cried rolfe with all his heart mr reginald emerged radiant with vanity you are like me mr writer said he you don't like to be cooped up in doors i wish i could play the fiddle like you my fine fellow ah you can't do that all in a minute see the time i have been at it ah to be sure i forgot your antiquity and it isn't the time only it's giving your mind to it old chap what you don't give your mind to your books then as you do to your fiddle young gentleman not such a flat why lookee here governor if you go and give your mind to a thing you don't like it's always time wasted because some other chap that does like it will beat you and what's the use working for to be beat 'for' is redundant objected rolfe but if you stick hard to the things you like you do 'em downright well but old people are such fools they always drive you the wrong way they make the gals play music six hours a day and you might as well set the hen bullfinches to pipe look at the gals as come here how they rattle up and down the piano and can't make it sing a morsel why they couldn't rattle like that if they'd music in their skins d n 'em and they drive me to those stupid books because i'm all for music and moonshine can you keep a secret as the tomb well then i can do plenty of things well besides fiddling i can set a wire with any poacher in the parish i have caught plenty of our old man's hares in my time and it takes a workman to set a wire as it should be show me a wire and i'll tell you whether it was hudson or whitbeck or squinting jack or who it was that set it i know all their work that walks by moonlight hereabouts this is criticism a science i prefer art play me another tune my bold bohemian ah i thought i should catch ye with my fiddle you're not such a muff as the others old 'un not by a long chalk hang me if i won't give ye 'ireland's music' and i've sworn never to waste that on a fool he played the old irish air so simply and tunably that rolfe leaned back in his chair with half closed eyes in soft voluptuous ecstasy the youngster watched him with his coal black eye i like you said he better than i thought i should a precious sight highly flattered come with me and hear my nurse sing it what and leave my novel oh bother your novel and so i will that will be tit for tat it has bothered me lead on bohemian bold the boy took him over hedge and ditch the short cut to meyrick's farm and caught mrs meyrick and said she must sing ireland's music to rolfe the writer mrs meyrick apologized for her dress and affected shyness about singing mr reginald stared at first then let her know that if she was going to be affected like the girls that came to the hall he should hate her as he did them and this he confirmed with a naughty word thus threatened she came to book and sang ireland's melody in a low rich sonorous voice reginald played a second the harmony was so perfect and strong that certain glass candelabra on the mantel piece rang loudly and the drops vibrated then he made her sing the second and he took the treble with his violin and he wound up by throwing in a third part himself a sort of countertenor his own voice being much higher than the woman's the tears stood in rolfe's eyes well said he you have got the soul of music you two i could listen to you 'from morn till noon from noon till dewy eve' as they returned to huntercombe this mercurial youth went off at a tangent and rolfe saw him no more he wrote in peace and walked about between the heats just before dinner time the screams of women were heard hard by and the writer hurried to the place in time to see mr basset hanging by the shoulder from the branch of a tree about twenty feet from the ground rolfe hallooed as he ran to the women to fetch blankets to catch him and got under the tree determined to try and catch him in his arms if necessary but he encouraged the boy to hold on all right governor said the boy in a quavering voice it was very near the kitchen maids and men poured out with blankets eight people held one under rolfe's direction and down came mr bassett in a semicircle and bounded up again off the blanket like an india rubber ball his quick mind recovered courage the moment he touched wool crikey that's jolly said he give me another toss or two oh no no said a good natured maid take an' put him to bed right off poor dear hold your tongue ye bitch said young hopeful if ye don't toss me i'll turn ye all off as soon as ever the old un kicks the bucket thus menaced they thought it prudent to toss him but at the third toss he yelled out oh oh oh i'm all wet it's blood i'm dead then they examined and found his arm was severely lacerated by an old nail that had been driven into the tree and it had torn the flesh in his fall he was covered with blood the sight of which quenched his manly spirit and he began to howl old linen rag warm water and a bottle of champagne shouted rolfe the servants flew rolfe dressed and bandaged the wound for him and then he felt faint the champagne soon set that right and then he wanted to get drunk alleging as a reason that he had not been drunk for this two months sir charles was told of the accident and was distressed by it and also by the cause rolfe said he sorrowfully there is a ring dove's nest on that tree she and hers have built there in peace and safety for a hundred years and cooed about the place my unhappy boy was climbing the tree to take the young after solemnly promising me he never would that is the bitter truth what shall i do with the young barbarian he sighed and lady bassett echoed the sigh said rolfe the young barbarian as you call him has disarmed me he plays the fiddle like a civilized angel oh mr rolfe what you his mother and not found that out yet oh yes he has a heaven born genius for music rolfe then related the musical feats of the urchin sir charles begged to observe that this talent would go a very little way toward fitting him to succeed his father and keep up the credit of an ancient family dear charles mr rolfe knows that but it is like him to make the best of things to encourage us but what do you think of him on the whole mr rolfe has sir charles more to hope or to fear give me another day or two to study him said rolfe that night there was a loud alarm mr bassett was running about the veranda in his night dress they caught him and got him to bed and rolfe said it was fever and with the assistance of sir charles and a footman laid him between two towels steeped in tepid water then drew blankets tight over him and in short packed him ah said he complacently i say give me a drink of moonshine old chap i'll give you a bucketful said rolfe then with the servant's help took his little bed and put it close to the window the moonlight streamed in on the boy's face his great black eyes glittered in it he was diabolically beautiful kiss me moonshine said he i like to wash in you next day he was apparently quite well and certainly ripe for fresh mischief rolfe studied him and the evening before he went gave sir charles and lady bassett his opinion but not with his usual alacrity a weight seemed to hang on him and more than once his voice trembled i shall tell you said he what i see what i foresee and then with great diffidence what i advise i see what naturalists call a reversion in race a boy who resembles in color and features neither of his parents and indeed bears little resemblance to any of the races that have inhabited england since history was written he suggests rather some oriental type sir charles turned round in his chair with a sigh and said we are to have a romance it seems lady bassett stared with all her eyes and began to change color the theorist continued with perfect composure i don't undertake to account for it with any precision how can i perhaps there is moorish blood in your family and here it has revived you look incredulous but there are plenty of examples ay and stronger than this every child that is born resembles some progenitor how then do you account for julia pastrana a young lady who dined with me last week and sang me 'ah perdona' rather feebly in the evening bust and figure like any other lady hand exquisite arms neatly turned but with long silky hair from the elbow to the wrist face ugh forehead made of black leather eyes all pupil nose an excrescence chin pure monkey face all covered with hair briefly a type extinct ten thousand years before adam yet it could revive at this time of day compared with la pastrana and many much weaker examples of antiquity revived that i have seen your mauritanian son is no great marvel after all this is a little too far fetched said sir charles satirically bella's father was a very dark man and it is a tradition in our family that all the bassetts were as black as ink till they married with you rolfes in the year oho said rolfe is it so see how discussion brings out things and then said lady bassett charles dear tell mr rolfe what i think ay do said rolfe that will be a new form of circumlocution sir charles complied with a smile lady bassett's theory is that children derive their nature quite as much from their wet nurses as from their parents and she thinks the faults we deplore in reginald are to be traced to his nurse by the by she is a dark woman too well said rolfe there's a good deal of truth in that as far as regards the disposition but i never heard color so accounted for yet why not it has been proved that the very bones of young animals can be colored pink by feeding them on milk so colored there said lady bassett but no nurse could give your son a color which is not her own i have seen the woman she is only a dark englishwoman her arms were embrowned by exposure but her forehead was not brown mr reginald is quite another thing the skin of his body the white of his eye the pupil all look like a reversion to some oriental type and mark the coincidence he has mental peculiarities that point toward the east sir charles lost patience on the contrary said he he talks and feels just like an english snob and makes me miserable oh as to that he has picked up vulgar phrases at that farm and in your stables but he never picked up his musical genius in stables and farms far less his poetry what poetry what poetry why did not you hear him was it not poetical of a wounded fevered boy to beg to be laid by the window and to say 'let me drink the moonshine' take down your homer and read a thousand lines haphazard and see whether you stumble over a thought more poetical than that but criticism does not exist whatever the dead said was good whatever the living say is little as if the dead were a race apart and had never been the living and the living would never be the dead heaven knows where he was running to now but sir charles stopped him by conceding that point well you are right poor child it was poetical and the father's pride predominated for a moment over every other sentiment yes but where did it come from that looks to me a typical idea i mean an idea derived not from his luxurious parents dwellers in curtained mansions but from some out door and remote ancestor perhaps from the oriental tribe that first colonized britain they worshiped the sun and the moon no doubt or perhaps after all it only came from some wandering tribe that passed their lives between the two lights of heaven and never set foot in a human dwelling this said sir charles is a flattering speculation but so wild and romantic that i fear it will lead us to no practical result i thought you undertook to advise me what advice can you build on these cobwebs of your busy brain excuse me my practical friend said rolfe i opened my discourse in three heads what i see what i foresee and what with diffidence i advise pray don't disturb my methods or i am done for never disturb an artist's form i have told you what i see what i foresee is this you will have to cut off the entail with reginald's consent when he is of age and make the saxon boy compton your successor cutting off entails runs in families like everything else your grandfather did it and so will you you should put by a few thousands every year that you may be able to do this without injustice either to your oriental or your saxon son never shouted sir charles then in a broken voice he is my first born and my idol his coming into the world rescued me out of a morbid condition he healed my one great grief bar the entail and put his younger brother in his place never mr rolfe bowed his head politely and left the subject which indeed could be carried no farther without serious offense and now for my advice the question is how to educate this strange boy one thing is clear it is no use trying the humdrum plan any longer it has been tried and failed i should adapt his education to his nature education is made as stiff and unyielding as a board but it need not be i should abolish that spectacled tutor of yours at once and get a tutor young enterprising manly and supple who would obey orders and the order should be to observe the boy's nature and teach accordingly why need men teach in a chair and boys learn in a chair the athenians studied not in chairs the peripatetics as their name imports hunted knowledge afoot those who sought truth in the groves of academus were not seated at that work then let the tutor walk with him and talk with him by sunlight and moonlight relating old history and commenting on each new thing that is done or word spoken and improve every occasion why i myself would give a guinea a day to walk with william white about the kindly aspects and wooded slopes of selborne or with karr about his garden cut latin and greek clean out of the scheme they are mere cancers to those who can never excel in them teach him not dead languages but living facts have him in your justice room for half an hour a day and give him your own comments on what he has heard there let his tutor take him to all quarter sessions and assizes and stick to him like diaculum especially out of doors order him never to be admitted to the stable yard dismiss every biped there that lets him come don't let him visit his nurse so often and never without his tutor it was she who taught him to look forward to your decease that is just like these common women such a tutor as i have described will deserve pounds a year give it him and dismiss him if he plays humdrum and doesn't earn it dismiss half a dozen if necessary till you get a fellow with a grain or two of genius for tuition when the boy is seventeen what with his oriental precocity and this system of education he will know the world as well as a saxon boy of twenty one and that is not saying much then if his nature is still as wild get him a large tract in australia cattle to breed kangaroos to shoot swift horses to thread the bush and gallop mighty tracts he will not shirk business if it avoids the repulsive form of sitting down in doors and offers itself in combination with riding hunting galloping cracking of rifles and of colonial whips as loud as rifles and drinking sunshine and moonshine in that mellow clime beneath the southern cross and the spangled firmament of stars unknown to us his own eyes sparkled like hot coals at this bohemian picture then he sighed and returned to civilization but said he be ready with eighty thousand pounds for him that he may enjoy his own way and join you in barring the entail i forgot i must say no more on that subject i see it is as offensive as it is inevitable cassandra has spoken wisely and i see in vain god bless you both good night and he rolled out of the room with a certain clumsy importance sir charles treated all this advice with a polite forbearance while he was in the room but on his departure delivered a sage reflection strange said he that a man so valuable in any great emergency should be so extravagant and eccentric in the ordinary affairs of life i might as well drive to bellevue house and consult the first gentleman i met there lady bassett did not reply immediately and sir charles observed that her face was very red and her hands trembled why bella said he has all that rhodomontade upset you lady bassett looked frightened at his noticing her agitation and said that mr rolfe always overpowered her he is so large and so confident and throws such new light on things new light wild eccentricity always does that but it is the light of jack o' lantern on a great question so near my heart as this give me the steady light of common sense not the wayward coruscations of a fiery imagination bella dear i shall send the boy to a good school and so cut off at one blow all the low associations that have caused the mischief you know what is best dear said lady bassett you are wiser than any of us in the morning she got hold of mr rolfe and asked him if he could put her in the way of getting more than three per cent for her money without risk only one saidrolfe london freeholds in rising situations let to substantial tenants i can get you five per cent that way if you are always ready to buy the thing does not offer every day i have twenty thousand pounds to dispose of so said lady bassett very well said rolfe i'll look out for you but oldfield must examine titles and do the actual business the best of that investment is it is always improving no ups and downs come thought he cassandra has not spoken quite in vain sir charles acted on his judgment and in due course sent mr bassett to a school at some distance kept by a clergyman who had the credit in that county of exercising sharp supervision and strict discipline sir charles made no secret of the boy's eccentricities mr beecher said he had one or two steady boys who assisted him in such cases sir charles thought that a very good idea it was like putting a wild colt into the break with a steady horse he missed the boy sadly at first but comforted himself with the conviction that he had parted with him for his good that consoled him somewhat the younger children of sir charles and lady bassett were educated entirely by their mother and taught as none but a loving lady can teach compton with whom we have to do never knew the thorns with which the path of letters is apt to be strewn a mistress of the great art of pleasing made knowledge from the first a primrose path to him sparkling all over with intelligence she impregnated her boy with it she made herself his favorite companion she would not keep her distance she stole and coaxed knowledge and goodness into his heart and mind with rare and loving cunning she taught him english and french and latin on the hamiltonian plan and stored his young mind with history and biography and read to him and conversed with him on everything as they read it she taught him to speak the truth and to be honorable and just she taught him to be polite and even formal rather than free and easy and rude she taught him to be a man he must not be what brave boys called a molly coddle like most womanly women she had a veneration for man and she gave him her own high idea of the manly character natural ability and habitual contact with a mind so attractive and so rich gave this intelligent boy many good ideas beyond his age when he was six years old lady bassett made him pass his word of honor that he would never go into the stable yard and even then he was far enough advanced to keep his word religiously in return for this she let him taste some sweets of liberty and was not always after him she was profound enough to see that without liberty a noble character cannot be formed and she husbanded the curb one day he represented to her that in the meadow next their lawn were great stripes of yellow which were possibly cowslips of course they might be only buttercups but he hoped better things of them he further reported that there was an iron gate between him and this paradise he could get over it if not objectionable but he thought it safest to ask her what she thought of the matter was that iron gate intended to keep little boys from the cowslips because if so it was a misfortune to which he must resign himself still it was a misfortune all this of course in the simple language of boyhood then lady bassett smiled and said suppose i were to lend you a key of that iron gate oh mamma i have a great mind to then you will you will does that follow yes whenever you say you think you'll do something kind or you have a great mind to do it you know you always do it and that is one thing i do like you for mamma you are better than your word better than my word where does the child learn these things la mamma papa says that often oh that accounts for it i like the phrase very much i wish i could think i deserved it at any rate i will be as good as my word for once you shall have a key of the gate the boy clapped his hands with delight the key was sent for and meantime she told him one reason why she had trusted him with it was because he had been as good as his word about the stable the key was brought and she held it up half playfully and said there sir i deliver you this upon conditions you must only use it when the weather is quite dry because the grass in the meadow is longer and will be wet do you promise yes mamma and you must always lock the gate when you come back and bring the key to one place let me see the drawer in the hall table the one with marble on it for you know a place for every thing is our rule on these conditions i hereby deliver you this magic key with the right of egress and ingress egress and ingress egress and ingress is that foreign for cowslips mamma and oxlips ha ha the child's head is full of cowslips there is the dictionary look out egress and afterward look out ingress when he had added these two words to his little vocabulary his mother asked him if he would be good enough to tell her why he did not care much about all the beautiful flowers in the garden and was so excited about cowslips which appeared to her a flower of no great beauty and the smell rather sickly begging his pardon this question posed him dreadfully he looked at her in a sort of comic distress and then sat gravely down all in a heap about a yard off to think finally he turned to her with a wry face and said why do i mamma she smiled deliciously no no sir said she how can i get inside your little head and tell what is there there must be a reason i suppose and you know you and i are never satisfied till we get at the reason of a thing but there is no hurry dear i give you a week to find it out now run and open the gate stay are there any cows in that field sometimes mamma but they have no horns you know upon your word upon my honor i am not fond of them with horns myself then run away darling but you must come and hunt me up and tell me how you enjoyed yourself because that makes me happy you know this is mawkish but it will serve to show on what terms the woman and boy were on second thoughts i recall that apology and defy creation the mawkish is a branch of literature a great and popular one and i have neglected it savagely master compton opened the iron gate and the world was all before him where to choose he chose one of those yellow stripes that had so attracted him horror it was all buttercups and deil a cowslip nevertheless pursuing his researches he found plenty of that delightful flower scattered about the meadow in thinner patches and he gathered a double handful and dirtied his knees returning thus laden from his first excursion he was accosted by a fluty voice little boy he looked up and saw a girl standing on the lower bar of a little wooden gate painted white looking over please bring me my ball said she pathetically compton looked about and saw a soft ball of many colors lying near he put down his cowslips gravely and brought her the ball he gave it her with a blush because she was a strange girl and she blushed a little because he did he returned to his cowslips little boy said the voice please bring me my ball again he brought it her with undisturbed politeness she was giggling he laughed too at that you did it on purpose that time said he solemnly la you don't think i'd be so wicked said she compton shook his head doubtfully and considering the interview at an end turned to go when instantly the ball knocked his hat off and nothing of the malefactress was visible but a black eye sparkling with fun and mischief and a bit of forehead wedged against the angle of the wall this being a challenge compton said now you come out after that and stand a shot like a man the invitation to be masculine did not tempt her a bit the only thing she put out was her hand and that she drew in with a laugh the moment he threw at it at this juncture a voice cried ruperta what are you doing there ruperta made a rapid signal with her hand to compton implying that he was to run away and she herself walked demurely toward the person who had called her it was three days before compton saw her again and then she beckoned him royally to her little boy said she talk to me compton looked at her a little confounded and did not reply stand on this gate like me and talk said she he obeyed the first part of this mandate and stood on the lower bar of the little gate so their two figures made a v when they hung back and a tenpenny nail when they came forward and met and this motion they continued through the dialogue and it was a pity the little wretches could not keep still and send for my friend the english titian for when their heads were in position it was indeed a pretty picture of childish and flower like beauty and contrast the boy fair blue eyed and with exquisite golden hair the girl black eyed black browed and with eyelashes of incredible length and beauty and a cheek brownish but tinted and so glowing with health and vigor that pricked with a needle it seemed ready to squirt carnation right into your eye she dazzled master compton so that he could do nothing but look at her well said she smiling well replied he pretending her well was not an interrogatory but a concise statement and that he had discharged the whole duty of man by according a prompt and cheerful consent you begin said the lady no you what for because i think you are the cleverest good little boy well then i will who are you i am compton who are you please i am ruperta i never heard that name before no more did i i think they measured me for it you live in the great house there don't you yes ruperta well then i live in the little house it is not very little either it's highmore i saw you in church one day is that lady with the hair your mamma yes ruperta she is beautiful isn't she but mine is so good mine is very good too ruperta wonderfully good i like you compton a little i like you a good deal ruperta la do you i wonder at that you are like a cherub and i am such a black thing but that is why i like you reginald is darker than you and oh so beautiful hum he is a very bad boy no he is not don't tell stories child he is i know all about him a wicked vulgar bad boy he is not cried compton almost sniveling but he altered his mind and fired up you are a naughty story telling girl to say that bless me said ruperta coloring high and tossing her head haughtily i don't like you now ruperta said compton with all the decent calmness of a settled conviction you don't screamed ruperta then go about your business directly and don't never come here again scolding me how dare you oh oh oh and the little lady went off slowly with her finger in her eye and master compton looked rather rueful as we all do when this charming sex has recourse to what may be called liquid reasoning i have known the most solid reasons unable to resist it however mens conscia recti and above all the cowslips enabled compton to resist and he troubled his head no more about her that day but he looked out for her the next day and she did not come and that rather disappointed him the next day was wet and he did not go into the meadow being on honor not to do so the fourth day was lovely and he spent a long time in the meadow in hopes he saw her for a moment at the gate but she speedily retired he was disappointed however he collected a good store of cowslips and then came home as he passed the door out popped ruperta from some secret ambush and said well chapter xxxviii well replied compton are you better dear i'm very well thank you said the boy in your mind i mean you were cross last time you know compton remembered his mother's lessons about manly behavior and said in a jaunty way well i s'pose i was a little cross now the other cunning little thing had come to apologize if there was no other way to recover her admirer but on this confession she said oh if you are sorry for it i forgive you you may come and talk then compton came and stood on the gate and they held a long conversation and having quarreled last time parted now with rather violent expressions of attachment after that they made friends and laid their little hearts bare to each other and it soon appeared that compton had learned more but ruperta had thought more for herself and was sorely puzzled about many things and of a vastly inquisitive mind why said she is good thing's so hard and had things so nice and easy it would be much better if good things were nice and bad ones nasty that is the way i'd have it if i could make things mr compton shook his head and said many things were very hard to understand and even his mamma sometimes could not make out all the things nor mine neither i puzzle her dreadful i can't help that things shouldn't come and puzzle me and then i shouldn't puzzle her shall i tell you my puzzles and perhaps you can answer them because you are a boy i can't think why it is wicked for me to dig in my little garden on a sunday and it isn't wicked for jessie to cook and sarah to make the beds can't think why mamma told papa not to be cross and when i told her not to be cross she put me in a dark cupboard all among the dreadful mice till i screamed so she took me out and kissed me and gave me pie can't think why papa called sally 'something' for spilling the ink over his papers and when i called the gardener the very same for robbing my flowers all their hands and eyes went up and they said i was a shocking girl can't think why papa giggled the next moment if i was a shocking girl it is all puzzle puzzle puzzle one day she said can you tell me where all the bad people are buried for that puzzles me dreadful compton was posed at first but said at last he thought they were buried in the churchyard along with the good ones oh indeed said she with an air of pity pray have you ever been in the churchyard and read the writings on the stones no then i have i have read every single word and there are none but good people buried there not one she added rather pathetically you should not answer me without thinking as if things were easy instead of so hard well one comfort there are not many wicked people hereabouts they live in towns so i suppose they are buried in the garden poor things or put in the water with a stone compton had no more plausible theory ready and declined to commit himself to ruperta's so that topic fell to the ground one day he found her perched as usual but with her bright little face overclouded by this time the intelligent boy was fond enough of her to notice her face what's the matter perta ruperta the matter puzzled again it is very serious this time tell me ruperta no dear please the young lady fixed her eyes on him and said with a pretty solemnity let us play at catechism i don't know that game the governess asks questions and the good little boy answers that's catechism i'm the governess then i'm the good little boy yes dear and so now look me full in the face there you're very pretty ruperta don't be giddy i'm hideous so behave and answer all my questions oh i'm so unhappy answer me is young people or old people goodest you should say best dear good better best why old people to be sure much so i thought and that is why i am so puzzled then your papa and mine are much betterer will that do than we are of course they are there he goes such a child for answering slap bang i never i'm not a child i'm older than you are ruperta that's a story well then i'm as old for mary says we were born the same day the same hour the same minute la we are twins she paused however on this discovery and soon found reason to doubt her hasty conclusion no such thing said she they tell me the bells were ringing for you being found and then i was found to catechism you there then you see i am older than you ruperta yes dear said ruperta very gravely i'm younger in my body but older in my head this matter being settled so that neither party could complain since antiquity was evenly distributed the catechizing recommenced do you believe in 'let dogs delight' i don't know what screamed ruperta oh you wicked boy why it comes next after the bible then i do believe it said compton who to tell the truth had been merely puzzled by the verb and was not afflicted with any doubt that the composition referred to was a divine oracle good boy said ruperta patronizingly well then this is what puzzles me your papa and mine don't believe in 'dogs delight' they have been quarreling this twelve years and more and mean to go on in spite of mamma she is good didn't you know that your papa and mine are great enemies no ruperta oh what a pity don't compton don't there you have made me cry he set himself to console her she consented to be consoled but she said with a sigh what becomes of old people being better than young ones now are you and i bears and lions do we scratch out each other's eyes it is all puzzle puzzle puzzle i wish i was dead nurse says when i'm dead i shall understand it all but i don't know i saw a dead cat once and she didn't seem to know as much as before puzzle puzzle compton do you think they are puzzled in heaven no then the sooner we both go there the better yes but not just now why not because of the cowslips here's a boy what would you rather be among the cowslips than the angels and think of the diamonds and pearls that heaven is paved with but you mightn't be there what am i a wicked girl then wickeder than you that is a boy oh no no no but see how big it is up there they cast their eyes up and taking the blue vault for creation were impressed with its immensity i know where to find you here but up there you might be ever so far off me la so i might well then we had better keep quiet i suppose we shall get wiser as we get older but compton i'm so sorry your papa and mine are bears and lions why doesn't the clergyman scold them nobody dare scold my papa said compton proudly then after reflection perhaps when we are older we may persuade them to make friends i think it is very stupid to quarrel don't you as stupid as an owl you and i had a quarrel once ruperta yes you misbehaved no no you were cross story well never mind we did quarrel and you were miserable directly not so very said compton tossing his head i was then said ruperta with unguarded candor so was i good boy kiss me dear there and there and there and that will do i want to talk compton yes dear i'm not very sure but i rather think i'm in love with you a little little bit you know and i'm sure i'm in love with you ruperta over head an' ears yes then i love you to distraction bother the gate if it wasn't for that i could run in the meadow with you and marry you perhaps and so gather cowslips together for ever and ever let us open it you can't let us try i have it won't be opened let me try some gates want to be lifted up a little and then they will open there i told you so the gate came open ruperta uttered an exclamation of delight and then drew back i'm afraid compton said she papa would be angry she wanted compton to tempt her but that young gentleman having a strong sense of filial duty omitted so to do when she saw he would not persuade her she dispensed come along said she if it is only for five minutes she took his hand and away they scampered he showed her the cowslips the violets and all the treasures of the meadow but it was all hurry and skurry and excitement no time to look at anything above half a minute for fear of being found out and so at last back to the gate beaming with stolen pleasure glowing and sparkling with heat and excitement the cunning thing made him replace the gate and then after saying she must go for about an hour marched demurely back to the house after one or two of these hasty trips impunity gave her a sense of security and the weather getting warm she used to sit in the meadow with her beau and weave wreaths of cowslips and place them in her black hair and for comp ton she made coronets of bluebells and adorned his golden head and sometimes for a little while she would nestle to him and lean her head with all the feminine grace of a mature woman on his shoulder said she a boy's shoulder does very nice for a girl to put her nose on one day the aspiring girl asked him what was that forest that is bassett's wood i will go there with you some day when papa is out i'm afraid that is too far for you said compton nothing is too far for me replied the ardent girl why how far is it more than half a mile is it very big immense belong to the queen no to papa oh and here my reader may well ask what was lady bassett about or did compton with all his excellent teaching conceal all this from his mother and his friend on the contrary he went open mouthed to her and told her he had seen such a pretty little girl and gave her a brief account of their conversation lady bassett was startled at first and greatly perplexed she told him he must on no account go to her if he spoke to her it must be on papa's ground she even made him pledge his honor to that more than that she did not like to say she thought it unnecessary and undesirable to transmit to another generation the unhappy feud by which she had suffered so much and was even then suffering moreover she was as much afraid of richard bassett as ever if he chose to tell his girl not to speak to compton he might she was resolved not to go out of her way to affront him through his daughter besides that might wound mrs bassett if it got round to her ears and although she had never spoken to mrs bassett yet their eyes had met in church and always with a pacific expression indeed lady bassett felt sure she had read in that meek woman's face a regret that they were not friends and could not be friends because of their husbands lady bassett then for these reasons would not forbid compton to be kind to ruperta in moderation whether she would have remained as neutral had she known how far these young things were going is quite another matter but compton's narratives to her were naturally enough very tame compared with the reality and she never dreamed that two seven year olds could form an attachment so warm as these little plagues were doing and to conclude about the time when mr compton first opened the gate for his inamorata lady bassett's mind was diverted in some degree even from her beloved boy compton by a new trouble and a host of passions it excited in her own heart a thunder clap fell on sir charles bassett in the form of a letter from reginald's tutor informing him that reginald and another lad had been caught wiring hares in a wood at some distance and were now in custody sir charles mounted his horse and rode to the place leaving lady bassett a prey to great anxiety and bitter remorse sir charles came back in two days with the galling news that his son and heir was in prison for a month all his exertions having only prevailed to get the case summarily dealt with reginald's companion a young gypsy aged seventeen had got three months it being assumed that he was the tempter the reverse was the case though when sir charles told lady bassett all this with a face of agony and a broken voice her heart almost burst she threw every other consideration to the winds charles she cried i can't bear it i can't see your heart wrung any more and your affections blighted tear that young viper out of your breast don't go on wasting your heart's blood on a stranger he is not your son chapter xxxix at this monstrous declaration from the very lips of the man's wife there was a dead silence sir charles being struck dumb and lady bassett herself terrified at the sound of the words she had uttered after a terrible pause sir charles fixed his eyes on her with an awful look and said very slowly will you have the goodness to say that again but first think what you are saying this made lady bassett shake in every limb indeed the very flesh of her body quivered yet she persisted but in a tone that of itself showed how fast her courage was oozing she faltered out almost inaudibly i say you must waste no more love on him he is not your son sir charles looked at her to see if she was in her senses it was not the first time he had suspected her of being deranged on this one subject but no she was pale as death she was cringing wincing quivering and her eyes roving to and fro a picture not of frenzy but of guilt unhardened he began to tremble in his turn and was so horror stricken and agitated that he could hardly speak am i dreaming he gasped lady bassett saw the storm she had raised and would have given the world to recall her words whose is he then asked sir charles in a voice scarcely human i don't know said lady bassett doggedly then how dare you say that he isn't mine kill me charles cried she passionately but don't look at me so and speak to me so why i say he is not yours is he like you either in face or mind and he is like whom lady bassett had lost all her courage by this time she whimpered out like nobody except the gypsies bella this is a subject which will part you and me for life unless we can agree upon it no reply in words from lady bassett so please let us understand each other your son is not my son is that what you look me in the face and tell me charles i never said that how could he be my son and not be yours and she raised her eyes and looked him full in the face nor fear nor cringing now the woman was majestic sir charles was a little alarmed in his turn for his wife's soft eyes flamed battle for the first time in her life now you talk sense said he if he is yours he is mine and as he is certainly yours this is a very foolish conversation which must not be renewed otherwise i shall be insulted by my own husband i think it very probable and as i do not choose you to be insulted nor to think yourself insulted i forbid you ever to recur to this subject i will obey charles but let me say one word first when i was alone in london and hardly sensible might not this child have been imposed upon me and you i'm sure he was by whom how can i tell i was alone that woman in the house had a bad face the gypsies do these things i've heard the gypsies and why not the fairies said sir charles contemptuously is that all you have to suggest before we close the subject forever yes said lady bassett sorrowfully i see you take me for a mad woman but time will show oh that i could persuade you to detach your affections from that boy he will break your heart else and rest them on the children that resemble us in mind and features these partialities are allowed to mothers but a father must be just reginald is my first born he came to me from heaven at a time when i was under a bitter trial and from the day he was born till this day i have been a happy man it is not often a father owes so much to a son as i do to my darling boy he is dear to my heart in spite of his faults and now i pity him as well as love him since it seems he has only one parent poor little fellow lady bassett opened her mouth to reply but could not she raised her hands in mute despair then quietly covered her face with them and soon the tears trickled through her white fingers sir charles looked at her and was touched at her silent grief my darling wife said he i think this is the only thing you and i cannot agree upon why not be wise as well as loving and avoid it i will never seek it again sobbed lady bassett but oh she cried with sudden wildness something tells me it will meet me and follow me and rob me of my husband well when that day comes i shall know how to die and with this she burst away from him like some creature who has been stung past endurance sir charles often meditated on this strange scene turn it how he could he came back to the same conclusion that she must have an hallucination on this subject he said to himself if bella really believed the boy was a changeling she would act upon her conviction she would urge me to take some steps to recover our true child whom the gypsies or the fairies have taken and given us poor dear reginald instead but still the conversation and her strange looks of terror lay dormant in his mind both were too remarkable to be ever forgotten such things lie like certain seeds awaiting only fresh accidents to spring into life the month rolled away and the day came for reginald's liberation a dogcart was sent for him and the heir of the bassetts emerged from a county jail and uttered a whoop of delight he insisted on driving and went home at a rattling pace he was in high spirits till he got in sight of huntercombe hall and then it suddenly occurred to his mercurial mind that he should probably not be received with an ovation petty larceny being a novelty in that ancient house whose representative he was when he did get there he found the whole family in such a state of commotion that his return was hardly noticed at all master compton's dinner hour was two pm and yet at three o'clock of this day he did not come in this was reported to lady bassett and it gave her some little anxiety for she suspected he might possibly be in the company of ruperta bassett and although she did not herself much object to that she objected very much to have it talked about and made a fuss so she went herself to the end of the lawn and out into the meadow that a servant might not find the young people together if her suspicion was correct she went into the meadow and called compton compton as loud as she could but there was no reply then she came in and began to be alarmed and sent servants about in all directions but two hours elapsed and there were no tidings the thing looked serious she sent out grooms well mounted to scour the country one of these fell in with sir charles who thereupon came home and found his wife in a pitiable state she was sitting in an armchair trembling and crying hysterically she caught his hand directly and grasped it like a vise it is richard bassett she cried he knows how to wound and kill me he has stolen our child sir charles hurried out and soon after that reginald arrived and stood awe struck at her deplorable condition sir charles came back heated and anxious kissed reginald told him in three words his brother was missing and then informed lady bassett that he had learned something very extraordinary richard bassett's little girl had also disappeared and his people were out looking after her ah they are together cried lady bassett together a son of mine consorting with that viper's brood what does that poor child know oh find him for me if you love that dear child's mother' sir charles hurried out directly but was met at the door by a servant who blurted out the men have dragged the fish ponds sir charles and they want to know if they shall drag the brook hold your tongue idiot cried sir charles and thrust him out but the wiseacre had not spoken in vain lady bassett moaned and went into worse hysterics with nobody near her but reginald that worthy never having seen a lady in hysterics and not being hardened at all points uttered a sympathetic howl and flung his arms round her neck oh oh oh don't cry mamma lady bassett shuddered at his touch but did not repel him i'll find him for you said the boy if you will leave off crying she stared in his face a moment and then went on as before mamma said he getting impatient do listen to me i'll find him easy enough if you will only listen you you and she stared wildly at him ay i know a sight more than the fools about here i'm a poacher just you put me on to his track i'll soon run into him if he is above ground a child like you cried lady bassett how can you do that and she began to wring her hands again i'll show you said the boy getting very impatient if you will just leave off crying like a great baby and come to any place you like where he has been to day and left a mark ah cried lady bassett i'm a poacher repeated reginald quite proudly you forget that come with me cried lady bassett starting up she whipped on her bonnet and ran with him down the lawn there reginald said she panting i think my darling was here this afternoon yes yes he must for he had a key of the door and it is open all right said reginald come into the field he ran about like a dog hunting and soon found marks among the cowslips somebody has been gathering a nosegay here to day said he now mamma there's only two ways put of this field let us go straight to that gate that is the likeliest near the gate was some clay and reginald showed her several prints of small feet look said he here's the track of two one's a gal how i know here's a sole to this shoe no wider nor a knife come on in the next field he was baffled for a long time but at last he found a place in a dead hedge where they had gone through see said he these twigs are fresh broken and here's a bit of the gal's frock oh won't she catch it oh you brave clever boy cried lady bassett come on shouted the urchin he hunted like a beagle and saw like a bird with his savage glittering eye he was on fire with the ardor of the chase and not to dwell too long on what has been so often and so well written by others in about an hour and a half he brought the anxious palpitating but now hopeful mother to the neighborhood of bassett's wood here he trusted to his own instinct they have gone into the wood said he and i don't blame 'em i found my way here long before his age i say don't you tell i've snared plenty of the governor's hares in that wood he got to the edge of the wood and ran down the side at last he found the marks of small feet on a low bank and darting over it discovered the fainter traces on some decaying leaves inside the wood there said he now it is just as if you had got them in your pocket for they'll never find their way out of this wood bless your heart why i used to get lost in it at first lost in the wood cried lady bassett but he will die of fear or be eaten by wild beasts and it is getting so dark what about that night or day is all one to me what will you give me if i find him before midnight anything i've got in the world give me a sovereign a thousand give me a kiss a hundred then i'll tell you what i'll do i don't mind a little trouble to stop your crying mamma because you are the right sort i'll get the village out and we will tread the wood with torches an' all for them as can't see by night i can see all one and you shall have your kid home to supper you see there's a heavy dew and he is not like me that would rather sleep in this wood than the best bed in london city a night in a wood would about settle his hash so here goes i can run a mile in six minutes and a half with these words the strange boy was off like an arrow from a bow lady bassett exhausted by anxiety and excitement was glad to sit down her trembling heart would not let her leave the place that she now began to hope contained her child she sat down and waited patiently the sun set the moon rose the stars glittered the infinite leaves stood out dark and solid as if cut out of black marble all was dismal silence and dread suspense to the solitary watcher yet the lady of huntercombe hall sat on sick at heart but patient beneath that solemn sky she shuddered a little as the cold dews gathered on her for she was a woman nursed in luxury's lap but she never moved the silence was dismal had that wild boy forgotten his promise or were there no parents in the village that their feet lagged so it was nearly ten o'clock when her keen ears strained to the utmost discovered a faint buzzing of voices but where she could not tell the sounds increased and increased and then there was a temporary silence and after that a faint hallooing in the wood to her right the wood was five hundred acres and the bulk of it lay in front and to her left the hallooing got louder and louder the whole wood seemed to echo her heart beat high lights glimmered nearer and nearer hares and rabbits pattered by and startled her and pheasants thundered off their roosts with an incredible noise owls flitted and bats innumerable disturbed and terrified by the glaring lights and loud resounding halloos nearer nearer came the sounds till at last a line of men and boys full fifty carrying torches and lanterns came up and lighted up the dew spangled leaves and made the mother's heart leap with joyful hope at succor so powerful oh she could have kissed the stout village blacksmith whose deep sonorous lungs rang close to her never had any man's voice sounded to her so like a god's as this stout blacksmith's hilloop hilloop close and loud in her ear and those at the end of the line hallooed hillo op hillo op like an echo and so they passed on through bush and brier till their voices died away in the distance a boy detached himself from the line and ran to lady bassett with a traveling rug it was reginald you put on this said he he shook it and standing on tiptoe put it over her shoulders thank you dear said she where is papa oh he is in the line and the highmore swell and all mr richard bassett air his kid is out on the loose as well as ours oh reginald if they should quarrel why our governor can lick him can't he chapter xl oh don't talk so i wouldn't for all the world they should quarrel well we have got enough fellows to part them if they do dear reginald you have been so good to me and you are so clever speak to some of the men and let there be no more quarreling between papa and that man all right said the boy on second thoughts take me to papa i'll be by his side and then they cannot you want to walk through the wood that is a good joke why it is like walking through a river and the young wood slapping your eyes for you can't see every twig by this light and the leaves sponging your face and shoulders and the briers would soon strip your gown into ribbons and make your little ankles bleed no you are a lady you stay where you are and let us men work it we shan't find him yet awhile i must get near the governor when we find my lord i'll give a whistle you could hear a mile off oh reginald are you sure he is in the wood i'd bet my head to a chany orange you might as well ask me when i track a badger to his hole and no signs of his going out again whether old long claws is there i wish i was as sure of never going back to school as i am of finding that little lot the only thing i don't like is the young muff's not giving us a halloo back but any way i'll find 'em alive or dead and with this pleasing assurance the little imp scudded off leaving the mother glued to the spot with terror for full an hour more the torches gleamed though fainter and fainter and so full was the wood of echoes that the voices though distant seemed to halloo all round the agonized mother but presently there was a continuous yell quite different from the isolated shouts a distant but unmistakable howl of victory that made a bolt of ice shoot down her back and then her heart to glow like fire it was followed by a keen whistle she fell on her knees and thanked god for her boy in the middle of this wood was a shallow excavation an old chalk pit unused for many years it was never deep and had been half filled up with dead leaves these once blown into the hollow or dropped from the trees had accumulated the very middle of the line struck on this place and moss the old keeper who was near the center had no sooner cast his eyes into it than he halted and uttered a stentorian halloo well known to sportsmen see ho a dead halt a low murmur and in a very few seconds the line was a circle and all the torches that had not expired held high in a flaming ring over the prettiest little sight that wood had ever presented the old keeper had not given tongue on conjecture like some youthful hound in a little hollow of leaves which the boy had scraped out lay master compton and miss ruperta on their little backs each with an arm round the other's neck enjoying the sweet sound sleep of infancy which neither the horror of their situation babes in the wood nor the shouts of fifty people had in the smallest degree disturbed to be sure they had undergone great fatigue young master wore a coronet of bluebells on his golden bead young miss a wreath of cowslips on her ebon locks the pair were flowers cherubs children everything that stands for young tender and lovely the honest villagers gaped and roared in chorus and held high their torches and gazed with reverential delight not for them was it to finger the little gentlefolks but only to devour them with admiring eyes indeed the picture was carried home to many a humble hearth and is spoken of to this day in huntercombe village but the pale and anxious fathers were in no state to see pictures they only saw their children sir charles and richard bassett came round with the general rush saw and dashed into the pit strange to say neither knew the other was there each seized his child and tore it away from the contact of the other child as if from a viper in which natural but harsh act they saw each other for the first time and their eyes gleamed in a moment with hate and defiance over their loving children here was a picture of a different kind and if the melancholy jaques or any other gentleman with a foible for thinking in a wood had been there methinks he had moralized very prettily on the hideousness of hate and the beauty of the sentiment it had interrupted so fiercely but it escaped this sort of comment for about eight years well all this woke the bairns the lights dazzled them the people scared them each hid a little face on the paternal shoulder the fathers like wild beasts each carrying off a lamb withdrew glaring at each other but the very next moment the stronger and better sentiment prevailed and they kissed and blessed their restored treasures and forgot their enemies for a time sir charles's party followed him and supped at huntercombe every man jack of them reginald who had delivered a terrific cat call now ran off to lady bassett there she was still on her knees found found he shouted she clasped him in her arms and wept for joy my eyes said he what a one you are to cry you come home you'll catch your death o' cold no no take me to my child at once can't be done the governor has carried him off through the wood and i ain't a going to let you travel the wood you come with me we'll go the short cut and be home as soon as them she complied though trembling all over on the way he told her where the children had been discovered and in what attitude little darlings said she but he has frightened his poor mother and nearly broken her heart oh if you cry any more mamma shut up i tell you must i oh yes or you'll catch pepper then he pulled her along gabbling all the time those two swells didn't quarrel after all you see thank heaven but they looked at each other like hobelixes and pulled the kids away like pison ha ha i say the young 'uns ain't of the same mind as the old 'uns i say though our compton is not a bad sort i'm blowed if he hadn't taken off his tippet to put round his gal i say don't you think that little chap has begun rather early why i didn't trouble my head about the gals till i was eleven years old lady bassett was too much agitated to discuss these delicate little questions just then she replied as irrelevantly as ever a lady did oh you good brave clever boy said she then she stopped a moment to kiss him heartily i shall never forget this night dear i shall always make excuses for you oh shall we never get home we shall be home as soon as they will said reginald come on he gabbled to her the whole way but the reader has probably had enough of his millclack lady bassett reached home and had just ordered a large fire in compton's bedroom when sir charles came in bringing the boy the lady ran out screaming and went down on her knees with her arms out as only a mother can stretch them to her child there was not a word of scolding that night he had made her suffer but what of that she had no egotism she was a true mother her boy had been lost and was found and she was the happiest soul in creation but the fathers of these babes in the wood were both intensely mortified and took measures to keep those little lovers apart in future richard bassett locked up his gate sir charles padlocked his and they both told their wives they really must be more vigilant the poor children being in disgrace did not venture to remonstrate but they used often to think of each other and took a liking to the british sunday for then they saw each other in church by and by even that consolation ceased ruperta was sent to school and passed her holidays at the sea side to return to reginald he was compelled to change his clothes that evening but was allowed to sit up and when the heads of the house were a little calmer became the hero of the night sir charles gazing on him with parental pride said reginald you have begun a new life to day and begun it well let us forget the past and start fresh to day with the love and gratitude of both your parents the boy hung his head and said nothing in reply lady bassett came to his assistance he will he will don't say a word about the past he is a good brave beautiful boy and i adore him and i like you mamma said reginald graciously from that day the boy had a champion in lady bassett and heaven knows she had no sinecure poor reginald's virtues were too eccentric to balance his faults for long together his parents could not have a child lost in a wood every day but good taste and propriety can be offended every hour when one is so young active and savage as master reginald he was up at five and doing wrong all day hours in the stables learning to talk horsey and smell dunghilly hours in the village gossiping and romping in good company an owl in bad or low company a cricket a nightingale a magpie he was seen at a neighboring fair playing the fiddle in a booth to dancing yokels and receiving their pence he was caught by moss wiring hairs in bassett's wood within twenty yards of the place where he had found the babes in the wood so nobly remonstrated with tenderly and solemnly he informed sir charles that poaching was a thing he could not live without and he modestly asked to have bassett's wood given him to poach in offering as a consideration to keep all other poachers out as a greater inducement he represented that he should not require a house but only a coarse sheet to stretch across an old saw pit and a pair of blankets for winter use one under one over sir charles was often sad sometimes indignant lady bassett excused each enormity with pathetic ingenuity excused but suffered and indeed pined visibly for all this time he was tormenting her as few women in her position have been tormented her life was a struggle of contesting emotions she was wounded harassed perplexed and so miserable she would have welcomed death that her husband might read that manuscript and cease to suffer and she escape the shame of confessing and of living after it in one word she was expiating neither the excuses she made nor the misery she suffered escaped sir charles he said to her at last my own bella this unhappy boy is killing you dear as he is to me you are dearer i must send him away again he saved our darling said she faintly but she could say no more he had exhausted excuse sir charles made inquiries everywhere and at last his attention was drawn to the following advertisement in the times unmanageable backward or other boys carefully trained and educated by a married rector home comforts moderate terms address dr beecher fennymore cambridgeshire he wrote to this gentleman and the correspondence was encouraging these scapegraces said the artist in tuition are like crab trees abominable till you graft them and then they bear the best fruit while the letters were passing came a climax reckless reginald could keep no bounds intact his inward definition of a boundary was a thing you should go a good way out of your way rather than not overleap accordingly he was often on highmore farm at night and even in highmore garden the boundary wall tempted him so one light but windy night when everybody that could put his head under cover and keep it there did reckless reginald was out enjoying the fresh breezes he mounted the boundary wall of highmore like a cat to see what amusement might offer thus perched he speedily discovered a bright light in highmore dining room he dropped from the wall directly and stole softly over the grass and peered in at the window he saw a table with a powerful lamp on it on that table and gleaming in that light were several silver vessels of rare size and workmanship and mr bassett with his coat off and a green baize apron on was cleaning one of these with brush and leather he had already cleaned the others for they glittered prodigiously reginald's black eye gloated and glittered at this unexpected display of wealth in so dazzling a form but this was nothing to the revelation in store when mr bassett had done with that piece of plate he went to the paneled wall and opened a door so nicely adapted to the panels that a stranger would hardly have discovered it yet it was an enormous door and being opened revealed a still larger closet lined with green velvet and fitted with shelves from floor to ceiling here shone in all their glory the old plate of two good families that is to say half the old plate of the bassetts and all the old plate of the goodwyns from whom came highmore to richard bassett through his mother ruperta goodwyn so named after her grandmother so named after her aunt so named after her godmother so named after her father prince rupert cavalier chemist glass blower etc etc the wall seemed ablaze with suns and moons for many of the chased goblets plates and dishes were silver gilt none of your filmy electro plate but gold laid on thick by the old mercurial process in days when they that wrought in precious metals were honest for want of knowing how to cheat glued to the pane gloating on this constellation of gold suns and silver moons and trembling with bohemian excitement reckless reginald heard not a stealthy step upon the grass behind him he had trusted to a fact in optics forgetting the doctrine of shadows the scotch servant saw from a pantry window the shadow of a cap projected on the grass with a face and part of a body she stepped out and got upon the grass finding it was only a boy she was brave as well as cunning and owing to the wind and his absorption stole on him unheard and pinned him with her strong hands by both his shoulders young hopeful uttered a screech of dismay and administered a back kick that made jessie limp for two days and scream very lustily for the present mr bassett at this dialogue of yells dropped a coffee pot with a crash and a tinkle and ran out directly and secured young hopeful who thereupon began to quake and remonstrate i was only taking a look said he where's the harm of that you were trespassing sir said richard bassett what is the harm of that governor you can come over all our place for what i care thank you i prefer to keep to my own place well i don't i say old chap don't hit me 'twas i put 'em all on the scent of your kid you know so i have heard well then this makes us quits don't it you ain't such a bad sort after all only mind mr bassett if i catch you prying here again that will be a fresh account and i shall open it with a horsewhip he then gave him a little push and the boy fled like the wind when he was gone richard bassett became rather uneasy he had hitherto concealed even from his own family the great wealth his humble home contained his secret was now public reginald had no end of low companions if burglars got scent of this it might be very awkward at last he hit upon a defense he got one of those hooks ending in a screw which are used for pictures and screwed it into the inside of the cupboard door near the top to this he fastened a long piece of catgut and carried it through the floor his bed was just above the cupboard door and he attached the gut to a bell by his bedside by this means nobody could open that cupboard without ringing in his ears jessie told tom tom told maria and harriet harriet and maria told everybody somebody told sir charles he was deeply mortified you young idiot said he would nothing less than this serve your turn must you go and lower me and yourself by giving just offense to my one enemy the man i hate and despise and who is always on the watch to injure or affront me oh who would be a father there pack up your things you will go to school next morning at eight o'clock mr reginald packed accordingly but that did not occupy long so he sallied forth and taking for granted that it was richard bassett who had been so mean as to tell he purchased some paint and brushes and a rope and languished until midnight but when that magic hour came he was brisk as a bee let himself down from his veranda and stole to richard bassett's front door and inscribed thereon in large and glaring letters jerry sneak esq tell tale tit he then returned home much calmed and comforted climbed up his rope and into his room and there slept sweetly as one who had discharged his duty to his neighbor and society in general in the morning however he was very active hurried the grooms and was off before the appointed time sir charles came down to breakfast and lo young hopeful gone without the awkward ceremony of leave taking sir charles found as usual many delicacies on his table and among them one rarer to him than ortolan pin tail or wild turkey in which last my soul delights for he found a letter from richard bassett esq sir some nights since we caught your successor that is to be at my dining room window prying into my private affairs having the honor of our family at heart i was about to administer a little wholesome correction when he reminded me he had been instrumental in tracking miss bassett and thereby rescuing her upon this i was naturally mollified and sent him about his business hoping to have seen the last of him at highmore this morning my door is covered with opprobrious epithets and as mr bassett bought paint and brushes at the shop yesterday afternoon it is doubtless to him i am indebted for them i make no comments i simply record the facts and put them down to your credit and your son's your obedient servant richard bassett lady bassett did not come down to breakfast that morning so sir charles digested this dish in solitude he was furious with reginald but as richard bassett's remonstrance was intended to insult him he wrote back as follows sir i am deeply grieved that a son of mine should descend to look in at your windows or to write anything whatever upon your door and i will take care it shall never recur yours obediently charles dyke bassett this little correspondence was salutary it fanned the coals of hatred between the cousins reckless reginald soon found he had caught a tartar in his new master that gentleman punished him severely for every breach of discipline the study was a cool dark room with one window looking north and that window barred here he locked up the erratic youth for hours at a time upon the slightest escapade reginald wrote a honeyed letter to sir charles bewailing his lot and praying to be removed sir charles replied sternly and sent him a copy of mr richard bassett's letter he wrote to mr beecher at the same time expressing his full approval thus disciplined the boy began to change he became moody sullen silent and even sleepy this was the less wonderful that he generally escaped at night to a gypsy camp and courted a gypsy girl who was nearly as handsome as himself besides being older and far more knowing his tongue went like a mill and the whole tribe soon knew all about him and his parents one morning the servants got up supernaturally early to wash mr reginald was detected stealing back to his roost and reported to the master mr beecher had him up directly locked him into the study alone put the other students into the drawing room and erected bars to his bedroom window a few days of this and he pined like a bird in a cage a few more and his gypsy girl came fortune telling to the servants and wormed out the truth then she came at night under his window and made him a signal he told her his hard case and told her also a resolution he had come to she informed the tribe the tribe consulted a keen saw was flung up to him in two nights he was through the bars the third he was free and joined his sable friends they struck their tents and decamped with horses asses tents and baggage and were many miles away by daybreak without troubling turnpikes the boy left not a line behind him and mr beecher half hoped he might come back still he sent to the nearest station and telegraphed to huntercombe sir charles mounted a fleet horse and rode off at once into cambridgeshire he set inquiries on foot and learned that the boy had been seen consorting with a tribe of gypsies he heard also that these were rather high gypsies many of them foreigners and that they dealt in horses and had a farrier and that one or two of the girls were handsome and also singers sir charles telegraphed for detectives from london wrote to the mayors of towns advertised with full description and large reward and brought such pressure to bear upon the egyptians that the band begin to fear they consulted and took measures for their own security none too soon for they being encamped on grey's common in oxfordshire sir charles and the rural police rode into the camp and demanded young hopeful they were equal to the occasion at first they knew nothing of the matter and with injured innocence invited a full inspection the invitation was accepted then all of a sudden one of the women affected to be struck with an idea it is the young gentleman who wanted to join us in cambridgeshire then all their throats opened at once yes gentleman there was a lovely young gentleman wanted to come with us but we wouldn't have him what could we do with him sir charles left them under surveillance and continued his researches telegraphing lady bassett twice every day a dark stranger came into huntercombe village no longer young but still a striking figure had once no doubt been superlatively handsome even now his long hair was black and his eye could glitter but his life had impregnated his noble features with hardness and meanness his large black eye was restless keen and servile an excellent figure for a painter though born in spain he was not afraid of color had a red cap on his snaky black hair and a striped waistcoat he inquired for mr meyrick's farm he soon found his way thither and asked for mrs meyrick the female servant who opened the door ran her eye up and down him and said bruskly what do you want with her my man because she is busy oh she will see me miss softened by the miss the girl laughed and said what makes you think that my man give her this miss said the gypsy and she will come to me he held her out a dirty crumpled piece of paper sally whose hands were wet from the tub whipped her hand under the corner of her checkered apron and so took the note with a finger and thumb operating through the linen by this means she avoided two evils her fingers did not wet the letter and the letter did not dirty her fingers she took it into the kitchen to her mistress whose arms were deep in a wash tub mrs meyrick had played the fine lady at first starting and for six months would not put her hand to anything but those twin cajolers of the female heart dignity and laziness made her so utterly wretched that she returned to her old habits of work only she combined with it the sweets of domination sally came in and said it's an old gypsy which he have brought you this mrs meyrick instantly wiped the soapsuds from her brown but shapely arms and whipping a wet hand under her apron took the note just as sally had it contained these words only nurse the old romance will tell you all about me reginald she had no sooner read it than she took her sleeves down and whipped her shawl off a peg and put it on and took off her apron and all for an old gypsy no stranger must take her for anything but a lady thus embellished in a turn of the hand she went hastily to the door she and the gypsy both started at sight of each other and mrs meyrick screamed why what brings you here old man said she panting the gypsy answered with oily sweetness the little gentleman sent me my dear why you look like a queen hush said mrs meyrick come in here she made the old gypsy sit down and she sat close to him speak low daddy said she and tell me all about my boy my beautiful boy the old gypsy told mrs meyrick the wrongs of reginald that had driven him to this and she fell to crying and lamenting and inveighing against all concerned schoolmaster sir charles lady bassett and the gypsies them the old man defended and assured her the young gentleman was in good hands and would be made a little king of all the more that keturah had told them there was gypsy blood in him mrs meyrick resented this loudly and then returned to her grief when she had indulged that grief for a long time she felt a natural desire to quarrel with somebody and she actually put on her bonnet and was going to the hall to give lady bassett a bit of her mind for she said that lady had never shown the feelings of a woman for the lamb but she thought better of it and postponed the visit i shall be sure to say something i shall be sorry for after said she so she sat down again and returned to her grief nor could she ever shake it off as thoroughly as she had done any other trouble in her life months after this she said to sally with a burst of tears i never nursed but one and i shall never nurse another and now he is across the seas she kept the old gypsy at the farm or to speak more correctly she made the farm his headquarters she assigned him the only bedroom he would accept viz a cattle shed open on one side she used often to have him into her room when she was alone she gave him some of her husband's clothes and made him wear a decent hat by these means she effaced in some degree his nationality and then she compelled her servants to call him the foreign gent the foreign gent was very apt to disappear in fine weather but rain soon drove him back to her fireside and hunger to her flesh pots on the very day the foreign gent came to meyrick's farm lady bassett had a letter by post from reginald dear mamma i am gone with the gypsies across the water i am sorry to leave you you are the right sort but they tormented me so with their books and their dark rooms it is very unfortunate to be a boy when i am a man i shall be too old to be tormented and then i will come back your dutiful son reginald lady bassett telegraphed sir charles and he returned to huntercombe looking old sad and worn lady bassett set herself to comfort and cheer him and this was her gentle office for many a long month she was the more fit for it that her own health and spirits revived the moment reginald left the country with his friends the gypsies the color crept back to her cheek her spirits revived and she looked as handsome and almost as young as when she married she tasted tranquillity year after year went by without any news of reginald and the hope grew that he would never cross her threshold again and compton be sir charles's heir without any more trouble chapter xli our story now makes a bold skip compton bassett was fourteen years old a youth highly cultivated in mind and trained in body but not very tall and rather effeminate looking because he was so fair and his skin so white for all that he was one of the bowlers in the wolcombe eleven whose cricket ground was the very meadow in which he had erst gathered cowslips with ruperta bassett and he had a canoe which he carried to adjacent streams however narrow and paddled it with singular skill and vigor a neighboring miller suffering under drought was heard to say there ain't water enough to float a duck nought can swim but the dab chicks and muster bassett he was also a pedestrian and got his father to take long walks with him and leave the horses to eat their oats in peace in these walks young master botanized and geologized his own father and sir charles gave him a little politics history and english poetry in return he had a tutor fresh from oxford for the classics one day returning with his father from a walk they met a young lady walking toward them from the village she was tall and a superb brunette now it was rather a rare thing to see a lady walking through that village so both sir charles and his son looked keenly at her as she came toward them compton turned crimson and raised his hat to her rather awkwardly sir charles who did not know the lady from eve saluted her nevertheless and with infinite grace for sir charles in his youth had lived with some of the elite of french society and those gentlemen bow to the person whom their companion bows to sir charles had imported this excellent trait of politeness and always practiced it though not the custom in england the more the pity as soon as the young lady had passed and was out of hearing sir charles said to compton who is that lovely girl why how the boy is blushing oh papa well what is the matter don't you see it is herself come back from school i have no doubt it is herself and not her sister but who is herself ruperta bassett richard bassett's daughter impossible that young lady looks seventeen or eighteen years of age yes but it is ruperta there's nobody like her papa well i suppose i may speak to her now what for she is so beautiful that she really is and therefore i advise you to have nothing to say to her you are not children now you know were you to renew that intimacy you might be tempted to fall in love with her i don't say you would be so mad for you are a sensible boy but still after that little business in the wood but suppose i did fall in love with her then that would be a great misfortune don't you know that her father is my enemy if you were to make any advances to that young lady he would seize the opportunity to affront you and me through you this silenced compton for he was an obedient youth but in the evening he got to his mother and coaxed her to take his part now lady bassett felt the truth of all her husband had said but she had a positive wish the young people should be on friendly terms at all events she wanted the family feud to die with the generation it had afflicted she promised therefore to speak to sir charles and so great was her influence that she actually obtained terms for compton he might speak to miss bassett if he would realize the whole situation and be very discreet and not revive that absurd familiarity into which their childhood had been betrayed she communicated this to him and warned him at the same time that even this concession had been granted somewhat reluctantly and in consideration of his invariable good conduct it would be immediately withdrawn upon the slightest indiscretion oh i will be discretion itself said compton but the warmth with which he kissed his mother gave her some doubts however she was prepared to risk something she had her own views in this matter when he had got this limited permission master compton was not much nearer the mark for he was not to call on the young lady and she did not often walk in the village but he often thought of her her loving sprightly ways seven years ago and the blaze of beauty with which she had returned at last one sunday afternoon she came to church alone when the congregation dispersed he followed her and came up with her but his heart beat violently miss bassett said he timidly she stopped and turned her eyes on him he blushed up to the temples she blushed too but not quite so much i am afraid you don't remember me said the boy sadly yes i do sir said ruperta shyly how you are grown yes sir you are taller than i am and more beautiful than ever no answer but a blush you are not angry with me for speaking to you no sir i wouldn't offend you i am not offended only oh miss bassett of course i know you will never be we shall never be like we used a very deep blush and dead silence you are a grown up young lady and i am only a boy still somehow but it would have been hard if i might not even speak to you would it not yes said the young lady but after some hesitation and only in a whisper i wonder where you walk to i have never seen you out but once no reply to this little feeler then at last compton was discouraged partly by her beauty and size partly by her taciturnity he was silent in return and so in a state of mutual constraint they reached the gate of highmore good by said compton reluctantly good by won't you shake hands she blushed and put out her hand halfway he took it and shook it and so they parted compton said to his mother disconsolately mamma it is all over i have seen her and spoken to her but she has gone off dreadfully why what is the matter she is all changed she is so stupid and dignified got to be she has not a word to say to a fellow perhaps she is more reserved that is natural she is a young lady now then it is a great pity she did not stay as she was oh the bright little darling who'd think she could ever turn into a great stupid dignified thing she is as tall as you mamma indeed she has made use of her time well dear don't take too much notice of her and then you will find she will not be nearly so shy too much notice i shall never speak to her again perhaps i would not be violent one way or the other why not treat her like any other acquaintance next sunday afternoon she came to church alone in spite of his resolution mr compton tried her a second time horror she was all monosyllables and blushes again compton began to find it too up hill at last when they reached highmore gate he lost his patience and said i see how it is i have lost my sweet playmate forever good by ruperta i won't trouble you any more and he held out his hand to the young lady for a final farewell ruperta whipped both her hands behind her back like a school girl and then recovering her dignity cast one swift glance of gentle reproach then suddenly assuming vast stateliness marched into highmore like the mother of a family these three changes of manner she effected all in less than two seconds poor compton went away sorely puzzled by this female kaleidoscope but not a little alarmed and concerned at having mortally offended so much feminine dignity after that he did not venture to accost her for some time but he cast a few sheep's eyes at her in church now ruperta had told her mother all and her mother had not forbidden her to speak to compton but had insisted on reserve and discretion she now told her mother she thought he would not speak to her any more she had snubbed him so dear me said mrs bassett why did you do that can you not be polite and nothing more no mamma why not he is very amiable everybody says so he is but i keep remembering what a forward girl i was and i am afraid he has not forgotten it either and that makes me hate the poor little fellow no not hate him but keep him off i dare say he thinks me a cross ill tempered thing and i am very unkind to him but i can't help it never mind said mrs bassett that is much better than to be too forward papa would never forgive that by and by there was a cricket match in the farmer's meadow highcombe and huntercombe eleven against the town of staveleigh all clubs liked to play at huntercombe because sir charles found the tents and the dinner and the young farmers drank his champagne to their hearts' content ruperta took her maid and went to see the match they found it going against huntercombe the score as follows staveleigh first innings a hundred and forty eight runs huntercombe eighty eight staveleigh second innings sixty runs and only one wicket down and johnson and wright two of their best men well in and masters of the bowling this being communicated to ruperta she became excited and her soul in the game the batters went on knocking the balls about and scored thirteen more before the young lady's eyes oh dear said she what is that boy about why doesn't he bowl they pretend he is a capital bowler at this time compton was standing long field on only farther from the wicket than usual johnson at the wicket bowled to being a hard but not very scientific hitter lifted a half volley ball right over the bowler's head a hit for four but a skyscraper compton started the moment he hit and running with prodigious velocity caught the ball descending within a few yards of ruperta but to get at it he was obliged to throw himself forward into the air he rolled upon the grass but held the ball in sight all the while mr johnson was out and loud acclamations rent the sky compton rose and saw ruperta clapping her hands close by she left off and blushed directly he saw her he blushed too and touched his cap to her with an air half manly half sheepish but did not speak to her this was the last ball of the over and as the ball was now to be delivered from the other wicket compton took the place of long leg the third ball was overpitched to leg and wright who like most country players hit freely to leg turned half and caught this ball exactly right and sent it whizzing for five but the very force of the stroke was fatal to him the ball went at first bound right into compton's hands who instantly flung it back like a catapult at wright's wicket wright having hit for five and being unable to see what had become of the ball started to run as a matter of course but the other batsman seeing the ball go right into long leg's hands like a bullet cried back wright turned and would have got back to his wicket if the ball had required handling by the wicket keeper but by a mixture of skill with luck it came right at the wicket seeing which the wicket keeper very judiciously let it alone and it carried off the bails just half a second before mr wright grounded his bat how's that umpire cried the wicket keeper out said the staveleigh umpire who judged at that end up went the ball into the air amid great excitement of the natives ruperta carried away by the general enthusiasm nodded all sparkling to compton and that made his heart beat and his soul aspire so next over he claimed his rights and took the ball luck still befriended him he bowled four wickets in twelve overs the wicket keeper stumped a fifth the rest were the tail and disposed of for a few runs and the total was no more than huntercombe's first innings our hero then took the bat and made forty seven runs before he was disposed of five wickets down for a hundred and ten runs the match was not won yet nor sure to be but the situation was reversed on going out he was loudly applauded and ruperta naturally felt proud of her admirer being now free he came to her irresolutely with some iced champagne ruperta declined with thanks but he looked so imploringly that she sipped a little and said warmly i hope we shall win and if we do i know whom we shall have to thank and so do i you miss bassett me why what have i done in the matter you brought us luck for one thing you put us on our mettle staveleigh shall never beat me with you looking on ruperta blushed a little for the boy's eyes beamed with fire if i believed that said she i should hire myself out at the next match and charge twelve pairs of gloves you may believe it then ask anybody whether our luck did not change the moment you came then i am afraid it will go now for i am going you will lose us the match if you do said compton i can't help it now you are out it is rather insipid there you see i can pay compliments as well as you then she made a graceful inclination and moved away compton felt his heart ache at parting he took a thought and ran quickly to a certain part of the field ruperta and her attendant walked very slowly homeward compton caught them just at their own gate cousin said he imploringly and held her out a nosegay of cowslips only at that the memories rushed back on her and the girl seemed literally to melt she gave him one look full of womanly sensibility and winning tenderness and said softly thank you cousin compton went away on wings the ice was broken but the next time he met her it had frozen again apparently to be sure she was alone and young ladies will be bolder when they have another person of their own sex with them mr angelo called on sir charles bassett to complain of a serious grievance mr angelo had become zealous and eloquent but what are eloquence and zeal against sex a handsome woman had preached for ten minutes upon a little mound outside the village and had announced she should say a few parting words next sunday evening at six o'clock mr angelo complained of this to lady bassett lady bassett referred him to sir charles mr angelo asked that magistrate to enforce the law against conventicles sir charles said he thought the act did not apply well but said angelo it is on your ground she is going to preach i am the proprietor but the tenant is the owner in law he could warn me off his ground i have no power i fear you have no inclination said angelo nettled not much to tell the truth replied sir charles coolly does it matter so very much who sows the good seed or whether it is flung abroad from a pulpit or a grassy knoll that is begging the question sir charles why assume that it is good seed it is more likely to be tares than wheat in this case and is not that begging the question well i will make it my business to know and if she preaches sedition or heresy or bad morals i will strain my power a little to silence her more than that i really cannot promise you the day is gone by for intolerance intolerance is a bad thing but the absence of all conviction is worse and that is what we are coming to not quite that but the nation has tasted liberty and now every man assumes to do what is right in his own eyes that mean's what is wrong in his neighbor's sir charles thought this neat and laughed good humoredly he asked the rector to dine on sunday at half past seven i shall know more about it by that time said he they dined early on sunday at highmore and ruperta took her maid for a walk in the afternoon and came back in time to hear the female preacher half the village was there already and presently the preacher walked to her station to ruperta's surprise she was a lady richly dressed tall and handsome but with features rather too commanding she had a glove on her left hand and a little bible in her right hand which was large but white and finely formed she delivered a short prayer and opened her text walk honestly not in strife and envying just as the text was given out ruperta's maid pinched her and the young lady looking up saw her father coming to see what was the matter maid was for hiding but ruperta made a wry face blushed and stood her ground how can he scold me when he comes himself she whispered during the sermon of which short as it was i can only afford to give the outline in crept compton bassett and got within three or four of ruperta finally sir charles bassett came up in accordance with his promise to angelo the perfect preacher deals in generalities but strikes them home with a few personalities most clerical preachers deal only in generalities and that is ineffective especially to uncultivated minds mrs marsh as might be expected from her sex went a little too much the other way after a few sensible words pointing out the misery in houses and the harm done to the soul by a quarrelsome spirit she lamented there was too much of it in huntercombe with this opening she went into personalities reminded them of the fight between two farm servants last week one of whom was laid up at that moment in consequence and said she even when it does not come to fighting it poisons your lives and offends your redeemer then she went into the causes and she said drunkenness and detraction were the chief causes of strife and contention she dealt briefly but dramatically with drunkenness and then lashed detraction as follows every class has its vices and detraction is the vice of the poor you are ever so much vainer than your betters you are eaten up with vanity and never give your neighbor a good word i have been in thirty houses and in not one of those houses has any poor man or poor woman spoken one honest word in praise of a neighbor so do not flatter yourselves this is a christian village for it is not the only excuse to be made for you and i fear it is not one that god will accept on his judgment day is that your betters set you a bad example instead of a good one the two principal people in this village are kinsfolk yet enemies and have been enemies for twenty years that's a nice example for two christian gentlemen to set to poor people who they may be sure will copy their sins if they copy nothing else they go to church regularly and believe in the bible and yet they defy both church and bible now i should like to ask those gentlemen a question how do they mean to manage in heaven when the baronet comes to that happy place where all is love will the squire walk out or do they think to quarrel there and so get turned out both of them i don't wonder at your smiling but it is a serious consideration for all that the soul of man is immortal and what is the soul it is not a substantial thing like the body it is a bundle of thoughts and feelings the thoughts we die with in this world we shall wake up with them in the next yet here are two christians loading their immortal souls with immortal hate what a waste of feeling if it must all be flung off together with the body lest it drag the souls of both down to bottomless perdition and what do they gain in this world irritation ill health and misery it is a fact that no man ever reached a great old age who hated his neighbor still less a good old age for if men would look honestly into their own hearts they would own that to hate is to be miserable i believe no men commit a sin for many years without some special warnings and to neglect these is one sin more added to their account such a warning or rather i should say such a pleading of divine love those two gentlemen have had do you remember about eight years ago two children were lost on one day out of different houses in this village a murmur from the crowd perhaps some of you here present were instrumental under god in finding that pretty pair a louder murmur oh don't be afraid to answer me preaching is only a way of speaking and i'm only a woman that is speaking to you for your good tell me we are not in church tied up by stait laced rules to keep men and women from getting within arm's length of one another's souls tell me who saw those two lost children i i i i i roared several voices in reply is it true as a good woman tells me that the innocent darlings had each an arm round the other's neck ay and little coronets of flowers to match their hair that was the girl's doing ay and the little boy had played the man and taken off his tippet to put round the little lady ay with a burst of enthusiasm from the assembled rustics i think i see them myself and the torches lighting up the dewy leaves overhead and that divine picture of innocent love well which was the prettiest sight and the fittest for heaven the hatred of the parents or the affection of the children and now mark what a weapon hatred is in the devil's hands there are only two people in this parish on whom that sight was wasted and those two being gentlemen and men of education would have been more affected by it than humble folk if hell had not been in their hearts for hate comes from hell and takes men down to the place it comes from do you then shun in that one thing the example of your betters and i hope those children will shun it too a father is to be treated with great veneration but above all is our heavenly father and his law and that law what is it what has it been this eighteen hundred years and more why love would you be happy in this world and fit your souls to dwell hereafter even in the meanest of the many mansions prepared above you must above all things be charitable you must not run your neighbor down behind his back or god will hate you you must not wound him to his face or god will hate you you must overlook a fault or two and see a man's bright side and then god will love you if you won't do that much for your neighbor why in heaven's name should god overlook a multitude of sins in you nothing goes to heaven surer than charity and nothing is so fit to sit in heaven st paul had many things to be proud of and to praise in himself things that the world is more apt to admire than christian charity the sweetest but humblest of all the christian graces st paul i say was a bulwark of learning an anchor of faith a rock of constancy a thunder bolt of zeal yet see how he bestows the palm 'knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but prophecies they shall fail tongues they shall cease knowledge it shall vanish away and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity' the fair orator delivered these words with such fire such feeling such trumpet tones and heartfelt eloquence that for the first time those immortal words sounded in these village ears true oracles of god then without pause she went on so let us lift our hearts in earnest prayer to god that in this world of thorns and tempers and trials and troubles and cares he will give us the best cure for all the great sweetener of this mortal life the sure forerunner of heaven his most excellent gift of charity then in one generous burst she prayed for love divine and there was many a sigh and many a tear and at the close an amen such as alas we shall never i fear hear burst from a hundred bosoms where men repeat beautiful but stale words and call it prayer the preacher retired but the people still lingered spell bound and then arose that buzz which shows that the words have gone home as for richard bassett he had turned on his heel indignant as soon as the preacher's admonitions came his way sir charles bassett stood his ground rather longer being steeled by the conviction that the quarrel was none of his seeking moreover he was not aware what a good friend this woman had been to him nor what a good wife she had been to marsh this seventeen years his mind therefore made a clear leap from rhoda somerset the vixen of hyde park and mayfair to this preacher and he could not help smiling than which a worse frame for receiving unpalatable truths can hardly be conceived and so the elders were obdurate but compton and ruperta had no armor of old age egotism or prejudice to turn the darts of honest eloquence they listened as to the voice of an angel they gazed as on the face of an angel and when those silvery accents ceased they turned toward each other and came toward each other with the sweet enthusiasm that became their years oh cousin ruperta quavered compton 'oh cousin compton cried ruperta the tears trickling down her lovely cheeks they could not say any more for ever so long ruperta spoke first she gave a final gulp and said i will go and speak to her and thank her oh miss ruperta we shall be too late for tea suggested the maid tea said ruperta our souls are before our tea i must speak to her or else my heart will choke me and kill me i will go and so will compton oh yes said compton and they hurried after the preacher they came up with her flushed and panting and now it was compton's turn to be shy the lady was so tall and stately too but ruperta was not much afraid of anything in petticoats oh madam said she if you please may we speak to you mrs marsh turned round and her somewhat aquiline features softened instantly at the two specimens of beauty and innocence that had run after her certainly my young friends and she smiled maternally on them she had children of her own who do you think we are we are the two naughty children you preached about so beautifully what you the babes in the wood yes madam it was a long long while ago and we are fifteen now are we not cousin compton yes madam and we are both so unhappy at our parents' quarreling at least i am and so am i and we came to thank you didn't we compton yes ruperta and to ask your advice how are we to make our parents be friends old people will not be advised by young ones they look down on us so it is dreadful my dear young lady said mrs marsh i will try and answer you but let me sit down a minute for after preaching i am apt to feel a little exhausted now sit beside me and give me each a hand if you please well my dears i have been teaching you a lesson and now you teach me one and that is how much easier it is to preach reconciliation and charity than it is to practice it under certain circumstances however my advice to you is first to pray to god for wisdom in this thing and then to watch every opportunity dissuade your parents from every unkind act don't be afraid to speak with the word of god at your back i know that you have no easy task before you sir charles bassett and mr bassett were both among my hearers and both turned their backs on me and went away unsoftened they would not give me a chance would not hear me to an end and i am not a wordy preacher neither here an interruption occurred ruperta so shy and cold with compton flung her arms round mrs marsh's neck with the tears in her eyes and kissed her eagerly yes my dear said mrs marsh after kissing her in turn i was a little mortified but that was very weak and foolish i am sorry for their own sakes they would not stay it was the word of god but they saw only the unworthy instrument well then my dears you have a hard task but you must work upon your mothers and win them to charity ah that will be easy enough my mother has never approved this unhappy quarrel no more has mine is it so then you must try and get the two ladies to speak to each other but something tells me that a way will be opened have patience have faith and do not mind a check or two but persevere remembering that 'blessed are the peace makers' she then rose and they took leave of her give me a kiss children said she you have done me a world of good my own heart often flags on the road and you have warmed and comforted it god bless you and so they parted compton and ruperta walked homeward ruperta was very thoughtful and compton could only get monosyllables out of her this discouraged and at last vexed him what have i done said he that you will speak to anybody but me don't be cross child said she but answer me a question did you put your tippet round me in that wood i suppose so oh then you don't remember doing it eh no that i don't then what makes you think you did because they say so because i must have been such an awful cad if i didn't and i was always much fonder of you than you were of me my tippet i'd give my head sooner than any harm should come to you ruperta ruperta made no reply but being now at highmore she put out her hand to him and turned her head away he kissed her hand devotedly and so they parted compton told lady bassett all that happened and ruperta told mrs bassett those ladies readily promised to be on the side of peace but they feared it could only be the work of time and said so by and by compton got impatient and told ruperta he had thought of a way to compel their fathers to be friends i am afraid you won't like the idea at first said he but the more you think of it the more you will see it is the surest way of all well but what is it you must let me marry you ruperta stared and began to blush crimson will you cousin of course not child the idea oh ruperta cried the boy in dismay surely you don't mean to marry anybody else but me would that make you very unhappy then you know it would wretched for my life i should not like to do that but i disapprove of early marriages i mean to wait till i'm nineteen and that is three years nearly it is a fearful time but if you will promise not to marry anybody else i suppose i shall live through it ruperta though she made light of compton's offer was very proud of it it was her first she told her mother directly mrs bassett sighed and said that was too blessed a thing ever to happen why not said ruperta how could it said mrs bassett with everybody against it but poor little me compton assures me that lady bassett wishes it indeed but sir charles and papa ruperta oh compton must talk sir charles over and i will persuade papa i'll begin this evening when he comes home from london accordingly as he was sitting alone in the dining room sipping his glass of port ruperta slipped away from her mother's side and found him his face brightened at the sight of her for he was extremely fond and proud of this girl for whom he would not have the bells rung when she was born she came and hung round his neck a little and kissed him and said softly dear papa i have something to tell you i have had a proposal richard bassett stared what of marriage ruperta nodded archly to a child like you scandalous no for after all you look nineteen or twenty and who is the highwayman that thinks to rob me of my precious girl well papa whoever he is he will have to wait three years and so i told him it is my cousin compton what cried richard bassett so loudly that the girl started back dismayed that little monkey have the impudence to offer marriage to my daughter surely ruperta you have offered him no encouragement n no your mother promised me nothing but common civility should pass between you and that young gentleman she promised for me but she could not promise for him poor little fellow marry a son of the man who has robbed and insulted your father oh papa is it so are you sure you did not begin if you can think that it is useless to say more i thought ill fortune had done its worst but no blow upon blow and wound upon wound don't spare me child nobody else has and why should you marry my enemy's son his younger son and break your father's heart at this what could a sensitive girl of sixteen do but burst out crying and promise round her father's neck never to marry any one whom he disliked when she had made this promise her father fondled and petted her and his tenderness consoled her for she was not passionately in love with her cousin yet she cried a good deal over the letter in which she communicated this to compton he lay in wait for her but she baffled him for three weeks after that she relaxed her vigilance for she had no real wish to avoid him and was curious to see whether she had cured him he met her and his conduct took her by surprise he was pale and looked very wretched he said solemnly were you jesting with me when you promised to marry no one but me no compton but you know i could never marry you without papa's consent of course not but what i fear he might wish you to marry somebody else then i should refuse i will never break my word to you cousin i am not in love with you you are too young for that but somehow i feel i could not make you unhappy can't you trust my word you might i come of the same people as you why do you look so pale we are very unhappy then the tears began to steal down her cheeks and compton's soon followed compton consulted his mother she told him with a sigh she was powerless sir charles might yield to her but she had no power to influence mr bassett at present the time may come said she she could not take a very serious view of this amour except with regard to its pacific results so mr bassett's opposition chilled her in the matter while things were so something occurred that drove all these minor things out of her distracted heart one summer evening as she and sir charles and compton sat at dinner a servant came in to say there was a stranger at the door and he called himself bassett what is he like said lady bassett turning pale he looks like a foreigner my lady he says he is mr bassett repeated the man with a scandalized air sir charles got up directly and hurried to the hall door compton followed to the door only and looked sure enough it was reginald full grown and bold as handsome as ever and darker than ever in that moment his misconduct in running away never occurred either to sir charles or compton all was eager and tremulous welcome the hall rang with joy they almost carried him into the dining room the first thing they saw was a train of violet colored velvet half hidden by the table compton ran forward with a cry of dismay it was lady bassett in a dead swoon her face as white as her neck and arms and these as white and smooth as satin chapter xlii lady bassett was carried to her room and did not reappear she kept her own apartments and her health declined so rapidly that sir charles sent for dr willis he prescribed for the body but the disease lay in the mind martyr to an inward struggle she pined visibly and her beautiful eyes began to shine like stars preternaturally large she was in a frightful condition she longed to tell the truth and end it all but then she must lose her adored husband's respect and perhaps his love and she had not the courage she saw no way out of it but to die and leave her confession and as she felt that the agony of her soul was killing her by degrees she drew a somber resignation from that she declined to see reginald she could not bear the sight of him compton came to her many times a day with a face full of concern and even terror but she would not talk to him of herself he brought her all the news he heard having no other way to cheer her one day he told her there were robbers about two farmhouses had been robbed a thing not known in these parts for many years lady bassett shuddered but said nothing but by and by her beloved son came to her in distress with a grief of his own ruperta bassett was now the beauty of the county and it seems mr rutland had danced with her at her first ball and been violently smitten with her he had called more than once at highmore and his attentions were directly encouraged by mr bassett now mr rutland was heir to a peerage and also to considerable estates in the county compton was sick at heart and being young saw his life about to be blighted so now he was pale and woe begone and told her the sad news with such deep sighs and imploring tearful eyes that all the mother rose in arms ah said she they say to themselves that i am down and cannot fight for my child but i would fight for him on the edge of the grave let me think all by myself dear come back to me in an hour i shall do something your mother is a very cunning woman for those she loves compton kissed her gown a favorite action of his for he worshiped her and went away the invalid laid her hollow cheek upon her wasted hand and thought with all her might by degrees her extraordinary brain developed a twofold plan of action and she proceeded to execute the first part being the least difficult though even that was not easy and brought a vivid blush to her wasted cheek she wrote to mrs bassett madam i am very ill and life is uncertain something tells me you like me regret the unhappy feud between our houses if this is so it would be a consolation to me to take you by the hand and exchange a few words as we already have a few kind looks yours respectfully bella bassett she showed this letter to compton and told him he might send a servant with it to highmore at once oh mamma said he i never thought you would do that how good you are you couldn't ask ruperta could you just in a little postscript you know lady bassett shook her head that would not be wise my dear let me hook that fish for you not frighten her away great was the astonishment at highmore when a blazing footman knocked at the door and handed jessie the letter with assumed nonchalance then stalked away concealing with professional art his own astonishment at what he had done it was no business of jessie's to take letters into the drawing room she would have deposited any other letter on the hall table but she brought this one in and standing at the door exclaimed here a letter fr' huntercombe richard bassett mrs bassett and ruperta all turned upon her with one accord from where fr' huntercombe itsel' et isna for you nor for you missy et's for the mesterress she marched proudly up to mrs bassett and laid the letter down on the table then drew back a step or two and being scotch coolly waited to hear the contents richard basset being english told her she need not stay mrs bassett cast a bewildered look at her husband and daughter then opened the letter quietly read it quietly and having read it took out her handkerchief and began to cry quietly ruperta cried oh mamma and in a moment had one long arm round her mother's neck while the other hand seized the letter and she read it aloud cheek to cheek but before she got to an end her mother's tears infected her and she must whimper too here are a couple of geese said richard bassett can't you write a civil reply to a civil letter without sniveling i'll answer the letter for you no said mrs bassett richard was amazed ruperta ditto the little woman had never dealt in noes least of all to her husband and besides this was such a plump no it came out of her mouth like a marble i think the sound surprised even herself a little for she proceeded to justify it at once i have been a better wife than a christian this many years but there's a limit and richard i should never have married you if you had told me we were to be at war all our lives with our next neighbor that everybody respects to live in the country and not speak to our only neighbor that is a life i never would have left my father's house for not that i complain if you have been bitter to them you have always been good and kind to me and i hope i have done my best to deserve it but when a sick lady and perhaps dying holds out her hand to me write her one of your cold blooded letters that i won't reply my reply will be just putting on my bonnet and going to her this afternoon it is passion week too and that's not a week to play the heathen poor lady i've seen in her sweet eyes this many years that she would gladly be friends with me and she never passed me close but she bowed to me in church or out even when we were at daggers drawn she is a lady a real lady every inch but it is not that altogether no if a sick woman called me to her bedside this week i'd go whether she wrote from huntercombe hall or the poorest house in the place else how could i hope my saviour would come to my bedside at my last hour this honest burst from a meek lady who never talked nonsense to be sure but seldom went into eloquence staggered richard bassett and enraptured ruperta so that she flung both arms round her mother's neck and cried oh mamma i always thought you were the best woman in england and now i know it well well well said richard kindly enough then to ruperta did i ever say she was not the best woman in england so you need not set up your throats neck and neck at me like two geese at a fox unfortunately she is the simplest woman in england as well as the best and she is going to visit the cunningest that lady bassett will turn our mother inside out in no time i wish you would go with her you are a shrewd girl my daughter will not go till she is asked said mrs bassett firmly in that case said richard dryly let us hope the lord will protect you since it is for love of him you go into a she fox's den no reply was vouchsafed to this aspiration the words being the words of faith but the voice the voice of skepticism mrs bassett put on her bonnet and went to huntercombe hall after a very short delay she was ushered upstairs to the room where lady bassett was lying on a sofa lady bassett heard her coming and rose to receive her she made mrs bassett a court courtesy so graceful and profound that it rather frightened the little woman seeing which lady bassett changed her style and came forward extending both hands with admirable grace and gentle amity not overdone mrs bassett gave her both hands and they looked full at each other in silence till the eyes of both ladies began to fill you would have come like this years ago at a word faltered lady bassett yes gulped mrs bassett then there was another long pause oh lady bassett what a life it is a wonder it has not killed us both it will kill one of us not if i can help it god bless you for saying so dear madam sit by me and let me hold the hand i might have had years ago if i had had the courage why should you take the blame said mrs bassett we have both been good wives too obedient perhaps but to have to choose between a husband's commands and god's law that is a terrible thing for any poor woman it is indeed then there was another silence and an awkward pause mrs bassett broke it with some hesitation i hope lady bassett your present illness is not in any way i hope you do not fear anything more from my husband oh mrs bassett how can i help fearing it especially if we provoke him mr reginald bassett has returned and you know he once gave your husband cause for just resentment well but he is older now and has more sense even if he should ruperta and i must try and keep the peace ruperta i wish i had asked you to bring her with you but i feared to ask too much at once i'll send her to you to morrow lady bassett no bring her then tell me your hour yes and i will send somebody out of the way i want you both to myself while this conversation was going on at huntercombe richard bassett being left alone with his daughter proceeded to work with his usual skill upon her young mind he reminded her of mr rutland's prospects and said he hoped to see her a countess and the loveliest jewel of the peerage he then told her mr rutland was coming to stay a day or two next week and requested her to receive him graciously she promised that at once that said he will be a much better match for you than the younger son of sir charles bassett however my girl is too proud to go into a family where she is not welcome much too proud for that said ruperta he left her smarting under that suggestion while he was smoking his cigar in the garden mrs bassett came home she was in raptures with lady bassett and told her daughter all that had passed and in conclusion that she had promised lady bassett to take her to huntercombe to morrow me dear cried ruperta why what can she want of me all i know is her ladyship wishes very much to see you in my opinion you will be very welcome to poor lady bassett is she very ill mrs bassett shook her head she is much changed she says she should be better if we were all at peace but i don't know oh mamma i wish it was to morrow they went to huntercombe next day and ill as she was lady bassett received them charmingly she was startled by ruperta's beauty and womanly appearance but too well bred to show it or say it all in a moment she spoke to the mother first but presently took occasion to turn to the daughter and to say may i hope miss bassett that you are on the side of peace like your dear mother and myself i am said ruperta firmly i always was especially after that beautiful sermon you know mamma says the proud mother you might tell lady bassett you think it is your mission to reunite your father and sir charles mamma said ruperta reproachfully that was to stop her mouth if you tell all the wild things i say to you her ladyship will think me very presumptuous no no said lady bassett enthusiasm is not presumption enthusiasm is beautiful and the brightest flower of youth i am glad you think so lady bassett for people who have no enthusiasm seem very hard and mean to me and so they are said lady bassett warmly but i have no time to record the full details of the conversation i can only present the general result lady bassett thought ruperta a beautiful and noble girl that any house might be proud to adopt and ruperta was charmed by lady bassett's exquisite manners and touched and interested by her pale yet still beautiful face and eyes they made friends but it was not till the third visit when many kind things had passed between them that lady bassett ventured on the subject she had at heart my dear said she to ruperta when i first saw you i wondered at my son compton's audacity in loving a young lady so much more advanced than himself but now i must be frank with you i think the poor boy's audacity was only a proper courage he has all my sympathy and if he is not quite indifferent to you let me just put in my word and say there is not a young lady in the world i could bear for my daughter in law now i have seen and talked with you my dear thank you lady bassett said mrs bassett and since you have said so much let me speak my mind so long as your son is attached to my daughter i could never welcome any other son in law i have got the tippet lady bassett looked at ruperta for an explanation ruperta only blushed and looked uncomfortable she hated all allusion to the feats of her childhood mrs bassett saw lady bassett's look of perplexity and said eagerly you never missed it all the better i thought i would keep it for a peacemaker partly my dear friend said lady bassett you are speaking riddles to me what tippet the tippet your son took off his own shoulders and put it round my girl that terrible night they were lost in the wood forgive me keeping it lady bassett i know i was little better than a thief but it was only a tippet to you and to me it was much more ah lady bassett i have loved your darling boy ever since you can't wonder you are a mother and turning suddenly on ruperta why do you keep saying he is only a boy if he was man enough to do that at seven years of age he must have a manly heart no i couldn't bear the sight of any other son in law and when you are a mother you'll understand many things and for one you'll under stand why i'm so fool ish seeing the sweet boy's mother ready to cry too oh oh oh lady bassett held out her arms to her and the mothers had a sweet cry together in each other's arms ruperta's eyes were wet at this but she told her mother she ought not to agitate lady bassett and she so ill and that is true my good sensible girl said mrs bassett but it has lain in my heart these nine years and i could not keep it to myself any longer but you are a beauty and a spoiled child and so i suppose you think nothing of his giving you his tippet to keep you warm don't say that mamma said ruperta reproachfully i spoke to dear compton about it not long ago he had forgotten all about it even all the more to his credit but don't you ever forget it my own girl i never will mamma by degrees the three became so unreserved that ruperta was gently urged to declare her real sentiments by this time the young beauty was quite cured of her fear lest she should be an unwelcome daughter in law but there was an obstacle in her own mind she was a frank courageous girl but this appeal tried her hard she blushed fixed her eyes steadily on the ground and said pretty firmly and very slowly i had always a great affection for my cousin compton and so i have now but i am not in love with him he is but a boy now i a glance at the large mirror and a superb smile of beauty and conscious womanhood completed the sentence he will get older every day said mrs bassett and so shall i but you will not look older and he will you have come to your full growth he hasn't i agree with the dear girl said lady bassett adroitly compton with his fair hair looks so young it would be ridiculous at present but it is possible to be engaged and wait a proper time for marriage what i fear is lest you should be tempted by some other offer to speak plainly i hear that mr rutland pays his addresses to you and visits at highmore yes he has been there twice he is welcome to your father and his prospects are dazzling and he is not a boy for he has long mustaches i am not dazzled by his mustaches and still less by his prospects said the fair young beauty you are an extraordinary girl that she is said mrs bassett her father has no more power over her than i have oh mamma am i a disobedient girl then no no only in this one thing i see you will go your own way lady bassett put in her word well but this one thing is the happiness or misery of her whole life i cannot blame her for looking well before she leaps a grateful look from ruperta's glorious eyes repaid the speaker but said lady bassett tenderly it is something to have two mothers when you marry instead of one and you would have two my love i would try and live for you this touched ruperta to the heart she curled round lady bassett's neck and they kissed each other like mother and daughter this is too great a temptation said ruperta yes i will engage myself to cousin compton if papa's consent can be obtained without his consent i could not marry any one nobody can obtain it if you cannot said mrs bassett ruperta shook her head mark my words mamma it will take me years to gain it papa is as obstinate as a mule to be sure i am as obstinate as fifty it shall not take years nor yet months said lady bassett i know mr bassett's objection and i will remove it cost me what it may this speech surprised the other two ladies so they made no reply said lady bassett firmly do you pledge yourself to me if i can obtain mr bassett's consent i do said ruperta but you think my power with your father must be smaller than yours i hope to show you you are mistaken the ladies rose to go lady bassett took leave of them thus good by my most valued friend and sister in sorrow good by my dear daughter at the gate of huntercombe whom should they meet but compton bassett looking very pale and unhappy he was upon honor not to speak to ruperta but he gazed on her with a wistful and terrified look that was very touching she gave him a soft pitying smile in return that drove him almost wild with hope that night richard bassett sat in his chair gloomy when his wife and daughter spoke to him in their soft accents he returned short surly answers evidently a storm was brewing at last it burst he had heard of ruperta's repeated visits to huntercombe hall you are not dealing fairly with me you two said he i allowed you to go once to see a woman that says she is very ill but i warned you she was the cunningest woman in creation and would make a fool of you both and now i find you are always going this will not do she is netting two simple birds that i have the care of now listen to me i forbid you two ever to set foot in that house again do you hear me we hear you papa said mrs bassett quietly we must be deaf if we did not ruperta kept her countenance with difficulty it is not a request it is a command mrs bassett for once in her life fired up and a most tyrannical one said she ruperta put her hand before her mother's mouth then turned to her father there was no need to express your wish so harshly papa we shall obey then she whispered her mother and mr rutland shall pay for it mrs bassett communicated this behest to lady bassett in a letter then lady bassett summoned all her courage and sent for her son compton compton said she i must speak to reginald can you find him oh yes i can find him i am sorry to say anybody can find him at this time of day why where is he i hardly like to tell you do you think his peculiarities have escaped me at the public house ask him to come to me compton went to the public house and there to his no small disgust found mr reginald bassett playing the fiddle and four people men and women dancing to the sound while one or two more smoked and looked on compton restrained himself till the end of that dance and then stepped up to reginald and whispered him mamma wants to see you directly tell her i'm busy i shall tell her nothing of the kind you know she is very ill and has not seen you yet and now she wants to so come along at once like a good fellow youngster said reginald it is a rule with me never to leave a young woman for an old one not for your mother no nor my grandmother either then you were born without a heart but you shall come whether you like it or not though i have to drag you there by the throat learn to spell 'able' first i'll spell it on your head if you don't come oh that is the game young un is it yes well don't let us have a shindy on the bricks there is a nice little paddock outside come out there and i'll give you a lesson thank you i don't feel inclined to assist you in degrading our family chaps that are afraid to fight shouldn't threaten come now the first knock down blow shall settle it if i win you stay here and dance with us if you win i go to the old woman compton consented somewhat reluctantly but to do him justice his reluctance arose entirely from his sense of relationship and not from any fear of his senior the young gentlemen took off their coats and proceeded to spar without any further ceremony reginald whose agility was greater than his courage danced about on the tips of his toes and succeeded in planting a tap or two on compton's cheek compton smarted under these and presently in following his antagonist who fought like a shadow he saw ruperta and her mother looking horror stricken over the palings infuriated with reginald for this exposure he rushed in at him received a severe cut over the eye but dealt him with his mighty anglo saxon arm a full straightforward smasher on the forehead which knocked him head over heels like a nine pin that active young man picked himself up wondrous slowly rheumatism seemed to have suddenly seized his well oiled joints he then addressed his antagonist in his most ingratiating tones all right sir said he you are the best man i'll go to the old lady this minute i'll see you go said compton sternly and mind i can run as well as hit so none of your gypsy tricks with me then he came sheepishly to the palings and said it is not my fault miss bassett he would not come to mamma without and she wants to speak to him oh he is hurt he is wounded cried ruperta come here to me he came to her and she pressed her white handkerchief tenderly on his eyebrow it was bleeding a little well are you coming said reginald ironically or do you like young women better than old ones compton instantly drew back a little made two steps laid his hand on the palings vaulted over and followed reginald that's your boy said mrs bassett ruperta made no reply but began to gulp what is the matter darling the fighting the blood said ruperta sobbing mrs bassett drew her on one side and soon soothed her when their gentle bosoms got over their agitation they rather enjoyed the thing especially ruperta she detested reginald for his character and for having insulted her father all of a sudden she cried out he has taken my handkerchief how dare he and she affected anger never mind dear said mrs bassett coolly we have got his tippet chapter xliii could any one have looked through the keyhole at lady bassett waiting for reginald he would have seen by the very movements of her body the terrible agitation of the mind she rose she sat down she walked about with wild energy she dropped on the sofa and appeared to give it up as impossible but ere long that deadly languor gave way to impatient restlessness again at last her quick ear heard a footstep in the corridor accompanied by no rustle of petticoats and yet the footstep was not compton's instantly she glanced with momentary terror toward the door there was a tap she sat down and said with a tone from which all agitation was instantly banished come in the door opened and the swarthy reginald diabolically handsome with his black snaky curls entered the room she rose from her chair and fixed her great eyes on him as if she would read him soul and body before she ventured to speak here i am mamma sorry to see you look so ill thank you my dear said lady bassett without relaxing for a moment that searching gaze she said still covering him with her eye would you cure me if you could to appreciate this opening and lady bassett's sweet engaging manner you must understand that this young man was in her eyes a sort of black snake her flesh crept with fear and repugnance at the sight of him yet that is how she received him being a mother defending her favorite son of course i would said reginald just you tell me how excellent words but the lady's calm infallible eye saw a cunning twinkle in those black twinkling orbs young as he was he was on his guard and waiting for her nor was this surprising reginald naturally intelligent had accumulated a large stock of low cunning in his travels and adventures with the gypsies a smooth and cunning people lady bassett's fainting upon his return his exclusion from her room and one or two minor circumstances had set him thinking the moment she saw that look lady bassett with swift tact glided away from the line she had intended to open and after merely thanking him and saying i believe you dear though she did not believe him she resumed in a very impressive tone you see me worse than ever to day because my mind is in great trouble the time is come when i must tell you a secret which will cause you a bitter disappointment why i send for you is to see whether i cannot do something for you to make you happy in spite of that cruel disappointment not a word from reginald mr bassett forgive me if you can for i am the most miserable woman in england you are not the heir to this place you are not sir charles bassett's son what shouted the young man her fortitude gave way for a moment she shook her head in confirmation of what she had said and hid her burning face and scalding tears in her white and wasted hands there was a long silence reginald was asking himself if this could be true or was it a maneuver to put her favorite compton over his head lady bassett looked up and saw this paltry suspicion in his face she dried her tears directly and went to a bureau unlocked it and produced the manuscript confession she had prepared for her husband she bade reginald observe the superscription and the date when he had done so she took her scissors and opened it for him read what i wrote to my beloved husband at a time when i expected soon to appear before my judge she then sank upon the sofa and lay there like a log only from time to time during the long reading tears trickled from her eyes reginald read the whole story and saw the facts must be true more than that being young and a man he could not entirely resist the charm of a narrative in which a lady told at full the love the grief the terror the sufferings of her heart and the terrible temptation under which she had gone astray he laid it down at last and drew a long breath it's a devil of a job for me said he but i can't blame you you sold that dick bassett and i hate him but what is to become of me what i offer you is a life in which you will be happier than you ever could be at huntercombe i mean to buy you vast pasture fields in australia and cattle to feed those noble pastures will be bounded only by wild forests and hills you will have swift horses to ride over your own domain or to gallop hundreds of miles at a stretch if you like no confinement there no fences and boundaries all as free as air no monotony one week you can dig for gold another you can ride among your flocks another you can hunt all this in a climate so delightful that you can lie all night in the open air without a blanket under a new firmament of stars not one of which illumines the dull nights of europe the bait was too tempting well you are the right sort cried reginald but presently he began to doubt but all that will cost a lot of money it will but i have a great deal of money reginald thought and said suspiciously i don't know why you should do all this for me do you not what when i have brought you into this family and encouraged you in such vast expectations could i in honor and common humanity let you fall into poverty and neglect no i have many thousand pounds all my own and you will have them all and perhaps waste them all but it will take you some time because while you are wasting i shall be saving more for you then there was a pause each waiting for the other then lady bassett said quietly and with great apparent composure of course there is a condition attached to all this what is that i must receive from you a written paper signed by yourself and by mrs meyrick acknowledging that you are not sir charles's son but distinctly pledging yourself to keep the secret so long as i continue to furnish you with the means of living you hesitate is it not fair well it looks fair but it is an awkward thing signing a paper of that sort you doubt me sir you think that because i have told one great falsehood from good but erring motives i may break faith with you do not insult me with these doubts sir try and understand that there are ladies and gentlemen in the world though you prefer gypsies have you forgotten that night when you laid me under so deep a debt and i told you i never would forget it from that day was i not always your friend was i not always the one to make excuses for you reginald assented to that then trust me i pledge you my honor that i am this day the best friend you ever had or ever can have refuse to sign that paper and i shall soon be in my grave leaving behind me my confession and other evidence on which you will be dismissed from this house with ignominy and without a farthing for your best friend will be dead and you will have killed her he looked at her full he said with a shade of compunction i am not a gentleman but you are a lady i'll trust you i'll sign anything you like that confidence becomes you said lady bassett and now i have no objection to show you i deserve it here is a letter to mr rolfe by which you may learn i have already placed three thousand pounds to his account to be laid out by him for your benefit in australia where he has many confidential friends and this is a check for five hundred pounds i drew in your favor yesterday do me the favor to take it he did her that favor with sparkling eyes now here is the paper i wish you to sign but your signature will be of little value to me without mary meyrick's oh she will sign it directly i have only to tell her are you sure men can be brought to take a dispassionate view of their own interest but women are not so wise take it and try her if she refuses bring her to me directly do you understand otherwise in one fatal hour her tongue will ruin you and destroy me impressed with these words reginald hurried to mrs meyrick and told her in an off hand way she must sign that paper directly she looked at it and turned very white but went on her guard directly sign such a wicked lie as that said she that i never will you are his son and huntercombe shall be yours she is an unnatural mother gammon said reginald you might as well say a fox is the son of a gander come now i am not going to let you cut my throat with your tongue sign at once or else come to her this moment and tell her so that i will said mary meyrick and give her my mind this doughty resolution was a little shaken when she cast eyes upon lady bassett and saw how wan and worn she looked she moderated her violence and said sullenly sorry to gainsay you my lady and you so ill but this is a paper i never can sign it would rob him of huntercombe i'd sooner cut my hand off at the wrist nonsense mary said lady bassett contemptuously she then proceeded to reason with her but it was no use mary would not listen to reason and defied her at last in a loud voice very well said lady bassett then since you will not do it my way it shall be done another way i shall put my confession in sir charles's hands and insist on his dismissing him from the house and you from your farm it will kill me and the money i intended for reginald i shall leave to compton these are idle words my lady you daren't i dare anything when once i make up my mind to die she rang the bell mary meyrick affected contempt a servant came to the door request sir charles to come to me immediately chapter xliv don't you be a fool said reginald to his nurse sir charles will send you to prison for it said lady bassett for what i done along with you oh he will not punish his wife he will look out for some other victim sign you d d old fool cried reginald seizing mary meyrick roughly by the arm strange to say lady bassett interfered with a sort of majestic horror she held up her hand and said do not dare to lay a finger on her then mary burst into tears and said she would sign the paper while she was signing it sir charles's step was heard in the corridor he knocked at the door just as she signed reginald had signed already lady bassett put the paper into the manuscript book and the book into the bureau and said come in with an appearance of composure belied by her beating heart here is mrs meyrick my dear in those few seconds so perfect a liar as mary meyrick had quite recovered herself if you please sir said she i be come to ast if you will give us a new lease for ourn it is run out you had better talk to the steward about that very well sir and she made her courtesy reginald remained not knowing exactly what to do my dear said lady bassett reginald has come to bid us good by he is going to visit mr rolfe and take his advice if you have no objection none whatever and i hope he will treat it with more respect than he does mine reginald shrugged his shoulders and was going out when lady bassett said won't you kiss me reginald as you are going away he came to her she kissed him and whispered in his ear be true to me as i will be to you then he left her and she felt like a dead thing with exhaustion she lay on the sofa and sir charles sat beside her and made her drink a glass of wine she lay very still that afternoon but at night she slept a load was off her mind for the present next day she was so much better she came down to dinner what she now hoped was that entire separation coupled with the memory of the boy's misdeeds would cure sir charles entirely of his affection for reginald and so that after about twenty years more of conjugal fidelity she might find courage to reveal to her husband the fault of her youth at a time when all its good results remained to help excuse it and all its bad results had vanished such was the plan this extraordinary woman conceived and its success so far had a wonderful effect on her health but a couple of days passed and she did not hear either from reginald or mr rolfe that made her a little anxious on the third day compton asked her with an angry flush on his brow whether she had not sent reginald up to london yes dear said lady bassett well he is not gone then oh he is living at his nurse's i saw him talking to an old gypsy that lives on the farm lady bassett groaned but said nothing never mind mamma said compton your other children must love you all the more this news caused lady bassett both anxiety and terror she divined bad faith and all manner of treachery none the less terrible for being vague down went her health again and her short lived repose meantime reginald in reality was staying at the farm on a little business of his own he had concerted an expedition with the foreign gent and was waiting for a dark and gusty night he had undertaken this expedition with mixed motives spite and greed especially the latter he would never have undertaken it with a pound check in his pocket but some minds are so constituted they cannot forego a bad design once formed so mr reginald persisted though one great motive existed no longer on this expedition it is now our lot to accompany him the night was favorable and at about two o'clock reginald and the foreign gent stood under richard bassett's dining room window with crape over their eyes noses and mouths and all manner of unlawful implements in their pockets the foreign gent prized the shutters open with a little crowbar he then with a glazier's diamond soon cut out a small pane inserted a cunning hand and opened the window then reginald gave him a leg and he got into the room the agile youth followed him without assistance they lighted a sort of bull's eye and poured the concentrated light on the cupboard door behind which lay the treasure of glorious old plate then the foreign gent produced his skeleton keys and after several ineffective trials opened the door softly and revealed the glittering booty at sight of it the foreign gent could not suppress an ejaculation but the younger one clapped his hand before his mouth hurriedly the foreign gent unrolled a sort of green baize apron he had round him it was in reality a bag into this receptacle the pair conveyed one piece of plate after another with surprising dexterity rapidity and noiseless ness when it was full they began to fill the deep pockets of their shooting jackets while thus employed they heard a rapid footstep and richard bassett opened the door he was in his trousers and shirt and had a pistol in his hand at sight of him reginald uttered a cry of dismay the foreign gent blew out the light richard bassett among whose faults want of personal courage was not one rushed forward and collared reginald but the foreign gent had raised the crowbar to defend himself and struck him a blow on the head that made him stagger back the foreign gent seized this opportunity and ran at once at the window and jumped at it if reginald had been first he would have gone through like a cat but the foreign gent older and obstructed by the contents of his pocket higgled and stuck a few seconds in the window that brief delay was fatal richard bassett leveled his pistol deliberately at him fired and sent a ball through his shoulder he fell like a log upon the ground outside richard then leveled another barrel at reginald but he howled out for quarter and was immediately captured and with the assistance of the brave jessie who now came boldly to her master's aid his hands were tied behind him and he was made prisoner with the stolen articles in his pocket when they were tying him he whimpered and said it was only a lark he never meant to keep anything he offered a hundred pounds down if they would let him off but there was no mercy for him richard bassett had a candle lighted and inspected the prisoner he lifted his crape veil and said oho you see it was only a lark said reginald and shook in every limb richard bassett smiled grimly and said nothing he gave jessie strict orders to hold her tongue and she and he between them took reginald and locked him up in a small room adjoining the kitchen they then went to look for the other burglar he had emptied his pockets of all the plate and crawled away it is supposed he threw away the plate either to soften reginald's offense or in the belief that he had received his death wound and should not require silver vessels where he was going bassett picked up the articles and brought them in and told jessie to light the fire and make him a cup of coffee he replaced all the plate except the articles left in reginald's pocket then he went upstairs and told his wife that burglars had broken into the house but had taken nothing she was to give herself no anxiety he told her no more than this for his dark and cruel nature had already conceived an idea he did not care to communicate to her on account of the strong opposition he foresaw from so good a christian besides of late since her daughter came home to back her she had spoken her mind more than once he kept them then in the dark and went downstairs again to his coffee he sat and sipped it and with it his coming vengeance all the defeats and mortifications he had endured from huntercombe returned to his mind and now with one masterstroke he would balance them all yet he felt a little compunction active hostilities had ceased for many years lady bassett at all events had held out the hand to his wife the blow he meditated was very cruel would not his wife and daughter say it was barbarous would not his own heart the heart of a father reproach him afterward these misgivings that would have restrained a less obstinate man irritated richard bassett he went into a rage and said aloud i must do it i will do it come what may he told jessie he valued her much she should have a black silk gown for her courage and fidelity but she must not be faithful by halves she must not breathe one word to any soul in the house that the burglar was there under lock and key if she did he should turn her out of the house that moment hets said the woman der ye think i canna haud my whist when the maister bids me i'm nae great clasher at ony time for my pairt at seven o'clock in the morning he sent a note to sir charles bassett to say that his house had been attacked last night by two armed burglars he and his people had captured one and wished to take him before a magistrate at once since his house was not a fit place to hold him secure he concluded sir charles would not refuse him the benefit of the law however obnoxious he might be sir charles's lips curled with contempt at the man who was not ashamed to put such a doubt on paper however he wrote back a civil line to say that of course he was at mr bassett's service and would be in his justice room at nine o'clock meantime mr richard bassett went for the constable and an assistant but even to them he would not say precisely what he wanted them for his plan was to march an unknown burglar with his crape on his face into sir charles's study give his evidence and then reveal the son to the father jessie managed to hold her tongue for an hour or two and nothing occurred at highmore or in huntercombe to interfere with richard bassett's barbarous revenge meantime however something remarkable had occurred at the distance of a mile and a quarter mrs meyrick breakfasted habitually at eight o'clock reginald did not appear mrs meyrick went to his room and satisfied herself he had not passed the night there then she went to the foreign gent's shed he was not there then she went out and called loudly to them both no answer then she went into the nearest meadow to see if they were in sight the first thing she saw was the foreign gent staggering toward her drunk said she and went to scold him but when she got nearer she saw at once that something very serious had happened his dark face was bloodless and awful and he could hardly drag his limbs along indeed they had failed him a score of times between highmore and that place just as she came up with him he sank once more to the ground and turned up two despairing eyes toward her oh daddy what is it where's reginald whatever have they done to you brandy groaned the wounded man she flew into the house and returned in a moment with a bottle she put it to his lips he revived and told her all in a few words the young bloke and i went to crack a crib i'm shot with a bullet hide me in that loose hay there leave me the bottle and let nobody come nigh me the beak will be after me very soon then mrs meyrick being a very strong woman dragged him to the haystack and covered him with loose hay now said she trembling where's my boy he's nabbed oh and he'll be lagged unless you can beg him off mary meyrick uttered a piercing scream you wretch to tempt my boy to this and him with five hundred pounds in his pocket and my lady's favor oh why did we not keep our word with her she was the wisest and our best friend but it is all your doing you are the devil that tempted him you old villain don't miscall me said the gypsy not miscall you when you have run away and left them to take my boy to jail no word is bad enough for you you villain i'm your father and a dying man said the old gypsy calmly and folded his hands upon his breast with oriental composure and decency the woman threw herself on her knees forgive me father tell me where is he highmore house at that simple word her eyes dilated with wild horror she uttered a loud scream and flew into the house in five minutes she was on her way to highmore she reached that house knocked hastily at the door and said she must see mr richard bassett that moment he is just gone out said the maid where to the girl knew her and began to gossip why to huntercombe hall what haven't you heard mrs meyrick master caught a robber last night laws you should have seen him he have got crape all over his face and master and the constable and mr musters they be all gone with him to sir charles for to have him committed the villain why what ails the woman for mary meyrick turned her back on the speaker and rushed away in a moment she went through the kitchen at huntercombe she was so well known there nobody objected she flew up the stairs and into lady bassett's bedroom oh my lady my lady lady bassett screamed at her sudden entrance and wild appearance mary meyrick told her all in a few wild words she wrung her hands with a great fear it's no time for that cried mary fiercely come down this moment and save him how can i you must you shall cried the other don't ask me how don't sit wringing your hands woman if you are not there in five minutes to save him i'll tell all have mercy on me cried lady bassett i gave him money i sent him away it's not my fault no matter he must be saved or i'll ruin you i can't stay here i must be there and so must you she rushed down the stairs and tried to get into the justice room but admission was refused her then she gave a sort of wild snarl and ran round to the small room adjoining the justice room through this she penetrated and entered the justice room but not in time to prevent the evidence from being laid before sir charles what took place in the meantime was briefly this the prisoner handcuffed now instead of tied was introduced between the constable and his assistant the door was locked and sir charles received mr bassett with a ceremonious bow seated himself and begged mr bassett to be seated thank you said mr bassett but did not seat himself he stood before the prisoner and gave his evidence during which the prisoner's knees were seen to knock together with terror he was a young man fit for folly but not for felony said richard bassett i have a cupboard containing family plate it is valuable and some years ago i passed a piece of catgut from the door through the ceiling to a bell at my bedside very late last night the bell sounded i flung on my trousers and went down with a pistol i caught two burglars in the act of rifling the cupboard i went to collar one he struck me on the head with a crowbar constable show the crowbar i staggered but recovered myself and fired at one of the burglars he was just struggling through the window he fell and i thought he was dead but he got away i secured the other and here he is just as he was when i took him constable search his pockets the constable did so and produced therefrom several pieces of silver plate stamped with the bassett arms my servant here can confirm this added mr bassett it is not necessary here said sir charles then to the criminal have you anything to say it was only a lark quavered the poor wretch i would not advise you to say that where you are going he then while writing out the warrant said as a matter of course remove his mask the constable lifted it and started back with a shout of dismay and surprise jessie screamed sir charles looked up and saw in the burglar he was committing for trial his first born the heir to his house and his lands the pen fell from sir charles's fingers and he stared at the wan face and wild imploring eyes that stared at him he stared at the lad and then put his hand to his heart and that heart seemed to die within him there was a silence and a horror fell on all even richard bassett quailed at what he had done ah cruel man cruel man moaned the broken father god judge you for this as now i must judge my unhappy son mr bassett it matters little to you what magistrate commits you and i must keep my oath i am going to set you an example by signing a warrant no no no cried a woman's voice and mary meyrick rushed into the room every person there thought he knew mary meyrick yet she was like a stranger to them now there was that in her heart at that awful moment which transfigured a handsome but vulgar woman into a superior being her cheek was pale her black eyes large and her mellow voice had a magic power you don't know what you are doing she cried go no farther or you will all curse the hand that harmed a hair of his head you most of all richard bassett sir charles in any other case would have sent her out of the room but in his misery he caught at the straw speak out woman he said and save the wretched boy if you can i see no way there are things it is not fit to speak before all the world bid those men go and i'll open your eyes that stay then richard bassett foresaw another triumph so he told the constable and his man they had better retire for a few minutes while said he with a sneer these wonderful revelations are being made when they were gone mary turned to richard bassett and said why do you want him sent to prison to spite sir charles here to stab his heart through his son sir charles groaned aloud the woman heard and thought of many things she flung herself on her knees and seized his hand don't you cry my dear old master mine is the only heart shall bleed he is not your son what cried sir charles in a terrible voice that is no news to me said richard he is more like the parson than sir charles bassett for shame for shame cried mary meyrick oh it becomes you to give fathers to children when you don't know your own flesh and blood he is your son richard bassett my son roared bassett in utter amazement ay i should know for i am his mother this astounding statement was uttered with all the majesty of truth and when she said i am his mother the voice turned tender all in a moment they were all paralyzed and absorbed in this strange revelation did not hear a tottering footstep a woman pale as a corpse and with eyes glaring large stood among them all in a moment as if a ghost had risen from the earth it was lady bassett at sight of her sir charles awoke from the confusion and amazement into which mary had thrown him and said ah bella do you hear what she says that he is not our son what then have you agreed with your servant to deceive your husband lady bassett gasped and tried to speak but before the words would come the sight of her corpse like face and miserable agony moved mary wells and she snatched the words out of her mouth what is the use of questioning her she knows no more than you do i done it all and done it for the best my lady's child died i hid that from her for i knew it would kill her and keep you in a mad house i done for the best i put my live child by her side and she knew no better as time went on and the boy so dark she suspected but know it she couldn't till now my lady i am his mother and there stands his cruel father cruel to me and cruel to him but don't you dare to harm him i've got all your letters promising me marriage i'll take them to your wife and daughter and they shall know it is your own flesh and blood you are sending to prison oh i am mad to threaten him my darling speak him fair he is your father he may have a bit of nature in his heart somewhere though i could never find it the young man put his hands together like an oriental and said forgive me then sank at richard bassett's knees then sir charles himself much shaken took his wife's arm and led her trembling like an aspen leaf from the room perhaps the prayers of reginald and the tears of his mother would alone have sufficed to soften richard bassett but the threat of exposure to his wife and daughter did no harm the three soon came to terms reginald to be liberated on condition of going to london by the next train and never setting his foot in that parish again his mother to go with him and see him off to australia she solemnly pledged herself not to reveal the boy's real parentage to any other soul in the world this being settled richard bassett called the constable in and said the young gentleman had satisfied him that it was a practical joke though a very dangerous one and he withdrew the charge of felony the constable said he must have sir charles's authority for that a message was sent to sir charles he came the prisoner was released and mary meyrick took his arm sharply as much as to say out of my hands you go no more before they left the room sir charles who was now master of himself said with deep feeling my poor boy you can never be a stranger to me the affection of years cannot be untied in a moment you see now how folly glides into crime and crime into punishment take this to heart and never again stray from the paths of honor lead an honorable life and if you do write to me as if i was still your father they retired but richard bassett lingered and hung his head sir charles wondered what this inveterate foe could have to say now at last richard said half sullenly yet with a touch of compunction sir charles you have been more generous than i was you have laid me under an obligation sir charles bowed loftily you would double that obligation if you would prevail on lady bassett to keep that old folly of mine secret from my wife and daughter i am truly ashamed of it and whatever my faults may have been they love and respect me mr bassett said sir charles my son compton must be told that he is my heir but no details injurious to you shall transpire you may count on absolute secrecy from lady bassett and myself sir charles said richard bassett faltering for a moment i am very much obliged to you and i begin to be sorry we are enemies good morning the agitation and terror of this scene nearly killed lady bassett on the spot she lay all that day in a state of utter prostration meantime sir charles put this and that together but said nothing he spoke cheerfully and philosophically to his wife said it had been a fearful blow terrible wrench but it was all for the best such a son as that would have broken his heart before long ah but your wasted affections groaned lady bassett and her tears streamed at the thought sir charles sighed but said after a while is affection ever entirely wasted my love for that young fool enlarged my heart there was a time he did me a deal of good but next day having only herself to think of now lady bassett could live no longer under the load of deceit she told sir charles mary meyrick had deceived him read this she said and see what your miserable wife has done who loved you to madness and crime sir charles looked at her and saw in her wasted form and her face that if he did read it he should kill her so he played the man he restrained himself by a mighty effort and said my dear excuse me but on this matter i have more faith in mary meyrick's exactness than in yours besides i know your heart and don't care to be told of your errors in judgment no not even by yourself sorry to offend an authoress but i decline to read your book and more than that i forbid you the subject entirely for the next thirty years at least let by gones be by gones that eventful morning mr rutland called and proposed to ruperta she declined politely but firmly she told mrs bassett and mrs bassett told richard in a nervous way but his answer surprised her he said he was very glad of it ruperta could do better mrs bassett could not resist the pleasure of telling lady bassett she went over on purpose with her husband's consent lady bassett asked to see ruperta by all means said richard bassett graciously on her return to highmore ruperta asked leave to go to the hall every day and nurse lady bassett they will let her die else said she richard bassett assented to that too ruperta for some weeks almost lived at the hall and in this emergency revealed great qualities as the malevolent small pox passing through the gentle cow comes out the sovereign cow pox so in this gracious nature her father's vices turned to their kindred virtues his obstinacy of purpose shone here a noble constancy his audacity became candor and his cunning wisdom her intelligence saw at once that lady bassett was pining to death and a weak minded nurse would be fatal she was all smiles and brightness and neglected no means to encourage the patient with this view she promised to plight her faith to compton the moment lady bassett should be restored to health and so with hopes and smiles and the novelty of a daughter's love she fought with death for lady bassett and at last she won the desperate battle this did richard bassett's daughter for her father's late enemy the grateful husband wrote to bassett and now acknowledged his obligation a civil mock modest reply from richard bassett from this things went on step by step till at last compton and ruperta at eighteen years of age were formally betrothed thus the children's love wore out the father's hate that love so troubled at the outset left by degrees the region of romance and rippled smoothly through green flowery meadows ruperta showed her lover one more phase of girlhood she who had been a precocious and forward child and then a shy and silent girl came out now a bright and witty young woman full of vivacity modesty and sensibility time cured compton of his one defect ruperta stopped growing at fifteen but compton went slowly on caught her at seventeen and at nineteen had passed her by a head he won a scholarship at oxford he rowed in college races and at last in the university race on the thames ruperta stood in peerless beauty dark blue from throat to feet and saw his boat astern of his rival saw it come up with and creep ahead amid the roars of the multitude when she saw her lover with bare corded arms as brown as a berry and set teeth filling his glorious part in that manly struggle within eight yards of her she confessed he was not a boy now but lady bassett accepted no such evidence being pestered to let them marry at twenty years of age she clogged her consent with one condition they must live three years at huntercombe as man and wife no boy of twenty said she can understand a young woman of that age i must be in the house to prevent a single misunderstanding between my beloved children the young people who both adored her voted the condition reasonable they were married and a wing of the spacious building allotted to them for their sakes let us hope that their wedded life now happily commenced will furnish me no materials for another tale the happiest lives are uneventful the foreign gent recovered his wound but acquired rheumatism and a dislike for midnight expeditions reginald galloped a year or two over seven hundred miles of colony sowing his wild oats as he flew but is now a prosperous squatter very fond of sleeping in the open air england was not big enough for the bold bohemian he does very well where he is old meyrick died and left his wife a little estate in the next county drake asked her hand at the funeral she married him in six months and migrated to the estate in question for sir charles refused her a lease of his farm not choosing to have her near him her new abode was in the next parish to her sister's la marsh set herself to convert mary and often exhorted her to penitence she bore this pretty well for some time being overawed by old reminiscences of sisterly superiority but at last her vanity rebelled repent and repent cried she why you be like a cuckoo all in one song one would think i had been and robbed a church 'tis all very well for you to repent as led a fastish life at starting but i never done nothing as i'm ashamed on richard bassett said one day to wheeler old fellow there is not a worse poison than hate it has made me old before my time and what does it all come to we might just as well have kept quiet for my grandson will inherit huntercombe and bassett after all thanks to the girl you would not ring the bells for sir charles and lady bassett lead a peaceful life after all their troubles and renew their youth in their children of whom ruperta is one and as dear as any yet there is a pensive and humble air about lady bassett which shows she still expiates her fault though she knows it will always be ignored by him for whose sake she sinned in summing her up it may be as well to compare this with the unmixed self complacency of mrs drake you men and women who judge this bella bassett be firm and do not let her amiable qualities or her good intentions blind you in a plain matter of right and wrong be charitable and ask yourselves how often in your lives you have seen yourselves or any other human being resist a terrible temptation my experience is that we resist other people's temptations nobly and succumb to our own so let me end with a line of england's gentlest satirist heaven be merciful to us all sinners as we be the end
