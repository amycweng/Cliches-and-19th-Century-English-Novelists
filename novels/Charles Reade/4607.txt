love me little love me long by charles reade preface should these characters imbedded in carpet incidents interest the public at all they will probably reappear in more potent scenes this design which i may never live to execute is i fear the only excuse i can at present offer for some pages forming the twelfth chapter of this volume chapter i nearly a quarter of a century ago lucy fountain a young lady of beauty and distinction was by the death of her mother her sole surviving parent left in the hands of her two trustees edward fountain esq of font abbey and mr bazalgette a merchant whose wife was mrs fountains halfsister they agreed to lighten the burden by dividing it she should spend half the year with each trustee in turn until marriage should take her off their hands our mild tale begins in mr bazalgettes own house two years after the date of that arrangement the chitchat must be your main clue to the characters in life it is the same men and women wont come to you ticketed or explanation in hand lucy you are a great comfort in a house it is so nice to have some one to pour out ones heart to my husband is no use at all aunt bazalgette in that way you listen to my faded illusions to the aspirations of a nature too finely organized ah to find its happiness in this rough selfish world when i open my bosom to him what does he do guess nowwhistles then i call that rude so do i and then he whistles more and more yes but aunt if any serious trouble or grief fell upon you you would find mr bazalgette a much greater comfort and a better stay than poor spiritless me oh if the house took fire and fell about our ears he would come out of his shell no doubt or if the children all died one after another poor dear little souls but those great troubles only come in stories give me a friend that can sympathize with the real hourly mortifications of a too susceptible nature sit on this ottoman and let me go on where was i when jones came and interrupted us they always do just at the interesting point miss fountains face promptly wreathed itself into an expectant smile she abandoned her hand and her ear and leaned her graceful person toward her aunt while that lady murmured to her in low and thrilling toneshis eyes his long hair his imaginative expressions his romantic projects of frugal love how her harsh papa had warned adonis off the premises how adonis went without a word as pale as death love and soon after in his despair flung himselfto an ugly heiress and how this disappointment had darkened her whole life and so on perhaps if adonis had stood before her now rolling his eyes and his phrases hot from the annuals the flourishing matron might have sent him to the servants hall with a wave of her white and jeweled hand but the melody disarms this sort of brutal criticisma womans voice relating loves young dream and then the picturea matron still handsome pouring into a lovely virgins ear the last thing she ought the young beautys eyes mimicking sympathy the ripe beautys soft delicious accentspurr purr purr crash overhead a window smashed aie aie clatter clatter screams of infantine rage and feminine remonstrance feet pattering and a general hullabaloo cut the soft recital in two the ladies clasped hands like guilty things surprised lucy sprang to her feet the oppressed one sank slowly and gracefully back inch by inch on the ottoman with a sigh of ostentatious resignation and gazed martyrlike on the chandelier will you not go up to the nursery cried lucy in a flutter no dear replied the other faintly but as cool as a marble slab you go cast some of your oil upon those evertroubled waters and then come back and let us try once more miss fountain heard but half this sentence she was already gliding up the stairs she opened the nursery door and there stood in the middle of the room original sin its name after the flesh was master reginald it was halfpast six had been baptized in church after which every child becomes according to polemic divines of the day a little soul of christian fire until it goes to a public school and there it straddled two scarlet cheeks puffed out with rage soft flaxen hair streaming cerulean eyes glowing the poker grasped in two chubby fists it had poked a window in vague ire and now threatened two females with extinction if they riled it any more the two grownup women were discovered erect but flat in distant corners avoiding the bayonet and trusting to their artillery wicked boy naughty boy grape little ruffian etc and hints as to the ultimate destination of so sanguinary a soul round shot ah heres miss oh miss we are so glad you are come up dont go anigh him miss he is a tiger miss fountain smiled and went gracefully on one knee beside him this brought her angelic face level with the fallen cherubs what is the matter dear asked she in a tone of soft pity the tiger was not prepared for this he dropped his poker and flung his little arm round his cousins neck i love you oh oh oh yes dear then tell me nowwhat is the matter what have you been doing nothnothnothingits ththem been naaagging me nagging you and she smiled at the word and a tigers horror of it who has been nagging you love ththosebitbitit the word was unfortunately lost in a sob it was followed by red faces and two simultaneous yells of remonstrance and objurgation i must ask you to be silent a minute said miss fountain quietly reginald what do you mean bybynagging reginald explained by nagging he meantwhynagging well then what had they been doing to him no poor reginald was not analytical dialectical and critical like certain pedanticules who figure in story as children he was a terrible infant not a horrible one they wont fight and they wont make it up and they keep nagging was all could be got out of him come with me dear said lucy gravely yes assented the tiger softly and went out awestruck holding her hand and paddling three steps to each of her serpentine glides seated in her own room tiger at knee she tried topics of admonition during these his eyes wandered about the room in search of matter more amusing so she was obliged to bring up her reserve and no young lady will ever marry you i dont want them to cousin i wouldnt let them you will marry me because you promised did i why you know you didupon your honor and no lady or gentleman ever breaks their word when they say that you told me so yourself added he of the inconvenient memory ah but there is another rule that i forgot to tell you what is that that no lady ever marries a gentleman who has a violent temper oh dont they no they would be afraid if you had a wife and took up the poker she would faint away and dieperhaps oh dear i should but cousin you would not want the poker taken to you you never nag perhaps that is because we are not married yet what then when we are shall you turn like the others impossible to say well then after a moments hesitation ill marry you all the same no you forget i shall be afraid until your temper mends ill mend it it is mended now see how good i am now added he with selfadmiration and a shade of surprise i dont call this mending it for i am not the one that offended you mending it is promising me never never to call naughty names again how would you like to be called a dog id kill em there you seethen how can you expect poor nurse to like it you dont understand cousintom said to george the groom that mrs jones was anoldstingyb i dont want to hear anything about tom he is such a clever fellow cousin so i think if jones is an old one those two that keep nagging me must be young ones what do you think yourself asked reginald appealing suddenly to her candor and no doubt it was tom that taught you this other vulgar word nagging was the evasive reply no that was mamma lucy colored wheeled quickly and demanded severely of the terrible infant who is this tom what dont you know tom reginald began to lose a grain of his respect for her why he helps in the stables oh cousin he is such a nice fellow reginald i shall never marry you if you keep company with grooms and speak their language well sighed the victim ill give up tom sooner than you thank you dear now i am flattered one struggle more we must go together and ask the nurses pardon must we ugh yesand kiss themand make it up reginald made a wry face but after a pause of solemn reflection he consented on condition that lucy would keep near him and kiss him directly afterward i shall be sure to do that because you will be a good boy then outside the door reginald paused i have a favor to ask you cousina great favor you see i am so very little and you are so big now the husband ought to be the biggest quite my own opinion reggy well dear now if you would be so kind as not to grow any older till i catch you up i shall be so very very very much obliged to you dear i will try reggy nineteen is a very good age i will stay there as long as my friends will let me thank you cousin but that is not what we have in hand the nurses were just agreeing what a shame it was of miss to take that little vagabonds part against them when she opened the door nurse here is a penitenta young gentleman who is never going to use rude words or be violent and naughty again la miss why it is witchcraftthe dear childsoon up and soon down as a boy should beg parn nursebeg parn kitty recited the dear child late tiger and kissed them both hastily and this double formula gone through ran to miss fountain and kissed her with warmth while the nurses were reciting little angel all heart etc to take the taste out of my mouth explained the penitent and was left with his propitiated females and didnt they nag him at short intervals until sunset but strong in the contemplation of his future union with cousin lucy this great heart in a little body despised the pins and needles that had goaded him to fury before lucy went down to the drawingroom she found mrs bazalgette leaning with one elbow on the table her hand shading her high polished forehead her grave face reflecting great mental power taxed to the uttermost so newton looked solving nature miss fountain came in full of the nursery business but catching sight of so much mind in labor approached it with silent curiosity the oracle looked up with an absorbed air and delivered itself very slowly with eye turned inward i am afraidi dont thinki quite like my new dress that is unfortunate that would not matter i never like anything till i have altered it but here is baldwin has just sent me word that her mother is dying and she cant undertake any work for a week provoking could not the woman die just as well after the ball oh aunt and my maid has no more taste than an owl what on earth am i to do wear another dress what other can i nothing can be prettier than your white mousseline de soie with the tartan trimming no i have worn that at four balls already i wont be known by my colors like a bird i have made up my mind to wear the jaune and i will in spite of them all that is if i can find anybody who cares enough for me to try it on and tell me what it wants lucy offered at once to go with her to her room and try it on nonoit is so cold there we will do it here by the fire you will find it in the large wardrobe dear mind how you carry it lucy lots of pins mrs bazalgette then rang the bell and told the servant to say she was out if anyone called no matter who meantime lucy impressed with the gravity of her office took the dress carefully down from the pegs and as it would have been death to crease it and destruction to let its hem sweep against any of the inferior forms of matter she came down the stairs and into the room holding this female weapon of destruction as high above her head as judith waves the sword of holofernes in ettys immortal picture the other had just found time to loosen her dress and lock one of the doors she now locked the other and the rites began well it fits you like a glove really tell the truth now it is a sin to tell a storyabout a new gown what a nuisance one cant see behind one i could fetch another glass but you may trust my word aunt this point behind is very becoming it gives distinction to the waist yes baldwin cuts these bodies better than olivier but the worst of her is when it comes to the trimming you have to think for yourself the woman has no mind she is a pair of hands and there is an end of her i must confess it is a little plain for one thing said lucy why you little goose you dont think i am going to wear it like this no i thought of having down a wreath and bouquet from fosters of violets and heartseasethe bosom and sleeves covered with blond you know and caught up here and there with a small bunch of the flowers then in the center heartsease of the bosom i meant to have had two of my largest diamonds sethush the doorhandle worked viciously then came rap rap rap rap tictictic this is always the way who is there go away you cant come here but i want to speak to you what the deuce are you doing said through the keyhole the wretch that owned the room in a mere legal sense we are trying a dress come again in an hour confound your dresses who is we lucy has got a new dress aunt whispered lucy in a tone of piteous expostulation oh if it is lucy well goodby ladies i am obliged to go to london at a moments notice for a couple of days you will have done by when i come back perhaps and off went bazalgette whistling but not best pleased he had told his wife more than once that the drawingrooms and diningrooms of a house are the public rooms and the bedrooms the private ones lucy colored with mortification it was death to her to annoy anyone so her aunt had thrust her into a cruel position poor mr bazalgette sighed she fiddle de dee let him go and come back in a better temperset transparent so then backed by the violet you know they will imitate dewdrops to the life charming why not let olivier do it for you as poor baldwin cannot because olivier works for the claytons and we should have that emily clayton out as my double and as we visit the same houses and as she is extremely prettyaunt what a generalissima you are pretty snubnosed little toad no she is not pretty but she is eighteen so i cant afford to dress her no i see i shall have to moderate my views for this gown and buy another dress for the flowers and diamonds there take it off and let us think it calmly over i never act in a hurry but i am sorry for it afterwardi mean in things of real importance the gown was taken off in silence broken only by occasional sighs from the sufferer in whose heart a dozen projects battled fiercely for the mastery and worried and sore perplexed her and rent her inmost soul fiercely divers ways black lace dear suggested lucy soothingly mrs b curled her arm lovingly round lucys waist just what i was beginning to think said she warmly and we cant both be mistaken can we but where can i get enough and her countenance that the cheering coincidence had rendered seraphic was once more clouded with doubt why you have yards of it yes but mine is all made up in some form or other and it musses ones things so to pick them to pieces so it does dear replied lucy with gentle but genuine feeling it would only be for one night lucyi should not hurt it loveyou would not like to fetch down your brussels point scarf and see how it would look would you we need not cut the lace dear we could tack it on again the next morning you are not so particular as i amyou look well in anything lucy was soon seated denuding herself and embellishing her aunt the latter reclined with grace and furthered the work by smile and gesture you dont ask me about the skirmish in the nursery their squabbles bore me dear but you can tell me who was the most in fault if you think it worth while reginald then i am afraid but it is not the poor boy it is the influence of the stableyard and i do advise and entreat you to keep him out of it impossible my dear you dont know boys the stable is their paradise when he grows older his father must interfere meantime let us talk of something more agreeable yes you shall go on with your story you had got to his look of despair when your papa came in that morning oh i have no time for anybodys despair just now i can think of nothing but this detestable gown lucy i suspect i almost wish i had made them put another breadth into the skirt luncheon maam lucy begged her aunt to go down alone she would stay and work no you must come to luncheon there is a dish on purpose for youstewed eels eels why i abhor them i think they are waterserpents who is it that is so fond of them then it is you aunt so it is i thought it had been you come you must come down whether you eat anything or not i like somebody to talk to me while i am eating and i had an idea just nowit is gonebut perhaps it will come back to me it was about this abominable gown o how i wish there was not such a thing as dress in the world while mrs bazalgette was munching watersnakes with delicate zeal and lucy nibbling cake came a letter mrs bazalgette read it with heightening color laid it down cast a pitying glance on lucy and said with a sigh poor girl lucy turned a little pale has anything happened she faltered something is going to happen you are to be torn away from here where you are so happywhere we all love you dear it is from that selfish old bachelor listen dear madam my niece lucy has been due here three days i have waited to see whether you would part with her without being dunned my curiosity on that point is satisfied and i have now only my affection to consult which i do by requesting you to put her and her maid into a carriage that will be waiting for her at your door twentyfour hours after you receive this note i have the honor to be madam an old brute and you can smile but that is you all over you dont care a straw whether you are happy or miserable dont i not you you will leave this where you are a little queen and go and bury yourself three months with that old bachelor and nobody will ever gather from your face that you are bored to death and here we are asked to the cavendishes next wednesday and the hunts ball on fridayyou are such a lucky girlour best invitations always drop in while you are with uswe go out three times as often during your months as at other times it is your good fortune or the weather or something dear aunt this was your own arrangement with uncle fountain i used to be six months with each in turn till you insisted on its being three you make me almost laugh both you and uncle fountain what do you see in me worth quarreling for i will tell you what he seesa good little spiritless thing i am larger than you dear yes in bodythat he can make a slave ofalways ready to nurse him and his foe or to put down your work and to take up histo play at his vile backgammon piquet please where is the differenceto share his desolation and take half his blue devils on your own shoulders till he will hyp you so that to get away you will consent to marry into his setthe county setsome beggarly old family that came down from the conquest and has been going down ever since so then he will let you flywith a string you must vegetate two miles from him so then he can have you in to backquette and write his letters he will settle four hundred a year on you and you will be miserable for life poor uncle fountain what a schemer he turns out men all turn out schemers when you know them miss impertinence well dear i have no selfish views for you i love my few friends too singleheartedly for that but i am sad when i see you leaving us to go where you are not prized indeed aunt i am prized at font abbey i am overrated there as i am here they all receive me with open arms so is a hare when it comes into a trap said mrs bazalgette sharply drawing upon a limited knowledge of grammar and fieldsports nouncle fountain really loves me as much as i do asked the lady with a treacherous smile very nearly was the young courtiers reply she went on to console her aunts unselfish solicitude by assuring her that font abbey was not a solitude that dinners and balls abounded and her uncle was invited to them all you little goose dont you see all those invitations are for your sake not his if we could look in on him now we should find him literally in single cursedness those county folks are not without cunning they say beauty has come to stay with the beast we must ask the beast to dinner so then beauty will come along with him what other pleasure awaits you at font abbey the pleasure of giving pleasure replied lucy apologetically ah that is your weakness lucy it is all very well with those who wont take advantage but it is the wrong game to play with all the world you will be made a tool of and a slave of and use of i speak from experience you know how i sacrifice myself to those i love luckily they are not many not so many as love you dear heaven forbid but you are at the head of them all and i am going to prove itby deeds not words lucy looked up at this additional feature in her aunts affection you must go to the great bears den for three months but it shall be the last time lucy said nothing you will return never to quit us or at all events not the neighborhood thatwould be nice said the courtier warmly but hesitatingly but how will you gain uncles consent by dispensing with it yes but the means aunt a husband lucy started and colored all over and looked askant at her aunt with opening eyes like a thoroughbred filly just going to start all across the road mrs bazalgette laid a loving hand on her shoulder and whispered knowingly in her ear trust to me ill have one ready for you against you come back this time no please dont pray dont cried lucy clasping her hands in feebleminded distress in this neighborhoodone of the right sort i am so happy as i am you will be happier when you are quite a slave and so i shall save you from being snapped up by some country wiseacre and marry you into our own set merchant princes suggested lucy demurely having just recovered her breath and what little sauce there was in her yes merchant princesthe men of the agethe men who could buy all the acres in the country without feeling itthe men who make this little island great and a woman happy by letting her have everything her heart can desire you mean everything that money can buy of course i said so didnt i so then you are tired of me in the house remonstrated lucy sadly no ingrate but you will be sure to marry soon or late no i will not if i can possibly help it but you cant help it you are not the character to help it the first man that comes to you and says i know you rather dislike me you could not hate anybody lucy but if you dont take me i shall die of a broken fiddlestick you will whine out oh dear shall you well then sooner than disoblige you heretake me am i so weak as this asked lucy coloring and the water coming into her eyes dont be offended said the other coolly we wont call it weakness but excess of complaisance you cant say no to anybody yet i have said it replied lucy thoughtfully have you when oh to me yes where i am concerned you have sometimes a will of your own and a pretty stout one but never with anybody else the aunt then inquired of the niece frankly now between ourselves whether she had no wish to be married the niece informed her in confidence that she had not and was puzzled to conceive how the bare idea of marriage came to be so tempting to her sex of course she could understand a lady wishing to marry if she loved a gentleman who was determined to be unhappy without her but that women should look about for some hunter to catch instead of waiting quietly till the hunter caught them this puzzled her and as for the superstitious love of females for the marriage rite in cases when it took away their liberty and gave them nothing amiable in return it amazed her so aunt she concluded if you really love me driving me to the altar will be an unfortunate way of showing it while listening to this tirade which the young lady delivered with great serenity and concluded with a little yawn mrs bazalgette had two thoughts the first was this girl is not flesh and blood she is made of curds and whey or something else the second was no she is a shade hypocriticaler than other girlsbefore they are married that is all and acting on this latter conviction she smiled a lofty incredulity and fell to counting on her fingers all the moneyed bachelors for miles at this lucy winced with sensitive modesty and for once a shade of vexation showed itself on her lovely features the quicksighted keenwitted matron caught it and instantly made a masterly move of feigned retreat no cried she i will not tease you anymore love just promise me not to receive any gentlemans addresses at font abbey and i will never drive you from my arms to the altar i promise that cried lucy eagerly upon your honor upon my honor kiss me dear i know you wont deceive me now you have pledged your honor this solemn promise consoles me more than you can conceive i am so glad but if you knew how little it costs me all the better you will be more likely to keep it was the dry reply the conversation then took a more tender turn and so tomorrow you go how dull the house will be without you and who is to keep my brats in order now i have no idea well there is nothing but meeting and parting in this world it does not do to love people does it ah dont cry love or i shall give way my desolate heart already brims overnonow dont cry a little sharply the servants will be coming in to take away the things will you cccome and hhelp me pack dear me love oh no i could not bear the sight of your things put out to go away i promised to call on mrs hunt this afternoon and you must not stop in all day yourselfi cannot let your health be sacrificed you had better take a brisk walk and pack afterward thank you aunt i will go and finish my drawing of harrowden church to take with me no dont go there the meadows are wet walk upon the hatton road it is all gravel yes only it is so ugly and i have nothing to do that way but ill give you something to do said mrs bazalgette obligingly you know where old sarah and her daughter livethe last cottages on that road i dont like the shape of the last two collars they made me you can take them back if you like and lend them one of yours i admire so for a pattern that i will with pleasure shall you come back through the garden if you dontnever mind but if you do you may choose me a bouquet the servants are incapable of a bouquet i will thank you dear how kind and thoughtful of you to give me something to occupy me now that i am a little sad mrs bazalgette accepted this tribute with a benignant smile and the ladies parted the next morning a travelingcarriage with four smoking posthorses came wheeling round the gravel to the front door uncle fountains factotum got down from the dicky packed lucys imperial on the roof and slung a box below the dicky stowed her maid away aft arranged the footcushion and a shawl or two inside and half obsequiously half bumptiously awaited the descent of his fair charge then upstairs came a sudden simultaneous attack of ardent lips and a long clinging embrace that would have graced the most glorious passionate antique love sculpture outdone the young lady went down and was handed into the carriage her ardent aunt followed presently and fired many glowing phrases in at the window and just as the carriage moved she uttered a single word quite quietly as much as to say now this i mean this genuine word the last aunt bazalgette spoke had been two hundred years before the last word of charles the first note the coincidences of history the two postboys lifted their whips level to their eyes by one instinct the horses tightened the traces the wheels ground the gravel and lucy was whirled away with that quiet emphatic postdict ringing in her ears remember font hill was sixty miles off they reached it in less than six hours there was uncle fountain on the hall steps to receive her and the comely housekeeper mrs brown ducking and smiling in the background while the servants were unpacking the carriage mr fountain took lucy to her bedroom mrs brown had gone on before to see for the third time whether all was comfortable there was a huge fire all red and on the table a gigantic nosegay of spring flowers with smell to them all oh how nice after a journey said lucy mowing down uncle fountain and mrs brown with one comprehensive smile mrs brown flamed with complacency what cried her uncle i suppose you expected a black fire and impertinent apologies by way of substitute for warmth a stuffy room and damp sheets roasted like a woodcock twenty minutes before use no uncle dear i expected every comfort at font abbey brown retired with a courtesy aha what you have found out that it is all humbug about old bachelors not knowing comfort do bachelors ever put their friends into damp sheets no that is the womens trick with their household science your sex have killed more men with damp sheets than ever fell by the sword yet nobody erects monuments to us put in lucy slyly she missed fire uncle fountain like most englishmen could take in a pun by the ear but wit only by the eye do you remember when mrs bazalgette put you into the linen sponge and killed you killed me certainly as far as in her lay we can but do our best well she did hers and went the right way to work you see i survive by a miracle dinner is at six very well dear yes but six in this house means sixty minutes after five and sixty minutes before seven i mention this the first day because you are just come from a place where it means twenty minutes to seven also let me observe that i think i have noticed soup and potatoes eat better hot than cold and meat tastes nicer done to a turn than to a cinder ha ha and come with an appetite please uncle no tyranny i beg tyranny you know this is liberty hall only when i eat i expect my companion toeat too besides there is nothing to be gained by humbug today there will be only us two at dinner and when i see young ladies fiddling with an asparagus head instead of eating their dinner it dont fall into the greenhorns notionexquisite creature all soul no stomach feeds on air ideas and quadrille musicno what do you think i say something flattering i feel sure on the contrary something true i say hypocrite been grubbing like a pig all day so cant eat like a christian at meal time you cant humbug me alas so i see that decides me to be candidand hungry well i am off i dont stick to my friends and bore them with my affairs like that egotistical hussy jane bazalgette i amuse myself and leave them to amuse themselves that is my notion of politeness i am going to see my pigs fed then into the village i am building a new blacksmiths shop there you must come and look at it the first thing tomorrow and at six if you want to find me i shall peep behind the souptureen and there i shall be if i am alive at dinner the old boy threw himself into the work with such zeal that soon after the cloth was removed from fatigue and repletion he dropped asleep with his shoulder toward lucy but his face instinctively turned toward the fire lucy crept away on tiptoe not to disturb him in about an hour he bustled into the drawingroom ordered tea blew up the footman because the cook had not water boiling that moment drank three cups then brightened up rubbed his hands and with a cheerful benevolent manner now lucy cried he come and help me puzzle out this tiresome genealogy a smile of warm assent from lucy and the old bachelor and the blooming hebe were soon seated with a mountain of parchments by their side and a tree spreading before them it was not a finite tree like an elm or an oak no it was a banyan tree covered an acre and from its boughs little suckers dropped to earth and turned to little trees and had suckers in their turn and confounded the confusion uncle fountains happiness depended pro tem on proving that he was a sucker from the great bough of the fontaines of melton and why because this effected he had only to go along that bough by an established pedigree to the great trunk of the funteyns of salle and the first funteyn of salle was said to be and this he hoped to prove true greatgrandson of robert de fontibus son of john de fonte now uncle fountain could prove himself the shoot of george his father a step at which so many pedigrees halt who was the shoot of william who was the shoot of richard but here came a gap of eighty years between him and that fountain younger son of melton to whom he wanted to hook on now the logic of women children and criticasters is a thing of gaps they reason as marches a kangaroo but to mathematicians logicians and genealogists a link wanting is a chain broken this blank then made uncle fountain miserable and he cried out for help lucy came with her young eyes her womans patience and her own complaisance a great ditch yawned between a crocheteer and a rotten branch he coveted our quinta curtia flung herself her eyesight and her time into that ditch twelve oclock came and found them still wallowing in modern antiquity bless me cried mr fountain when john brought up the bedcandles how time flies when one is really employed yes indeed uncle and by a gymnastic of courtesy she first crushed and then so molded a yawn that it glided into society a smile we have spent a delightful evening lucy thanks to you uncle i hope you will sleep well child i am sure i shall dear said she sweetly and inadvertently chapter ii a large aspiration is a rarity but who has not some small ambition none the less keen for being narrowkeener perhaps mrs bazalgette burned to be great by dress mr fountain member of a sex with higher aims aspired to be great in the county unluckily his main property was in the funds he had acres in shire but so few that some years ago its lord lieutenant declined to make him an injustice of the peace that functionary died and on his death the mortified aspirant bought a coppice christened it springwood and under cover of this fringe to his three meadows applied to the new lord lieutenant as mduff approached mbeth the new man made him a magistrate so now he aspired to be a deputy lieutenant and attended all the boards of magistrates and turnpike trusts etc and brought up votes and beerbarrels at each election and in short played all the cards in his pack lucy included to earn that distinction we may as well confess that there lurked in him a halfunconscious hope that some day or other in some strange collision or combination of parties a man profound in county business zealous in county interests personally obnoxious to nobody might drop into the seat of county member and if this should be would not he have the sense to hold his tongue upon the noisy questions that waste parliaments time and the nations but on the first of those periodical attacks to which the wretched landowner is subject wouldnt he speak and show the difference between a mere member of the commons and a member for the county if anyone had asked this man plump which is the most important england or shire he would have certainly told you england but our opinions are not the notions we repeat and can defend by reasons or even by facts our opinions are the notions we feel and act on could you have looked inside mr fountains head you would have seen ideas corresponding to the following diagrams drawing mr fountain courted the stomach of the county without this he knew an angel could not reach its heart and here one of his eccentricities broke out he drew a line in his dictatorial way between dinner and feeding parties a dinner party is two rubbers four gentlemen and four ladies sit round a circular table then each can hear what anyone says and need not twist the neck at every word foraging parties are from fourteen to thirty set up and down a plank each separated from those he could talk to as effectually as if the ocean rolled between and bawling into one persons ear amid the din of knives forks and multitude i go to those long strings of noisy duets because i must but i give society at home the county people had just strength of mind to like the old boys sociable dinners though not to imitate them and an invitation from him was very rarely declined when lucy was with him and she was in her glory she could carry complaisance such a long way at font abbeyshe was mistress of the house she listened with a wonderful appearance of interest to county matters ie to minute scandal and infinitesimal politics to the county cricket match and archery meeting to the past ball and the ball to come in the drawingroom when a cold fit fell on the coterie she would glide to one egotist after another find out the monotope and set the critter peters the place de concorde the square of st mark versailles the alhambra the apollo belvidere the madonna of the chair and all the glories of nature and the feats of art could not warm so then the fine gentleman began to actto walk himself out as a person who had seen and could give details about anything but was exalted far above admiring anything quel grand homme rien ne peut lui plaire and on this while the women were gazing sweetly on him and revering his superiority to all great impressions and the men envying rather hating but secretly admiring him too she who had launched him bent on him a look of soft pity and abandoned him to admiration poor mr talboys thought she i fear i have done him an ill turn by drawing him out and she glided to her uncle who was sitting apart and nobody talking to him mr talboys started by lucy ambled out his highpacing nil admirantem character and derived a little quiet selfsatisfaction this was the highest happiness he was capable of so he was not ungrateful to miss fountain who had procured it him and partly for this partly because he had been kind to her and lent her a pony he shook hands with her somewhat cordially at parting as it happened he was the last guest you have won that mans heart lucy cried mr fountain with a mixture of surprise and pride lucy made no reply she looked quickly into his face to see if he was jesting writing lucyso late only a few lines uncle you shall see them i note the more remarkable phenomena of society i am recalling a conversation between three of our guests this evening and shall be grateful for your opinion on it there read it out please mrs luttrell we missed you at the archery meetingha ha ha mrs willis mr willis would not let me gohe he he mrs james well at all eventshe heyou will come to

what of he he the precise meaning there you puzzle me uncle i mean what do you mean by them oh i put ha ha when they giggle and he he when they only chuckle then this is a caricature my lady no dear you know i have no satire in me it is taken down to the letter and i fear i must trouble you for the solution well the solution is they are three fools no uncle begging your pardon they are not replied lucy politely but firmly well then three dd fools lucy winced at the participle but was two polite to lecture her elder they have not that excuse said she they are all sensible women who discharge the duties of life with discretion except society and they can discriminate between grave and gay whenever they are not at a party and as for mrs luttrell when she is alone with me she is a sweet natural love they cackledat every wordlike thatthe whole evening except when you told that funny story about the irish corporal who was attacked by a mastiff and killed him with his halberd and when he was reproached by his captain for not being content to repel so valuable an animal with the butt end of his lance answeredha ha so then he answered haw haw did he now uncle no he answered so i would your arnr if he had run at me with his tail now that was genuine wit mixed with quite enough fun to make an intelligent person laugh and then you told it so drollyha ha they did not laugh at that sat as grave as judges and you tell me they are not fools i must repeat they have not that excuse perhaps their risibility had been exhausted after laughing three hours a propos de rien it is time to be serious out of place i will tell you what they did laugh at though miss malcolm sang a song with a title i dare not attempt there were two lines in it which i am going to mispronounce but you are not scotch so i dont care for you uncle darling he had but a saxpence he break it in twa and he gave me the half ot when he gaed awa they laughed at that a general giggle went round well i must confess i dont see much to laugh at in that lucy it would be odd if you did uncle dear why it is pathetic pathetic oh is it you naughty cunning uncle you know it is it is pathetic and almost heroic consider dear in a world where the very newspapers show how mercenary we all are a poor young man is parted from his love he has but one coin to go through the world with and what does he do with it scheme to make the sixpence a crown and to make the crown a pound no he breaks this one treasure in two that both the poor things may have a silver token of love and a pledge of his return i am sure if the poet had been here he would have been quite angry with us for laughing at that line keep your temper why this is new from you lucy but you women of sugar can all cauterize your own sex the theme inspires you uncle how dare you are you not afraid i shall be angry one of these days dear the gentlemen were equally concerned in this last enormity poor jemmy or jammy with his devotion and tenderness that soothed and his high spirit that supported the weaker vessel was as funny to our male as to our female guestsso there i saw but one that understood him and did not laugh at him talboys for a pound mr talboys no you dear uncle you did not laugh i noticed it with all a nieces pride of course i didnt can i hear a word these ladies mew can i tell in what language even they are whining and miauling i have given up trying this twenty years and more i return to my question said lucy hastily and i to my solution your three graces are three dd fools if you can account for it in any other way do no uncle dear if you had happened to agree with me beforehand i would but as you do not i beg to be excused but keep the paper and the next time listen to the talk and unmeaning laughter you will find i have not exaggerated and some day dear i will tell you how my mamma used to account for similar monstrosities in society here is a mysterious little toad well lucy for all this you enjoyed yourself i never saw you in better spirits i am glad you saw that said lucy with a languid smile and how talboys came out he did sighed lucy here the young lady lighted softly on an ottoman and sank gracefully back with a wearyotheworld air and when she had settled down like so much floss silk fixing her eye on the ceiling and doling her words out languidly yet thoughtfullyjust above a whisper uncle darling inquired she where are the men we have all heard of how should i know what men where are the men of sentiment that can understand a woman and win her to reveal her real heart the best treasure she has uncle dear she paused for a reply none coming she continued with decreasing energy where are the men of spirit the men of action the upright downright men that heaven sends to cure us of our disingenuousness where are the heroes and the wits an infinitesimal yawn where are the real men and where are the women to whom such men can do homage without degrading themselves where are the men who elevate a woman without making her masculine and the women who can brighten and polish and yet not soften the steel of manhoodtell me tell me instantly said she with still greater languor and want of earnestness and her eyes remained fixed on the ceiling in deep abstraction they are all in this house at this moment said mr fountain coolly who dear i fear i was not attending to you how rude horrid i say the men and women you inquire for are all in this house of mine and the old gentlemans eyes twinkled uncle heaven forgive you andoh fie they are upon my soul then they must be in some part of it i have not visited are they in the kitchen with a little saucy sneer no they are in the library in the libah le malin they were never seen in the drawingroom and never will be yet surely they must have lived in nature before they were embalmed in print said lucy interrogating the ceiling again the nearest approach you will meet to these paragons is reginald talboys said fountain stoutly uncle i do love you and lucy rose with junolike slowness and dignity and leaning over the old boy kissed him with sudden small fury why asked he eagerly connecting this majestic squirt of affection with his last speech because you are such a nice dear sarcastic thing let us drink tea in the library tomorrow then that will be an approach to with this illegitimate full stop the conversation ended and miss fountain took a candle and sauntered to bed in church next sunday lucy observed a young lady with a beaming face who eyed her by stealth in all the interstices of devotion she asked her uncle who was that pretty girl with a nez retrousse a cocked nose it must be my little friend eve dodd i didnt know she was come back what a pretty face to be in suchsuch asuch an impossible bonnet it has come down from another epoch this not maliciously but with a sort of tender womanly concern for beauty set off to the most disadvantage o hang her bonnet she is full of fun she shall drink tea with us she is a great favorite of mine they quickened their pace and caught eve dodd just as she took a flying leap over some water that lay in her path and showed a charming ankle in those days female dress committed two errors that are disappearing it revealed the whole foot by day and hid a section of the bosom at night after the usual greetings mr fountain asked eve if she would come over and drink tea with him and his niece miss dodd colored and cast a glance of undisguised admiration at miss fountain but she said thank you sir i am much obliged but i am afraid i cant come my brother would miss me whatthe sailor is he at home yes sir came home last night and she clapped her hands by way of comment he has been with my mother all churchtime so now it is my turn and i dont know how to let him out of my sight yet awhile and she gave a glance at miss fountain as much as to say you understand well eve said mr fountain goodhumoredly we must not separate brother and sister and he was turning to go perhaps uncle said lucy looking not at mr fountain but at evemrmr david dodd is my brothers name said eve quickly mr david dodd might be persuaded to give us the pleasure of his company too oh yes if i may bring dear david with me burst out the child of nature coloring again with pleasure it will add to the obligation said lucy finishing the sentence in character so that is settled said mr fountain somewhat dryly as they were walking home together the courtier asked her uncle rather coldly who are these we have invited dear who are they a pretty girl and a man she wouldnt come without and who is the gentleman what is he a marine animalfirst mate of a ship first mate mate is that what in the novels is called boatswains mate haw haw haw i say lucy ask him when he comes if he is the bosens mate how little eve will blaze then i shall ask him nothing of the kind do tell me i know admiralsthey swearand captains and i think lieutenants and above all those little loves of midshipmen strutting with their dirks and cocked hats like warlike bantams but i never met mates mates that is because you have only been introduced to the royal navy but there is another navy not so ornamental but quite as useful called the east india companys i am ashamed to say i never heard of it i dare say not well in this navy there are only two kinds of superior officersthe mates and the captain there are five or six mates young dodd has been first mate some time so i suppose he will soon be a captain uncle well will thismateswear clearly there now i do not like swearing on a sunday that wicked old admiral used to make me shudder oh said mr fountain playing upon innocence he swore by the supreme being i bet sixpence yes said lucy in a low soft voice of angelic regret ah he was in the royal navy but this is a merchantman you dont think he will presume to break into the monopoly of the superior branch he will only swear by the wind and weather thunder and squalls donner and blitzen handspikes and halyards these are the innocent execrations of the merchant servicehe he ho uncle can you be serious asked lucy somewhat coldly if so be so good as to tell me is this gentlemanagentleman well replied the other coolly he is what i call a nondescript like an attorney or a surgeon or a civil engineer or a banker or a stockbroker and all that sort of people he can be a gentleman if he is thoroughly bent on it you would in his place and so should i but these skippers dont turn their mind that way old families dont go into the merchant service indeed it would not answer there they rise bybymere maritime considerations then uncle began lucy with dignified severity permit me to say that in inviting a nondescript you showedless consideration for me thanyouare in the habitof doing dearest well have a headache and cant come down so i certainly should but most unfortunately i have an objection to tell fibs on a sunday you are quite right we should rest from our usual employments one dayha ha and so go at it fresher tomorrowhaw ho come lucy dont you be so exclusive eve dodd is a merry girl she comes and amuses me when you are not here and david by all accounts is a fine young fellow and as modest as a girl of fifteen they will make me laugh especially eve and it would be hard at my age i think if i might not ask whom i liketo tea so it would put in lucy hastily she added coaxing it shall have its own wayit shall have what makes it laugh long before eight oclock the fountains had forgotten that they had invited the dodds not so eve she was all in a flutter and hesitated between two dresses and by some blessed inspiration decided for the plainest but her principal anxiety was not about herself but about davids deportment before the queen of fashion for such report proclaimed miss fountain and those fine ladies are so satirical said eve to herself but i will lecture him going along dinner time and by consequence tea time came earlier in those days so about eight oclock a tall squareshouldered young fellow was walking in the moonlight toward font abbey eve holding his hand and tripping by his side and lecturing him on deportment very gravely while dancing around him and pulling him all manner of ways like your solid tune with your gamboling accompaniment a combination now in vogue all of a sudden without with your leave or by your leave the said david caught this light fantastic object up in his arms and carried it on one shoulder on this she gave a little squeak then without a moments interval continued her lecture as if nothing had happened she looked down from her perch like a hen from a ladder and laid down the law to david with seriousness and asperity and just please to remember that they are people a long way above usat least above what we are now since father fell into trouble so dont you make too free and miss fountain is the finest of all the fine ladies in the county then i am sorry we are going no you are not she is a beautiful girl that alters the case no it does not dont chatter so david interrupting forever but listen and mind what i say or ill never take you anywhere again are you sure you are taking me now asked david dryly why not mr david retorted eve from his shoulder didnt i hear you tell how you took the combermere out of harbor and how you brought her into port she didnt take you out and bring you home eh had me there though yes and what is more you are not skipper of the combermere yet and never will be but i am skipper of you ashorenot a doubt of it said david with cool indifference he despised terrestrial distinction courting only such as was marine then i command you to let me down this instant do you hear crew no objected david if i put you overboard you cant command the vessel and ten to one if the craft does not founder for want of seawomanship on the quarterdeck however added he in a relenting tone wait till we get to that puddle shining on ahead and then ill disembark you no david do let me down thats a good soul i am tired added she peevishly tired of what of doing nothing stupid there let me down dear wont you darling then take that love a box of the ear well ive got it said david dryly keep it then till the next no he wont let me down he has got both my hands in one of his paws and he will carry me every foot of the way nowi know the obstinate pig we all have our little characters eve well i have got your wrists but you have got your tongue and that is the stronger weapon of the two you know and you are on the poop so give your orders and the ship shall be worked accordingly likewise i will enter all your remarks on goodbreeding into my log here unluckily david tapped his forehead to signify that the log in question was a metaphorical one the log of memory eve had him again directly she freed a claw so this is your log is it cried she tapping it as hard as she could well it does sound like wood of some sort well then david dearyou wretch i meanpromise me not to laugh loud well i will not it is odds if i laugh at all i wish we were to moor alongside mother instead of running into this strange port stuff think of miss fountains figureheadnor tell too many storiesand above all for heavens sake do keep the poor dear old sea out of sight for once ay ay that stands to reason by this time they were at font abbey and david deposited his fair burden gently on the stone steps of the door she opened it without ceremony and bustled into the diningroom crying i have brought david sir and here he is and she accompanied davids bow with a corresponding movement of her hand the knuckles downward the old gentleman awoke with a start rubbed his eyes shook hands with the pair and proposed to go up to lucy in the drawingroom now it happened unluckily that miss fountain had been to the library and taken down one or two of those men and women who according to her uncle exist only on paper and certain it is she was in charming company when she heard her visitors steps and voices coming up the stairs had those visitors seen the vexed expression of her face as she laid down the book they would have instantly bout ship and home again but that sour look dissolved away as they came through the open door on coming in they saw a young lady seated on a sofa apparently she did not see them enter her face happened to be averted but ere they had taken three steps she turned her face saw them rose and took two steps to meet them all beaming with courtesy kindness and quiet satisfaction at their arrival she gave her hand to eve this is my brother miss fountain miss fountain instantly swept david a courtesy with such a grace and flow coupled with an engaging smile that the sailor was fascinated and gazed instead of bowing eve had her finger ready to poke him when he recovered himself and bowed low eve played the accompaniment with her hand knuckles down they sat down cups of tea etc were brought round to each by john it was bad tea made out of the room catch a human being making good tea in which it is not to share mr fountain was only half awake eve was more or less awed by lucy david tutored by eve held his tongue altogether or gave short answers this must be what the novels call a seacub thought miss fountain the friends propriety and restraint presided over the innocent banquet and a dismal evening set in the first infraction of this polite tranquillity came i blush to say from the descendant of john de fonte he exploded in a yawn of magnitude to cover this the young lady began hastily to play her old game of setting people astride their topic and she selected david dodd for the experiment she put on a warm curiosity about the sea and ships and the countries men visit in them then occurred a droll phenomenon david flashed with animation and began full and intelligent answers then catching his sisters eye came to unnatural full stops and so warmly and skillfully was he pressed that it cost him a gigantic effort to avoid giving much amusement and instruction the courtier saw this hesitation and the vivid flashes of intelligence and would not lose her prey she drew him with all a womans tact and with a warmth so well feigned that it set him on real fire his instinct of politeness would not let him go on all night giving short answers to inquiring beauty he turned his eye which glowed now like a live coal toward that enticing voice and presently like a ship that has been hanging over the water ever so long on the last rollers with one gallant glide he took the sea and towed them all like little cockleboats in his wake from sea to sea from port to port from tribe to tribe from peril to peril from feat to feat david whirled his wonderstruck hearers and held them panting by the quadruple magic of a tuneful voice a changing eye an ardent soul and truth at firsthand they sat thrilled and surprised most of all miss fountain to her things great and real had up to that moment been mere vague outlines seen through a mist moreover her habitual courtesy had hitherto drawn out pumps but now when least expected all in a moment as a spark fires powder it let off a man a sailor is a live book of travels check your own vanity if you possibly can and set him talking you shall find him full of curious and profitable matter the fountains did not know this and even if they had dodd would have taken them by surprise for besides being a sailor and a seaenthusiast he was a fellow of great capacity and mental vigor he had not skimmed so many books as we have but i fear he had sucked more however his main strength did not lie there he was not a paper man and thisoh men of paper and oh c r in particulargave him a tremendous advantage over you that sunday evening the man whose knowledge all comes from reading accumulates a great number of whatfacts no of the shadows of facts shadows often so thin indistinct and featureless that when one of the facts themselves runs against him in real life he does not know his old friend round about which he has written a smart leader in a journal and a ponderous trifle in the polysyllabic review but this sailor had stowed into his mental hold not factshadows but the glowing facts all alive o for thirteen years man and boy he had beat about the globe with real eyes real ears and real brains ever at work he had drunk living knowledge like a fish and at fountainheads yet to utter intellectual wealth nobly two things more are indispensable the gift of language and a tunable voice which last does not always come by talking with tempests well david dodd had sucked in a good deal of language from books and tongues not indeed the normanfrench and demilatin and jargon of the schools printed for english in impotent old trimestrials for the further fogification of cliques but he had laid by a fair store of the bestof the monosyllablesthe saxonthe soul and vestal fire of the great english tongue so he was never at a loss for words simple clear strong like blasts of a horn his voice at this period was mellow and flexible he was a mimic too the brighter things he had seen whether glories of nature or acts of man had turned to pictures in this mans mind he flashed these pictures one after another upon the trio he peopled the soft and cushioned drawingroom with twenty different tribes and varieties of man barbarous semibarbarous and civilized their curious customs their songs and chants and dances and struts and actual postures the aspect of famous shores from the sea glittering coasts dark straits volcanic rocks defying sea and sky and warm delicious islands clothed with green that burst on the mariners sight after rugged places and scowling skies the adventures of one unlucky ship the connemara on a single whaling cruise on the coast of peru the first slight signs of a gale seen only by the careful skipper the hasty preparations for it all hands to shorten sail then the moaning of the wind high up in the sky all hands to reef sail nowthe whirl and whoo of the gale as it came down on them the ship careening as it caught her the speakingtrumpetthe captain howling his orders through it amid the tumult the floating icebergsthe ship among them picking her way in and out a hundred deaths baffled by the unyielding wind off cape horn sailing six weeks on opposite tacks and ending just where they began weatherbound in sight of the gloomy horn then the terrors of a landlocked bay and a lee shore the ship tacking writhing twisting to weather one jutting promontory the sea and safety is on the other side of it land and destruction on thisthe attempt the hope the failure then the stouthearted skillful captain would try one rare maneuver to save the ship cargo and crew he would clubhaul her and if that fails my lads there is nothing but up mainsail up helm run her slap ashore and lay her bones on the softest bit of rock we can pick long ere this the poor ship had become a live thing to all these four and they hung breathless on her fate then he showed how a ship is clubhauled and told how nobly the old connemara behaved ships are apt to when well handleddoublebarreled guns ditto and how the wind blew fiercer and the rocks seemed to open their mouths for her and how she hung and vibrated between safety and destruction and at last how she writhed and slipped between deaths lips yet escaped his teeth and tossed and tumbled in triumph on the great but fair fighting sea and how they got at last to the whaling ground and could not find a whale for many a weary day and the novices said they were all killed before we sailed and how as uncommon ill luck is apt to be balanced by uncommon good luck one fine evening they fell in with a whole shoal of whales at play jumping clean into the air sixty feet long and coming down each with a splash like thunder even the captain had never seen such a game and how the crew were for lowering the boats and going at them but the captain would not let them a hundred playful mountains of fish the smallest weighing thirty ton flopping down happygolucky he did not like the looks of it the boat will be at the mercy of chance among all those tails and we are not lucky enough to throw at random no since the beggars have taken to dancing for a change let them dance all night tomorrow they shall pay the piper how at peep of day the man at the masthead saw ten whales about two leagues off on the weatherbow how the ship tacked and stood toward them how she weathered on one of monstrous size and how he and the other youngsters were mad to lower the boat and go after it and how the captain said ye lubbers cant ye see that is a right whale and not worth a button look here away over the quarter at this whale see how low she spouts she is a sperm whale and worth seven hundred pounds if she was only dead and towed alongside that she shall be in about a minute cried one and indeed we were all in a flame the boat was lowered and didnt i worship the skipper when he told me off to be one of her crew i was that eager to be in at that whales death i didnt recollect there might be smaller brutes in danger just before the oars fell into the water the skipper looked down over the bulwarks and says he to one of us that had charge of the rope that is fast to the boat at one end and to the harpoon at the other now jack you are a new hand mind all i told you last night or your mother will see me come ashore without you and that will vex her and my lads remember if there is a single lubberly hitch in that line you will none of you come up the ships side again all right captain says jack and we pulled off singing and spring to your oars and make your boat fly and when you come near her beware of her eye till the coxswain bade us hold our lubberly tongues and not frighten the whales however we soon found we wanted all our breath for our work and more too then david painted the furious race after the whale and how the boat gradually gained and how at last as he was grinding his teeth and pulling like mad he heard a sound ahead like a hundred elephants wallowing and now he hoped to see the harpooner leave his oar and rise and fling his weapon but that instant up flukes a tower of fish was seen a moment in the air with a tailfin at the top of it just about the size of this room we are sitting in ladies and down the whale sounded then it was pull on again in her wake according as she headed in sounding pull for the dear life and after a while the oarsmen saw the steermans eyes prying over the sea turn like hot coals the men caught fire at this and put their very backbones into each stroke and the boat skimmed and flew suddenly the steersman cried out fiercely stand up harpoon up rose the harpooner his eye like a hot coal now the men saw nothing they must pull fiercer than ever the harpooner balanced his iron swayed his body lightly and the harpoon hissed from him a soft thudthen a heaving of the water all round a slap that sounded like a church tower falling flat upon an acre of boards and drenched and blinded and half smothered us all in spray and at the same moment away whirled the boat dancing and kicking in the whales foaming bubbling wake and we holding on like grim death by the thwarts not to be spun out into the sea delightful cried miss fountain the waves bounded beneath you like a steed that knows its rider pray continue yes miss fountain now of course you can see that if the line ran out too easy the whale would leave us astern altogether and if it jammed or ran too hard she would tow us under water of course we see said eve ironically we understand everything by instinct hang explanations when im excited go ahead do then i wont explain how it is or why it is but ill just let you know that two or three hundred fathom of line are passed round the boat from stem to stern and back and carried in and out between the oarsmen as they sit well it was all new to me then but when the boat began jumping and rocking and the line began whizzing in and out and screaming and smoking likethere now fancy a machine a complicated one made of poisonous serpents the steam on and you sitting in the middle of the works with not an inch to spare on the crankest rockingest jumpingest bumpingest rollingest cradle that ever david said eve solemnly hallo sang out david dont oh yes do cried lucy slightly clasping her hands if this little black ugly line was to catch you it would spin you out of the boat like a shuttlecock if it held you it would cut you in two or hang you to death or drown you all at one time and if it got jammed against anything alive or dead that could stand the strain it would take the boat and crew down to the coral before you could wink twice oh dear said lucy then i dont think i like it now it is too terrible pray go on mrmr well miss fountain when a novice like me saw this black serpent twisting and twirling and smoking and hissing in and out among us i remembered the skippers words and i hailed jackit was he had laid the linehe was in the bow jack said i hallo said he for gods sake are there any hitches in the line said i not as i knows on says he much cooler than you sit there and that is a sailor all over well she towed us about a mile and then she was blown and we hauled up on the line and came up with her and drove lances into her till she spouted blood instead of salt water and went into her flurry and rolled suddenly over our way dead and was within a foot of smashing us to atoms but if she had it would only have been an accident for she was past malice poor thing then we took possession planted our flagstaff in her spoutinghole you know and pulled back to the ship and she came down and anchored to the whale and then for the first time i saw the blubber stripped off a whale and hoisted by tackles into the ships hold which is as curious as any part of the business but a dirtyish job and not fit for the present company and i dare say that is enough about whales no no no well then shall i tell you how one old whale knocked our boat clean into the air bottom uppermost and how we swam round her and managed to right her and went back to the ship and had your tea in bed and your clothes dried no eve replied david with the utmost simplicity we got in and to work again and killed the whale in less than half an hour and planted our flag on her and away after another then he told them how they harpooned one right whale and by good luck were able to make her fast to the stern of the ship and if you will believe me miss fountain though there was just a breath on and off right aft and the foresail jib and mizzen all set to catch it she towed the ship astern a good cables length and the last thing was she broke the harpoon shaft just below the line and away she swam right in the winds eye and there was an end of her and your nasty cruel harpoon andoh im so pleased no there wasnt eve we heard of both fish and harpoon again but not for a good many years mr dodd yes miss fountain it is curious like many things that fall out at sea but not so wonderful as her towing a ship of four hundred tons with the foresail mizzen and jib all aback well sir did you ever hear of nantucket it is a port in the united states and our harpooner happened to be there full four years after we lost this whale some yankee whalers were treating him to the best of grog and it was brag briton brag yankee according to custom whenever these two met well our man had no more invention than a stone so he was getting the worst of it till he bethought him of this whale so he up and told how he had struck a right whale in the pacific and she had towed the ship with her sails aback at least her foresail mizzen and jib only he didnt tell it short like me but as long as the red sea with the day and the hour the latitude within four or five degrees i take it and what we had done a week before and what we had not done all by way of prologue and for fear of weathering the horntic ticthe point of the story too soon when he had done there was a general howl of laughter and they began to cap lies with him and so they bantered him most cruelly by all accounts but at last a long silent chap weatherbeaten to the color of rosewood put in his word what was the ships name mate the connemara says he and what is your name so he told him jem green the other brings a great mutton fist down on the table and makes all the glasses dance you stay at your moorings till i come back says he i have got something belonging to you jem green and he sheered off the others lay to and passed the grog presently the long one comes back with a harpoon steel in his hand there was connemara stamped on it and also james green graved with a knife is that yours is my hand mine says jem but wasnt there a broken shaft to it there was says the yankee harpooner i cut it out well says jem that is the harpoon we were fast by to this very whale where did you kill her in the greenland seas and he whips out his private log here you are says he march latitude so and so killed a right whale lost half the blubber owing to the carcass sinking cut an english harpoon out of her avast there mate cried jem and he whips out his log overhaul that the other harpooner overhauled it mates look here says he i reckon we haint fathomed the critters yet the britisher struck her in the pacific on the th of march and we killed her off greenland on the th five thousand miles of water by the lowest reckoning by this time there were a dozen heads jammed together like bees swarming over the two logs she got a wound in the pacific hallo says she this is no sea for a lady to live in so she up helm and right away across the pole into the atlantic and met her death your story has an interest you little suspect young gentleman if this is true the northwest passage is proved that has been proved a hundred times sir and in a hundred ways the only riddle is to find it the man that tells you there is not a northwest passage is no sailor and the fish that cant find it is not a whale for there is not a young suckling no bigger than this room that does not know that passage as well as a mid on his first voyage knows the way to the mizzentop through lubbers hole how tired you must be of whales ladies oh no kill us one more david i love bloodshedto hear of well now i dont think that can be miss fountains taste to look at her then david told them how he had fallen in with a sperm whale dead of disease floating as high as a frigate how with a very light breeze the skipper had crept down toward her how at half a mile distance the stench of her was severe but as they neared her awful then so intolerable that the skipper gave the crew leave to go below and close the lee ports so there were but two men left on the brigs deck and a ships company that a hurricane would not have driven from their duty skulked before a foul smell but such a smell a smell that struck a chill and a loathing to the heart and soul and marrowbone a smell like the gases in a foul mine it would have suffocated us in a few moments if we had been shut up along with it then he told how the skipper and he stuffed their noses and ears with cotton steeped in aromatic vinegar and their mouths with pigtail by which as it subsequently appeared lucy understood pork or bacon in some form unknown to her narrow experience and lighted short pipes and breached the brig upon the putrescent monster and grappled to it and then the skipper jumped on it a basket slung to his back and a rope fast under his shoulders in case of accident and drove his spade in behind the whales sidefin his spade mr dodd his whalespade it is as sharp as a razor and how the skipper dug a hole in the whale as big as a well and four feet deep and after a long search gave a shout of triumph and picked out some stuff that looked like gloucester cheese and when he had nearly filled his basket with this stuff he slacked the grapplingiron and david hauled him on board and the carcass dropped astern and the captain sang out for rum and drank a small tumbler neat and would have fainted away spite of his precautions but for the rum and how a heavenly perfume was now on deck fighting with that horrid odor and how the crew smelled it and crept timidly up one by one and how the gloster cheese was a great favorite of yours ladies it was the king of perfumesambergas there is some of it in all your richest scents and the knowing skipper had made a hundred guineas in the turn of the hand so knowledge is wealth you see and the sweet can be got out of the sour by such as study nature dont preach david especially after just telling a fib a hundred guineas i am wrong said david very wrong indeed there were eight pounds and he sold it at a guinea the ounce to a wholesale chemist so that looks to me like pounds then david left the whales and encouraged by bright eyes and winning smiles and warm questions sang higher strains ships in dire distress at sea yet saved by gods mercy and the cool invincible courage of captain and crewgreat ships run ashorethe waves breaking them upthe rigging black with the despairing crew eying the watery death that tumbled and gaped and roared for them below and then little shore boats manned by daring hearts launched into the surf and going out to the great ship and her peril risking more life for the chance of saving life and he did not present the bare skeletons of daring acts those grand morgues the journals do that there lie the dry bones of giant epics waiting geniuss hand to make them live he gave them not only the broad outward factsthe bones but those smaller touches that are the body and soul of a story true or false wanting which the deeds of heroes sound an almanac above all he gave them glimpses not only of what men acted but what they felt what passed in the hearts of men perishing at sea in sight of land houses fires on the hearth and outstretched hands and in the hearts of the heroes that ran their boats into the surf and deaths maw to save them and of the lookers on admiring fearing shivering glowing and of the women that sobbed and prayed ashore with their backs to the sea just able to risk lover husband and son for the honor of manhood and the love of christ but not able to look on at their own flesh and blood diving so deep and lost so long in cockleshells between the hills of waves such great acts great feelings great perils and the gushes that crowned all of holy triumph when the boats came in with the dripping and saved and man for a moment looked greater than the sea and the wind and death this seaman poured hot from his own manly heart into quick and womanly bosoms that heaved visibly and glowed with admiring sympathy and fluttered with gentle fear and after a while though not at first davids yarns began to contain a double interest to one of the partymiss fountain those who live to please get to read character at sight and david though in these more noble histories he scarcely named himself was laying a fulllength picture of his own mind bare to these keen feminine eyes as for old fountain he was charmed and saw nothing more than david showed him outright but the women sat flashing secret intelligence backward and forward from eye to eye after the manner of their sex do you see said one ladys eyes yes replied the other he was concerned in this feat though he does not say so oh you agree with me then we are right replied the first pair of speakers there again look this sailor whom he describes as a fellow that happened to be ashore at that foreign port with nothing better to do and who went out with the english smugglers to save the brig when the natives durst not launch a boat himself not a doubt of it and so the blue and hazel lightning went dancing to and fro ay even when the tale took a sorrowful turn and dimmed these bright orbs of intelligence the lightning struggled through the dew and david was read and discussed by gleams and glances and flashes without a word spoken and he all unconscious that he sat between a pair of telegraphs and heating more and more under his great recollections and his hearers sympathy inthralled them with his tuneful voice his glowing face his lion eye and his breathing burning histories heart to dare and do yet heart to feel and brain and tongue to tell a deed well are rare allies yet here they met he mastered his hearers and played on their breasts as david played the harp and perhaps achilles bochsa never nor any of his tribe he made the old man forget his genealogies his small ambition his gout his years and be a boy again an hour or two in thought and blood and early fire he made the womens bosoms pant and swell and seem to aspire to be the nests and cradles of heroes and their eyes flash and glisten and their cheeks flush and grow pale by turns and the four little papered walls that confined them seemed to fall without noise and they were away in thought out of a carpeted temple of wax small talk nonentity and nonentities away to seabreezes that they almost felt in their hair and round their temples as their hearts rose and fell upon a broad swell of passion perils waves male men realities the spell was at its height when the seawizards eye fell on the mantelpiece died in a moment his noble ardor why it is eight bells said he servilely then doggedly time to turn in hang that clock shouted mr fountain ill have it turned out of the room said lucy with gentle enthusiasm it must be beautiful to be a sailor and to have seen the real world and above all to be brave and strong like mr must it not uncle and she looked askant at davids square shoulders and lion eye and for the first time in her life there crossed her an undefined instinct that this gentleman must be the male of her species as for his courage said eve that we have only his own word for david grinned not even that replied lucy for i observed he spoke but little of himself i did not notice that said eve pertly but as for his strength he certainly is as strong as a great bear and as rude what do you think my lord carried me all the way from the top of the green lane to your house and i am no feather no a skein of silk put in david i asked the gentleman politely to put me down and he wouldnt so then i boxed his ears oh how could you oh bless you he never hits me again he is too great a coward and the great mule carried me all the morecarried me to your very door i almost thinki believe i could guess why he carried you if you will not be offended at my assuming the interpreter said lucy looking at eve and speaking at david you have thin shoes on miss dodd now i remember the gravel ends at green lane and the grass begins so from what we know of mr dodd perhaps he carried you that you might not have damp feet nothing of the kindyes it was though by his coloring up la david dear boy what is a man alongside for but to keep a girl out of mischief said david bruskly pray convert all your sex to that view laughed lucy so now they were going then mr fountain thanked david for the pleasant evening he had given them then david blushed and stammered he had a veneration for old ageanother of his superstitions her uncles lead gave lucy an opportunity she instantly seized mr dodd you have taken us into a new world of knowledge we never were so interested in our lives at this pointblank praise david blushed and was anything but comfortable and began to back out of it all with a curt bow then as the ladies can advance when a man of merit retreats lucy went the length of putting out her hand with a sweet grateful smile so he took it and in the ardor of encouraging so much spirit and modesty she unconsciously pressed it on this delicious pressure light as it was he raised his full brown eye and gave her such a straightforward look of manly admiration and pleasure that she blushed faintly and drew back a little in her turn well davy dear how do you like the fountains eve she is a clipper and the old gentleman he was very friendly what do you think of her she is an outandout woman of the world and very agreeable as insincere people generally are i like her because she was so polite to you oh that is your reading of her is it the rest of the walk passed almost in silence uncle i am not sleepy tonight who is that young rascal has set me on fire with his yarns who would have thought that awkward cub had so much in him awkward but not a cub say rather a black swan and you know uncle a swan is an awkward thing on land but when it takes the water it is glorious and that man was glorious butdavid dodd i dont know whether he was glorious but i know he amused me and ill have him to tea three times a week while he lasts uncle do you believe such an unfortunate combination of sounds is his real name asked lucy gravely why who would be mad enough to feign such a name that is true but now tell meif he should ever think of marrying with such a name then there will be two david dodds in the world mr and mrs i dont think so he will be merciful and take her name instead of she his he is so goodnatured ordinary sponsors would have been content with samuel or nathan but no this ones must call in apt alliterations artful aid and have the two ds lucy assented with a smile and so being no longer under the spell of the enthusiast and the male the genealogist and the fine lady took the rise out of what miss fountain was pleased to call his impossible title david dodd chapter iii lucy was not called on to write any more formal invitations to mr talboys her uncle used merely to say to her talboys dines with us today she made no remark she respected her uncles preference besidesthe pony of these trios mr fountain was the true soul he had to blow the coals of conversation right and left it is very good of me not to compare him to the tropic between two frigid zones at first he took his nap as usual for he said to himself now i have started them they can go on besides he had seen pictures in the shop windows of an old fellow dozing and then the young ones popping dozing off with this idea uppermost he used to wake with his eyes shut and his ears wide open but it was to hear drowsy monosyllables dropping out at intervals like minuteguns or to find lucy gone and talboys reading the coals then the schemer sighed and took to strong coffee soon after dinner and gave up his nap and its loss impaired his temper the rest of the evening he indemnified himself for these sleepless dinners by asking david dodd and his sister to tea thrice a week on the offnights this joyous pair amused the old gentleman and he was not the man to deny himself a pleasure without a powerful motive what again so soon hazarded lucy one day that he bade her invite them i hardly know how to word my invitation i have exhausted the forms if you say another word ill make them come every night am i to have no amusement he added in a deep tone of reproach they make me laugh ah i forgot forgive me little hypocrite dont they you too pray why you are as dull as ditchwater the other evenings me dear dull with you yes miss crocodile dull with a pattern uncle and his friendand your admirer he watched her to see how she would take this last word catch her taking it at all i am never dull with you dear uncle said she but a third person however estimable is a certain restraint and when that person is not very lively here the explanation came quietly to an untimely end like those old tunes that finish in the middle or thereabouts but that is the very thing what do i ask them for tonight but to thaw talboys to thaw talboys he he lucy seemed so tickled by this expression that the old gentleman was sorry he had used it i mean they will make him laugh then to turn it off he said hastily and dont forget the fiddle lucy oh yes dear please let me forget that and then perhaps they may forget to bring it why you pressed him to bring it i heard you did i said lucy ruefully i am sure i thought you were mad after a fiddle you seconded eve so warmly so that was only your extravagant politeness after all i am glad you are caught i like a fiddle so there is no harm done yes reader you have hit it eve who openly quizzed her brother but secretly adored him and loved to display all his accomplishments had egged on mr fountain to ask david to bring his violin next time lucy had shivered internally now of all the screeching whining things that i dislike a violinand thus thinking gushed out oh pray do mr dodd with a gentle warmth that settled the matter and imposed on all around this evening then the dodds came to tea they found lucy alone in the drawingroom and eve engaged her directly in sprightly conversation into which they soon drew david and interchanging a secret signal plied him with a few artful questions andlaunched him but the one sketch i gave of his manner and matter must serve again and again were i to retail to the reader all the droll the spirited the exciting things he told his hearers there would be no room for my own little story and we are all so egotistical suffice it to say the living book of travels was inexhaustible his observation and memory were really marvelous and his enthusiasm coupled with his accuracy of detail had still the power to inthrall his hearers mr dodd said lucy now i see why eastern kings have a storyteller always about thema live storyteller would not you have one miss dodd if you were queen of persia me id have a coupleone to make me laugh one miserable one would be enough if his resources were equal to your brothers pray go on mr dodd it was madness to interrupt you with small talk david hung his head for a moment then lifted it with a smile and sailed in the spirit into the china seas and there told them how the chinamen used to slip on board his ship and steal with supernatural dexterity and the sailors catch them by the tails which they observing came ever with their tails soaped like pigs at a village feast and how some foolhardy sailors would venture into the town at the risk of their lives and how one day they had to run for it and when they got to the shore their boat was stolen and they had to bout ship and fight it out and one fellow who knew the natives had loaded the sailors guns with currant jelly make readypresentfire in a moment the troops of the celestial empire smarted and were spattered with seeming gore and fled yelling then he told how a poor comrade of his was nabbed and clapped in prison and his hands and feet were to be cut off at sunrise himself at noon it was midnight and strict orders from the quarterdeck had been issued that no man should leave the ship what was to be done it was a moonlight night they met silent as death between decksdarent speak above a whisper for fear the officers should hear them his messmate was crying like a child one proposed one thing one another but it was all nonsense and we knew it was and at sunrise poor tom must die at last up jumps one fellow and cries messmates ive got it tom isnt dead yet this was the moment mr fountain and mr talboys chose for coming into the drawingroom of course mr fountain with a shade of hesitation and awkwardness introduced the dodds to mr talboys he bowed a little stiffly and there was a pause eve could not repress a little movement of nervous impatience david is telling us one of his nonsensical stories sir said she to mr fountain and it is so interesting go on david well but said david modestly it isnt everybody that likes these seayarns as you do eve no ill belay and let my betters get a word in now you are more merciful than most storytellers sir said talboys eve tossed her head and looked at lucy who with a word could have the story go on again that young ladys face expressed general complacency politeness and tout mest egal eve could have beat her for not taking davids part doubleface thought she she then devoted herself with the sly determination of her sex to trotting david out and making him the principal figure in spite of the newcorner but as fast as she heated him talboys cooled him we are all great at something or other small or great talboys was a firstrate freezer he was one of those men who cannot shine but can eclipse they darken all but a vain man by casting a dark shadow of trite sentences on each luminary the vain man insults them directly and so gets rid of them talboys kept coming across honest enthusiastic david with little remarks each skillfully discordant with the rising sentiment was he droll talboys did a bit of polite gravity on him was he warm in praise of some gallant action chill irony trickled on him from t his flashes of romance were extinguished by neat little dicta embodying sordid and false but current views of life the gauze wings of eloquence unsteeled by vanity will not bear this repeated dabbing with prose glue so david collapsed and talboys conqueredspell benumbed charm the seawizard yielded to the petrifier and could no more as the poets say talboys smiled superior but as his art was a purely destructive one it ended with its victim not having an idea of his own in his skull the commentator in silencing his text silenced himself and brought the society to a standstill eve sat with flashing eyes lucys twinkled with sly fun this made eve angrier she tried another tack you asked david to bring his fiddle said she sharply but i suppose now has he brought it asked mr fountain eagerly yes he has i made him with a glance of defiance at talboys mr fountain rang the bell directly and sent for the fiddle it came david took it and tuned it and made it discourse lucy leaned a little back in her chair wore her tout mest egal face and eve watched her like a cat first her eyes opened with a mild astonishment then her lips parted in a smile after a while a faint color came and went and her eyes deepened and deepened in color and glistened with the dewy light of sensibility a fiddle wrought this or rather genius in whose hand a jewsharp is the lyre of orpheus a fiddle the harp of david a chisel a hewer of heroic forms a brush or a pen the scepter of souls and alas a nail a picklock inside every fiddle is a soul but a coy one the nine hundred and ninetynine never win it they play rapid tunes but the soul of beautiful gayety is not there slow tunes very slow ones wherein the spirit of whining is mighty but the sweet soul of pathos is absent doleful not nice and tearful then comes the heavenborn fiddler who can make himself cry with his own fiddle david had a touch of this witchcraft though a sound musician and reasonably master of his instrument he could not fly in a second up and down it tickling the fingerboard and scratching the strings without an atom of tone as the mechanical monkeys do that boobies call fine players this is a definition of the heavenborn fiddler by pate bailey a gypsy tinker and celestial violinist being asked for a test of proficiency on that instrument he replied that no man is a fiddler till he can gar himsel greet wi a feddle great orpheus played so well he moved old nick but these move nothing but their fiddlestick see how unjust satire is dont they move their finger nails but he could make you laugh and crow with his fiddle and could make you jump up aetat and snap your fingers at old age and propriety and propose a jig to two bishops and one master of the rolls and they declining pity them without a shade of anger and substitute three chairs then sit unabashed and smiling at the past and the next minute he could make you cry or near it in a word he could evoke the soul of that wonderful wooden shell and bid it discourse with the souls and hearts of his hearers meantime lucy fountains face would have interested a subtle student of her sex her sensibility to music was great and the feeling strains stole into her nature and stirred the treasures of the deep to the surface eve a keen if not a profound observer was struck by the rising beauty of this countenance over which so many moods chased one another she said to herself well david is right after all she is a lovely girl her features are nothing out of the way her nose is neither one thing nor the other but her expression is beautiful none of your wooden faces for me and dear heart how her neck rises la how her color comes and goes well i do love the fiddle myself dearly and now if her eyes are not brimming i could kiss her la david cried she bursting the bounds of silence that is enough of the tune the old cow died of take and play something to keep our hearts updo eves goodhumor and mirth were restored by davids success and now nothing would serve her turn but a duet pianoforte and violin miss fountain objected why spoil the violin david objected too i had hoped to hear the pianoforte and how can i with a fiddle sounding under my chin eve overruled both peremptorily well miss dodd what shall we select but it does not matter i feel sure mr dodd can play a livre ouvert not he said eve hypocritically being secretly convinced he could can you play a leevre ouvert david who is it by miss fountain lucy never moved a muscle after a rummage a duet was found that looked promising and the performance began in the middle david stopped ha ha davids broke down shrieked eve concealing her uneasiness under fictitious gayety i thought he would i beg your pardon explained david to miss fountain but you are out of time am i said lucy composedly and have been more or less all through david you forget yourself no no set me right by all means mr dodd i am not a hardened offender is it not just possible the violin may be the instrument that is out of time suggested talboys insidiously no said david simply i was right enough let us try again mr dodd play me a few bars first in exact time thank you now all went merry as a marriage bell for a page and a half then david fiddling away cried out you are getting too fast ri tum tiddy iddy ri tum ti then by stamping and accenting very strongly he kept the piano from overflowing its bounds the piece ended eve rubbed her hands now youll catch it mr david i am afraid i gave you a great deal of trouble mr dodd en revanche you gave us a great deal of pleasure put in mr talboys lucy turned her head and smiled graciously but pianoforte players play so much by themselves they really forget the awful importance of time i profit by your confession that they do sometimes play by themselves said mr talboys be merciful and let us hear you by yourself eve turned as red as fire david backed the request sincerely lucy played a piece composed expressly for the piano by a pianist of the day david sat on her left hand and watched intently how she did it when it was over talboys did a bit of rapture eve another that is playing i would not have believed it if i had not seen it done said david eve you should have seen her beautiful fingers thread in and out among the keys it was like white fire dancing and as for her hand it is not troubled with joints like ours i should say the music mr dodd said lucy severely oh the music well i could hardly take on me to say you see i heard it by the eye and that was all in its favor but i should say the music wasnt worth a button david how you run off with ones words eve i mean played by anybody but her why what was it when you come to think up and down the gamut and then down and up no more sense in it than a b ca scramble to the mainmasthead for nothing and back to no good id as lief see you play on the table miss fountain poor moscheles said lucy dryly revenge is in your power said talboys play no more punish us all for this one heretic lucy reflected a moment she then took from the canterbury a thick old book this was my mothers her taste was pure in music as in everything i shall be sorry if you do not all like this added she softly it was an old mass full magnificent chords in long succession strung together on a clear but delicate melody she played it to perfection her lovely hands seemed to grasp the chords no fumbling in the base no gelatinizing in the treble her touch firm and masterly yet feminine evoked the soul of her instrument as david had of his and she thought of her mother as she played these were those golden strains from which all mortal dross seems purged hearing them so played you could not realize that he who writ them had ever eaten drunk smoked snuffed and hated the composer next door she who played them felt their majesty and purity she lifted her beaming eye to heaven as she played and the color receded from her cheek and when her enchantment ended she was silent and all were silent and their ears ached for the departed charm then she looked round a mute inquiry talboys applauded loudly but the tear stood in davids eye and he said nothing well david said eve reproachfully im sure if that does not please you please me cried david a little fretfully more shame for me if it does not please is not the word it is angel music i call itah well you need not break your heart for that he is going to cryha ha im no such thing cried david indignantly and blew his nosepromptly with a vague air of explanation and defiance but why the male of my species blows its nose to hide its sensibility a deeper than i must decide mr talboys for some time had not been at his ease he had been playing too and an instrument he hatedsecond fiddle he rose and joined mr fountain who was sitting half awake on a distant sofa aha thought eve exulting we have driven him away judge her mortification when lucy after shutting the piano joined her uncle and mr talboys eve whispered david gone to smooth him down the high and mighty gentleman wasnt made enough of every one in their turn said david calmly that is manners look it is the old gentleman she is being kind to she could not be unkind to anyone however eve put her lips to davids ear she will be unkind to you if you are ever mad enough to let her see what i see said she in a cutting whisper what do you see more than there is to see ill wager said david looking down ah that is the way with young men the moment they take a fancy their sister is nothing to them their best friend loses their confidence dont ye say that evenow dont say that no no david never mind me i am cross and if you saw a sore heart in store for anyone you had a regard for wouldnt you be cross young men are so stupid they cant read a girl no more than hebrew if she is civil and affable to them oh they are the man directly when instead of that if it was so she would more likely be shy and half afraid to come near them david you are in a fools paradise in company and even in flirtation all sorts meet and part again but it isnt so with marriage there it is beasts of a kind that in one are joined and birds of a feather that came together like to like david she is a fine lady and she will marry a fine gentleman and nothing else with a large income if she knew what has been in your head this month past she would open her eyes and ask if the man was mad she has a right to look down on me i know murmured david humbly but his eye glowing with sudden rapture she doesntshe doesnt look down on you you are better company than she is or anyone she can get in thisoutoftheway place it is her interest to be civil to you i am too hard upon her she is a ladya perfect ladyand that is why she is above giving herself airs no david she is not the one to treat us with disrespect if we dont forget ourselves but if ever you let her see that you are in love with her you will get an affront that will make your cheek burn and my heart smartso i tell you hush i never told you i was in love with her never told me never told me who asked you to tell me i have eyes if you have none eve said david imploringly i dont hear of any lover that she has do you no said eve carelessly but who knows she passes half the year a hundred miles from this and there are young men everywhere if she was a milkmaid theyd turn to look at her with such a face and figure as that much more a young lady with every grace and every charm she has more than one after her that we never see take my word eve had no sooner said this than she regretted it for davids face quivered and he sighed like one trying to recover his breath after a terrible blow what made this and the succeeding conversation the more trying and peculiar was that the presence of other persons in the room though at a considerable distance compelled both brother and sister though anything but calm to speak sotto voce but in the history of mankind more strange and incongruous matter has been dealt with in an undertone and with artificial and forced calmness my poor david said eve sorrowfully you who used to be so proud so highspirited be a man dont throw away such a treasure as your affection for my sake dear david your sisters sake who does love you so very very dearly and i love you eve thank you it was hard lines ah but it is wholesome no doubt like most bitters yes thank you eve i do admire her vvery much and his voice faltered a little but i am a man for all that and ill stand to my own words ill never be any womans slave that is right david i will not give hot for cold nor my heart for a smile or two i cant help admiring her and i do hope she will behappyahwhoever she fancies but if i am never to command her i wont carry a willow at my masthead and drift away from reason and manhood and my duty to you and mother and myself ah david if you could see how noble you look now is it a promise david for i know you will keep your word if once you pass it there is my hand on it eve the brother and sister grasped hands and when david was about to withdraw his eves soft but vigorous little hand closed tighter and kept it firmer and so they sat in silence eve my dear now dont you be cross no dear eve is sad not cross what is it well evedear eve dont be afraid to speak your mind to mewhy should you well then eve now if she had not some little kindness for me would she be so pleased with these thundering yarns i keep spinning her as old as adam and as stale as bilgewater you that are so keen how comes it you dont notice her eyes at these times i feel them shine on me like a couple of suns they would make a statue pay the yarn out who ever fancied my chat as she does david said eve quietly i have thought of all this but i am convinced now there is nothing in it you see david mother and i are used to your yarns and so we take them as a matter of course but the real fact is they are very interesting and very enticing and you tell them like a book you came all fresh to this lady and as she is very quick she had the wit to see the merit of your descriptions directly i can see it myself now all young women like to be amused david and above all excited and your stories are very exciting that is the charm that is what makes her eyes fire but if that puppy there or that bookshelf yonder could tell her your stories she would look at either the puppy or the bookstand with just the same eyes she looks on you with my poor david dont say so eve let me think there is some little feeling for me inside those sweet eyes that look so kind on me and on me and on everybody it is her manner i tell you she is so to all the world she isnt the first ive met trust me to read a woman david what can you know i know nothing but they tell me you can fathom one another better than any man ever could said david sorrowfully david just now you were telling as interesting a story as ever was you had just got to the thrilling part oh had i what was i saying i cant tell you to the very word i am not your sweetheart any more than she is but one of the sailors was in danger of his life and so on you never told me the story before i was not worth it well just then does not that affected puppy choose his time to come meandering in puppy i call him a fine gentleman well there isnt so much odds in he comes your story is broken off directly does she care no she has got one of her own set he is not a very bright one he is next door to a fool no matter before he came to judge by her crocodile eyes she was hot after your story the moment he did come she didnt care a pin for you nor your story i gave her more than one opening to bring it on again not she i tell you you are nothing but a pass time you suit her turn so long as none of her own set are to be had if she would leave you for such a jackanapes as that what would she do for a real gentleman such a man as she is a woman for instance and as if there werent plenty such in her own setoh you goose i write this word as the lady thought proper to pronounce it david interrupted her i have been a vain fool and it is lucky no one has seen it but you and he hid his face in his hands a moment then suddenly remembering where he was and that this was an attitude to attract attention he tried to laugha piteous effort then he ground his teeth and said let us go home all i want now is to get out of the house it would have been better for me if i had never set foot in it hush be calm david for heavens sake i am only waiting to catch her eye and then well bid them goodevening very well ill wait and david fixed his eyes sadly and doggedly on the ground i wont look at her if i can help it said he resolutely but very sadly and turned his head away now david whispered eve david rose mechanically and moved with his sister toward the other group miss fountain turned at their approach somewhat to davids surprise eve retreated as quickly as she had advanced we are to stay what for she made me a signal not that i saw said david incredulously what didnt you see her give me a look yes i did but what has that to do with it that look was as much as to say please stay a little longer i have something to say to you good heavens i think it is about a bonnet david i asked her to put me in the way of getting one made like hers she does wear heavenly bonnets ay i did well to listen to you eve you see i cant even read her face much less her heart i saw her look up but that was all how is a poor fellow to make out such craft as these that can signal one another a whole page with a flash of the eye ah there david he is going was i right mr talboys was in fact taking leave of miss fountain the old gentleman convoyed his friend as the door closed on them miss fountains face seemed to catch fire her sweet complacency gave way to a halfjoyous halfirritated small energy she came gliding swiftly though not hurriedly up to eve thank you for seeing then she settled softly and gradually on an ottoman saying now mr dodd david looked puzzled what is it and he turned to his interpreter eve but it was lucy who replied his messmate was crying like a child at sunrise poor tom must die then up rose one fellow we have not any idea who one fellow means in these narrativeshave we miss dodd and cried i have it messmates tom isnt dead yet now mr dodd between that sentence and the one that is to follow all that has happened in this room was a hideous dream on that understanding we have put up with it it is now happily dispersed and wego ahead again i see eve she thinks she would like some more of that china yarn her sentiments are not so tame she longs for it thirsts for it and must and will have itif you will be so very obliging mr dodd the contrast between all this singular vivacity of miss fountain and the sudden return to her native character and manner in the last sentence struck the sister as very drollseemed to the brother so winning that scarcely master of himself he burst out you shant ask me twice for that or anything i can give you and it was with burning cheeks and happy eyes he resumed his tale of bold adventure and skill on one side of numbers danger and difficulty on the other he told it now like one inspired and both the young ladies hung panting and glowing on his words david and eve went home together david was in a triumphant state but waited for eve to congratulate him eve was silent at last david could refrain no longer why you say nothing no common sense is too good to be wasted dont go so fast no therei heave to for convoy to close up would it be wasted on me ha ha tonight there you go pelting on again eve i cant help it i feel all canvas with a cargo of angels feathers and sunshine for ballast moonshine sun moon and stars and all that is bright by night or day ill tell you what to do you keep your head free and come on under easy sail ill stand across your bows with every rag set and drawing so then i shall be always within hail this soberminded maneuver was actually carried out the little corvette sailed steadily down the middle of the lane the great merchantman went pitching and rolling across her bows thus they kept together though their rates of sailing were so different merry eve never laughed once but she smiled and then sighed david did not heed her all of a moment his heart vented itself in a seaditty so loud and clear and mellow that windows opened and out came nightcapped heads to hear him carol the lusty stave making night jolly meantime the weather being balmy mr fountain had walked slowly with mr talboys in another direction mr talboys inquired who were these people oh only two humble neighbors was the reply i never met them anywhere they are received in the neighborhood not in society of course i dont understand you have not i just met them here that is not the way to put it said the old gentleman a little confused you did not meet them you did me and my niece the honor to dine with us and the dodds dropped in to teaquite another matter oh is it is it not i see you have been so long out of england you have forgotten these little distinctions society would go to the deuce without them we ask our friends and persons of our own class to dinner but we ask who we like to tea in this county dont you like her she is the prettiest girl in the village pretty and pert ha ha that is true she is saucy enough and amusing in proportion it is the man i alluded to what david ay a very worthy lad he is a downright modest wellinformed young man i dont doubt his general merits but let me ask you a serious question his evident admiration of miss fountain his admiration of miss fountain is it agreeable to you it is a matter of consummate indifference to me but not i think to her she showed a submission to the cubs impertinence and a desire to please instead of putting him down that made me suspect do you often ask mr doddwhat a nameto tea my dear friend i see that with all your accomplishments you have something to learn you want insight into female character now i who must go to school to you on most points can be of use to you here then seeing that talboys was mortified at being told thus gently there was a department of learning he had not fathomed he added at all events i can interpret my own niece to you i have known her much longer than you have mr talboys requested the interpreter to explain the pleasure his niece took in mr dodds fiddle part politeness part sham why she wanted not to ask them this evening the fiddle especially ill give you the clue to lucy she is a female chesterfield and the droll thing is she is polite at heart as well takes it from her mother she was something between an angel and a duchess politeness does not account for the sort of partiality she showed for these dodds while i was in the room pure imagination my dear friend i was there and had so monstrous a phenomenon occurred i must have seen it if you think she could really prefer their society to yours you are as unjust to her as yourself she may have concealed her real preference out of finesse or perhaps she has observed that our inferiors are touchy and ready to fancy we slight them for those of our own rank talboys shrugged his shoulders he was but half convinced her enthusiasm when the cub scraped the fiddle went beyond mere politeness beyond other peoples you mean nothing on earth ever went beyond hersha ha ha tomorrow night if you like we will have my gardener jack absolom in to tea no i thank you i have no wish to go beyond mr and miss dodd oh only for an experiment the first minute jack will be wretched and want to sink through the floor but in five minutes you will fancy lucy will have made jack absolom at home in my drawingroom he will be laying down the law about jonquilles and she all sweetness curiosity and enthusiasm outsideennui in can her eyes glisten out of politeness inquired talboys with a subdued sneer why not they could shed tears perhaps for the same motive said talboys with crushing irony well hum id back them at four to seven mr talboys was silent and his manner showed that he was a little mortified at a subject turning to joke which he had commenced seriously he must stop this annoyance he said severely it is time to come to an understanding with you at these words and above all at their solemn tone the senior pricked his ears and prepared his social diplomacy i have visited very frequently at your house mr fountain never without being welcome my dear sir you have i think divined one reason of my very frequent visits here i have not been vain enough to attribute them entirely to my own attractions you approve the homage i render to that other attraction unfeignedly am i so fortunate as to have her suffrage too i have no better means of knowing than you have indeed i was in hopes you might have sounded her inclinations i have scrupulously avoided it replied the veteran i had no right to compromise you upon mere conjecture however reasonable i awaited your authority to take any move in so delicate a matter can you blame me on one side my friends dignity on the other a young ladys peace of mind and that young lady my brothers daughter you were right my dear sir i see and appreciate your reserve your delicacy though i am about to remove its cause i declare myself to you your nieces admirer have i your permission to address her you have and my warmest wishes for your success thank you i think i may hope to succeed provided i have a fair chance afforded me i will take care you shall have that i should prefer not to have others buzzing about the lady whose affection i am just beginning to gain you pay this poor sailor an amazing compliment said mr fountain a little testily if he admires lucy it can only be as a puppy is struck with the moon above the moon does not respond to all this wonder by descending into the whelps jawsno more will my niece but that is neither here nor there you are now her declared suitor and you have a right to stipulate in short you have only to say the word and exeunt dodds as the playbooks say dodds i have no objection to the lady would it not be possible to invite her to tea alone quite possible but useless she would not stir out without her brother she seems a little person likely to give herself airs well then in that case though as you say i am no doubt raising mr dodd to a false importance still say no more we should indulge the whims of our friends not attack them with reasons you will see the dodds no more in my house oh as to that just as you please perhaps they would be as well out of it said talboys with a sudden affectation of carelessness i must not take you too far goodnight good night poor david he was to learn how little real hold upon society has the man who can only instruct and delight it mr fountain bustled home rubbing his hands with delight aha thought he jealous actually jealous absurdly jealous that is a good sign who would have thought so proud a man could be jealous of a sailor i have found out your vulnerable point my friend ill tell lucy how she will laugh david dodd now we know how to manage him lucy and i if he freezes back again we have but to send for david dodd and his fiddle he bustled home and up into the drawingroom to tell lucy mr talboys had at last declared himself his heart felt warm he would settle six thousand pounds on mrs talboys during his life and his whole fortune after his death he found the drawingroom empty he rang the bell where is miss fountain john didnt know but supposed she had gone to her room you dont know you never know anything send her maid to me the maid came and courtesied demurely at the door tell your mistress i want to speak to her directlybefore she undresses the maid went out and soon returned to say that her mistress had retired to rest but that if he pleased she would rise and just make a demitoilet and come to him this smooth and fairsounding proposal was not i grieve to say so graciously received as offered much obliged snapped old fountain her demitoilette will keep me another hour out of my bed and i get no sleep after dinner now among you tell her tomorrow at breakfast time will do chapter iv david dodd was so radiant and happy for a day or two that eve had not the heart to throw cold water on him again three days elapsed and no invitation to font abbey on this his happiness cooled of itself but when day after day rolled by and no font abbey he was dashed uneasy and above all perplexed what could be the reason had he with his rough ways offended her had she been too dignified to resent it at the time was he never to go to font abbey again eves first feeling was unmixed satisfaction we have seen already that she expected no good from this rash attachment for a single moment her influence and reasons had seemed to wean david from it but his violent agitation and joy at two words of kindly curiosity from miss fountain and the instant unreasonable revival of love and hope showed the strange power she had acquired over him it made eve tremble but now the fountains were aiding her to cure this folly she had read them right had described them to david aright a wind of caprice had carried him and her into font abbey another such wind was carrying them out no event had happened mr and miss fountain had been seen more than once in the village of late they have dropped us and thank heaven said eve in her idiomatic way she pitied david deeply and was kinder and kinder to him now to show him she felt for him but she never mentioned the font abbey people to him either to praise or blame them though it was all she could do to suppress her satisfaction at the turn their insolent caprice had taken that satisfaction was soon clouded this time instead of rousing himself and his pride david sank into a moody despondency varied by occasional fretfulness his appetite went and his bright color and his elastic step this silent sadness was so new in him such a contrast to his natural temperature large genial and ever cheerful that eve could not bear it i must shake him out of this at all hazards thought she yet she put off the experiment and put it off partly in hopes that david would speak first partly because she saw the wound she would probe was deep and she winced beforehand for her patient meantime prolonged doubt and suspense now goaded with their intolerable stings the active spirit that chill misgivings had at first benumbed spurred into action by these torments david had already watched several days in the neighborhood of font abbey determined to speak to miss fountain and find out whether he had given her offense for this was still his uppermost idea having failed in this attempt at an interview with her he was now meditating a more resolute course and he paced the little gravelwalk at home debating in himself the pros and cons raising his head suddenly he saw his sister walking slowly at the other end of the path she was coming toward him but her eyes were bent thoughtfully on the ground david slipped behind some bushes not to have his unhappiness and his meditations interrupted the lover and the lunatic have points in common he had been there some time when a grave little voice spoke quietly to him from the lawn david i want to speak to you david came out here am i oh i knew where you were dont do that again sir please or youll catch it oh i didnt think you saw me said david somewhat confusedly what has that to do with it stupid david continued she assuming a benevolent cheerful and somewhat magnificent nonchalance i sometimes wonder you dont come to me with your troubles i might advise you as well as here and there one but perhaps you think now because i am naturally gay i am not sensible you mustnt go by that altogether manner is very deceiving the most foolishly conducted men and women ever i met were as grave as judges and as demure as cats after cream bless you there is folly in every heart your slow ones bottle it up for use against the day wisdom shall be most needed my sort let it fizz out at their mouths in their daily talk and keep their good sense for great occasions like the present have we drifted among the proverbs of solomon inquired david dryly no need to make so many tacks eve havent i seen your sense and profited by iti and one or two more who but you has steered the house this ten years and commanded the lubberly crew the reader must not be misled by the familiar phraseology of these two speakers to suppose that anything the least droll or humorous was intended by either of them at any part of this singular dialogue their hearts were sad and their faces grave and then again david where the heart is concerned young women are naturally in advance of young men god knows he made them both i dont why all the world knows it and then besides i am five years older than you so mother says but i dont know how to believe it no one would say so to look at you ill tell you david folk that have small features look a deal younger than their years and you know poor father used to say my face was the pattern of a flatiron so nobody gives me my age but i am five good years older than you only you neednt go and tell the town crier well eve well then put all these together and now why not come to me for friendly advice and the voice of reason reason reason there are other lights besides reason jackolantern eh and willothewisp eve nobody can advise me that cant feel for me nobody can feel for me that doesnt know my pain and you dont know that because you were never in love oh then if i had ever been in love you would listen as i would to an angel from heaven and be advised by me why not for then youd be competent to advise but now you havent an idea what you are talking about what a pity dont you think it would be as well if you were not to speak to me so sulky i ask your pardon eve i did not mean to offend you davy dearfor gods sake what is this chill that has come between you and me you are a man speak out like a man david turned his great calm sorrowful eye full upon her well then eve if the truth must be told i am disappointed in you oh david a little you are not the girl i took you for you know which way my fancy lies yet you keep steering me in the teeth of it then you see how downhearted i am this while but not a word of comfort or hope comes from you and me almost dried up for want of one make one word of it davidi am not a sister to you i dont say that but you might be kinder you are against me just when i want you with me the most now this is what i like said eve cheerfully this is plain speaking so now it is my turn my lad do you remember balaam and his ass sure said david but used as he was to eves transitions he couldnt help staring a little at being carried eastward ho so suddenly then what did the ass say when she broke silence at last well you know eve i take shame to say i dont remember her very words but the tune of them i do why she sang out avast there it is first fault so you neednt be so hasty with your thundering ropes end there youd make a nice commentator you havent taken it up one bit you are as much in the dark as our parson he preached on her the very sunday you came home and it was all i could do to help whipping up into the pulpit and snatching away his book and letting daylight in on them david was scandalized at the very idea of such a breach of discipline that is ridiculous said he one cant have two skippers in a church any more than in a ship brig or bark but you can let daylight in on me i mean to begin the ass was in the right and balaam in the wrong so what becomes of your first fault she was frugal of her words but every syllable was a needle the worst is some skins are so thick our needles wont enter em says she this seven years you have known me always true to the bridle and true to you did ever i disobey you before then why go and fancy i do it without some great cause that you cant see then the mans eyes were open and he saw it was destruction his old friend had run back from and galled his foot to save his life so of course he thanked her and blessed her then not he he was too much of a man ay ay i see but what is the moral for i have no heart to expound riddles oh ill tell you the moral sooner than youll like perhaps the ass is a type david in holy writ you know almost everything is a type when a thing means one thing and stands for another thats a type ducks can swimat least ive heard so now if you could tell me what she is a type of what the ass dont you know why of women to be sureof us poor creatures of burden underrated and misunderstood all the world over and balaam he stands for men and for you at the head of them cried she turning round with flashing eyes on david you have known me and my true affection more than seven years or seventeen i carried you in my arms when you were a year old and i was six you were my little curlyheaded darling and have been from that day to this did ever i cross you or be cold or unkind to you till the other day no eve no no no come sit beside me then shouldnt you have said dont slobber me i wont have it you and i are bad friends oughtnt you to have said eve could never give herself the pain of crossing me no there isnt a man in the world with gumption enough to say thatthat is a womans thought but at least you might have said she sees rocks ahead that i cant balaam couldnt see the drawn sword ahead but there it was it was for you to say my sister eve would not change from gay to grave all at once and from indulging me in everything to thwarting me and vexing me unless she saw some great danger threatening your peace of mind your career in life your very reason perhaps i have been to blame eve but speak out and let me know the worst you have heard something against her character speak plain out for heavens sake it is all very well of you to say speak plain out but there are things girls dont like to speak about to any man but after what you said that you would listen to me if iso it is my duty you will see my face red enough in about a minute two years ago i couldnt have done this even for you it is hard i must expose my own follymy own crime why eve lass how you tremble drop it now drop it hold your tongue said eve sharply but in considerable agitation it is too late now after something you have said to me if i didnt speak out now i should be like that bad man you told us of who let out the beacon light when the wind was blowing hard on shore listen david and take my words to heart the road you are on now i have been upon only i went much farther on it than you shall go she resumed after a short pause you remember henry dyke what the young clergyman who used to be always alongside you at our last anchorage yes he was just such a man as miss fountain is a woman he was but a dish of skimmilk yet he could poison my life then eve told the story of her heart she described her lover as he appeared to her in the early days of courtship young handsome good noble in sentiment and warm and tender in manner halcyon daysnot a speck to be seen on loves horizon then she delineated the fine gradations by which the illusion faded too slowly and too late for her to withdraw the love she had conceived for his person at that time when person and mind seemed alike superior she painted with the delicate touch of her sex the portrait of a man and a scholar born to please all the world and incapable of condensing his affections a pious flirt no longer stimulated to genuine ardor by doubts of success but too kindhearted to pain her beyond measure when a little factitious warmth from time to time would give her hours of happiness keep her on the whole content and above all retain her his then she shifted the mirror to herself the fiery and faithful one and showed david what centuries of torture a good little creature like this dyke with its charming exterior could make a quick and ardent and devoted nature suffer in a year or two came out in her narrative link by link the gentle delicious complacency of the first period the chill airs that soon ruffled it the glowing hopes the misgivings that dashed them then the diminution of confidence more complexing and exasperating than its utter loss the alternations of joy and doubt the fever and the ague of the wounded spirit then the gusts of hatred followed by deeper love later still the periodical irritation at hopes long deferred and still gleams of bliss between the paroxysms so that now as the vulgar say in their tremendous saxon she spent her time between heaven and hell last of all the sickness and recklessness of the wornout and wearied heart over which melancholy or fury impended it was at this crisis when as she could now see on a calm retrospect her mind was distempered a new and terrible passion stepped upon the scenejealousy a friend came and whispered her mr dyke was courting another woman at the same time and that other woman was rich david at that word a flash of lightning seemed to go through me and show me the man as he really was the mean scoundrel to sell himself for money no david he would not have sold himself with his eyes open any more than perhaps your miss fountain would but what little heart he had he could give to any girl that was not a fright he was a selfdeceiver and a general lover and such characters and their affections sink by nature to where their interest lies iron is not conscious yet it creeps toward the loadstone well while she was with me i held up and managed to question her as coldly as i speak to you now but as soon as she left me i went off in violent hysterics poor eve she had not been gone an hour when doesnt the devil put it into his head to send me a long affectionate letter and in the postscript he invited himself to supper the same afternoon then i got up and dried my eyes and i seemed to turn into stone with resolution come i said but dont think you shall ever go back to her your troubles and mine shall end tonight why eve you turn pale with thinking of it i fear you have had worse thoughts pass through your mind than any man is worth david your blood was in my veins and mine is in yours if i didnt think so the lord deliver us from temptation we dont know ourselves nor those we love he had driven me mad mad indeed what had you the heart to see the man bleed to deaththe man you had lovedyou my little gentle eve oh no no no blood said eve with a shudder laudanum good god oh i see your thought no i was not like the men in the newspapers that kill the poor woman with a sure hand and then give themselves a scratch it was to be one spoonful for him but two for me i cant dwell on it and she hid her face in her hands it is too terrible to remember how far i was misled who think you saved us both david could not guess a little angelmy good angel that came home from sea that very afternoon when i saw your curly head and your sweet sunburned face come in at the door guess if i thought of putting death in the pot after that ah the love of our own flesh and blood that is the lovegod and good angels can smile on it yes but go on said david impatiently it is ended david they say a womans heart is a riddle and perhaps you will think so when i tell you that when he had brought me down to this and hadnt died for it i turned as cold as ice to him that minute once and forever i looked back at the precipice and i hated him ay from that evening he was like the black dog to my eye i used to slip anywhere to hide out of his wayjust as you did out of mine but now cant you forget that well to be sure well so then now you may learn what these skimmilk cheeses are made of when he found he was my aversion he fell in love with me again as hot as ever tried all he could think of to win me back wrote a letter every day came to me every other day and when he saw it was all over for good between us he cried and bellowed till my hate all went and scorn came in its place next time we met he played quite another partthe calm heartbroken christian gave me his blessing went down on his knees and prayed a beautiful prayer that took me off my guard and made me almost respect him then went away and quietly married the girl with money and six months after wrote to me he was miserable dated from the vicarage her parents had got him now you know if he wasnt a parson dn me if id turn in tonight till id ropesended that lubber as if id let you dirty your hands with such rubbish i sent the note back to him with just one line such a fool as you are has no right to be a villain there david there is your poor sisters life oh what i went through for that man often i said is heaven just to let a poor faithful loving girl who has done no harm be played with on the hook and tortured hot and cold day after day month after month year after year as i was but now i see why it was permitted it was for your sake that you might profit by my sharp experience and not fling your heart away on frozen mud as i did and happy in this feminine theory of divine justice eve rested on her brother a look that would have adorned a seraph then took him gently round the neck and laid her little cheek flat to his she felt as if she had just saved a beloved life who can estimate the value of a happiness so momentary yet so holy presently looking up she saw davids face illuminated what is it she asked joyously you look pleased david was pleased because now he was sure she could feel for him and would side with him that i do but david as it is all over between you and her all over am i dead then eve gasped with astonishment why what have i been telling you all this for who should you tell your trouble to but your own brother why eveha hayou dont really see any likeness between your case and mine do you you are not so blind as to compare her with that thundering muff they are brother and sister as we are was the reply ever since i saw you looked her way my eye has hardly been off her and she is henry dyke in petticoats i dont thank you for saying that well and if she is what has that to do with it i am not a woman i am not forced to lie to waiting for a wind as the girls are i am a man i can work for the wish of my heart and if it does not come to meet me i can overhaul it eve was a little staggered by this thrust but she was not one to show an antagonist any advantage he had obtained david said she coldly it must come to one of two things either she will send you about your business in form which is a needless affront for you and me both or she will hold you in hand and play with you and drive you mad take warning remember what is in our blood father was as well as you are but agitation and vexation robbed him of his reason for a while and you and i are his children milk of roses creeps along in that young ladys veins but fire gallops in ours give her up david as she has you she has let you escape dont fly back like a moth to the candle you shant however i wont let you eve said david quietly you argue well but you cant argue light into dark nor night into day she is the sun to me i have seen her light and now i cant live without it he added more calmly it is her or none i never saw a girl but this that i wanted to see twice and i never shall but it is that which frightens me for you david often i have wished i could see you flirt a bit and harden your heart and break some poor girls oh hang them they always contrive to pass it on what do i care for girls they are not my brother but no david i cant believe you will go against me and my judgment after the insult she has put on you no more about it but just you choose between my respect and this wildgoose chase i choose both said david quietly both you shant have and with this up bounced eve and stood before him bristling like a catomountain david tried to soothe herto coax herin vain her cheek was on fire and her eyes like basilisks it was a picture to see the pretty little fury stand so erect and threatening great david so humble and deprecating yet so dogged at last he took out his knife it was not one of your stabbingknives but the sort of pruningknife that no sailor went without in those days now said he sadly take and cut my head offcut me to pieces if you willi wont wince or complain and then you will get your way but while i do live i shall love her and i cant afford to lose her by sitting twiddling my thumbs waiting for luck ill try all i know to win her and if i lose her i wont blame her but myself for not finding out how to please her and with that ill live a bachelor all my days for her or else die just as god willsi shant much care which oh i know you you obstinate toad said eve clinching her teeth and her little hand then she burst out furiously are you quite resolved quite dear eve said david sadlybut somehow it was like a rock speaking then there is my hand said eve with an instant transition to amiable cheerfulness that dazzled a body like a dark lantern flying open used as david was to her it stupefied him he stared at her and was all abroad well what is the wonder now inquired eve there are but two of us we must be together somehow or another must we not you wont be wise with me well then ill be a fool with you ill help you with this girl oh my dear eve you wont gain much without me you hadnt the shadow of a chance and with me you havent a chance that is all the odds i have i have you have taken away my breath with joy and david was quite overcome with the turn eve had taken in his favor oh you need not thank me said eve tossing her head with a hypocrisy all her own it is not out of affection for you i do it you may be very sure of that but it looks so ridiculous to see my brother slipping out of my way behind a tree as soon as he sees me comingoh oh oh oh and a violent burst of sobs and tears revealed how that incident had rankled in this stoical little heart david with the tear in his own eye clasped her in his arms and kissed her and coaxed her and begged her again and again to forgive him this she did internally at the first word but externally no pouted and sobbed till she had exacted her full tribute then cleared up with sudden alacrity and inquired his plans i am going to call at font abbey and find out whether i have offended her eve demurred that would never do you would betray yourself and there would be an end of you how good i am not to let you go no ill call there i shall quietly find out whether it is her doing that we have not been invited so long or whose it is you stay where you are i wont be a minute when the minute was thirtyfive david came under her window and called her she popped her head out well what are you doing putting on my bonnet why you have been an hour you wouldnt have me go there a fright would you at last she came down and started for font abbey and david was left to count the minutes till her return he paced the gravel sailorwise taking six steps and then turning instead of going in each direction as far as he could he longed and feared his sisters return one hourtwo hours elapsed still he walked a supposed deck on the little lawnsix steps and then turn at last he saw her coming in the distance he ran to meet her but when he came up with her he did not speak but looked wistfully in her face and tried hard to read it and his fate now david dont make a fool of yourself or i wont tell you no no ill be calm i willbecalm well then for one thing she is to drink tea with us this evening she who what where oh here chapter v mr fountain sat at breakfast opposite his niece with a twinkle set in his eye like a cherryclack in a tree relishing beforehand her smiles and blushes and gratitude to him for having hooked and played his friend so that now she had but to land him ill just finish this delicious cup of coffee thought he and then ill tell you my lady while he was slowly sipping said cup lucy looked up and said graciously to him how silly mr talboys was last nightwas he not dear talboys silly what do you know why what on earth do you mean silly is a harsh wordinjudicious thenpraising me a tort et a travers and was downright illbredwas discourteous to another of our guests mr dodd confound mr dodd i wish i had never invited him so do i if you remember i dissuaded you i do remember now what you dont like him either there you are mistaken dear i esteem mr dodd highly and miss dodd too in spite of her manifest defects but in making up parties however small we should choose our guests with reference to each other not merely to ourselves now forgive me it was clear beforehand that mr talboys and the dodds especially miss dodd would never coalesce hence my objection in inviting them but you overruled mewith a rod of iron dear yes but why because you gave me such a bad reason you never said a word about this incongruity but it was in my mind all the time then why didnt it come out becausebecause something else would come out instead as if one gave ones real reasons for things now uncle dear you allow me great liberties but would it have been quite the thing for me to lecture you upon the selection of your own convives why you have ended by doing it lucy colored not till the event provesnot till not till your advice is no longer any use lucy driven into a corner replied by an imploring look which had just the opposite effect of argument it instantly disarmed the old boy he grinned superior and spared his supple antagonist three sarcasms that were all on the tip of his tongue he was rewarded for his clemency by a little piece of advice delivered by his niece with a sort of hesitating and penitent air he did not understand one bit eyes down upon the cloth all the time it came to this he was to listen to her suggestions with a prejudice in their favor if he could and give them credit for being backed by good reasons at all events he was never to do them the injustice to suppose they rested on those puny considerations she might put forward in connection with them silly is a term carrying with it a certain promptness and decision above all it was a very remarkable word for lucy to use the girl is a martinet in these things thought he she cant forgive the least bit of impoliteness i suppose he snubbed jack tar what a crime but i had better let this blow over before i go any farther so he postponed his disclosure till tomorrow but before tomorrow came he had thought it over again and convinced himself it would be the wiser course not to interfere at all for the present except by throwing the young people constantly together he had lived long enough to see that in nine cases out of ten husband and wife might be defined a man and a woman that were thrown a good deal togethergenerally in the country a marries b and c d but under similar circumstances ie thrown together a would have married d and c b this applies to puppy dogs male and female as well as to boys and girls perhaps a personal feeling had some little share too in bringing him to the above conclusion he was a bit of a schemerliked to play puppets at present his niece and friend were the largest and finest puppets he had on hand the day he should bring them to a mutual rational understanding the puppetstrings would fall from his hands and the puppets turn independent agents he represented to talboys that lucy was young and very innocent in some respects that marriage did not seem to run in her head as in most girls that a precipitate avowal might startle her and raise unnecessary difficulties by putting her on her guard too early in their acquaintance you have no rival he concluded best win her quietly by degrees undermine the coy jade she is worth it cool talboys acquiesced david had spurred him out of his pace one night but david was put out of the way the course was clear and as he could walk over it now why gallop childish as his friends jealousy of this poor sailor had seemed to mr fountain still the idea once started he could not help inspecting lucy to see how she would take his sudden exclusion from these parties now lucy missed the dodds very much and was surprised to see them invited no more but it was not in her character to satisfy a curiosity of this sort by putting a pointblank question to the person who could tell her in two words she was one of those thorough women whose instinct it is to find out little things not to ask about them when day after day passed by and the dodds were not invited it flashed through her mind first that there must be some reason for this secondly that she had only to take no notice and the reason if any would be sure to pop out she half suspected talboys but gave him no sign of suspicion with unruffled demeanor and tranquil patience she watched demurely for disclosures from her uncle or from him like the prettiest little velvet panther conceivable lying flat in a blind path deranging nobody but waiting with amiable tranquillity for her friends to come her way thus under the smooth surface of the little society at font abbey finesse was cannily at work but the surface of every society is like the skin of a manhides a deal of secret machinery here were two undermining a coy jade perhaps on the whole uncle fountain it might be more prudent in you not to call her that name again you see she is my heroine and i am a man that could cut you out of this story and nobody miss you and the coy jade watching for the miners like a sweet little velvet panther and to fling away metaphor an honest heart set aching sore hard by for having come among such a lot chapter vi a fable tells us a fowler one day saw sitting in tree a woodpigeon this is a very shy bird so he had to creep and maneuver to get within gunshot unseen unheard he stole from tree to tree and muffled his footsteps in the long grass so adroitly that just as he was going to pull the trigger he stepped light as a feather on a venomous snake it bit he died this is instructive and pointed but a trifle severe what befell uncle fountain busy enmeshing his cock and hen pheasant netting a niece and a friend went to the same tune but in a lower key as befitted a domestic tale domestic you are aware is latin for tame ex domestic fowl domestic drama story of domestic intereet or chronicle of small beer among his letters at breakfasttime came one which he had no sooner read than he flung on the table and went into a fury lucy sat aghast then inquired in tender anxiety what was the matter angry explanations are apt to be dark ones it is a confounded shameit is a trick childit is a do ah what is that uncle a doa do yes a do he knew i hated figures cant bear the sight of them and the cursed responsibility of adding them up right but who knew all this he came over here bursting with health and asked me to be one of his executorsmind one i consented on a distinct understanding i was never to be called upon to act he was twenty years my junior and like so much mahogany it was just a form i did it to soothe a man who called himself my friend and set his mind at rest but uncle dear i dont understand even now can it be possible that a friend has abused your good nature a little with an angry sneer has he betrayed your confidence hasnt he oh dear what has he done died that is all snarled the victim oh uncle poor man poor man no doubt but how about poor me why it turns out i am sole executor but dear uncle how could the poor soul help dying that is not candid lucy said mr fountain severely did ever i say he could help dying but he could help coming here under false colors a mahogany face and trapping his friend uncle what is the useyour trying to play the misanthrope with me who know how good you are in spite of your pretenses to the contrary to hide your emotion from your poor niece you go into a feigned fury and all the time you know how sorry you are your poor friend is gone of course i am he has secured one mourner he might have died to all eternity if he hadnt nailed me first see how selfish men are and badhearted into the bargain i believe that young fellow had been to a doctor and found out he was booked in spite of his mahogany cheeks so then he rides out here and wheedles an unguarded friendim wiredim trappedim snared lucy set herself to soothe her injured relative you must say to yourself cest un petit matheur tell myself a falsehood what shall i gain by that let me tell you it is these minor troubles that send a man to bedlam one breeds another till they swarm and buzz you distracted and sting you dead petit maiheur it is a greater one than you have ever encountered since you have been under my wing it is dear it is but i hope to encounter much greater ones before i am your age the deuce you do or else i shall die without ever having liveda vegetable not a human being bombast a flower your lovers will call you and men of sense a weed but dont let us discuss me what i wish to know is the nature of your annoyance dear he explained to her with a groan that he should have to wind up all the affairs of an estate of pounds a year pay the annual and other encumbrances etc etc well but dear you will be quite at home in this you have such a turn for business for my own shrieked the old bachelor angrily not for other peoples why lucy there will be half a dozen separate accounts all of four figures it is not as if executors were paid and why are they not paid there ought to be a law compelling the estates they administer to pay them and handsomely it never occurred to me before but now i see the monstrous iniquity of amateur executors amateur trustees amateur guardians they take business out of the hands of those who live by business i sincerely regret my share in this injustice if a snob works he always expects to be paid how much more a gentleman he ought to be paid doubleonce for the work and once for giving up his natural ease here am i guardian gratis to a cub of sixteenthe worst agedone school and not begun oxford and governesses tutors you mean do i is it the tutors the whelps fall in love with little goose stop ill describe my interesting charge as the books call it he has hair you could not tell from tow he has no eyebrowsa little unfledged slippery horror he used to come in to dessert and turn all our stomachs except his silly fathers poor orphan when you speak to him he never answersblushes instead poor child he has read of eloquent blushes and thinks there is no need to reply in wordsblushing must be such an interesting and effective substitute poor boy he wants a little judicious kindness we will have him here here cried the old gentleman with horror what make font abbey a kennel no lucy no this house is sacred no nuisances admitted here here on this single spot of earth reigns comfort and shall reign unruffled while i live this is the temple of peace if i must be worried i must but not beneath this hallowed roof this eloquence delivered as it was with a sudden solemnity told upon the mind dear font abbey murmured lucy half closing her eyes how well you describe it societies of the cosey the walls seem padded the carpets velvet and the whole structure careproof all is quiet gayety and sweet punctuality here comfort and good humor move by clockwork that is font abbey yet you are right if you were to be seen in it no more it would lose the life of its charm dear uncle fountain thank you my dearthank you i do like to see my friends about me comfortable and above all to be comfortable myself the place is well enough and i am bitterly sorry i must leave it and sorry to leave you my dear leave us not immediately this very day why the funeral is to be this weeka grand funeraland i have to order it all then there are relatives to be invitedthirty lettersothers to be asked to the reading of the will it will be one hurryscurry till we get the house clear of the corpse and the vultures then at it i must go headforemost into fathomless additionsubtractionmultiplication and vexation oh now forever farewell something or otherfarewell content you talk of misanthropy i shall end there lucy yes dear uncle i neverdoa goodnatured thingbutibitterlyrepent it by jupiter the coffee is cold the first time that has befallen me since i turned off seven servants that battled that point of comfort with me lucy suggested that the coffee might have cooled a little while he was being so kind as to answer her question at unusual length then she came round to him bringing a fresh supply of fragrant slow poison and sat beside him and soothed him till his ire went down and came the calm depression of a man who accustomed for many years to do just what he liked found himself suddenly obliged to do something he did not likea thing out of the groove of his habits too sure enough he left font abbey the same day with a promise exacted by lucy that he should make her the partner of all his vexations by writing to her every day and lucy said the old parthian as he stepped into his travelingcarriage my friend talboys will miss me pray be kind to him while i am away he is a particular friend of mine i may be wrong but i do like men of known originof old family and you are right i will be kind to him for your sake dear a slight cold confined lucy to the house for three or four days after her uncles departure by the by i think this must have been the reason of davids ill success in his endeavors to get an interview with her out of doors thus circumstanced ladies rummage lucy found in a garret a chest containing a quantity of papers and parchments and the beautifulest dust no such dust is made in these degenerate days some of these mss bore recent dates and were easily legible though not so easily intelligible being written as gratiano spake the writers had omitted to put the idead words into red ink so they had to be picked out with infinite difficulty from the multitude of unidead ones gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing his reasons are as three grains of wheat in two bushels of chaff other of the mss more ancient wore a double veil they hid their sense in verbiage and also in narrow germanifled letters farther deformed by contractions and ornamental flourishes whose joint effect made a word look like a black daddylonglegs all sprawling fantastic limbs and the body a dot the perusal of these pieces was slow and painful it was like walking or slipping about among broken ruins overgrown with nettles but then uncle fountain was so anxious to hook on to the flunkeysoh ciel what am i sayingthe funteyns and his direct genealogical evidence had so completely broken down she said to herself oh dear if i could find something among these old writings and show it him on his return she had them all dusted and brought down and a tablecloth laid on a long table in the drawingroom and spelled them with a goodhumored patience that belonged partly to her character partly to her sex a female who undertakes this sort of work does not skip as we should the habit of needlework in all its branches reconciles that portion of mankind to invisible progress in other matters besides this they are naturally careful and above all born to endure they carry patience into nearly all they do at about the third rehearsal of a new play our actresses bring the authors words into their heads our actors are still all abroad and at the first performance the breaks down are sure to be among the males the female jumenta carry their burden be it of piglead safe from wing to wing lucy made her way manfully through all the wellwritten circumlocution and in a very short time considering but the antique greek tried her eyes too much at night so she gave nearly her whole day to it for she was anxious to finish all before her uncles return it was a curious picturevenus immersed in musty records one day she had studied and spelled four mortal hours when a visitor was suddenly announcedmiss dodd that young lady came briskly in at the heels of the servant and caught lucy at her work after the first greeting her eye rested with such undisguised curiosity on the mouldy records that lucy told her in general terms what she was trying to do for her uncle la said eve you will ruin your eyesight why not send them over to us i will make david read them and his eyesight oh bless you he has a knack at reading old writing he has made a study of it if i thought i was not presuming too far on mr dodds good nature i would send one or two of them do and i will make him draw up a paper of the contents i have seen him at this sort of work before now but there la i suppose you know it is all vanity i do it to please my poor uncle and very good you are but what the better will the poor old gentleman be we are here to act our own part well we cant ride up to heaven on our greatgrandfather these maxims were somewhat coldly received so eve shifted her ground after all i dont know why i should be the one to say that for my own name is older than your uncles a pretty deal lucy looked puzzled then suddenly fancying she had caught eves meaning she said that is true hail mother of mankind and bowed her head with graceful reverence eve stared and colored not knowing what on earth her companion meant i am afraid it must be owned that eve steadily eschewed books and always had what little booklearning she had came to her filtered through david and by this channel she accepted it willingly even sought it at odd times when there was no bread pudding dress theology scandal or fun going on she turned it off by a sudden inquiry where mr fountain was they told me in the village he was away now several circumstances combined to make lucy more communicative than usual first she had been studying hard and after long study when a lively person comes to us it is a great incitement to talk pitiful by nature i spare you the bent bow secondly she was a little anxious lest her uncles sudden neglect should have mortified miss dodd and a neutral topic handled at length tends to replace friendly feeling without direct and unpleasant explanations she therefore answered every question in full told her that her uncle had lost a dear friend that he was executor and guardian to the poor boy now entirely an orphan her uncle with his usual zeal on behalf of his friends had gone off at once and doubtless would not return till he had fulfilled in every respect the wishes of the deceased to this general sketch she added many details suppressing the misanthropy mr fountain had exhibited or affected at the first receipt of the intelligence in short angelic gossip earthly gossip always backbites you know eve missed something somehow no doubt the human or backbiting element still it was gossip sacred gossip far dearer than shakespeare to the female heart and eves eyes glowed with pleasure and her tongue plied eager questions with all this such instinctive artists are these delicate creatures both these ladies were secretly in ambush lucy to learn whether eve and david were hurt or surprised at not being invited of late and why she and he had not called since eve to find out what was the cause david and she had been so suddenly dropped was it lucys doing or whose each lady being bent on receiving not on making revelations nothing transpired on either side seeing this eve became impatient and made a bold move miss fountain said she you are all alone i wish you would come over to us this evening and have tea lucy did not immediately reply eve saw her hesitation it is but a poor place said she to ask you to i will come said the lady directly i will come with great pleasure will seven be too early for you oh no i dont dine now my uncle is away i call luncheon dinner perhaps six then pray let me come at your usual hour why derange your family for one person six oclock was settled i must take some of this rubbish with me said eve come along my dears and with an ample and mock enthusiastic gesture she caught up an armful of manuscripts the servant shall take them over for you oh bother the servant i am my own servantif you will lend me a pin or two lucy drew six pins out from different parts of her dress eve noticed this but said nothing she pinned up her apron so as to make an enormous pocket and went gayly off with the spoils of time chapter vii is that what you call being calm david let me alonedont slobber me i am sure i wish she had said no if i had thought she would come i would never have asked her you would eve you would for love of me who knows perhaps i might i am more indulgent than kind eve do tell me all is she well does she come of her own good will dear eve well ill tell you first we had a bit of a talk for a blind like and her uncle is away so then i asked her plump to come to tea well david first she looked noonly for a single moment though she soon altered her mind and so then the moment it was to be yes she cleared up and you would have thought she had been asked to the kings banquet ah david my lad you have fallen into good handsyou have launched your heart on a deeper ocean than ever your ship sailed on david took no notice he was in a state of exaltation for one thing and besides eves simile was sent to the wrong address we terrestrials fear water in proportion to its depth but these mariners dread their native element only when it is shallow david now kept asking in an excited way what they could do for her what could they get to do her honor wouldnt she miss the luxuries of her fine place now you be quiet david we need not put ourselves about for she will be the easiest girl to please you have ever seen here or if she isnt shell act it so that youll be none the wiser however you can go and buy some flowers for me that i will we have none good enough for her here and david tea under the catalpa as we always do on fine nights you dont mean that ah but i do these fine ladies are all for novelties now im much mistaken if this one has ever had her tea out of doors in all her born days what do you think our little stuffy room would be any treat to her after the drawingroom at font abbey come you be off till halfpast five youll fidget yourself and fidget me else david recognized her superiority obeyed and vanished eve having got rid of him showed none of the insouciance she had recommended she darted into the kitchen bared her arms and made wheaten cakes with unequaled rapidity the servant looking on with demure admiration all the while these put into the oven she got her keys and put out the silver teapot cream jug and sugar basin things not used every day i can tell you item the best old china tea service item some rare tea of which david had brought home a small quantity from china at six oclock miss fountain came a footman marched twenty yards behind her she dismissed him at the door and eve invited her at once into the garden there david joined them his heart beating violently she put out her hand kindly and calmly and shook hands with him in the most unembarrassed way imaginable at the touch of her soft hand every fiber in him thrilled and the color rushed into his face at this a faint blush tinged her own but no more than the warm welcome she was receiving might account for they seated her in a comfortable chair under the catalpa presently out came a nice clean maid her white neck half hidden half revealed by plain unfigured muslin worn where the frock ended she put the tea things on the table and courtesied to lucy who returned her salute by a benignant smile out came another stouter one with the kettle hung it from a hoop between two stout sticks and lighted a fire she had laid underneath retiring with a parting look at the kettle as soon as it hissed then returned maid one with bread and wheaten cakes and fruit butter nice and hard from the cellar and yellow cream and went off smiling a gentle zeal seemed to animate these domestics as if they also in relative proportions gave the fete or at least contributed good will lucys quick eye caught this it was new to her the tea was soon made and its oriental fragrance mingled with the other odors that filled the balmy air gay golden broken lights flickered in patches on the table the china cups the ladies dresses and the grass all but in one place where the cool deep shadow lay undisturbed around the foot of the treestem looking up to see whence the flickering gold came that sprinkled her white hand lucy saw one of the loveliest and commonest things in nature the sky was bluethe sun fierythe air potable gold outside the tree so that as she looked up the mellow green leaves of the catalpa coming between her and the bright sky and glowing air shone like transparent goldstaircase upon staircase of great exotic translucent leaves with specks of lovely blue sky that seemed to come down and perch among the top branches charming as these sights were contrast doubled their beauties for all these dimples of bright blue and flakes of translucent gold were eyed from the cool and from the deep shade the light it is true came down and danced on the turf here and there but it left its heat behind through running the gauntlet of the myriad leaves over lucys head hung by a silk line from one of the branches a huge globe of humble but fragrant flowers they were in point of fact fastened with marvelous skill all round a damp sponge but she did not know that thus these simple hosts honored their lovely guest and while these sights and smells stole into her deep eyes and her delicate nostrils fiddle david said eve loftily and straightway a simple mellow tune rang sweetly on the cheerful chordsa rustic dulcet and immortal ditty in tune with summer and afternoon with goldcheckered grass and leaves that slumbered yet vibrated in the glowing air a bright dreamy hour the soul and senses floated gently in color fragrance melody and great calm each sound seemed but an echo of tranquillity lucy looked up and absorbed the scene then closed her eyes and listened and presently her lips parted gradually in so ravishing a smile her eyes remaining closed that even eve who saw her in her true light a terrible girl come there to burn and destroy david remaining cool as a cucumber could hardly forbear seizing and mumbling her in certain companies you shall see a boisterous cordiality which at bottom is as hollow as diplomacy but there is a modest geniality which is to society what the bloom is to the plum and this charm lucy found in her hosts of the catalpa for this very reason that they were her hosts their manner to her changed a little and becomingly they made no secret that it was a downright pleasure to them to have her there they petted her and showed her so much simple kindness that what with the scene the music and her companions goodness the coy bud openedtimidly at firstbut in a way it never had expanded at font abbey she even developed a feeble sense of fun followed suit demurely when eve came out sprightly laughed like a brook gurgling to eves peal of bells and lo and behold when the two girls got together and faced the man strong in numbers a favorite trick backed her ally as cowards back the brave and set her on to sauce david they cast doubts upon his skill in navigation they perplexed him with treacherous questions in geography put with an innocent affectation of a humble desire for information in short they played upon him lightly as they touch the piano and eve carolled a song and david accompanied her on the fiddle and at the third verse lucy chimed in spontaneously with a second and the next verse david struck in with a base and the tepid air rang with harmony and poor david thrilled with happiness his heart felt his voice mingle and blend with hers and even this contact was delicious to his imagination and they were happy but all must end the shades of evening came down and the pleasant little party broke up and as john had not come david asked leave to escort her home oh no she could not think of giving him that trouble so saying she went home with him when they were alone his deep love made him timid and confused he walked by her side and did not speak to her she waited with some surprise at this silence and then as he was shy she talked to him uttered many airy nothings and then put questions to him did he always drink tea out of doors on fine nights in summer eve settled all such matters have you not a voice i have a voice but no vote she is skipper ashore oh is she who taught her how delicious it is to drink tea out of doors david did not knowfancied it was her own idea did you really like it miss fountain like it mr dodd it was elysium i never passed a sweeter evening in my life david colored all over i wish i could believe that was it the tuliptree or the violin or was it your conversation mr dodd i wonder asked she demurely looking mockinnocent in his face it was your goodness to be so easily pleased said dodd with a gush that made her color she smiled however well that is one way of looking at things said she entre nous i think miss dodd was the enchantress eve is capital company for that matter indeed she is you must be very happy together your mutual affection is very charming mr dodd but sometimes it almost makes me sad forgive me i have no brother you will never want one to love you a thousand times better than a brother can love oh shant i said the lady and opened her eyes no and there is more than one that worships the ground you tread on at this moment but you know that oh do i she opened her eyes still wider david longed to tell how he loved her but dared not he looked wistfully at her face it was quite calm and had suddenly became a little reserved he felt he was on new and dangerous ground he sighed and was silent he turned away his face when this involuntary sigh broke from him she turned her head a little and looked at him he felt her eye dwell on him and his cheeks burned under it the next moment they were at font hill and lucy seemed to david to hesitate whether to give him her hand at parting or not she did give him her hand though not so freely david thought as she had done on his own little lawn three hours before and this dashed his spirits it seemed to him a step lost and he had hoped to gain a step somehow by walking home with her he felt like one who has undertaken to catch some skittish timorous thing that if you stand still will come within a certain small but safe distance but you must not move a step toward it or whir away it is he went slowly home his heart warm and cold by turns warm when he remembered the sweet hours he had just spent and her sweet looks and heavenly tones every one of which he saw and heard again cold when he thought of the social distance that separated them and the hundred chances to one against his love then he said to himself time was i thought i could never bring a yard down from the foretop to the deck but i mastered that time was i thought i could never work out a logarithm without a formula but i mastered that time was the fiddle beat me so i was ready to cry over it but at last i learned to make it sing and now i can make her smile with it god bless her instead of stopping her ears i can hardly mind the thing that didnt beat me dead for a long while but i persevered and got the upper hand ay but this is higher and harder than them alla hundred times harder and higher ill hold my course let the wind blow high or low and if i cant overhaul the wish of my heart well ill carry her flag to the last ill die a bachelor for her sake as sure as you are the moon my lass and you the polar star and from this hour ill never look at you but ill make believe it is her i am looking up at for she is as high above me and as bright as you are god bless her and to think i never even said goodnight to her i stood there like a mummy and david reproached himself for his unkindness lucy on entering the drawingroom was surprised to find it blazing with candles but she was more surprised at what she saw seated calmly in an armchairmrs bazalgette lucy stood transfixed the audacious intruder laughed at her astonishment the next moment they intertwined and fell to kissing one another with tender violence well love the fact is i was passing here on my way home from devonshire and i wanted particularly to speak to you so i thought i would venture just to pop in for a passing call and lo i find the old ogre is absent and not expected back for ever so long so i have installed myself at his font abbey partly out of love for you dear partly i confess it out of hate to him you will write and tell me his face when he comes home and hears i have been living and enjoying myself in his den i ordered my imperial into his bedroom i took it for granted that would be the only comfortable one in his house aunt bazalgette cried lucy turning pale oh aunt what will become of us dont be frightened the grayhaired monster that dyes his whiskers and gets him up to look only sixty interposed and forbade the consecration i am glad of it you shall sleep in mine dear and i will go into the east room it is a sweet little room is it then why not put me there lucy colored a little i think mine would suit you better dear because it is larger and airier and i see as you please you know i never make difficulties and how long have you been here aunt about three hours three hours and not send for me i was only in the village did no one tell you yes but you know it is not my way to make a fuss and put people out how could i tell you might be agreeably employed and i was sure of you before bedtime mightyfine but the truth is she came to font abbey to pry she had heard a vague report about lucy and a gentleman she was very glad to find lucy was out it gave her an opportunity she sent for lucys maid to help her unpack a dress or twothirteen this girl was paid out of lucys estate but did not know that mrs bazalgette handed her her wages and that gives an influence the wily matron did not trust to that alone in unpacking she gave the girl a dress and several smaller presents and this done slowly and cautiously pumped her jane to fulfill her share of a bargain which though never once alluded to was perfectly understood between both the parties told her all she knew and all she conjectured told her in particular how constantly mr talboys was in the house and how one night the old gentleman had walked part of the way home with him which mr thomas says he didnt think his master would do it for the king mum and had come in all of a flurry and sent up for miss and swore awful when she couldnt come because she was abed so you may depend mum it is so leastways the gentlemen they are willing we talk it over mostly every day in the servants hall mum and we are all of a mind so fur but whether it will come to a wedding that we havent a settled yet its miss beats us she is like no other young lady ever i came anigh a man or womanit is all the same to hera kind word for everybody and pass on but i do really think she likes her own side of the house a trifle the best the ladies of the bedchamber will embellish after all it is their business and there you dont agree with her jane well mumbeing as we are alonenow is it natural but mr thomas he says the cold ones take the first offer that comes when there is money ahind it it isnt us they wants says he i told him i should think not the likes of himbut our house and land says he and hopera box and cetera but i dont think that of our one says i bless you she is too highminded but what i think mum is she wouldnt say no to her uncle her mouth dont seem made for saying no especially to him and he is bent on talboys mum you take my word to return to the drawingroom mrs bazalgette after the above delicate discussion sat there in ambush knowing more of lucys affairs than lucy knew her next point was to learn lucys sentiments and to find whether she was deliberately playing false and breaking her promise vide well lucy any lovers yet no aunt take care lucy a little bird whispers in my ear then it is a hummingbird and lucy pouted now aunt did you really come to font abbey to tease me about such nonsense asasgentlemen and lucy looked hurt heres an actress for you thought mrs bazalgette but she calmly dropped the subject and never recurred to it openly all the evening but lay secretly in watch and put many subtle but seeming innocent questions to her niece about her habits her uncles guest whether her uncle kept a horse for her whether he bought it for her etc etc the next morning mrs bazalgette breakfasted in bed during which process she rang her bell seven times lucy received at the breakfasttable a letter from her uncle my dear niecethe funeral was yesterday and i flatter myself well performed there were fiveandtwenty carriages after that a luncheon in the right style and then to the reading of the will and here i shall surprise you but not more than i was myself i am left pounds consols my worthy friend whose loss we are called on so suddenly to deplore accompanied this bequest in his will with many friendly expressions of esteem which i have always studied and shall study to deserve he bequeathed to me also during minority the care of his boy the heir to this fine property which far exceeds the value i had imagined there is a letter attached to the will in compliance with it arthur is to go to cambridge but not until he has been well prepared he will therefore accompany me to font abbey tomorrow and i must contrive somehow or other to find him a mathematical tutor in the neighborhood there is a handsome allowance made out of the estate for his board etc etc he is an interesting boy and has none of the rudeness and mischievousness they generally haveblue eyes soft silky flaxen hair and as modest as a girl his orphaned state merits kindness and his prospects entitle him to consideration i mention this because i fancy when we last discussed this matter i saw a little disposition on your part to be satirical at the poor boys expense i am sure however that you will restrain this feeling at my request and treat him like a younger brother i only wish he was three or four years olderyou understand me miss tomorrow afternoon then we shall be at font abbey let him have the east room and tell brown to light a blazing fire in my bedroom and warm and air every mortal thing on pain of death your affectionate uncle john fountain on reading this letter lucy formed an innocent scheme it had long been matter of regret to her that aunt bazalgette could not see the good qualities of uncle fountain and uncle fountain of aunt bazalgette it must be mere prejudice said she or why do i love them both she had often wished she could bring them together and make them know one another better they would find out one anothers good qualities then and be friends but how as shakespeare says oxen and wainropes would not haul them together at last chance aided hermrs bazalgette was at font abbey actually lucy knew that if she announced mr fountains expected return the b would fly off that minute so she suppressed the information and giving up to young arthur as she had to mrs b moved into a still smaller room than the east room and now her heart quaked a little but after all uncle fountain is a gentleman thought she and not capable of showing hostility to her under his own roof here she is safe though nowhere else only i must see him and explain to him before he sees her with this view lucy declined demurely her aunts proposal for a walk no she must be excused she had work to do in the drawingroom that could not be postponed work that alters the case let me see it she took for granted it was some useful worksomething that could be worn when done what is this itthese dirty parchments oh i see it is for that selfish old man who but he would set a lady to parchments a bad guess cried lucy joyously i found them myself and set myself to work on them dont tell me he is at the bottom of it if it was for yourself you would give it up directly how amusing for me to see you work at that lucy rose and brought her the new novel mrs bazalgette took it and sat down to it but she could not fix her attention long on it ladies whose hearts are in dress have no taste for books however frivolous cant sit them for above a second or two mrs bazalgette fidgeted and fidgeted and at last rose and left the room book in hand how unkind i am said lucy to herself she was sitting sentinel till the carriage should arrive then she could run down and prepare her uncle for his innocent and accidental visitor it would not be prudent to let him receive the information from a servant or without the accompanying explanation this it was that made her so unnaturally firm when the little idle b pressed her to waste in play the shining hours mrs bazalgette went book in hand to her bedroom and had not been there long before she found employment many of lucys things were still in the wardrobes mrs b rummaged them inspected them at the window and ended by ringing for her maid and trying divers of her nieces dresses on they make her dresses better than they do mine they take more pains at last she found one that was new to her though lucy had worn it several times at font abbey where did she get this jane present from the old gentleman mum he had it down from london for her all at one time with this shawl and twelve puragloves lucy looked two inches taller than mrs b but somehow i cant tell how this dress of hers fitted the latter like a glove it embraced her it held her tenderly but tight as gowns and lovers should the poor dear could not get out of it i must wear it an hour or two said she besides it will save my own knocking about in these country lanes thus attired she went into the drawingroom to surprise lucy now lucy was determined not to move so not to be enticed she did not even look up from her work on this the other took a mild huff and whisked out so keen are the feminine senses that lucy on reflection recognized something brusk perhaps angry in the rustle of that retiring dress and soon after rang the bell and inquired where mrs bazalgette was john would make henquiries your haunt is in the back garden miss walking or what john would make henquiries she is reading miss and she is sitting on the seat master ad made for you miss very well thank you any more commands miss not at present john retired with a regretful air as one capable of executing important commissions but lost for lack of opportunity all the servants in this house liked to come into contact with lucy she treated them with a dignified kindness and reserved politeness that wins these good creatures more than either arrogance or familiarity jeames is not such a fool as he looks lucy was glad her aunt had got her book it is an interesting story she will not miss me now and the carriage will soon be here and then i will make up for my unkindness curiously enough at this very juncture the fair student found something in her parchment which gave her some little hopes of a favorable result she was following this clue eagerly when all of a sudden she started her ear had caught the rattle of a carriage over the stones of the stable yard she rang the bell and inquired if that was not the carriage yes miss my uncle has sent it back then he is not coming today john would inquire of the coachman oh yes miss master is come but he got out at the foot of the hill and walked up through the shrubbery with the young gentleman to show him the grounds on this news lucy rose hastily snatched up a garden hat and without any other preparation went out to intercept her uncle as she stepped into the garden she heard a loud scream followed by angry voices she threw her hands up to heaven in dismay and ran toward the sounds they came from the back garden she went like lightning round the corner of the house and came plump upon an agitated group of whom she made one directly spellbound here stood aunt bazalgette her head turned haughtily her cheeks scarlet there stood mr fountain on the other side of the rustic seat red as fire too but wearing a hangdog look and behind him young arthur pale with two eyes like saucers gazing awestruck at the first row he had ever seen between a fullgrown lady and gentleman our narrative must take a step to the rear as an excellent writer private phrases it otherwise you might be misled to suppose that uncle fountain was quarreling with mrs b for having set her foot in sacred font abbey i had an escape myself as i opened the door of a house a black fellow was behind waiting for me and made a chop i took a step to the rear fired through the door and cooked his goosetimes no the pudding was richer than that mr fountain had young arthur in charge and not being an illnatured old gentleman he pitied the boy and did all he could to make him feel he was coming among friends he sent the carriage on and showed arthur the grounds and covertly praised the place and all about it lucy included for was not she an appendage of his abbey you will see my niecea charming young lady who will be kind to you and you must make friends with her she is very accomplishedpaints she plays like an angel too ah there she is she has got the gown on i gave hera compliment to mea very pretty attention arthur the day of my return what is she doing arthur with his young eyes settled this question the lady is asleep see she has dropped her book and in fact the whole attitude was lax and not ungraceful her right hand hung down and the domestic story its duty done reposed beneath now arthur said the senior making himself young to please the boy and to show him that if he looked old he was not worn out would you like a bit of fun we will startle herwell give her a kiss arthur hung back irresolute and his cheeks were dyed with blushes not you you young rogue you are not her uncle the old gentleman then stole up at the back of the seat followed with respectful curiosity by arthur she happened to move as the senior got near so for fear she was going to wake of herself and baffle the surprise he made a rush and rubbed his beard a little roughly against mrs bazalgettes cheek up starts that lady who was not fast asleep but only under the influence of the domestic tale utters a scream and when she sees her ravisher goes into a passion how dare you what is the meaning of this insult how came you here was the reply in an equally angry tone cant a lady come into your little misery of a garden without being outraged it isnt the gardenit is only the back garden cried the proprietor of font hill blesse ill swear that is my nieces gown so youve invaded that too aunt bazalgetteuncle fountain it was my fault sighed a piteous voice this was lucy who had just come on the scene dear uncle forgive me it was i who invited her lucys pathetic tones which were fast degenerating into sobs were agreeably interrupted at one and the same moment the man and woman of the world took a new view of the situation looked at one another and burst out laughing both these carried a safetyvalve against cholera trait that takes us into many follies but keeps us out of othersa sense of humor the next thing to relieve the situation was the seniors comprehensive vanity he must recover young arthurs reverence which was doubtless dissolving all this time now arthur he whispered take a lesson from a gentleman of the old school i hate this shedevil but this is at my house soobserve he then strutted jauntily and feebly up to mrs bazalgette madam my niece says you are her guest but permit me to dispute her title to that honor mrs bazalgette smiled agreeably she wanted to stay a day or two at font abbey the senior flourished out his arm let me show you what we call the garden here she took his arm graciously i shall be delighted sir pompous old fool mrs bazalgette steeled her mind to admire the garden and would have done so with ease if it had been hideous but unfortunately it was prettyprettier than her own had grassy slopes a fountain a grotto variegated beds and beds a blaze of one color a fashion not common at that time item a brook with waterlilies on its bosom this brook is not mine strictly speaking said her host i borrowed it of my neighbor the lady opened her eyes so he grinned and revealed a characteristic transaction a quarter of a century ago he had found the brook flowing through a meadow close to his garden hedge he applied for a lease of the meadow and was refused by the proprietor in the following terms what is to become of my cows he applied constantly for ten years and met the same answer proprietor died the cows turned to oxbeef and were eaten in london along with flour and a little turmeric and washed down with spanish licoricewater salt gentian and a little burned malt widow inherited made hay and refused f the meadow because her husband had always refused him but in the tenth year of her siege she assented for the following reasons primo she had said no so often the word gave her a sense of fatigue secundo she liked variety and thought a change for the worse must be better than no change at all her tenant instantly cut a channel from the upper part of the stream into his garden and brought the brook into the lawn made it write an s upon his turf then handed it but again upon the meadow none the worse his own comment these things could be done in the countryjadis it cost mrs bazalgette a struggle to admire the garden and borrowed streamthey were so pretty she made the struggle and praised all lucy walking behind the pair watched them with innocent satisfaction how fast they are making friends thought she mistaking an armistice for an alliance since the place is so fortunate as to please you you will stay a week with me madam at least a week no mr fountain i really admire your courtesy too much to abuse it not at all you will oblige me i cannot bring myself to think so you may believe me i have a selfish motive oh if you are in earnest i will explain if you are my guest for a week that will give me a claim to be yours in turn and he bent a keen look upon the lady as much as to say now i shall see whether you dare let me spy on you as you are doing on me i propose an amendment said mrs bazalgette with a merry air of defiance for every day i enjoy here you must spend two beneath my roof on this condition i will stay a week at font abbey i consent said mr fountain a little sharply he liked the bargain i must leave you to lucy for a minute i have some orders to give i like my guests to be comfortable with this he retired to his study and pondered what is she here for it is not affection for lucy that is all my eye a selfish toad like her how agreeable she can make herself though she heard i was out and came here to spy directly that was sharp practice better not give her a chance of seeing my game i disarmed her suspicion by asking her to stay a week aha well during that week talboys must not come that is all aha my lady i wont give those cunning eyes of yours a chance of looking over my hand he then wrote a note to talboys telling him there was a guest at font abbey a disagreeable woman who makes mischief whenever she can she would be sure to divine our intentions and use all her influence with lucy to spite me you had better stay away till she is gone he sent this off by a servant then pondered again she suspects something then that is a sign she has her own designs on lucy hum no if she had she would not have invited me to her house she invited me directly and cheerfully mrs bazalgette walked and sat with an arm round lucys waist and told her seven times before dinner how happy she was at the prospect of a quiet week with her in the evening she yawned eleven times next day she asked lucy who was coming to dinner nobody dear nobody at all i thought you would perhaps not care to have our teteatete interrupted yet oh but i should like to explore the natives too i will give uncle a hint dear the hint was given very delicately but the malicious senior had a perverse construction ready immediately so this is her mighty affection for you cant get through two days without strangers uncle said lucy imploringly she is so used to society and she has me all day we ought to give her some little amusement at night well i cant make up parties now my friends are all in london she only wants something to flirt with send for david dodd what for her to flirt with yes he is a handsome fellow he will serve her turn for shame uncle what would mr bazalgette say poor aunt she is a coquette now and has been this twenty years now i was thinkingmr talboys talboys is not at home she must be content with lower game she shall bring down david lucy hesitated i dont think she will like mr dodd and i am sure he will not like her how can you know that he is so honest he will not understand a woman of the world and her little insinno i dont mean that well if he does not understand her he may like her aunt he has made me ask the dodds to tea and i am afraid you will not like them well if i dont we must try some more natives tomorrow who are they lucy told her pretty people to ask to meet me said she loftily this scorn dissolved in course of the evening lucy anxious her guests should be pleased with one another drew the dodds out especially davidmade him spin a yarn with this and his good looks he so pleased mrs bazalgette that it was the last yarn he ever span during her stay she took a fancy to him and set herself to captivate him with sprightly ardor david received her advances politely but a little coldly the lady was very agreeable but she kept him from lucy he hardly got three words with her all the evening as they went home together eve sneered well you managed nicely it was your business to make friends with that lady with all my heart then why didnt you do what she bid you she gave me no orders that i heard said the literal first mate she gave you a plain hint though to do what to do what stupid why to make love to her to be sure why she is a married woman if she chooses to forget that is it your business to remember it and if she was single and the loveliest in the world how could i court her when my heart is full of an angel if your heart is full your head is empty why you see nothing i cant see why i should belie my heart cant you then i can david in less than a month miss fountain goes to this lady and stays a quarter of a year she told me so herself oh my ears are always open in your service ever since i did agree to be as great a fool as you are now dont you see that if you cant get mrs bazalgette to invite you to her house you must take leave of the other here forever i see what you mean eve how wise you are it is wonderful but what is to be done i am bad at feigning i cant make love to her but you can let her make love to you is that an effort you feel equal to and i must do the rest oh we have a nice undertaking before us but if boys will cry for fruit that is out of their reach and their silly sisters will indulge themdont slobber me you are such a dear girl to fight for me so a little against your judgment a little eh dead against it you mean dont look so blank david you are all right as far as me when my heart is on your side you can snap your fingers at my judgment david was cheered by this gracious revelation eve was a tormenting little imp she could not help reminding him every now and then that all her maneuvers and all his love were to end in disappointment these discouraging comments had dashed poor davids spirits more than once but he was beginning to discover that they were invariably accompanied or followed by an access of cheerful zeal in the desperate causea pleasing phenomenon though somewhat unintelligible to this honest fellow who had never microscoped the enigmatical sex mrs bazalgette reproached lucy you never told me how handsome mr dodd was didnt i no he is the handsomest man i ever saw i have not observed that but i think he is one of the worthiest i should not wonder said the other lady carelessly it is clear you dont appreciate him here you half apologized to me for inviting him that was because you are such a fashionable lady and the dodds have no such pretensions all the better my taste is not for sophisticated people i only put up with them because i am obliged why lucy you ought to know how my heart yearns for nature and truth i am sure i have told you so often enough an hour spent with a simple natural creature like captain dodd refreshes me as a cooling breeze after the heat and odors of a crowded room miss dodd is very natural toois she not very pertness and vulgarity are natural enoughto some people my uncle likes her the best of the two then your uncle is mad but the fact is men are no judges in such cases they are always unjust to their own sex and as blind to the faults of ours as beetles but surely aunt she is very arch and lively pert and fussy you mean pretty at all events rather what with that snub nose lucy offered to invite other neighbors mrs bazalgette replied she didnt want to be bothered with rurality you can ask captain dodd if you like there is no need to invite the sister oh yes i must my uncle likes her the best but i dont and i am only here for a day or two miss dodd would be hurt it would be unkinddiscourteous no no she watches him all the time like a little dragon apres we have no sinister designs on mr dodd have we and something unusually keen flashed upon aunt bazalgette out of the tail of the quiet lucys eye mrs bazalgette looked cross nonsense lucy so tiresome cant we have an agreeable person without tacking on a disagreeable one aunt said lucy pathetically ask me anything else in the world but dont ask me to be rude for i cant well then you are bound to entertain her since she is your choice and leave me mine lucy acquiesced softly david tutored by his sister now tried to seem interested in her who came between him and lucy and a miserable hand he made of this his first piece of acting luckily for him mrs bazalgette liked the sound of her own voice and his good looks too went a long way with the mature woman lucy and eve sat together at the teatable mr fountain slumbered below arthur was in the study nailed to a novel eve under a careless exterior watched intently to find out if lucy under a calm surface cared for david at all or not and also watched for a chance to serve him she observed a certain languor about the young lady but no attempt to take david from the coquette at last however lucy did say demurely mr dodd seems to appreciate my aunt dont you think it is rather the other way that is an insidious question miss dodd i shall make no admissions but i warn you she is a very fascinating woman my brother is greatly admired by the ladies too oh since i praised my champion you have a right to praise yours but he will get the worst in that little encounter why so because my sprightly aunt forgets the very names of her conquests when once she has thoroughly made them she will never make this one my brother carries an armor against coquettes ay indeed and pray what may that be inquired lucy a little quizzingly a true and deep attachment ah and if you will look at him a little closer you will see that he would be glad to get away from that old flirt but david is very polite to ladies lucy stole a look from under her silken lashes and it so happened that at that very moment she encountered a sorrowful glance from david that said plainly enough i am obliged to be here but i long to be there she received his glance full in her eyes absorbed it blandly then lowered her lashes a moment then turned her head with a sweet smile toward eve i think you said your brother was engaged no i misunderstood you then yes eve uttered this monosyllable so dryly that lucy drew back and immediately turned the conversation into chitchat it had not trickled above ten minutes when an exclamation from david interrupted it the young ladies turned instinctively and there was david flushing all over and speaking to mrs bazalgette with a tremulous warmth that addressed as it was to a pretty woman sounded marvelously like lovemaking lucy turned her crest round a little haughtily and shot such a glance on eve eve read in it a compound of triumph and pique david came to eve one morning with parchments in his hand and a merry smile eureka youre another said eve as quick as lightning and upon speculation i have made mr fountains pedigree out explained david you dont say so wont he be pleased yes do you think she will be pleased why not she will look pleased anyway i say dont you go and tell them the whole county was owned by the dodds before fountain or funteyn or font was ever heard of hardly i have my own weaknesses my lass ive no need to adopt another mans bless my soul how wise you are got so sudden too you shouldnt surprise a body like that lucky im not hysterical now let me think davidsolomon i meanno you shall keep this discovery back awhile it may be wanted she then reminded him that the fountains were capricious that they had dropped him for a week and eight again if so this might be useful to unlock their street door to him at need good heavens eve what cunning david when i have a bad cause in hand i do one of two things i drop it or i go into it heart and soul if my zeal offends you i can retire from the contest with great pleasure no no no no no if you leave the helm i shall go ashore directlydismay of david grim satisfaction of his imp this matter settled david asked eve if she did not think master nelson mr fountains new ward was a very nice boy yes and i see he has taken a wonderful fancy to you and so have i to him we have had one or two walks together he is to come here at twelve oclock today now why couldnt you have asked me first david the painters are coming into the house today and the paperers and all and we cant be bothered with mathematics you must do them at font abbey eve was a little cross david only laughed at her but he hesitated about making a schoolhouse of font abbeyit would look like intruding pooh nonsense said eve they will only be too glad to take advantage of your goodnature he is an orphan said david doggedly however the lesson was given at font abbey and after it master nelson came bounding into the drawingroom to the ladies oh lucy mr dodd is such a beautiful geometrician he has been giving me a lesson he is going to give me one every day he knows a great deal more than my last tutor on this master nelson was questioned and revealed that a friendship existed between him and mr dodd such as girls are incapable of this was leveled at lucy being crossexamined as to the date of this friendship he was obliged to confess that it had only existed four days but was to last to death but arthur said lucy will not this take up too much of mr dodds time i think you had better consult uncle fountain before you make a positive arrangement of the kind oh i have spoken to my guardian about it and he was so pleased he said that would save him a mathematical tutor oh then said mrs bazalgette mr dodd is to teach mathematics gratis my friend is a gentleman was the timid reply juveniles have a pomposity all their own and exquisitely delicious we read together because we like one another and that is why we walk together and play together if we were to offer him money he would throw it at our heads mr arthur then relaxed his severity and condescending once more to the familiar added and he has made me a kite on mathematical principlessuch a whackerthose in the shops are no use and he has sent his mothers bath chair on to the downs and he is going to show me the kite draw him ten knots an hour in ita knot means a mile lucyso i cant stay wasting my time here only if you want to see some fun for once in your lives come on the downs in about an hourwill you oh yes do come read the oxford essays certainly not said mrs bazalgette sharply excuse us dear said lucy in the same breath well lucy said mrs bazalgette am i wrong about your uncles selfishness i have tried in vain ever since i came here to make you see it where you were the only sufferer not quite in vain aunt said lucy sadly you have shown me defects in my poor uncle that i should never have discovered mrs bazalgette smiled grimly only as you hate him and i love him and always mean to love him permit me to call his defects thoughtlessness you can apply the harsh term selfishness to the most goodnatured kind indulgentoh ha ha dont cry you silly girl thoughtless a calculating old goose who is eternally aiming to be a foxnever says or does anything without meaning something a mile off luckily his veil is so thin that everybody sees through it but you what do you think of his thoughtlessness in getting a tutor gratis poor mr dodd i will answer for it it is a pleasure to mr dodd to be of service to his little friend said lucy warmly how do you know a bore is a pleasure to mr dodd mr dodd is a new acquaintance of yours aunt but i have had opportunities of observing his character and i assure you all this pity is wasted why lucy what did you say to arthur just now you are contradicting yourself what a love of opposition i must have are you not tired of indoors shall we go into the village no i exhausted the village yesterday the garden no well then suppose we sketch the church together there is a good light no let us go on the downs lucy why aunt itit is a long walk all the better but we said no what has that to do with it arthur was right the kites that are sold by shops of prey are not proportioned nor balanced this is probably in some way connected with the circumstance that they are made to sell not fly the monster kite constructed by the light of euclid rose steadily into the air like a balloon and eventually being attached to the chair drew mr arthur at a reasonable pace about half a mile over a narrow but level piece of turf that was on the top of the downs qed this done these two patient creatures had to wind the struggling monster in and go back again to the starting point before they had quite achieved this two petticoats mounted the hill and moved toward them across the plateau at sight of them david thrilled from head to foot and arthur cried oh bother an unjust ejaculation since it was by his invitation they came his alarms were verified the ladies made themselves no directly and the poor kite became a shield for flirtation arthur was so cross at last the bs desire to occupy attention brought her to the verge of trouble seeing david saying a word to lucy she got into the chair and went gayly off drawn by the kite which arthur with a mighty struggle succeeded in hooking to the car for her now the plateau was narrow and the chair wanted guiding it was easy to guide it but mrs bazalgette did not know how so it sidled in a pertinacious and horrid way toward a long and steepish slope on the left side she began to scream arthur to laughthe young are cruel and i am afraid though he stood perfectly neutral to all appearance his heart within nourished black designs but david came flying up at her screamsjust in time he caught the ladys shoulders as she glided over the brow of the slope and lifted her by his great strength up out of the chair which went the next moment bounding and jumping athwart the hill and soon rolled over and groveled in rather an ugly way mrs bazalgette sobbed and cried so prettily on davids shoulder and had to be petted and soothed by all hands inward composure soon returned though not outward and in due course histrionics commenced first the sprain business none of you do it better ladies whatever you may think david had to carry her a bit but she was too wise to be a bore next the heroic business would be put down would walk possible or not would not be a trouble to her kind friends then the martyr smiling through pain david was very attentive to her for while he was carrying her in his arms she had won his affection all he could spare from lucy which of you can tell all the consequences if you go and carry a pretty woman with her little insinuating mouth close to your ears lucy and arthur walked behind arthur sighed lucy was reveuse arthur broke silence first lucy yes dear when is she going arthur for shame i wont tell you tomorrow lucy said arthur with a depth of feeling she spoils everything next morning come back what for i will have the goodness to tell you what she said in his ear why nothing you are a female reader oh that alters the case to attempt to deceive you would be cowardly immoral it would fail she sighed my preserver at which david had much ado not to laugh in her face then she murmured still more softly you must come and see me at my home before you sailwill you not i insist in the tone of a supplicant come promise me that i willwith pleasure said david flushing mind it is a promise put me down lucy come here and make him put me down i will not be a burden to my friends chapter viii that same evening mrs bazalgette being alone with lucy in the drawingroom put her arm round that young ladys waist and lovingly not seriously as a man might have been apt to do reminded her of her honorable promisenot to be caught in the net of matrimony at font abbey lucy answered without embarrassment that she claimed no merit for keeping her word no one had had the ill taste to invite her to break it you are either very sly or very blind replied mrs bazalgette quietly aunt said lucy piteously mrs bazalgette who by many a subtle question and observation during the last week had satisfied herself of lucys innocence now set to work and laid uncle fountain bare i do not speak in a hurry lucy a hint came round to me a fortnight ago that you had an admirer here and it turns out to be this mr talboys mr talboys yes does that surprise you do you think a young gentleman would come to font abbey three nights in a week without a motive lucy reflected it is all over the place that you two are engaged lucy colored and her eyes flashed with something very like anger but she held her peace ask jane else what take my servant into my confidence oh there is a way of setting that sort of people chattering without seeming to take any notice to tell the truth i have done it for you it is all over the village and all over the house the proper person to ask must have been uncle fountain himself as if he would have told me the truth he is a gentleman aunt and would not have uttered a falsehood doctrine of chivalry he would have uttered half a dozen in one minute besides why should i question a person i can read without your uncle with his babyish cunning that everybody sees through has given me the only proof i wanted he has not had mr talboys here once since i came cunning little aunt mr talboys happens not to be at home uncle told me so himself simple little niece uncle told you a fib mr talboys is at home and observe until i came to font abbey he was here three times a week you admit that i come your uncle knows i am not so unobservant as you and mr talboys is kept out of sight the proof that my uncle has deceived me said lucy coldly and with lofty incredulity read that note from miss dodd what you in correspondence with miss dodd that is to say she has thrust herself into correspondence with mejust like her assurance the letter ran thus dear madammy brother requests me to say that in compliance with your request he called at the lodge of talboys park and the people informed him mr talboys had not left talboys park at all since easter i remain yours etc lucy was dumfounded i suspected something lucy so i asked mr dodd to inquire it was a singular commission to send him on oh he takes long walkscruises he calls themand he is so goodnatured well what do you think of your uncles veracity now lucy was troubled and distressed but she mastered her countenance i think he has sacrificed it for once to his affection for me i fear you are right my eyes are opened to many circumstances but dooh pray dosee his goodness in all this the goodness of a storyteller he admires mr talboyshe reveres him no doubt he wished to secure his poor niece what he thinks a great match and now you assign ill motives to him yes i confess he has deviated from truth cruel cruel what can you give me in exchange if you rob me of my esteem for those i love this innocent distress with its cause were too deep for a lady whose bright little intelligence leaned toward cunning rather than wisdom in spite of her nieces trouble and the brimming eyes that implored forbearance she drove the sting merrily in again and again till at last lucy who was not defending herself but an absent friend turned a little suddenly on her and said and do you think he says nothing against you oh he is a backbiter too is he i didnt know he had that vice ah and pray what can he find to say against me oh people that hate one another can always find something illnatured to say retorted lucy with a world of meaning mrs bazalgette turned red and her little nose went up into the air at an angle of fortyfive she said with majestic disdain i dont hate the mani dont condescend to hate him then dont condescend to backbite him dear this homethrust coming from such a quarter took away my lady disdains very breath she sat transfixed then upon reflection got up a tear and had to be petted this sweet lady departed flinging down her firebrand on those hospitable boards lucy though she had defended her uncle was not a little vexed that he had managed matters so as to get her talked of with mr talboys her natural modesty and reserve prevented her from remonstrating nor was there any positive necessity she was one of those young ladies who seem born mistresses of the art of selfdefense deriving the art not from experience but from instinct they are as adroit at seventeen as they are at twentyseven so a last years bird constructs her first nest as cunningly as can a veteran feathered architect therefore without a grain of discourtesy or tangible illtemper she quietly froze and a small family with her they could not tell how or why for they had never even suspected this girls power you would have seemed to them as one that mocketh had you told them they owed their gayety their goodhumor their happiness and their conversational powers to her of these talboys suffered the most she brought him to a standstill by a very simple process she no longer patted or spurred him to vary the metaphor a man that has no current must be stirred or stagnate lucys light hand stirred talboys no more talboys stagnated mr fountain suffered next in proportion he began to find that something was the matter but what he had no idea he did not observe that though lucy answered him as kindly as ever she did not draw him out as heretofore far less that she was vexed with him and on her guard against him and everybody like a maitresse darmes no the days were drawing in the air was heavy no carbon in it wind in the east again etc so subtle is the influence of these silly little creatures upon creations lords mr talboys did not take delicate hints he continued his visits three times a week and the coast was kept clear for him on this miss fountain proceeded to overt acts of war she brought a champion on the scenea terrible championa champion so irresistible that i set any woman down as a coward who lets him loose upon a sex already so unequal to the contest as ours what that champions real name is i have in vain endeavored to discover but he is called headache when this terrible ally mingled in the gameon the talboys nightsdismay fell upon the wretched males that abode in and visited the once cheerful cozy font abbey messrs fountain and talboys put their heads together in grave anxious consultations and arthur vented a yell of remonstrance he found the lady one afternoon preparing indisposition she was leaning languidly back and the fire was dying out of her eye and the color out of her cheek and the blinds were drawn down the poor boy burst in upon this prologue oh lucy he cried in piteous foreboding tones dont go and have a headache tonight it was so jolly till you took to these stupid headaches i am so sorry arthur said lucy apologetically but at bottom she was inexorable the disease reached its climax just before dinner all remedies failed and there was nothing for it but to return to her own room and read the last new tale of domestic interestand principleuntil sleep came to her relief after dinner arthur shot out with the retiring servants and interred himself in the study where he sought out with care such wild romances as give entirely false views of life and found them and so shut up in measureless contentmacbeth the seniors consulted at their ease they both appreciated the painful phenomenon but they differed toto coelo as to the cause mr fountain ascribed it to the somber influence of mrs bazalgette and miscalled her till janes hair stood on end she happened to be the one at the keyhole that night mr talboys laid all the blame on david dodd the discussion was vigorous and occupied more than two hours and each party brought forward good and plausible reasons and if neither made any progress toward converting the other they gained this at least that each corroborated himself now mrs bazalgette was gone no direct reprisals on her were possible registering a vow that one day or other he would be even with her the senior consented though not very willingly to cooperate with his friend against an imaginary danger in answer to his remark that the dodds were never invited to tea now mr talboys had replied but i find from mr arthur he visits the house every day on the pretense of teaching him mathematicsa barefaced pretensea sailor teach mathematics mr fountain had much ado to keep his temper at this pertinacity in a jealous dream he gulped his ire down however and said somewhat sullenly i really cannot consent to send my poor friends son to the university a dunce and there is no other mathematician near if i find you one said talboys hastily will you relieve mr dodd of his labors and me of his presence certainly said the other poor david then there is my friend bramby he is a second wrangler he shall take arthur and keep him till miss fountain leaves us bramby will refuse me nothing i have a living in my gift and the incumbent is eightyeight the senior consented with a pitying smile bramby will take him next week said talboys severely mr fountain nodded his head it was all the assent he could effect and at that moment there passed through him the sacrilegious thought that the conqueror must have imported an ass or two among his other forces and that one of these intermarrying with saxon blood had produced a mule and that mule was his friend the same uneasy jealousy which next week was to expel david from font abbey impelled mr talboys to call the very next day at one oclock to see what was being done under cover of trigonometry he found mr and miss fountain just sitting down to luncheon david and arthur were actually together somewhere perhaps going through the farce of geometry he was half vexed at finding no food for his suspicions presently so spiteful is chance the door opened and in marched arthur and david i have made him stay to luncheon for once said arthur he couldnt refuse me we are to part so soon arthur got next to lucy and had david on his left mr talboys gave mr fountain a look and very soon began to play his battery upon david how do you naval officers find time to learn geometry what dont you know it is a part of our education sir i never heard that before that is odd but perhaps you have spent all your life ashore this in commiserating accents david then politely explained to mr talboys that a man who looked one day to command a ship must not only practice seamanship but learn navigation and that navigation was a noble art founded on the exact sciences as well as on practical experiences that there did still linger upon the ocean a few of the old captains who born at a period when a ship in making a voyage used to run down her longitude first and then begin to make her latitude could handle a ship well and keep her off a lee shore if they saw it in time but were in truth hardly to be trusted to take her from port to port we get a word with these old salts now and then when we are becalmed alongside and the questions they put make us quite feel for them then they trust entirely to their instruments they can take an observation but they cant verify one they can tack her and wear her i have seen them do one when they should have done the other and they can read the sky and the water better than we young ones and while she floats they stick to her and the greater the danger the louder the oathsbut that is all he then assured them with modest fervor that much more than that was expected of the modern commander particularly in the two capital articles of exact science and gentlemanly behavior he concluded with considerable grace by apologizing for his enthusiastic view of a profession that had been too often confounded with the faults of its professorsfaults that were curable and that they would all he hoped live long enough to see cured then turning to miss fountain he said and if i began by despising my business and taking a small view of it how should i ever hold sticks with my able competitors who study it with zeal and admiration lucy i dont quite understand all you have said mr dodd but that last i think is unanswerable fountain i am sure of it as the duke of wellington said the other day in the house of lords that is a position i defy any noble lord to assault with successhaw ho mr talboys averted his attack pray sir said he with a sneer may i ask have nautical commanders a particular taste for education as well as science not that i know of if you mean me i am hungry to learn and i find few but what can teach me something and what little i know i am willing to impart sir give and take it is the direction of your teaching that seems to me so singular mathematics are horrible enough and greatly to be avoided that is news to me on terra firma i mean at this opening of the case talboys versus newton arthur shrugged his shoulders to lucy and david and went swiftly out as from the presence of an idiot it was abominably rude but besides being illnatured and a little shallow mr talboys was drawling out his words and arthur was sixteencandid epoch at which affectation in man or woman is intolerable to us we get a little hardened to it long before sixty mr talboys bit his lip at this boyish impertinence but he was too proud a man to notice it otherwise than by quietly incorporating the offender into his satire but the enigma is why you read them with a stripling of whose breeding we have just had a specimenmathematics with a hobbadehoy grand dieu do pray tell us mr dodd why you come to font abbey every day is it really to teach master orson mathematics and manners david did not sink into the earth as he was intended to i come to teach him algebra and geometry what little i know but your motive mr dodd david looked puzzled lucy uneasy at seeing her guest badgered ask miss fountain why she thinks i do my best for arthur said david lowering his eyes talboys colored and looked at fountain i think it must be out of pure goodness said lucy sweetly mr talboys ignored her calmly pray enlighten us mr dodd now what is the real reason you walk a mile every day to do mathematics with that interesting and wellbehaved juvenile you are very curious sir said david grimly his ire rising unseen i amon this point well since you must be told what most men could see without help it isbecause he is an orphan and because an orphan finds a brother in every man that is worth the shoeleather he stands in can ye read the riddle now ye lubber and david started up haughtily and with contempt and wrath on his face marched through the open window and joined his little friend on the lawn leaving fountain red with anger and talboys white the next thing was lucy rose and went quietly out of the room by the door it is the last time he shall set his foot within my door provoking cub you are convinced at last that he is a dangerous rival a rival nonsense and stuff then why was she so agitated she went out with tears in her eyes i saw them the poor girl was frightened no doubt we dont have fracases at font abbey on this one spot of earth comfort reigns and balmy peace and shall reign unruffled while i live the passions are not admitted here sir gracious heaven forbid id as soon see a bonfire in the middle of my diningroom as jealousy co in that case you had better exclude the cause the cause is your imagination my good friend but i will give it no handle i will exclude david dodd until she has accepted you in form with this understanding the friends parted after dinner that same day arthur sat in the drawingroom with lucy he was reading she working placidly she looked off her work demurely at him several times he was absorbed in a flighty romance i have dropped my worsted arthur it is by you arthur picked the ball up and brought it to her then back to his romance heart and soul another sidelong glance at him then after a long silence your book seems very interesting ill fling it against the wall if it does not mind was the infuriated reply here are two fools quarreling page after page and cant see or wont see what everybody else can see that it is an absurd misunderstanding one word of common sense would put it all right then why not put the book down and talk to me i cant it wont let me i must see how long the two fools will go on not seeing what everybody else sees will not the number of volumes tell you that signorina dont you try to be satirical said the sprightly youth youll only make a mess of it what is the use dropping one drop of vinegar into such a great big honey pot you are a saucy boy retorted lucy in tones of gentle approbation a long silence arthur will you hold this skein for me arthur groaned never mind dear i will try and manage with a chair no you wont now there the victim was caught by the hands but with fatal instinctive perverseness he sat in silent amazement watching lucys supple white hand disentangling impossibilities instead of chattering as he was intended to lucy gave a little sigh here was a dreadful businessobliged to elicit the information she had resolved should be forced upon her by the by arthur said she carelessly did mr dodd say anything to you on the lawn what about about what was said after you went out so ruso suddenly no why what was said something about me tell me oh no dear as mr dodd did not mention it it is not worth while you must not move your hands please now lucy that is too bad it is not fair to excite ones curiosity and then stop directly but it is nothing mr talboys teased mr dodd a little that is all and mr dodd was not so patient as i have seen him on like occasions there you are disentangled at last now signorina let us talk sense tell me which do you like best of all the gentlemen that come here you dear only keep your hands still none of your chaff lucy chaff what is that flattery then i hope it isnt that affected fool talboys for i hate hun i cannot undertake to share your prejudices mr arthur then you actually like him i dont dislike him then i pity your taste that is all mr talboys has many good qualities and if he was what you describe him uncle fountain would not prize him as he does there is something in that lucy but i think my guardian and you are mad upon just that one point talboys is a fool and a snob arthur said lucy severely if you speak so of my uncles friends you and i shall quarrel you wont quarrel just now if you can help it wont i though why not pray because your skein is not wound yet oh you little blackhearted thing i know human nature miss said the urchin pompously i have read miss edgeworth he then made an appeal to her candor and good sense now dont you see my friend mr dodd is worth them all put together i cant quite see that he is so noble so kind so clever you must own he is a trifle brusk never and if he is that is not like hurting peoples feelings on purpose and saying nasty illnatured things wrapped up in politeness that you darent say out like a man or youd get kicked he is a gentleman inside that talboys is only one outside but you girls cant look below the surface we have not read miss edgeworth his hands are not so white as mr talboys nor his liver eitheroh you goose which has the finest eyes why you dont see such eyes as mr dodds every day they are as large as yours only his are dark dont be angry dear you must admit his voice is very loud he can make it loud but it is always low and gentle whenever he speaks to you i have noticed that so that is monstrous ungrateful of you there the skein is wound arthur well i have a great mind to tell you something your friend mr dodd said while you were out of the roombut no you shall finish your story first no no hang the story ah you only say that out of politeness i have taken you from it so long already the impetuous boy jumped up seized the volumes dashed out and presently came running back crying there i have thrown them behind the bookcase for ever and ever now will you tell me what he said lucy smiled triumphantly she could relish a bloodless victory over an inanimate rival then she said softly arthur what i am going to tell you is in confidence i will be torn in pieces before i betray it said the young chevalier lucy smiled at his extravagance then began again very gravely mr talboys who with many good qualities haswhat shall i saynarrow and artificial views compared with your friend ah now you are talking sense then why interrupt me dearbegan teasing him and wanting to know the real reason he comes here the real reason what did the fool mean how can i tell arthur any more than you mr dodd evidently thought that some slur was meant on the purity of his friendship for you shame shame oh i saw his anger rising for mr dodd though not irritable is passionateat least i think so i tried to smooth matters but no mr talboys persisted in putting this ungenerous question when all of a sudden mr dodd burst out you wish to know why i love arthur because he is an orphan and because an orphan finds a brother in every man who is worth the shoeleather he stands in that is all the riddle you lubber it was terribly rude but oh arthur i must tell you your friend looked noble he seemed to swell and rise to a giant as he spoke and we all felt such little shrimps around him and his lip trembled and fire flashed from his eyes how you would have admired him then and he swept out of the room and left us for his little friend who is worthy of it all since he stands up for him against us all arthur why he is crying poor child and do you think those words did not go to my heart as well i am an orphan too arthur dont cry love oh oh oh oh magic of a word from a great heart such a word uncouth and simple but hot from a manly bosom pierced silk and broadcloth as if they had been calico and fustian and made a fashionable young lady and a bold schoolboy take hands and cry together but such sweet tears dry quickly they dry almost as they flow hallo cried the mercurial prince a sudden thought strikes me you kept running him down a minute ago me said lucy with a look of amazement why you know you did now tell me what was that for to give you the pleasure of defending him oh hum lucy you are not quite so simple as the others think sometimes i cant make you out myself is it possible well you know what to do dear no i dont why read miss edgeworth over again chapter ix arthur was bundled off to a private tutor and the dodds invited to font abbey no more and talboys dined there three days a week so far david dodd was in a poor and miserable position compared with talboys who visited lucy at pleasure and could close the very street door against a rival real or imaginary but the street door is not the door of the heart and david had one little advantage over his powerful antagonist it was a slender one and he owed it to a subtle sourcefemale tact his sister had long been aware of talboys the gossip of the village had enlightened her as to his visits and supposed pretensions she had deliberately withheld this information from her brother for she said to herself men always make such fools of themselves when they are jealous no david shant even know he has got a rival if he did he would be wretched and live on thorns and then he would get into passions and either make a fool of himself in her eyes or do something rash and be shown to the door thus far eve defending her brother and with this piece of shrewdness she did a little more for him than she intended or was conscious of for talboys either by feeble calculation or instinct of petty rivalry constantly sneered at david before lucy david never mentioned talboys name to her now superior ignores inferior detracts thus talboys lowered himself and rather elevated david moreover he counteracted his own strongest weapon the street door after putting david out of sight this judicious rival could not let him fade out of mind too he found means to stimulate the ladys memory and as far as in him lay made the absent present may all my foes unweave their webs as cleverly david knew nothing of this he saw himself shut out from paradise and he was sad he felt the loss of arthur too the orphan had been medicine to him when a man is absorbed in a hopeless passion to be employed every day in a good action has a magical soothing influence on the racked heart try this instead of suicide despairing lover it is a quack remedy no m d prescribes it never you mind in desperate ills a little cure is worth a deal of etiquette poor david had lost this innocent comfortlost too the pleasure of going every day to the house she lived in to be sure when he used to go he seldom caught a glimpse of her but he did now and then and always enjoyed the hope i see how it is said he to eve one day i am not welcome to the master of the house well he is the master i shall not force my way where i am not welcome but after these spirited words he hung his head oh nonsense said eve it isnt him there are mischiefmakers behind ay just you tell me who they are ill teach them to come across my hawse and davids eyes flashed dont you be silly said eve and turned it off and dont be so downhearted why you are not half a man no more i am eve what has come to me what indeed just when everything goes swimmingly eve how can you say so why david she leaves this in a few days for mrs bazalgettes house you tell me you have got a warm invitation there then make the play there and if you cant win her say you dont deserve her twiddle your thumb and see a bolder lover carry her off you foolish boy she is only a woman she is to be won if you dont mind some man will show you it was as easy as you think it is hard timid wooers make a mountain of a molehill why it is you who have kept me backing and filling all this time eve of course prudence at first starting but that isnt to say courage is never to come in first creep within the fortification wall but once inside if you dont storm the city that minute woe be unto you come cheer up it is only for a few days and then she goes where you will have her all to yourself besides you shall have one sweet delicious evening with her all alone before she goes what have you forgotten the pedigree wasnt i right to keep that back and now march and take a good long walk her tongue was a spur it made davids drooping manhood rear and prancea trumpet and pealed victory to come david kissed her warmly and strode away radiant she looked sadly after him she had never spoken so hopefully so encouragingly the reason will startle such of my readers as have not taken the trouble to comprehend her it was that she had never so thoroughly desponded such was eve when matters went smoothly she itched to torment and take the gloss off david but now the affair looked really desperate so it would have been unkind not to sustain him with all her soul the cause of her despondency and consequent cheerfulness shall now be briefly related scarce an hour ago she had met miss fountain in the village and accompanied her home for davids sake she had diverted the conversation by easy degrees to the subject of marriage in order to sound miss fountain you would never give your hand without your heart i am sure heaven forbid was the reply not even to a coronet not even to a crown so far so good but miss fountain went on to say that the heart was not the only thing to be consulted in a matter so important as marriage it is the only thing i would ever consult said eve as lucy did not reply eve asked her next what she would do if she loved a poor man lucy replied coldly that it was not her present intention to love anybody but her relations that she should never love any gentleman until she had been married to him or correcting herself at all events been some time engaged to him and she should certainly never engage herself to anyone who would not rather improve her position in society than deteriorate it eve met these pretty phrases with a look of contempt as much as to say while you speak i am putting all that into plain vulgar english the other did not seem to notice it to leave this interesting topic for a while said she languidly let me consult you miss dodd i have not as you may have noticed great abilities but i have received an excellent education to say nothing of those soidisant accomplishments with which we adorn and sometimes weary society my dear mother had me well grounded in languages and history without being eloquent i have a certain fluency in which they tell me even members of parliament are deficient smoothly as their speeches read made into english by the newspapers like yourself miss dodd and all our sex i am not destitute of tact and tact you know is the talent of talents i feel here she bit her lip myself fit for public life i am ambitious oh you are are you very and perhaps you will kindly tell me how i had best direct that ambition the army no marching against daisies and dancing and flirting in garrison towns is frivolous and monotonous too it isnt as if war was raging trumpets ringing and squadrons charging your brothers profession not for the world i am a coward consistent shall i lower my pretensions to the learned professions i dont doubt your cleverness but the learned professions a woman has a tongue you know and that is their grand requisite i interrupted you miss dodd pray forgive me well then let us go through them to be a clergyman what is required to preach and visit the sick and feel for them and understand what passes in the sorrowful hearts of the afflicted is that beyond our sex that last is far more beyond a man at most times and oh the discourses one has to sit out in church portia made a very passable barrister miss dodd oh did she why you know she did and as for medicine the great successes there are achieved by honeyed words with a long word thrown in here and there ive heard my own mamma say so now which shall i be i suppose you are making fun of me said eve but there is many a true word spoken in jest you could be a better parson lawyer or doctor than nine out of ten but they wont let us they know we could beat them into fits at anything but brute strength and wickedness so they have shut all those doors in us poor girls faces there you see said lucy archly but two lines are open to our honorable ambition marriage andwatercolors i think marriage the more honorable of the two above all it is the more fashionable can you blame me then if my ambition chooses the altar and not the easel so that is what you have been bringing me to you came of your own accord was the sly retort let me offer you some luncheon no thank you i could not eat a morsel just now eve went away her bright little face visibly cast down it was not miss fountains words only and that new trait of hard satire which she had so suddenly produced from her secret recesses her very tones were cynical and worldly to eves delicate sense of hearing poor poor david she thought and when she got to the door of the room she sighed and as she went home she said more than once to herself no more heart than a marble statue oh how true our first thought is i come back to mine lucy sola then what right had she to come here and try to turn me inside out chapter x as the hour of lucys departure drew near mr fountain became anxious to see her betrothed to his friend for fear of accidents you had better propose to her in form or authorize me to do so before she goes to that mrs bazalgette this time it was talboys that hung back he objected that the time was not opportune i make no advance said he on the contrary i seem of late to have lost ground with your niece oh ive seen the sort of distance she has put on all superficial my dear sir i read it in your favor i know the sex they cant elude me pique sirnothing on earth but female pique she is bitter against us for shillyshallying these girls hate shillyshally in a man they are monopolistssevere monopolists shillyshally is one of their monopolies throw yourself at her feet and press her with ardor she will clear up directly the proposed attitude did not tempt the stiff talboys his pride took the alarm thank you it is a position in which i should not care to place myself unless i was quite sure of not being refused no i will not risk my proposal while she is under the influence of this dodd he is somehow or other the cause of her coldness to me good heavens why she has been hermetically sealed against him ever so long cried fountain almost angrily i saw his sister come out of your gate only the other day sisters are emissariesdangerous ones too who knows her very coldness may be vexation that this man is excluded perhaps she suspects me as the cause these are chimeraswild chimeras my niece cares nothing for such people as the dodds i beg your pardon these low attachments are the strongest it is a notorious fact there is no attachment there is nothing but civility and the affability of a wellbred superior to an inferior attachment why there is not a girl in europe less capable of marrying beneath her and she is too cold to flirtbut with a view to matrimonial position the worst of it is that while you fear an imaginary danger you are running into a real one if we are defeated it will not be by dodd but by that mrs bazalgette why now i think of it whence does lucys coldness date from that vipers visit to my house rely on it if we are suffering from any rival influence it is that womans she is a dangerous womanshe is a character i detestshe is a schemer am i to understand that mrs bazalgette has views of her own for miss fountain inquired talboys his jealousy half inclined to follow the new lead in all probability oh then it is mere surmise no it is not mere surmise it is the reasonable conjecture of a man who knows her sex and human nature and life since i have my views what more likely than that she has hers if only to spite me add to this her strange visit to font abbey and the somber influence she has left behind and to this woman lucy is going unprotected by any positive pledge to you here is the true cause for anxiety and if you do not share it with me it must be that you do not care about our alliance mr talboys was hurt not care for the alliance it was dear to himall the dearer for the difficulties he was attached to miss fountainwarmly attached would do anything for her except run the risk of an affronta refusal then followed a long discussion the result of which was that he would not propose in form now but would give proofs of his attachment such as no lady could mistake inter alia he would be sure to spend the last evening with her and would ride the first stage with her next day squeeze her hand at parting and look unutterable and as for the formal proposal that was only postponed a week or two mr fountain was to pay his visit to mrs bazalgette and secretly prepare miss fountain then talboys would suddenly pounceand pop the grandeur and boldness of this strategy staggered rather than displeased mr fountain what under her own roof and he could not help rubbing his hands with glee and spiteunder her own eye and malgre her personal influence why you are nap i she will be quite out of the way of the dodds there said talboys slyly the senior groaned mule i i should have said and so they cut and dried it all the last evening came and with it just before dinner a line by special messenger from mr talboys he could not come that evening his brother had just arrived from india they had not met for seven years he could not set him to dine alone after dinner in the middle of her uncles nap in came lucy and unheardof occurrencedeed of dreadful notewoke him she was radiant and held a note from eve good news uncle those good kind dodds they are coming to tea what and he wore a look of consternation recollecting however that talboys was not to be there he was indifferent again but when he read the note he longed for his selfinvited visitors it ran thus dear miss fountaindavid has found out the genealogy he says there is no doubt you came from the fountains of melton and he can prove it he has proved it to me and i am none the wiser so as david is obliged to go away tomorrow i think the best way is for me to bring him over with the papers tonight we will come at eight unless you have company he is a worthy young man shouted mr fountain what oclock is it very nearly eight oh uncle i am so glad how pleased you will be the dodds arrived soon after and while tea was going on david spread his parchments on the table and submitted his proofs he had eked out the other evidence by means of a series of leases the three fields that went with font abbey had been let a great many times and the landlords name fountain in the latter leases was fontaine in those of remoter date david even showed his host the exact date at which the change of orthography took place you are a shrewd young gentleman cried mr fountain gleefully david then asked him what were the names of his three meadows the names of them he didnt know they had any no names why there isnt a field in england that hasnt its own name sir i noticed that before i went to sea he then told mr fountain the names of his three meadows and curious names they were two of them were a good deal older than william the conqueror david wrote them on a slip of paper he then produced a chart what is that mr david a map of the melton estate sir why how on earth did you get that an old shipmate of mine lives in that quartergot him to make it for me overhaul it sir you will find the melton estate has got all your three names within a furlong of the mansion house from this you infer that one of that house came here and brought the e along with him that has got dropped somehow since and being so far from his birthplace he thought he would have one or two of the old names about him what will you bet me he hasnt shot more than one brace of partridges on those fields about melton when he was a boy so he christened your three fields afresh and the new names took likely he made a point of it with the people in the village for all that i have found one old fellow who stands out against them to this day his name is newel he will persist in calling the field next to your house snap witcheloe that is what my grandfather allus named it says he and that is the name it went by afore there was ever a fountain in this ere parish i have looked in the parish register and i see newels grandfather was born in now sir all this is not mathematical proof but when you come to add it to your own direct proofs that carry you within a cables length of port fontaine it is very convincing and not to pay out too much yarn ill betmy headto a china orange david dont be vulgar never mind mr doddbe yourself well then to serve eve out ill bet her head and that is a better one than mine to a china orange that fontaine and fountain are one and that the first fontaine came over here from melton more than one hundred and thirty years ago and less than one hundred and forty when newels grandfather was a young man probatum est shouted old fountain his eyes sparkling his voice trembling with emotion miss fontaine said he turning to lucy throwing a sort of pompous respect into his voice and manner you shall never marry any man that cannot give you as good a home as melton and quarter as good a coat of arms with you as your own the founteyns davids heart took a chill as if an icearrow had gone through it so join me to thank our young friend here mr fountain held out his hand david gave his mechanically in return scarcely knowing what he did you are a worthy and most intelligent young man and you have made an old man as happy as a lord said the old gentleman shaking him warmly and there is my hand too said lucy putting out hers with a blush to show you i bear you no malice for being more unselfish and more sagacious than us all instantly davids cold chill fled unreasonably his cheeks burned with blushes his eyes glowed his heart thumped and the delicate white supple warm velvet hand that nestled in his shot electric tremors through his whole frame when glided with wellbred noiselessness through the open door mr talboys and stood looking yellow at that ardent group and the massive yet graceful bare arm stretched across the table and the white hand melting into the brown one while he stood staring david looked up and caught that strange that yellow look instantly a light broke in on him so i should look felt david if i saw her hand in his he held lucys hand tight she was just beginning to withdraw it and glared from his seat on the newcomer like a lion ready to spring eve read and turned pale she knew what was in the mans blood lucy now quietly withdrew her hand and turned with smiling composure toward the newcomer and mr fountain thrust a minor anxiety between the passions of the rivals he rose hastily and went to talboys and under cover of a warm welcome took care to let him know miss dodd had been kind enough to invite herself and david he then explained with uneasy animation what david had done for him talboys received all this with marked coldness but it gave him time to recover his selfpossession he shook hands with lucy all but ignored david and eve and quietly assumed the part of principal personage he then spoke to lucy in a voice tuned for the occasion to give the impression that confidential communication was not unusual between him and her he apologized scarce above a whisper for not having come to dinner on her last day but after dinner said he my brother seemed fatigued i treacherously recommended bed you forgive me the nabob instantly acted on my selfish hint i mounted my horse and me voila in short in two minutes he had retaliated tenfold on david as for lucy she was a good deal amused at this sudden public assumption of a tenderness the gentleman had never exhibited in private but a little mortified at his parade of mysterious familiarity still for a certain female reason she allowed neither to appear but wore an air of calm cordiality and gave talboys his full swing david seated sore against his will at another table whither mr fountain removed him and parchments on pretense of inspecting the leases listened with hearing preternaturally keenlistened and writhed his back was toward them at last he heard talboys propose in murmuring accents to accompany her the first stage of her journey she did not answer directly and that second was an age of anguish to poor david when she did answer as if to compensate for her hesitation she said with alacrity i shall be delighted it will vary the journey most agreeably i will ride the pony you were so kind as to give me the letters swam before davids eyes lucy came to the table and standing close behind davidso close that he felt her pure cool breath mingle with his hair said to her uncle mr talboys proposes to me to ride the first stage tomorrow if i do you must be of the party oh must i well ill roll after you in my phaeton at this moment eve could bear no longer the anguish on davids beloved face it made her hysterical she could hardly command herself she rose hastily and saying we must not keep you up the night before a journey took leave with david as he shook hands with lucy his imploring eye turned full on hers and sought to dive into her heart but that soft sapphire eye was unfathomable it was like those dark blue southern waters that seem to reveal all yet hide all so deep they are though clear eve thank heaven we are safe out of the house david i have got a rival eve a pretty rival she doesnt care a button for him david he rides the first stage with her eve well what of that david i have got a rival david was none of your lieabeds he rose at five in summer six in winter and studied hard till breakfast time after that he was at every fools service this morning he did not appear at the breakfast table and the servant had not seen him about eve ran upstairs full of anxiety he was not in his room the bed had not been slept in the impress of his body outside showed however that he had flung himself down on it to snatch an uneasy slumber eve sent the girl into the village to see if she could find him or hear tidings of him the girl ran out without her bonnet partaking her mistresss anxiety but did not return for nearly half an hour that seemed an age to eve the girl had lost some time by going to josh grace for information graces house stood in an orchard so he was the unlikeliest man in the village to have seen david she set against this trivial circumstance the weighty one that he was her sweetheart and went to him first i haint asin him sue thee hadst better ask at the blacksmiths shop said joshua grace susan profited by this hint and learned at the blacksmiths shop that david had gone by up the road about six in the morning walking very fast she brought the news to eve toward royston yes miss but la he wont ever think to go all the way to roystonwithout his breakfast that will do susan i think i know what he is gone for on the servant retiring her assumed firmness left her on the road she is to travel and his rival with her what mad act is he going to do heaven have mercy on him and me and her eve knew what was in the mans blood she sat trembling at home till she could bear it no longer she put on her bonnet and sallied out on the road to royston determined to stop the carriage profess to have business at royston and take a seat beside mr fountain she felt that the very sight of her might prevent david from committing any great rashness or folly on reaching the high road she observed a fresh track of narrow wheels that her rustic experience told her could only be those of a fourwheeled carriage and making inquiries she found she was too late carriage and riders had gone on before her heart sank too late by a few minutes but somehow she could not turn back she walked as fast as she could after the gay cavalcade a prey to one of those female anxieties we have all laughed at as extravagant proved unreasonable and sometimes found prophetic meantime lucy and mr talboys cantered gayly along mr fountain rolled after in a phaeton the traveling carriage came last lucy was in spirits motion enlivens us all but especially such of us as are women she had also another cause for cheerfulness that may perhaps transpire her two companions and unconscious dependents were governed by her mood she made them larks today as she had owls for some weeks past last night excepted she would fall back every now and then and let uncle fountain pass her then come dashing up to him and either pull up short with a piece of solemn information like an aiddecamp from headquarters or pass him shooting a shaft of raillery back into his chariot whereat he would rise with mock fury and yell a repartee after her fountain found himself good companytalboys himself it was not the lady oh dear no it never is at last all seemed so bright and mr talboys found himself so agreeable that he suddenly recalled his high resolve not to pop in a county desecrated by dodds ill risk it now said he and he rode back to fountain and imparted his intention and the senior nearly bounded off his seat he sounded the charge in a stage whisper because of the coachman at her at once secret conference hum said lucy twisting her pony and looking slyly back mr talboys rejoined her and after a while began in strange melodious accents you will leave a blank shall we canter said lucy gayly and off went the pony talboys followed and at the next hill resumed the sentimental cadence you will leave a sad blank here miss fountain no greater than i found replied the lady innocently oh dear she cried with sudden interest i am afraid i have dropped my comb she felt under her hat no viper you have not dropped your comb but you are feeling for a large black pin with a head to it there you have found it and taken it out of your hair and got it hid in your hand what is that for ten times greater moaned the honeyed talboys for then we had not seen you ah my dear miss fountainthe devil woho goliah for the pony spilled the treacle he lashed out both heels with a squeak of amazement within an inch of mr talboys horse which instantly began to rear and plunge and snort while talboys an excellent horseman was calming his steed lucy was condoling with hers dear little naughty fellow said she patting him i did it too hard as i was saying the blessing we have never enjoyed we do not miss but now that you have shone upon us what can reconcile us to lose you unless it be the hope thathallo lucy ah the pony was off with a bound like a buck she had found out the right depth of pin this time ah where is my whip i have dropped it how careless then they had to ride back for the whip and by this means joined mr fountain lucy rode by his side and got the carriage between her and her beau by this plan she not only evaded sentiment but matured by a series of secret trials her skill with her weapon armed with this new science she issued forth and whenever mr talboys left off indifferent remarks and sounded her affections she probed the pony and he kicked or bolted as the case might require confound that pony cried talboys he used to be quiet enough oh dont scold him dear playful little love he carries me like a wave at this simple sentence talboys dormant jealousy contrived to revive he turned sulky and would not waste any more tenderness and presently they rattled over the stones of royston lucy commended her pony with peculiar earnestness to the ostler pray groom him well and feed him well sir he is a love the ostler swore he would not wrong her ladyships nag for the world lucy then expressed her desire to go forward without delay aunt will expect me she took her seat in the carriage bade a kind farewell to both the gentlemen now that no tender answer was possible and was whirled away thus the coy virgin eluded the pair now her manner in taking leave of talboys was so kind so smiling in the sweet consciousness of having baffled him that fountain felt sure it all had gone smoothly they were engaged well he cried with great animation no was the despondent reply refused screeched the other impossible no thank you was the haughty reply what then did you change your mind didnt you propose after all i couldnt that dd pony wouldnt keep still fountain groaned lucy left to herself gave a little sigh of relief she had been playing a part for the last twentyfour hours her cordiality with mr talboys naturally misled eve and david and perhaps a male reader or two shall i give the clue it may be useful to you young gentlemen well then her sex are compounders accustomed from childhood never to have anything entirely their own way they are content to give and take and these terms once accepted it is a point of honor and tact with them not to let a creature see the irksome part of the bargain is not as delicious as the other one coat of their own varnish goes over the smooth and the rough the bitter and the sweet now lucy besides being singularly polite and kind was femme jusqu au bout des ongles if her instincts had been reasons and her vague thoughts could have been represented by anything so definite as words the result might have appeared thus a few hours and you can bore me no more mr talboys now what must i do for you in return seem not to be bored today mais cest la moindre des choses seem to be pleased with your society why not it is only for an hour or two and my seeming to like it will not prolong it my heart swells with happiness at the thought of escaping from you good bore you shall share my happiness good bore it is so kind of you not to bore me to all eternity this was why the last night she sat like patience on an ottoman smiling on talboys and racking davids heart and this was why she made the ride so pleasant to those she was at heart glad to leave till they tried sentiment on and then she was an eel directly pony and all lucy sola that is over poor mr talboys does he fancy he has an attachment no i please and i am courted wherever i go but i have never been loved if a man loved me i should see it in his face i should feel it without a word spoken once or twice i fancied i saw it in one mans eyes they seemed like a lions that turned to a doves as they looked at me lucy closed her own eyes and recalled her impression it must have been fancy ought i to wish to inspire such a passion as others have inspired no for i could never return it the very language of passion in romances seems so extravagant to me yet so beautiful it is hard i should not be loved merely because i cannot love many such natures have been adored i could not bear to die and not be loved as deeply as ever woman was loved i must be loved adored and worshiped it would be so sweetsweet she slowly closed her eyes and the long lovely lashes drooped and a celestial smile parted her lips as she fell into a vague delicious reverie suddenly the carriage stopped at the foot of a hill she opened her eyes and there stood david dodd at the carriage window lucy put her head out why it is mr dodd oh mr dodd is there anything the matter no you look so pale do i and he flushed faintly which way are you going i am going home again now said david sorrowfully you came all this way to bid me goodby and she arched her eyebrows and laugheda little uneasily it didnt seem a step it will seem longer going back no no you shall ride back my pony is at the white horse will you not ride my pony back for me then i shall know he will be kindly used a stranger would whip him i should think my arm would wither if i illused him you are very good i suppose it is because you are so brave me brave i dont feel so am i to tell him to drive on and he looked at her with haggard and imploring eyes her eyes fell before his goodby then said she he cried with a choking voice to the postilion go ahead the carriage went on and left him standing in the road his head upon his breast at the steepest part of the hill a trace broke and the driver drew the carriage across the hill and shouted to david he came running up and put a large stone behind each wheel lucy was alarmed mr dodd let me out he handed her out the postboy was at a nonplus but david whipped a piece of cord and a knife out of his pocket and began with great rapidity and dexterity to splice the trace ah now you are pleased mr dodd our misfortune will elicit your skill in emergencies oh no it isnt that it isi never hoped to see you again so soon lucy colored and her eyes sought the ground the splice was soon made there said david i could have spent an hour over it but you would have been vexed and the bitter moment must have come at last god bless you miss fountainoh maynt i say miss lucy today he cried imploringly of course you may said lucy the tears rising in her eyes at his sad face and beseeching look oh mr dodd parting with those we esteem is always sad enough i got away from the door without cryingfor once dont you make me cry make you cry cried david as it he had been suspected of sacrilege god forbid he muttered in a choking voice you give the word of command for i cant you can go on said her soft clear voice but first she gave david her hand with a gentle lookgoodby but david could not speak to her he held her hand tight in both his powerful hands they seemed iron to hershaking trembling grasping iron the carriage went slowly on and drew her hand away she shrank into a corner of the carriage he frightened her he followed the carriage to the brow of the hill then sat down upon a heap of stones and looked despairingly after it meantime lucy put her head in her hands and blushed though she was all alone how dare he forget the distance between us poor fellow have not i at times forgotten it i am worse than he i lost my selfpossession i should have checked his folly he knows nothing of les convenances he has hurt my hand he is so rough i feel his clutch now there i thought so it is all redpoor fellow nonsense he is a sailor he knows nothing of the world and its customs parting with a pleasant acquaintance forever made him a little sad he is all nature he is like nobody else he shows every feeling instead of concealing it that is all he has gone home i hope she glanced hastily back he was sitting on the stones his arms drooping his head bowed a picture of despondency she put her face in her hands again and pondered blushing higher and higher then the pale face that had always been ruddy before the simple grief and agitation the manly eye that did not know how to weep but was so clouded and troubled and wildly sad the shaking hands that had clutched hers like a drowning mans she felt them still the quivering features choked voice and trembling lip all these recoiled with double force upon her mind they touched her far more than sobs and tears would have done her sexs ready signs of shallow grief two tears stole down her cheeks if he would but go home and forget me she glanced hastily back david was climbing up a tree active as a cat he is like nobody elsehe he stay is that to see the last of methe very last poor soul madman how will this end what can come of it but misery to him remorse to me this is love she half closed her eyes and smiled repeating this is love oh how i despise all the others and their feeble flatteries heaven forgive me my mad my wicked wish i am beloved i am adored i am miserable as soon as the carriage was out of sight david came down and hurried from the place he found the pony at the inn the ostler had not even removed his saddle methought that ostler did protest too much david kissed the saddle and the pommels and the bridle her hand had held and led the pony out after walking a mile or two he mounted the pony to sit in her seat not for ease walking thirty miles was nothing to this athlete sticking on and holding on with his chin on his knee was rather fatiguing meantime eve walked on till she was four miles from home no david she sat down and cried a little space then on again she had just reached an angle in the road whenclatter clatterdavid came cantering around with his knee in his mouth eve gave a joyful scream and up went both her hands with sudden delight at the double shock to his senses the pony thought his end was come and perhaps the worlds he shied slap into the hedge and stuck therealone for his rider swaying violently the reverse way the girths burst the saddle peeled off the ponys back and david sat griping the pommel of the saddle in the middle of the road at eves feet looking up in her face with an uneasy grin while dust rose around him in a little column eve screeched and screeched and screeched then fell to with a face as red as a turkeycocks and beat david furiously and hurther little hands david laughed this incident did him goodshook him up a bit the pony groveled out of the ditch and cantered home squeaking at intervals and throwing his heels david got up hoisted the side saddle on to his square shoulders and keeping it there by holding the girths walked with eve toward font abbey she was now a little ashamed of her apprehensions and besides when she leathered david she was in her own mind serving him out for both frights at all events she did not scold him but kindly inquired his adventures and he told her what he had done and said and what miss fountain had said the account disappointed eve all this is just a pack of nothing said she it is two lovers parting or it is two common friendly acquaintances all depends on how it was done and that you dont tell me then she put several subtle questions as to the looks and tones and manner of the young lady david could not answer them on this she informed him he was a fool so i begin to think said he there be quiet said she and let me think it over ay ay said he while he was being quiet and letting her think a carriage came rapidly up behind them with a horseman riding beside it and as the pedestrians drew aside an ironical voice fell upon them and the carriage and horseman stopped and floured them with dust messrs talboys and fountain took a stroll to look at the new jail that was building in royston and as they returned talboys whose wounded pride had now fermented told mr fountain plainly that he saw nothing for it but to withdraw his pretensions to miss fountain my own feelings are not sufficiently engaged for me to play the uphill game of overcoming her disinclination disinclination the mere shyness of a modest girl if she was to be won unsought she would not be worthy to be mrs talboys her worth is indisputable said mr talboys but that is no reason why i should force upon her my humble claims the moment his friends pride began to ape humility fountain saw the wound it had received was incurable he sighed and was silent opposition would only have set fire to opposition they went home together in silence on the road talboys caught sight of a tall gentleman carrying a sidesaddle and a little lady walking beside him he recognized his bete noir with a grim smile here at least was one he had defeated and banished from the fair what on earth was the man doing oh he had been giving his sister a ride on a donkey and they had met with an accident mr talboys was in a humor for revenge so he pulled up and in a somewhat bantering voice inquired where was the steed oh he is in port by now said david do you usually ease the animal of that part of his burden sir no said david sullenly eve who hated mr talboys and saw through his sneers bit her lip and colored but kept silence but mr talboys unwarned by her flashing eye proceeded with his ironical interrogatory and then it was that eve reflecting that both these gentlemen had done their worst against david and that henceforth the battlefield could never again be font abbey decided for revenge she stepped forward like an airy sylph between david and his persecutor and said with a charming smile i will explain sir mr talboys bowed and smiled the reason my brother carries this sidesaddle is that it belongs to a charming young ladyyou have some little acquaintance with hermiss fountain miss fountain cried talboys in a tone from which all the irony was driven out by eves coup she begged david to ride her pony home she would not trust him to anybody else oh said talboys stupefied well sir owing totoan accident the saddle came off and the pony ran home so then david had only her saddle to take care of for her why we escorted miss fountain to royston and we never saw mr dodd ay but you did not go beyond royston said eve with a cunning air beyond royston where and what was he doing there did he go all that way to take her orders about her pony said talboys bitterly oh as to that you must excuse me sir cried eve with a scornful laugh that is being too inquisitive goodmorning and she carried david off in triumph the next moment mr talboys spurred on followed by the phaeton talboys face was yellow la langue dune femme est son epee sheer off and repair damages you lubber said david dryly and dont come under our guns again or we shall blow you out of the water hum eve wasnt your tongue a little too long for your teeth just now not an inch she might be vexed it is not for me to boast of her kindness temper wont let a body see everything ill tell you what i have done tooive declared war have you then run the jack up to the mizzentop and let us fight it out that is the way to look at it david now dont you speak to me till we get home let me think at the gate of font abbey they parted and eve went home david came to the stable yard and hailed stable ahoy out ran a little bandylegged groom the craft has gone adrift cried david but ive got the gear safe stow it away and as he spoke he chucked the saddle a distance of some six yards on to the bandylegged groom who instantly staggered back and sank on a little dunghill and there sat saddled with two eyes like saucers looking stupefied surprise between the pommels it is you for capsizing in a calm remarked david with some surprise and went his way well eve have you thought yes david i was a little hasty that puppy would provoke a saint after all there is no harm done they cant hurt us much now it is not here the game will be played out now tell me when does your ship sail it wants just five weeks to a day does she take up her passengers at as usual yes eve yes and mrs bazalgette lives within a mile or two of you have a good excuse for accepting her invitation stay your last week in her house there will be no talboys to come between you do all a man can do to win her in that week i will and if she says no be man enough to tear her out of your heart i cant tear her out of my heart but i will win her i must win her i cant live without her a month to wait mr talboys well sir what do you say now mr fountain hypocritically i say that your sagacity was superior to mine forgive me if i have brought you into a mortifying collision to be defeated by a merchant sailor he paused to see the effect of his poisoned shaft talboys but i am not defeated i will not be defeated it is no longer a personal question for your sake for her sake i must save her from a degrading connection i will accompany you to mrs bazalgettes when shall we go well not immediately it would look so odd the old one would smell a rat directly suppose we say in a months time very well i shall have a clear stage yes and i shall then use all my influence with her hitherto i have used none thank you mr dodd cannot penetrate there i conclude of course not then she will be mrs talboys of course she will lucy sighed a little over davids ardent despairing passion and his pale and drawn face her womans instinct enabled her to comprehend in part a passion she was at this period of her life incapable of feeling and she pitied him he was the first of her admirers she had ever pitied she sighed a little then fretted a little then reproached herself vaguely i must have been guilty of some imprudencegiven some encouragement have i failed in womanly reserve or is it all his fault he is a sailor sailors are like nobody else he is so simpleminded he sees no doubt that he is my superior in all sterling qualities and that makes him forget the social distance between him and me and yet why suspect him of audacity poor fellow he had not the courage to say anything to me after all no he will go to sea and forget his folly before he comes back then she had a gust of egotism it was nice to be loved ardently and by a hero even though that hero was not a gentleman of distinction scarcely a gentleman at all the next moment she blushed at her own vanity next she was seized with a sense of the great indelicacy and unpardonable impropriety of letting her mind run at all upon a person of the other sex and shaking her lovely shoulders as much as to say away idle thoughts she nestled and fitted with marvelous suppleness into a corner of the carriage and sank into a sweet sleep with a red cheek two wet eyelashes and a halfsmile of the most heavenly character imaginable and so she glided along till at five in the afternoon the carriage turned in at mr bazalgettes gates lucy lifted her eyes and there was quite a little group standing on the steps to receive her and waving welcome to the universal pet there was mr bazalgette mrs bazalgette and two servants and a little in the rear a tall stranger of gentlemanlike appearance the two ladies embraced one another so rapidly yet so smoothly and so dovetailed and blended that they might be said to flow together and make one in all but color like the saone and the rhone after half a dozen kisses given and returned with a spirit and rapidity from which if we male spectators of these ardent encounters were wise we might slyly learn a lesson aunt bazalgette suddenly darted her mouth at lucys ear and whispered a few words with an animation that struck everybody present lucy smiled in reply after the meeting of the muslins mr bazalgette shook hands warmly and at last lucy was introduced to his friend mr hardie who expressed in courteous terms his hopes that her journey had been a pleasant one the animated words mrs bazalgette whispered into lucys ear at that moment of burning affection were as follows you have had it washed lucy unpacking her things in her bedroom who is mr hardie dear what dont you know mr hardie is the great banker only a banker i should have taken him for something far more distinguished his manner is good there is a suavity without feebleness or smallness mrs bazalgettes eye flashed but she answered with apparent nonchalance i am glad you like him you will take him off my hands now and then he must not be neglected bazalgette would murder us apropos remind me to ask him to tell you mr hardies story and how he comes to be looked up to like a prince in this part of the world though he is only a banker with only ten thousand a year you make me quite curious aunt cannot you tell me me oh dear no paper currency foreign loans government securities gold mines ten per cents mr peel and why one breaks and another doesnt all that is quite beyond me bazalgette is your man i had no idea your mousselinedelame would have washed so well why it looks just out of the shop it come away reader for heavens sake chapter xi the man whom mr bazalgette introduced so smoothly and offhand to lucy fountain exercised a terrible influence over her life as you will see by and by this alone would make it proper to lay his antecedents before the reader but he has independent claims to this notice for he is a principal figure in my work the history of this remarkable mans fortune is a study the progress of his mind is another and its past as well as its future are the very cornerstone of that capacious story which i am now building brick by brick after my fashion where the theme is large i invite my reader therefore to resist the natural repugnance which delicate minds feel to the ring of the precious metals and for the sake of the coming story to accompany me into an old bank the hardies were goldsmiths in the seventeenth century and when that business split and the deposit and billofexchange business went one way and the plate and jewels another they became bankers from father to son a peculiarity attended them they never broke nor even cracked jew james hardie conducted for many years a smooth unostentatious and lucrative business it professed to be a bank of deposit only and not of discount this was not strictly true there never was a bank in creation that did not discount under the rose when the paper represented commercial effects and the indorsers were customers and favorites but mr hardies main business was in deposits bearing no interest it was of that nature known as the legitimate banking business a title not i think invented by the customers since it is a system destitute of that reciprocity which is the soul of all just and legitimate commercial relations you shall lend me your money gratis and i will lend it out at interest such is legitimate bankingin the opinion of bankers this system whose decay we have seen and whose death my young readers are like to see flourished under old hardie greenas the public in whose pockets its roots were buried country gentlemen and noblemen and tradesmen welltodo left floating balances varying from seven five three thousand pounds down to a hundred or two in his hands his art consisted in keeping his countenance receiving them with the air of a person conferring a favor and investing the bulk of them in government securities which in that day returned four and five per cent as he did not pay one shilling for the use of the capital he pocketed the whole interest a small part of the aggregate balance was not invested but remained in the bank coffers as a reserve to meet any accidental drain it was a point of honor with the squires and rectors who shared their incomes with him in a grateful spirit never to draw their balances down too low and more than once in this bankers career a gentleman has actually borrowed money for a month or two of the bank at four per cent rather than exhaust his deposit or in other words paid his debtor interest for the temporary use of his own everlasting property such capitalists are not to be found in our day they may reappear at the millennium the banker had three clerks one a youth and very subordinate the other two steady old men at good salaries who knew the affairs of the bank but did not chatter them out of doors because they were allowed to talk about them to their employer and this was a vent the tongue must have a regular vent or random explosionschoose besides the above compliment paid to years of probity and experience the ancient regime bound these men to the interest and person of their chief by other simple customs now no more at each of the four great festivals of the church they dined with mr and mrs hardie and were feasted and cordially addressed as equals though they could not be got to reply in quite the same tone they were never scorned but a peculiar warmth of esteem and friendship was shown them on these occasions one reason was the oldfangled banker himself aspired to no higher character than that of a man of business and were not these clerks men of business good and true his staff not his menials and since i sneered just now at a vital simplicity let me hasten to own that here at least it was wise as well as just and worthy where men are forever handling heaps of money it is prudent to fortify them doubly against temptationwith selfrespect and a sufficient salary it is one thing not to be led into temptation accident on which half the virtue in the world depends another to live in it and overcome it and in a bank it is not the conscience only that is tempted but the senses piles of glittering gold amiable as hesperian fruit heaps of silver paper that seem to whisper as they rustle think how great we are yet see how little we are fifteen thousand pounds yet we can go into your pocket whip us up and westward ho if you have not the courage for that at all events wet your finger a dozen of us will stick to it that pen in your hand has but to scratch that book there and who will know besides you can always put us back you know hundreds and thousands of men take a share in the countrys public morality legislate build churches and live and die respectable who would be jailbirds sooner or later if their sole income was the pay of a bankers clerk and their eyes and hands and souls rubbed daily against hundredpound notes as his do i tell you it is a temptation of fortydevil power not without reason then did this ancient banker bestow some respect and friendship on those who tempted daily brought their hands pure christmas after christmas to their masters table not without reason did mrs hardie pet them like princes at the great festivals and always send them home in the carriage as persons their entertainers delighted to honor herein i suspect she looked also womanlike to their security for they were always expected to be solemnly not improperly intoxicated by the end of supper no wise fuddled but muddled for the graceful superstition of the day suspected severe sobriety at solemnities as churlish and ungracious the bank itself was small and grave and a trifle dingy and bustle there was none in it but if the stream of business looked sluggish and narrow it was deep and quietly incessant and tended all one wayto enrich the proprietor without a farthing risked old hardie had sat there forty years with other peoples money overflowing into his lap as it rolled deep and steady through that little countinghouse when there occurred or rather recurred a certain phenomenon which comes with some little change of features in a certain cycle of commercial changes as regularly as the month of march in the year or the neaptides or the harvest moon but strange to say at each visit takes the country by surprise chapter xii the nation had passed through the years of exhaustion and depression that follow a long war its health had returned and its elastic vigor was already reviving when two remarkable harvests in succession and an increased trade with the american continent raised it to prosperity one sign of vigor the roll of capital was wanting speculation was fast asleep the government of the day seems to have observed this with regret a writer of authority on the subject says that to stir stagnant enterprise they directed the bank of england to issue about four millions in advances to the state and in enlarged discounts i give you the mans words they doubtless carry a signification to you though they are jargon in a fog to me some months later the government took a step upon very different motives which incidentally had a powerful effect in loosening capital and setting it in agitation they reduced to four per cent the navy five per cents a favorite national investment which represented a capital of two hundred millions now when men have got used to five per cent from a certain quarter they cannot be content with four particularly the small holders so this reduction of the navy five per cents unsettled several thousand capitalists and disposed them to search for an investment a flattering one offered itself in the nick of time considerable attention had been drawn of late to the mineral wealth of south america and one or two mining companies existed but languished in the hands of professed speculators the public now broke like a sudden flood into these hitherto sluggish channels of enterprise and up went the shares to a high premium almost contemporaneously numerous jointstock companies were formed and directed toward schemes of internal industry the small capitalists that had sold out of the navy five per cents threw themselves into them all and being bona fide speculators drew hundreds in their train adventure however was at first restrained in some degree by the state of the currency it was low and rested on a singularly sound basis mr peels currency bill had been some months in operation by its principal provision the bank of england was compelled on and after a certain date to pay gold for its notes on demand the bank anticipating a consequent rush for gold had collected vast quantities of sovereigns the new coin but the rush never came for a mighty simple reason gold is convenient in small sums but a burden and a nuisance in large ones it betrays its presence and invites robbers it is a bore to lug it about and a fearful waste of golden time to count it men run upon gold only when they have reason to distrust paper but mr peels bill instead of damaging bank of england paper solidified it and gave the nation a just and novel confidence in it thus then the large hoard of gold fourteen to twenty millions that the caution of the bank directors had accumulated in their coffers remained uncalled for but so large an abstraction from the specie of the realm contracted the provincial circulation the small business of the country moved in fetters so low was the metal currency the country bankers petitioned government for relief and government listening to representations that were no doubt supported by facts and backed by other interests tampered with the principle of mr peels bill and allowed the country bankers to issue pound and pound notes for eleven years to come to this step there were but six dissentients in the house of commons so little was its importance seen or its consequences foreseen this piece of inconsistent legislation removed one restraint irksome but salutary from commercial enterprise at a moment when capital was showing some signs of a feverish agitation its immediate consequences were very encouraging to the legislator the country bankers sowed the land broadcast with their small paper and this for the cause above adverted to took pro tem the place of gold and was seldom cashed at all except where silver was wanted on this enlargement of the currency the arms of the nation seemed freed enterprise shot ahead unshackled and unwonted energy and activity thrilled in the veins of the kingdom the rise in the prices of all commodities which followed inevitable consequence of every increase in the currency whether real or fictitious was in itself adverse to the working classes but the vast and numerous enterprises that were undertaken some in the country itself some in foreign parts to which english workmen were conveyed raised the price of labor higher still in proportion so no class was out of the sun mens faces shone with excitement and hope the dormant hordes of misers crept out of their napkins and sepulchral strongboxes into the warm air of the golden time the masons chisel chirped all over the kingdom and the shipbuilders hammers rang all round the coast corn was plenty money became a drug labor wealth and poverty and discontent vanished from the face of the land adventure seemed all wings and no lumbering carcass to clog it new jointstock companies were started in crowds as larks rise and darken the air in winter hundreds came to nothing but hundreds stood and of these nearly all reached a premium small in some cases high in most fabulous in some and the ease with which the first calls for cash on the multitudinous shares were met argued the vast resources that had hitherto slumbered in the nation for want of promising investments suited to the variety of human likings and judgments the mind can hardly conceive any species of earthly enterprise that was not fitted with a company oftener with a dozen and with fifty or sixty where the proposed road to metal was direct of these the mines of mexico still kept the front rank but not to the exclusion of european australian and african ore two hundred new vessels are said to have been laid on the stocks in one year in two years new companies were projected that masterpiece of fiction the prospectus diffused its gorgeous light far and near lit up the dark mine and showed the minerals shining and the jewels peeping shone broad over the smiling fields soon to be plowed reaped and mowed by machinery and even illumined the depths of the sea whence the buried treasures of ancient and modern times were about to be recovered by the divingbell company there is a little unlicked anonymuncule going scribbling about whose creed seems to be that a little camel to be known must be examined and compared with other quadrupeds but that the great arts can be judged out of the depths of a pennyaliners inner consciousness and to be rated and ranked need not be compared inter se applying the microscope to the method of the novelist but diverting the glass from the learned judges method in biography the learned historians method in history and the daily chroniclers method in dressing res gestoe for a journal this little addlepate has jumped to a comparative estimate not based on comparison so that all his blindfold vituperation of a noble art is chimera not reasoning it is in fact a retrograde step in science and logic this is to evade the baconian method humble and wise and crawl back to the lazy and selfconfident system of the ancients that kept the world dark so many centuries it is greek versus induction greek ladies is divination by means of an asss skull a pettifoggers skull however will serve the turn provided that pettifogger has been bitten with an insane itch for scribbling about things so infinitely above his capacity as the fine arts avoid this sordid dreamer and follow in letters as in science the baconian method then you will find that all uninspired narratives are more or less inexact and that one and one only fiction proper has the honesty to antidote its errors by professing inexactitude you will find that the historian biographer novelist and chronicler are all obliged to paint upon their data with colors the imagination alone can supply and all do italive or dead you will find that fiction as distinguished from neat mendacity has not one form upon earth but a dozen you will find the most habitually willfully and inexcusably inaccurate with the means of accuracy under its nose that form of fiction called anonymous criticism political and literary the most equivocating perhaps is the imaginavit better known at lincolns inn as the affidavit in the article of exaggeration the mildest and tamest are perhaps history and the novel the boldest and most sparkling is the advertisement but the grandest ablest most gorgeous and plausibly exaggerating is surely the grave commercial prospectus drawn up and signed by potent grave and reverend seniors who fear god worship mammon revere big wigs right or wrong and never read romances one mine was announced with a vein of ore as pure and solid as a tin flagon in another the prospectus offered mixed advantages the ore lay in so romantic a situation and so thick that the eye could be regaled with a heavenly landscape while the foot struck against neglected lumps of gold weighing from two pounds to fifty this put the bolanos mine on its mettle and it announced not mines but mountains of silver here then men might chip metal instead of painfully digging it with this up went the shares till they reached premium tialpuxahua was done at premium anglo mexican pounds paid went to pounds premium united mexican pounds columbian pounds but the real del monte a mine of longer standing on which pounds was paid up went to premium and at a later period for i am not following the actual sequence of events reached the enormous height of premium the prospectus of the equitable loan company lamented in paragraph one the imposition practiced on the poor and denounced the pawnbrokers per cent in paragraph four it promised per cent to its shareholders philanthropy smiled in the heading and avarice stung in the tail no wonder a royal duke and other good names figured in this concern another eloquent sheet appealed to the national dignity should a nation that was just now being intersected by forty canal companies and lighted by thirty gas companies and every life in it worth a button insured by a score of insurance companies dwell in hovels here was a country that after long ruling the sea was now mining the earth and employing her spoils nobly lending money to every nation and tribe that would fight for constitutional liberty should the principal city of so sovereign a nation be a collection of dingy dwellings made with burned clay no let these perishable and ignoble materials give way and london be granite or at least wear a granite frontwith which up went the red granite company a railway was projected from dover to calais but the shares never came into the market the rhine navigation shares were snapped up directly the original holders having no faith in their own paper sold large quantities directly for the account but they had underrated the ardor of the public at settling day the shares were at premium and the sellers found they had made a most original hedge for the hedge is not a daring operation that grasps at large gains it is a timid and cautious maneuver whose humble aim is to lower the figures of possible loss or gain to be ruined by a stroke of caution so shocked the directors sense of justice that they forged new coupons in imitation of the old and tried to pass them off the fraud was discovered a committee sat on it respectables quaked finally a scapegoat was put forward and expelled the stock exchange and with that the inquiry was hushed it would have let too much daylight in on a host of good names in the city and on change at the same time the country threw itself with ardor into transatlantic loans this however was an existing speculation vastly dilated at the period we are treating but created about five years earlier its antecedent history can be dispatched in a few words england is said to be governed by a limited monarchy but in case of a struggle between the two her heart goes more with unlimited republic than with genuine monarchy the spanish colonies in south america found this out and in their long battle for independence came to us for sympathy and cash they often obtained both and in one case something more we lent chili a million at six per cent but we lent her ships bayonets and cochrane gratis this last a gallant and amphibious dragoon went to work in a style the slow spaniard was unprepared for blockaded the coast overawed the royalist party and wrenched the state from the mother country and settled it a republic one of the first public acts of this chilian republic was to borrow a million of us to go on with peru took only half a million at this period colombia during the protracted struggle her independence cost her obtained a sort of carte blanche loan from us at ten per cent we were to deliver the stock in munitions of war as called for which you will observe was selling our loan for at the bottom of all our romance lies business business business her freedom secured the new state accommodated us by taking two millions of per cent stock at in all about ten millions nominal capital eight millions cash crossed the atlantic while we were cool but now that we were heated by three hundred jointstock companies and the fire fanned by seven hundred prospectuses fresh loans were effected with a wider range of territory and on a more important scale brazil now got l in two loans colombia l peru l in two loans mexico l in two loans buenos ayres l and guatemala a state we never heard of till she wanted money took a million and a half besides these there were smaller loans lent not to nations but to tribes so hot was our money in our pockets that we tried pounds on patagonia but the savages could not be got to nail us which was the more to be regretted as we might have done a good stroke with them could have sent the stock out in fishermans boots

not get in nor out and a bare passage had to be cleared by force and fines through a mass of velvet fustian plush silk rags lace and broadcloth that jostled and squeezed each other in the struggle for gain the shopkeeper flung down his scales and off to the sharemarket the merchant embarked his funds and his credit the clerk risked his place and his humble respectability high and low rich and poor all hurried round the exchange like midges round a flaring gaslight and all were to be rich in a day and strange to say all seemed to win and none to lose for nothing was at a discount except toil and selfdenial and the patient industry that makes men rich but not in a day one cold misgiving fell the vast quantities of gold and silver that mexico mined by english capital and machinery was about to pour into our ports would so lower the price of those metals that a heavy loss must fall on all who held them on a considerable scale at their present values in relation to corn land labor and other properties and commodities we must convert our gold was the cry others more rash said this is premature cautiontimidity there is no gold come over yet wait till you learn the actual bulk of the first metallic imports no thank you replied the prudent ones it will be too late then when once they have touched our shores the fall will be rapid so they turned their gold whose value was so precarious into that unfluctuating material paper this solitary fear was soon swallowed up in the general confidence the king congratulated parliament and parliament the king both houses rang with trumpet notes of triumph a few of which still linger in the memories of living men the cotton trade and iron trade were never so flourishing the exports surpassed by millions the highest figure recorded in history the hum of industry was heard throughout the fields joy beamed in every face the country now reaped in honor and repose all it had sown in courage constancy and wisdom our prosperity extended to all ranks of men enhanced by those arts which minister to human comfort and those inventions by which man seems to have obtained a mastery over nature through the application of her own powers but one honorable gentleman informed the commons that distress had vanished from the land and in addressing the throne acknowledged a novel embarrassment such said he is the general prosperity of the country that i feel at a loss how to proceed whether to give precedence to our agriculture which is the main support of the country to our manufactures which have increased to an unexampled extent or to our commerce which distributes them to the ends of the earth finds daily new outlets for their distribution and new sources of national wealth and prosperity the poor ye shall have always with youchimerical evangelist our old bank did not profit by the golden shower mr hardie was old too and the cautious and steady habits of forty years were not to be shaken readily he declined shares refused innumerable discounts and loans upon scrip and invoices and in short was behind the time his bank came to be denounced as a clog on commerce two new banks were set up in the town to oil the wheels of adventure on which he was a drag and hardie fell out of the game he was not so old or cold as to be beyond the reach of mortification and these things stung him one day he said fretfully to old skinner it is hardly worth our while to take down the shutters now for anything we do one afternoon two of his best customers who were now up to their chins in shares came and solicited a heavy loan on their joint personal security hardie declined the gentlemen went out young skinner watched them and told his father they went into the new bank stayed there a considerable time and came out looking joyous old skinner told mr hardie the old gentleman began at last to doubt himself and his system the bank would last my time said he but i must think of my son i have seen many a good business die out because the merchant could not keep up with the times and here they are inviting me to be director in two of their companiesgood mercantile names below me it is very flattering ill write to dick it is just he should have a voice but dear heart at his age we know beforehand he will be for galloping faster than the rest well his old father is alive to curb him it was always the ambition of mr richard hardie to be an accomplished financier for some years past he had studied money at home and abroadscientifically his fathers connection had gained him a footing in several large establishments abroad and there he sat and worked en amateur as hard as a clerk this zeal and diligence in a young man of independent means soon established him in the confidence of the chiefs who told him many a secret he was now in a great london bank pursuing similar studies practical and theoretical he received his fathers letters sketching the rapid decline of the bank and finally a short missive inviting him down to consider an enlarged plan of business during the four days that preceded the young mans visit more than one application came to hardie senior for advances on scrip cargoes coming from mexico and joint personal securities of good merchants that were in the current ventures old hardie now instead of refusing detained the proposals for consideration meantime he ordered five journals daily instead of one sought information from every quarter and looked into passing events with a favorable eye the result was that he blamed himself and called his past caution timidity mr richard hardie arrived and was ushered into the bank parlor after the first affectionate greetings old skinner was called in and in a little pompous goodhearted speech invited to make one in a solemn conference the compliment brought the tears into the old mans eyes mr hardie senior opened showed by the books the rapid decline of business pointed to the rise of two new banks owing to the tight hand he had held unseasonably then invited the other two to say whether an enlarged system was not necessary to meet the times and submitted the last proposals for loans and discounts now sir let me have your judgment after my betters sir was old skinners reply well dick have you formed any opinion on this matter i have sir i am extremely glad of it said the old gentleman very sincerely but with a shade of surprise out with it dick the young man thus addressed by his father would not have conveyed to us the idea of dick his hair was brown there were no wrinkles under his eyes or lines in his cheek but in his manner there was no youth whatever he was tall commanding grave quiet cold and even at that age almost majestic his first sentence slow and firm removed the paternal notion that a cipher or a juvenile had come to the counciltable first sir let me return to you my filial thanks for that caution which you seem to think has been excessive there i beg respectfully to differ with you i am glad of it dick but now you see it is time to relax eh no sir the two old men stared at one another the senile youth proceeded that some day or other our system will have to be relaxed is probable but just now all it wants istightening why dick skinner the boy is mad you cant have watched the signs of the times i have sir and looked below the varnish to the point then dick there is a general proposal to relax our system the boy uses good words skinner dont he and here are six particulars over which you can cast your eye hand them to him skinner i will take things in that order said richard quietly running his eye over the papers there was a moments silence it is proposed to connect the bank with the speculations of the day that is not fairly stated dick it is too broad we shall make a selection we wont go in the stream above ankle deep that is a resolution sir that has been often made but never keptfor this reason you cant sit on dry land and calculate the force of the stream it carries those who paddle in it off their feet and then they must swim with it orsink dick for heavens sake no poetry here nay sir said old skinner remember twas you brought the stream in more fool i flow on thou shining dick only the more figures of arithmetic and the fewer figures of speech you can give old skinner and me the more weight you will carry with us the young man colored a moment but never lost his ponderous calmness i will give you figures in their turn but we were to begin with the general view halfmeasures then are no measures they imply a vacillating judgment they are a vain attempt to make a pound of rashness and a pound of timidity into two pounds of prudence you permit me that figure sir it comes from the summingbook the able man of business fidgets he keeps quiet or carries something out old skinner rubbed his hands these are wise words sir no only clever ones this is booklearning it is the sort of wisdom you and i have outgrown these forty years why at his age i was chokefull of maxims they are good things to read but act proverbs and into the gazette you go my faith in any general position has melted away with the snow of my seventy winters what then if it was established that all adders bite would you refuse to believe his adder would bite you sir dick if a single adder bit me it would go farther to convince me that the next adder would bite me too than if fifty young buffons told me all adders bite the senile youth was disconcerted for a single moment he hesitated the keys that the old man had himself said would unlock his judgment lay beside him on the table he could not help glancing slyly at them but he would not use them before their turn his mind was methodical his will was strong in all things he put his hand in his sidepocket and drew out a quantity of papers neatly arranged tied and indorsed the old men instantly bestowed a more watchful sort of attention on him this gentlemen is a list of the jointstock companies created last year what do you suppose is their number fifty ill be bound mr richard more than that skinner say eighty two hundred and fortythree gentlemen of these some were stillborn but the majority hold the market the capital proposed to be subscribed on the sum total is two hundred and fortyeight millions pheugh skinner the amount actually paid at present chiefly in banknotes is stated at pounds and the balance due at the end of the year on this set of ventures will be pounds or thereabouts the projects of this year have not been collected but they are on a similar scale full a third of the general sum total is destined to foreign countries either in loans or to work mines etc the return for which is uncertain and future all these must come to nothing and ruin the shareholders that way or else must sooner or later be paid in specie since no foreign nation can use our paper but must sell it to the bank of england we stand then pledged to burst like a bladder or to export in a few months thrice as much specie as we possess to sum up if the country could be sold tomorrow with every brick that stands upon it the proceeds would not meet the engagements into which these jointstock companies have inveigled her in the course of twenty months viewed then in gross under the test not of poetry and prospectus but of arithmetic the whole thing is a bubble a bubble uttered both the seniors in one breath and almost in a scream but i am ready to test it in detail let us take three main featuresthe sharemarket the foreign loans and the inflated circulation caused by the provincial banks why do the public run after shares is it in the exercise of a healthy judgment no a cunning bait has been laid for human weakness transferable shares valued at pounds can be secured and paid for by small instalments of pounds or less if then his pound shares rise to pounds each the adventurer can sell at a nominal profit of per cent but a real profit of per cent on his actual investment this intoxicates rich and poor alike it enables the small capitalist to operate on the scale that belongs in healthy times to the large capitalist a beggar can now gamble like a prince his farthings are accepted as counters for sovereigns but this is a distinct feature of all the more gigantic bubbles recorded here too you see is illusory credit on a vast scale with its sure consequence inflated and fictitious values another bit of soap that goes to every bubble in history now for the transatlantic loans i submit them to a simple test judge nations like individuals if you knew nothing of a man but that he had set up a new shop would you lend him money then why lend money to new republics of whom you know nothing but that born yesterday they may die tomorrow and that they are exhausted by recent wars and that where responsibility is divided conscience is always subdivided well said richard well said if a stranger offered you thirty per cent would you lend him your money no for i should know he didnt mean to pay well these foreign negotiators offer nominally five per cent but looking at the price of the stock thirty forty and even fifty per cent yet they are not so liberal as they appear they could afford ninety per cent you understand me gentlemen would you lend to a man that came to you under an alias like a newgate thief cast your eye over this prospectus it is the poyais loan there is no such place as poyais good heavens it is a loan to an anonymous swamp by the mosquito river but mosquito suggests a bite so the vagabonds that brought the proposal over put their heads together as they crossed the atlantic and christened the place poyais and now fools that are not fools enough to lend sixpence to zahara are going to lend pounds to rushes and reeds why richard what are you talking about the air is soft and balmy the climate fructifying the soil is spontaneouswhat does that mean mum mum the water runs over sands of gold why it is a description of paradise and now i think of it is not all this taken from john milton very likely it is written by thieves it seems there are tortoiseshell diamonds pearls in the prospectus but not in the morass it is a good straightforward morass with no pretensions but to great damp but dont be alarmed gentlemen our countrymens money will not be swamped there it will all be sponged up in threadneedle street by the poetic swindlers whose names or aliases you hold in your hand the greek mexican and brazilian loans may be translated from prospectish into english thus at a date when every sovereign will be worth five to us in sustaining shriveling paper and collapsing credit we are going to chuck a million sovereigns into the hellespont five million sovereigns into the gulf of mexico and two millions into the pacific ocean against the loans to the old monarchies there is only this objection that they are unreasonable will drain out gold when gold will be lifeblood which brings me by connection to my third itemthe provincial circulation pray gentlemen do you remember the year for some minutes past a dead silence and a deep absorbed attention had received the young mans words but that quiet question was like a great stone descending suddenly on a silent stream such a noise agitation and flutter the old banker and his clerk both began to speak at once dont we oh lord mr richard dont talk of what do you know about you werent born oh mr richard such a todo sir firms in the gazette seventy banks stopped nearer a hundred mr skinner seventyone stopped in the provinces and a score in london why sir mr richard knows everything whether he was born or not no he doesnt you old goose he doesnt know how you and i sat looking at one another and pretending to fumble and counting out slowly waiting sick at heart for the sack of guineas that was to come down by coach if it had not come we should not have broken but we should have suspended payment for twentyfour hours and i was young enough then to have cut my throat in the interval but it came sirit came and you cried keep the bank open till midnight and when the blackguards heard that and saw the sackful of gold they crept away they were afraid of offending us nobody came anigh us next day banks smashed all round us like glass bottles but hardie co stood and shall stand for ever and ever amen who showed the white feather mr skinner who came creeping and sniveling and took my hand under the counter and pressed it to give me courage and then was absurd enough to make apologies as if sympathy was as common as dirt give me your hand directly you oldhallo god bless you sir god bless you it is all right sir the bank is safe for another fifty years we have got master richard and he has got a head o gemini what a head he has got and the other day playing marbles yes and we are interrupting him with our nonsense go on richard richard had secretly but fully appreciated the folly of the interruption his was a great mind and moved in a sort of pecuniary ether high above the little weaknesses my reader has observed in hardie senior and old skinner being however equally above the other little infirmities of fretfulness and fussiness he waited calmly and proceeded coolly what was the cause of the distress in ah that was the puzzlewasnt it skinner we were never so prosperous as that year the distress came over us like a thunderstorm all in a moment nobody knows the exact cause i beg your pardon sir it is as well known as any point of history whatever some years of prosperity had created a spawn of country banks most of them resting on no basis these had inflated the circulation with their paper a panic and a collapse of this fictitious currency was as inevitable as the fall of a stone forced against nature into the air there were a great many petty banks richard and of course plenty of bad paper i believe you are right the causes of things were not studied in those days as they are now all that we know now sir is to be found in books written long before books books yes sir a book is not dead paper except to sleepy minds a book is a man giving you his best thoughts in his very best words it is only the shallow reader that cant learn life from genuine books ill back him who studies them against the man who skims his fellowcreatures and vice versa a single page of adam smith studied understood and acted on by the statesmen of your day would have averted the panic of i have the paragraph in my notebook he was a great man sir oblige me mr skinner certainly sir certainly should the circulation of paper exceed the value of the gold and silver of which it supplies the place many people would immediately perceive they had more of this paper than was necessary for transacting their business at home and as they could not send it abroad bank paper only passing current where it is issued there would be a run upon the banks to the extent of this superfluous paper richard hardie resumed we were never so overrun with rotten banks as now shoemakers cheesemongers grocers write up bank over one of their windows and deal their rotten paper by the foolscap ream the issue of their larger notes is colossal and renders a panic inevitable soon or late but to make it doubly sure they have been allowed to utter pound and pound notes they have done it and on a frightful scale then to make it trebly sure the just balance between paper and specie is disturbed in the other scale as well as by foreign loans to be paid in gold in the candle was left unsnufled but we have lighted it at both ends and put it down to roast before the year ends every sovereign in the banks of this country may be called on to cash pounds of paperbankpaper sharepaper foolscappaper wastepaper in a small excess of paper over specie had the power to cause a panic and break some ninety banks but our excess of paper is far larger and with that fatal error we have combined foreign loans and three hundred bubble companies here then meet three bubbles each of which unaided secures a panic events revolve gentlemen and reappear at intervals the great french bubble of is here today with the addition of two english tomfooleries foreign loans and pound notes mr law was a great financier mr law was the first banker and the greatest all mortal bankers are his pupils though they dont know it mr law was not a fool his critics are mr law did not commit one error out of six that are attributed to him by those who judge him without reading far less studying his written works he was too sound and sober a banker to admit small notes they were excluded from his system he found france on the eve of bankruptcy in fact the state had committed acts of virtual bankruptcy he saved her with his bank then came his two errors one remedial the other fatal no he created a paper company and blew it up to a bubble when the shares had reached the skies they began to come down like stones by an inevitable law no to save them from their coming fate he propped them with his bank overrating the power of governments and underrating natures he married the mississippi shares at forty times their value to his banknotes by edict what was the consequence the bank paper sound in itself became rotten by marriage nothing could save the sharepaper the bank paper making common cause with it shared its fate had john law let his two tubs each stand on its own bottom the shares would have gone back to what they came fromnothing the bank based as it was on specie backed stoutly by the government and respected by the people for great national services would have weathered the storm and lasted to this day but he tied his rickety child to his healthy child and flung them into a stormy sea and told them to swim together they sank together now observe sir the fatal error that ruined the great financier in is this day proposed to us we are to connect our bank with bubble companies by the double tie of loans and liability john law was sore tempted the mississippi company was his own child as well as the bank love of that popularity he had drunk so deeply egotism and parental partiality combined to obscure that great mans judgment but with us folly stands naked on one side bubbles in handcommon sense and printed experience on the other these six specimen bubbles here are not our children let me see whose they are aliases excepted very good young gentleman very good now it is my turn i have got a word or two to say on the other side the journals which are so seldom agreed are all of one mind about these glorious times account for that how can you know their minds sir by their leading columns those are no clue what do they think one thing and print another why should the independent press do that nonsense why sir because they are bribed to print it but they are not bribed to think it bribed the english press bribed oh not directly like the english freeman oblige me with a journal or two no matter which they are all tarred with the same stick in time of bubble here sir are pounds worth of bubble advertisements yielding a profit of say pounds on this single issue in this one are nearer pounds worth of such advertisements now is it in nature that a newspaper which is a trade speculation should say the word that would blight its own harvest this is the oblique road by which the english press is bribed these leaders are mere echoes of todays advertisement sheet and bidders for tomorrows the world gets worse every day skinner it gets no better replied richard philosophically but richard here is our county member and staid sober men both and both have pledged their honor on the floor of the house of commons to the sound character of some of these companies they have sir but they will never redeem the said honor for they are known to be bribed and not obliquely by those very companies the price current of m p honor in time of bubble ought to be added to the works of arithmetic those two brutuses get pounds apiece per annum for touting those companies down at stephens goes cheaper and more oblique he touts in the same place for a gas company and his house in the square flares from cellar to garret gratis good gracious and he talked of the light of conscience in his very last speech but this cannot apply to all there is the archbishop he cant have sold his name to that company who knows he is over head and ears in debt but the duke he cant have why not he is over head and ears in debt princes deep in debt by misconduct and bishops deep in ditto by ditto are halfhonest needy men and halfhonest needy men are all to be bought and sold like hogs in smithfield especially in time of bubble what is the world come to what it was a hundred years ago i have got one pill left for him skinner here is the chancellor of the exchequer a man whose name stands for caution has pronounced a panegyric on our situation here are his words quoted in this leader now listen we may safely venture to contemplate with instructive admiration the harmony of its proportions and the solidity of its basis what do you say to that i say it is one mans opinion versus the experience of a century besides that is a quotation and may be a fraudulent one no no the speech was only delivered last wednesday we will refer to it mum mum ah here it is the chancellor of the exchequer rose and mum mum ahi am ofopinion thatif upon a fair review of our situation there shall appear to be nothing hollow in its foundation artificial in its superstructure or flimsy in its general results we may safely venture to contemplate with instructive admiration the harmony of its proportions and the solidity of its basis ha ha ha i quite agree with cautious bobby if it is not hollow it may be solid if it is not a gigantic paper balloon it may be a very fine globe and vice versa which vice versa he in his heart suspects to be the truth you see sir the mangled quotation was a swindle like the flimsy superstructures it was intended to prop the genuine paragraph is a fair sample of robinson and of the art of withholding opinion by means of expression but as quoted by a fraudulent suppression of one half the unbalanced half is palmed off as a whole and an indecision perverted into a decision i might just as fairly cite him as describing our situation to be hollow in its basis artificial in its superstructure flimsy in its general result since you value names i will cite you one man that has commented on the situation not like mr robinson by misty sentences each neutralizing the other but by consistent acts a man gentlemen whose operations have always been numerous and courageous in less prosperous times yet now he is out of everything but a single insurance company who is the gentleman it is not a gentleman it is a blackguard said the exact youth you excite my curiosity who is the capitalist then that stands aloof nathan meyer rothschild the devil old skinner started sitting rothschild hanging back oh master for heavens sake dont let us try to be wiser than those devils of jews mr richard i bore up pretty well against your booklearning but now youve hit me with a thunderbolt let us get in gold and keep as snug as mice and not lend one of them a farthing to save them from the gallows those jews smell farther than a christian can see dont lets have any more s sir for heavens sake listen to mr richard he has been abroad and come back with a head be quiet skinner you seem to possess private information richard i employ three myrmidons to hunt it it will be useful by and by it may be now remark on these proposals well sir two of them are based on gold mines shares at a fabulous premium now no gold mine can be worked to a profit by a company primo gold is not found in veins like other metals it is an abundant metal made scarce to man by distribution over a wide surface the very phrase gold mine is delusive secundo gold is a metal that cannot be worked to a profit by a company for this reason workmen will hunt it for others so long as the daily wages average higher than the amount of metal they find per diem but that rubicon once passed away they run to find gold for themselves in some spot with similar signs if they stay it is to murder your overseers and seize your mine gold digging is essentially an individual speculation these shares sell at pounds apiece a dozen of them are not worth one dutch tuliproot ah here is a company of another class in which you have been invited to be director they would have given you shares and made you liable mr richard consulted his notebook this company which commands the wealth of both indiesin perspectivedissolved yesterday afternoon for want of eight guineas they had rented offices at eight guineas a week and could not pay the first week turn out or pay said the landlord a brute absorbed in the present and with no faith in the glorious future they offered him pounds worth of shares instead of his paltry eight guineas cash on this he swept his premises of them what a godsend you would have been to these jeremy diddlers you and the ten thousand they would have bled you of the old banker turned pale oh that is nothing new sir tomorrow the first lord of the treasury calls at my house and brings me pounds s d which is due to me from the nation at twelve of the clock on that day you couldnt lend me a shilling till then could ye now for the loans baynes upon haggart want pounds at per cent good names richard surely said old hardie faintly they were but there are no good names in time of bubble the operations are so enormous that in a few weeks a man is hollowed out and his frame left standing in such times capitalists are like filberts they look all nut but half of them are dust inside the shell and only known by breaking baynes upon haggart and haggart upon baynes the city is full of their paper i have brought some down to show it to you a discounter who is a friend of mine did it for them on a considerable scale at thirty per cent discount cast your eye over these bills haggart on baynes but he has burned his fingers even at that and knows it so i am authorized to offer all these to you at fifty per cent discount good heavens richard if therefore you think of doing rotten apple upon rotten pear otherwise haggart upon baynes why do it at five per cent when it is to be had by the quire at fifty take them out of my sight said old hardie starting uptake them all out of my sight thank god i sent for you no more discussion no more doubt give me your hand my son you have saved the bank the conference broke up with these eager words and young skinner retired swiftly from the keyhole the next day mr hardie senior came to a resolution which saddened poor old skinner he called the clerks in and introduced them to mr richard as his managing partner every dog has his day said the old gentleman mine has been a long one richard has saved the bank from a fatal error richard shall conduct it as hardie son dont be disconsolate skinner ill look in on you now and then hardie junior sent back all the proposals with a polite negative he then proceeded on a twoheaded plan not to lose a shilling when the panic he expected should come and to make pounds upon its subsiding hardie son held exchequer bills on rather a large scale they were at half a crown premium he sold every one and put gold in his coffers he converted in the same way all his other securities except consols these were low and he calculated they would rise in any general depreciation of more pretentious investments he drew out his balance a large one from his london correspondent and put his gold in his coffers he drew a large deposit from the bank of england whenever his own notes came into the bank he withdrew them from circulation they may hop upon hardie son said he but they shant run upon us for ill cut off their legs and keep them in my safe one day he invited several large tradesmen in the town to dine with him at the bank they came full of curiosity he gave them a luxurious dinner which pleased them after dinner he exposed the real state of the nation as he understood it they listened politely and sneered silently but visibly he then produced six large packets of his banknotes each packet contained pounds skinner then present enveloped these packets in cartridgepaper and the guests were requested to seal them up this was soon done in those days a bunch of gigantic seals dangled and danced on the pit of every mans stomach the sealed packets went back into the safe show us a sparkle o gold mr richard said meredith linendraper and wag mr skinner oblige me by showing mr meredith a little of your speciea few antibubble pills eh mr meredith omnes ha ha ha presently a shout from meredith boys he has got it here by the bushel all new sovereigns dont any of ye be a linendraper if you have got a chance to be a banker how much is there here mr richard we must consult the books to ascertain that sir must you then just turn your head away mr richard and ill put in a claw omnes haw haw ho richard hardie resumed my precautions seem extravagant to you now but in a few months you will remember this conversation and it will lead to business the rest of the evening he talked of anything everything except banking he was not the man to dilute an impression hardie junior was so confident in his reading and his reasonings that he looked every day into the journals for the signs of a general collapse of paper and credit instead of which public confidence seemed to increase not diminish and the paper balloon as he called it dilated not shrank and this went on for months his gold lay a dead and useless stock while paper was breeding paper on every side of him he suffered his share of those mortifications which every man must look to endure who takes a course of his own and stems a human current he sat somber and perplexed in his bank parlor doing nothing his clerks mended pens in the office the national calamity so confidently predicted and now so eagerly sighed for came not in other words richard hardie was a sagacious calculator but not a prophet no man is till afterward and then nine out of ten are at last he despaired of the national calamity ever coming at all so then one dark november day an event happened that proved him a shrewd calculator of probabilities in the gross and showed that the records of the past studied instead of skimmed may in some degree counterbalance youth and its narrow experience owing to the foreign loans there were a great many bills out against this country some heavy ones were presented and seven millions in gold taken out of the bank of england and sent abroad this would have trickled back by degrees but the suddenness and magnitude of the drain alarmed the bank directors for the safety of the bank subject as it was by mr peels bill to a vast demand for gold up to this period though they had amassed specie themselves they had rather fed the paper fever in the country at large but now they began to take a wide and serious view of the grave contingencies around them they contracted their money operations refused in two cases to discount corn and in a word put the screw on as judiciously as they could but time was up public confidence had reached its culminating point the sudden caution of the bank could not be hidden it awoke prudence and prudence after imprudence drew terror at its heels there was a tremendous run upon the country banks the smaller ones smashed all around like glass bottles as in the larger ones made gigantic and prolonged efforts to stand and generally fell at last many whose books showed assets s in the pound suspended payment for in a violent panic the bank creditors can all draw their balances in a few hours or days but the poor bank cannot put a similar screw on its debtors thus no establishment was safe honor and solvency bent before the storm and were ranked with rottenness and as at the same time the market price of securities sank with frightful rapidity scarcely any amount of invested capital was safe in the unequal conflict exchequer bills went down to s discount and the funds rose and fell like waves in a storm london bankers were called out of church to answer dispatches from their country correspondents the mint worked day and night and coined a hundred and fifty thousand sovereigns per diem for the bank of england but this large supply went but a little way since that firm had in reality to cash nearly all the country notes that were cashed postchaises and four stood like hackneycoaches in lombard street and every now and then went rattling off at a gallop into the country with their golden freight in london at the end of a single week not an old sovereign was to be seen so fiercely was the old coinage swept into the provinces so active were the mint and the smashers these last drove a roaring trade for paper now was all suspected and anything that looked like gold was taken recklessly in exchange soon the storm burst on the london banks a firm known to possess half a million in undeniable securities could not cash them fast enough to meet the checks drawn on their counter and fell next day a house whose very name was a rock suspended for four days an hour or two later two more went hopelessly to destruction the panic rose to madness confidence had no longer a clue nor names a distinction a mans enemies collected three or four vagabonds round his door and in another hour there was a run upon him that never ceased till he was emptied or broken at last as in the ancient battles armies rested on their arms to watch a duel in which both sides were represented the whole town watched a run upon the great house of pole thornton co the bank of england from public motives spiced of course with private interest had determined to support pole thornton co and so perhaps stem the general fury for all things have their turningpoint three hundred thousand pounds were advanced to pole co who with this aid and their own resources battled through the week but on saturday night were drained so low that their fate once more depended on the bank of england another large sum was advanced them they went on but ere the next week ended they succumbed and universal panic gained the day climax of all the bank of england notes lost the confidence of the public and a frightful run was made on it the struggle had been prepared for and was gigantic on both sides here the great hall of the bank full of panicstricken citizens jostling one another to get gold for the notes of the bank there foreign nations sending over ingots and coin to the bank and the mint working night and day sunday and weekday to turn them into sovereigns to meet the run sovereigns or else halfsovereigns were promptly delivered on demand no hesitation or sign of weakness peeped out but under this bold and prudent surface dismay sickness of heart and the dread of a great humiliation at last one dismal evening this establishment which at the beginning of the panic had twenty millions specie left off with about five hundred thousand pounds in coin and a similar amount in bullion a large freight of gold was on the seas coming to their aid and due but not arrived the wind was high and in a few hours the people would be howling round their doors again they sent a hasty message to the government and implored them to suspend by order in council the operation of mr peels bill for a few days a plump negative from mr canning then being driven to expedients they bethought them of a chest of pound notes that they had luckily omitted to burn another message to the government may we use these as a temporary expedient yes the onepound notes were whirling all over the country before daybreak and marvelous anomaly which took richard hardie by surprise they oiled the waves the panic abated from that hour the holders of country notes took the pound b e notes as cash with avidity the very sight of them piled on a counter stopped a run in more than one city the demand for gold at the bank of england continued but less fiercely and as the ingots still came tumbling in and the mint hailed sovereigns on them their stock of specie rose as the demand declined and they came out of their fiercest battle with honor but ere the tide turned things in general came to a pass scarcely known in the history of civilized nations ladies and gentlemen took heirlooms to the pawnbrokers and swept their tills of the last coin not only was wild speculation hitherto so universal and ardent snuffed out like a candle but investment ceased and commerce came to a standstill bank stock east india stock and some days consols themselves did not go down they went out were blotted from the book of business no man would give them gratis no man would take them on any other terms the brokers closed their books there were no buyers nor sellers trade was coming to the same pass except the retail business in eatables and an observant statesman and economist that watched the phenomenon pronounced that in fortyeight hours more all dealings would have ceased between man and man or returned to the rude and primitive form of barter or direct exchange of mens several commodities labor included finally things crept into their places shades of distinction were drawn between good securities and bad shares were forfeited companies dissolved bladders punctured balloons flattened bubbles burst and thousands of families ruinedthousands of people beggaredand the nation itself its paper fever reduced by a severe bleeding lay sick panting exhausted and discouraged for a year or two to await the eternal cycletorpor prudence health plethora bloodletting torpor prudence health plethora bloodletting etc etc etc etc in secula seculorum the journals pitched into speculation three banks lay in the dust in the town of and hardie son stood looking calmly down upon the ruins richard hardie had carried out his doubleheaded plan there was no run upon himcould not be one in the course of nature his balances were so low and his notes were all at home he created artificially a run of a very different kind he dined the same party of tradesmenall but one who could not come being at supper after polonius his fashion after dinner he showed the packets still sealed and six more unsealed here gentlemen is our whole issue there was a huge wood fire in the oldfashioned room he threw a packet of notes into it a most respectable grocer yelled and lost color victim of his senses he thought sacred money was here destroyed and his host a wellbred and oh how plausible maniac the others derided him and packet after packet fed the flames when two only were left containing about five thousand pounds between them hardie junior made a proposal that they should advertise in their shop windows to receive hardies fivepound notes as five guineas in payment for their goods observing a natural hesitation he explained that they would by this means crush their competitors and could easily clap a price on their goods to cover the odd shillings the bargain was soon struck mr richard was a great man all his guests felt in their secret souls and pocketsexcuse the tautologythat some day or other they should want to borrow money of him besides crush their competitors next day mr richard loosed his hand and let a flock of his own banknotes fly they were asked for earnestly every day some soon found their way to the shops in question the next day still more took wing and buzzed about the shops presently other tradesmen finding people rushed to the shops in question began to bid against them for hardies notes a result the longheaded youth had expected and said notes went up to ten shillings premium too calm and cold to be betrayed into deserting his principles he confined the issue within the bounds he had prescribed and when they were all out seldom saw one of them again by this means he actually lowered the bank of england notes in public estimation and set his own high above them in the town of deposits came in confidence unparalleled took the place of fear so far as he was concerned and he was left free to work the other part of his plan to the amazement and mystification of old skinner he laid out ten thousand pounds in exchequer bills and followed this up by other large purchases of paper paper nothing but paper hardie senior was nervous are you true to your own theory richard the youth explained to him that blind confidence always ends in blind distrust and then all paper becomes depreciated alike but good paper is sure to recover sixtytwo shillings discount sir is a ridiculous decline of exchequer bills we are at peace and elastic and the government is strong my other purchases all rest upon certain information carefully and laboriously amassed while the world was so busy blowing bubbles i am now buying paper that is unjustly depreciated in panic ie in the second act of that mania of which bubble is the first act he added when the herd buy the price rises when they sell it falls to buy with them and sell with them is therefore to buy dear and sell cheap my gameand it is a game that reduces speculation to a certaintyis threefold first never at any price or under any temptation buy anything that is not as good as gold secondly buy that sound article when the herd sells it thirdly sell it when the herd buys it richard said the old man i see what it isyou are a genius no it is no use your denying it richard common sense sir common sense yes but common sense carried to such a height as you do is genius well sir then i own to the genius of common sense i admire you richardi am proud of you but the bank has stood one hundred and forty years and never a genius in it the old man sighed hardie senior having relieved his mind of this vague misgiving never returned to itprobably never felt it again it was one of those strange flashes that cross a mind as a meteor the sky the old gentleman having little to do talked more than heretofore and like fathers talked about his son and unlike sons cried him up at his own expense the world is not very incredulous above all it never disbelieves a man who calls himself a fool having then gained the public ear by the artifice of selfdepreciation he poured into it the praises of hardie junior he went about telling how he an old man was all but bubbled till this young daniel came down and foretold all thus paternal garrulity combined for once with a mans own ability to place richard hardie on the pinnacle of provincial grandeur a few years more and hardie senior died his old clerk skinner followed him a month later richard hardie now sole partner and proprietor assumed a mode of living unknown to his predecessors he built a large commodious house and entertained in the first style the best families in the neighborhood visited a man whose manner was quiet and stately his income larger than their own and his house and table luxurious without vulgar pretensions and the redhot gilding and glare with which the injudicious parvenu brands himself and furniture the bank itself put on a new face twice as much glass fronted the street and a skylight was let into the ceiling there were five clerks instead of three the new ones at much smaller salaries than the pair that had come down from antiquity chapter xiii such was mr hardie at twentyfive and his townspeople said if he is so wise now he is a boy what in heavens name will he be at forty to sixty the provincial imagination did not attempt to follow his wisdom he was now past thirty and behind the scenes of his bank was still the able financier i have sketched but in society he seemed another man there his characteristics were quiet courtesy imperturbability a suave but impressive manner vast information on current events and no flavor whatever of the shop he had learned the happy art which might be called the barristers art hoc agendi of throwing the whole man into a thing at one time and out of it at another in the bank and in his own study he was a devout worshiper of mammon in society a courteous polished intelligent gentleman always ready to sift and discuss any worthy topic you could start except finance there was some affectation in the cold and immovable determination with which he declined to say three words about money but these great men act habitually on a preconceived system this gives them their force if lucy fountain had been one of those empty girls that were so rife at the time the sterling value of his conversation would have disgusted her and his calm silence where there was nothing to be said sure proof of intelligence would have passed for stupidity with her but she was intelligent well used to bungling straightforward flattery and to smile with arch contempt at it and very capable of appreciating the more subtle but less satirical compliment a man pays a pretty girl by talking sense to her and as it happened her foible favored him no less than did her strong points she attached too solid a value to manner and mr hardies manner was to her fancy male perfection it added to him in her estimation as much as david dodds defects in that kind detracted from the value of his mind and heart to this favorable opinion mr hardie responded in full he had never seen so graceful a creature nor so young a woman so courteous and highbred he observed at once what less keen persons failed to discover that she was seldom spontaneous or off her guard he admired her the more he had no sympathy with the infantine in man or woman she thinks before she speaks said he with a note of admiration on the other hand he missed a trait or two the young lady possessed for they happened to be virtues he had no eye for but the sum total was most favorable in short it was esteem at first sight as a cobweb to a cabbagenet so fine was mrs bazalgettes reticulation compared with uncle fountains she invited mr hardie to stay a fortnight with her commencing just one day before lucys return she arranged a round of gayety to celebrate the double event what could be more simple yet there was policy below the whirl of pleasure was to make lucy forget everybody at font abbey to empty her heart and pave mrs bs candidates way to the vacancy then she never threw mr hardie at lucys head contenting herself with speaking of him with veneration when lucy herself or others introduced his name she was always contriving to throw the pair together but no mortal could see her hand at work in it bref a shespider the first day or two she watched her niece on the sly just to see whether she regretted font abbey or in other words mr talboys well acquainted with all the subtle signs by which women read one another she observed with some uneasiness that lucy appeared somewhat listless and pensive at times when left quite to herself once she found her with her cheek in her hand and by the way the young lady averted her head and slid suddenly into distinct cheerfulness suspected there must have been tears in her eyes but could not be positive next she noticed with satisfaction that the round of gayety including as it did morning rides as well as evening dances dissipated these little reveries and languors she inferred that either there was nothing in them but a sort of sediment of ennui the natural remains of a visit to font abbey or that if there was anything more it had yielded to the active pleasures she had provided and to the ladys easy temper and love of society the only thing she loves or ever will said mrs b assuming prophecy aunt how superior mr hardies conversation is he interests one in topics that are unbearable generally politics now i thought i abhorred them but i find it was only those little paltry whig and tory squabbles that wearied me mr hardies views are neither whig nor tory they are patriotic and sober and largeminded he thinks of the country i can take some interest in what he calls politics and pray what is that well aunt the liberation of commerce from its fetters for one thing i can contrive to be interested in that because i know england can be great only by commerce then the education of all classes because without that england cannot be enlightened or good he never says a word to me about such things said mrs bazalgette i suppose he thinks they are above poor me she delivered this with so admirable an imitation of pique that the courtier was deceived and applied butter to a foxs wound oh no aunt consider if that was it he would not waste them on me who am so inferior to you in sagacity more likely he says this young lady has not yet completed her education i will sprinkle a little good sense among her frivolous accomplishments whatever the motive i am very much obliged to mr hardie a man of sense is so refreshing afterfull stop what do you think of his voice his voice i dont remember anything about it yes you doyou must it is a very remarkable one so mellow so quiet yet so modulated well i do remember now it is rather a pleasant voicefor a man rather a pleasant voice repeated lucy opening her eyes why it is a voice to charm serpents ha ha it has not charmed him one yet you see this speech was not in itself pellucid but these sweet ladies among themselves have so few topics compared with men and consequently beat their little manor so often that they seize a familiar idea under any disguise with the rapidity of lightning oh charmers are charmproof replied lucy that is the only reason why i am sure of that then she reflected awhile it is his natural voice is it not did you ever hear him speak in any other think never then he must be a good man apropos is mr hardie a good man aunt why of course he is how do you know i never heard of any scandal against him oh i dont mean your negative goodness you never heard anything against me out of doors well and are you not a good girl me aunt why you know i am not bless me what have you done i have done nothing aunt exclaimed lucy and the good are never nullities then i am not open which is a great fault in a character but i cant help it i cant i cant well you need not break your heart for that you will get over it before you have been married a year look at me i was as shy as any of you at first going off but now i can speak my mind and a good thing too or what would become of me among the selfish set meaning me dear no divide it among you come this is idle talk mens voices and whether they are good bad or indifferent as if that mattered a pin provided their incomes are good and their manners endurable i want a little serious conversation with you do you and lucy colored faintly with all my heart we go to the hunts ball the day after tomorrow lucy i suppose you know that now what on earth am i to wear that is the question there is no time to get a new dress made and i have not got one that you have not worn at least once some of them twice and three times and the b looked aghast at the state of nudity to which she was reduced lucy sidled toward the door since you consult me dear i advise you to wear what i mean to wear myself ah what a capital idea then we shall pass for sisters i dare say i have got some old thing or other that will match yours but you had better tell me at once what you do mean to wear a gown a pair of gloves and a smirk and with this heartless expression of nonchalance lucy glided away and escaped the impending shower oh the selfishness of these girls cried the deserted one i have got her a husband to her taste so now she runs away from me to think of him the next moment she looked at the enormity from another point of view and then with this burst of injured virtue gave way to a steady complacency she is caught at last she notices his very voice she fancies she cares for politicsha ha she is gone to meditate on himcould not bear any other topicwould not even talk about dress a thing her whole soul was wrapped up in till now i have known her to go on for hours at a stretch about it there are people with memories so constructed that what they said and another did not contradict or even answer seems to them upon retrospect to have been delivered by that other person and received in dead silence by themselves meantime lucy was in her own room and the door bolted so she was the next day and uneasy mrs bazalgette came hunting her and tapped at the door after first trying the handle which in lucys creed was not a discreet and polished act nobody admitted here till three oclock it is me lucy so i conclude said lucy gayly me must call again at three whoever it is not i said aunt bazalgette and flounced off in a pet at three dignity dissolved in curiosity and mrs bazalgette entered her nieces room in an illtemper it vanished like smoke at the sight of two new dresses peachcolored and glacees just finished lying on the bed an eager fire of questions where did you get them which is mine who made them a new dressmaker ah what a godsend to poor us who is she let me see how you like her work before i tell you try this one on mrs bazalgette tried on her dress and was charmed with it lucy would not try on hers she said she had done so and it fitted well enough for her everything fits you you witch replied the b i must have this womans address she is an angel lucy looked pleased she is only a beginner but desirous to please you and zeal goes farther than talent says mr dodd mr dodd ah bytheby that reminds mei am so glad you mentioned his name where does the woman live the woman or as some consider her the girl lives at present with a charming person called by the world mrs bazalgette but by the dressmaker her sweet little aunt kiss kiss kiss and lucy whose natural affection for this lady was by a certain law of nature heated higher by working day and night for her in secret felt a need of expansion and curled round her like a serpent with a doves heart mrs bazalgette did what you and i manly reader should have been apt to omit she extricated herself not roughly yet a little hastilylike a watersnake gliding out of the other sweet serpents folds sacred dress being present she deemed caresses frivolousand illtimed there there let me alone child and tell me all about it directly what put it into your head who taught you is this your first attempt have you paid for the silk or am i to do tell me quick dont keep me on thorns here flashes on the cultivated mind the sprightly couplet oh that i had my mistress at this bay to kiss and clip metill i run away shakespearevenus and adonis lucy answered this fusillade in detail you know aunt dressmakers bring us their failures and we by our hints get them made into successes so we do so i said to myself now why not bring a little intelligence to bear at the beginning and make these things right at once well i bought several books and studied them and practiced cutting out in large sheets of brown paper first next i ventured a small flighti made jane a gown what your servant yes i had a double motive first attempts are seldom brilliant and it was better to fail in merino and on jane than on you madam and in silk in the next place jane had been giving herself airs and objecting to do some work of that kind for me so i thought it a good opportunity to teach her that dignity does not consist in being disobliging the poor girl is so ashamed now she comes to me in her merino frock and pesters me all day to let her do things for me i am at my wits end sometimes to invent unreal distresses like the writers of fiction you know and aunty dear you will not have to pay for the stuff to tell you the real truth i overheard mr bazalgette say something about the length of your last dressmakers bill and as i have been very economical at font abbey i found i had eighteen pounds to spare so i said nothing but i thought we will have a dress apiece that nobody shall have to pay for eighteen pounds these two lovely dresses lace trimmings and all for eighteen pounds yes aunt so you see those good souls that make our dresses have imposed upon us without ceremony they would have been twentyfive pounds apiece now would they not at least well you are a clever girl i might as well try on yours as you wont do dear she tried on lucys gown and as before got two lookingglasses into a line twisted and twirled and inspected herself north south east and west and in an hour and a half resigned herself to take the dress off lucy observed with a sly smile that her gayety declined and she became silent and pensive in the dead of the night when with labor oppressed all mortals enjoy the sweet blessing of rest a phantom stood at lucys bedside and fingered her she awoke with a violent scream the first note of which pierced the nights dull ear but the second sounded like a wail from a well being uttered a long way under the bedclothes hush dont be a fool cried the affectionate phantom and kneaded the uncertain form through the bedclothes fancy screeching so at sight of me then gradually a single eye peeped timidly between two white hands that held the sheets ready for defense like a shield bbbut you are all in white gulped lucy trembling all over for her delicate fibers were set quivering and could not be stilled by a word fingered at midnight all in a moment by a shape why what color should i bein my nightgown snapped the specter what color is yours and she gave lucy a little angry pulland everybody elses but at the dead of night aunt and without any warningits terrible oh dear another little gulp in the throat exceeding pretty lucy be yourself said the specter severely you used not to be so selfish as to turn hysterical when your aunt came to you for advice lucy had to do a little forgive blessed shade she apologized crushed down her obtrusive egotistical tremors and vibrated to herself placable aunt bazalgette accepted her excuses and opened the business that brought her there i didnt leave my bed at this hour for nothing you may be sure nno aunt lucy continued mrs bazalgette deepening there is a weight on my mind up sat lucy in the bed and two sapphire eyes opened wide and made terror lovely oh aunt what have you been doing it is remorse then that will not let you sleep ah i see your flirtationsyour flirtationsthis is the end of them my flirtations cried the other in great surprise i never flirt i only amuse myself with them in strict grammar this them ought to refer to flirtations but lucys aunt did not talk strict grammar does yours youneverflirt oh oh oh mr christopher mr horne sir george healey mr mdonnell mr wolfenton mr vaughanthere oh and mr dodd well at all events its not for any of those fools i get out of my bed at this time of night i have a weight on my mind so do be serious if you can lucy i tried all yesterday to hide it from myself but i cannot succeed what dear aunt that your gown fits me ever so much better than my own she sighed deeply lucy smiled slyly but she replied is not that fancy no lucy no was the solemn reply i have tried to shut my eyes to it but i cant so it seems ha ha now do be serious it is no laughing matter how unfortunate i am not at all take my gown i can easily alter yours to fit me if necessary oh you good girl how clever you are i should never have thought of that n bshe had been thinking of nothing else these six hours go to bed dear and sleep in peace said lucy soothingly leave all to me no i cant leave all to you now i am to have yours i must try it on it was hers now so her confidence in its fitting was shaken mrs bazalgette then lighted all the candles in the sconces and opened lucys drawers and took out linen and put on the dress with lucys aid and showed lucy how it fitted and was charmed like a child with a new toy presently lucy interrupted her raptures by an exclamation mrs bazalgette looked round and there was her niece inspecting the ghostly robe which had caused her such a fright here are oceans of yards of lace on her very nightgrown cried lucy well does not every lady wear lace on her nightgown was the tranquil reply what is that on yours pray a little misery of valenciennes an inch broad but this is mechlinsuperb delicious well aunt you are a sincere votary of the graces you put on fine things because they are fine things not with the hollow motive of dazzling society you wear mechlin not for eclat but for mechlin alas how few like you pursue quite the same course in the dark that they do in the worlds eye dont moralize dear unhook me after breakfast mrs bazalgette asked lucy how long she could give her to choose which of the two gowns to take after all till eight oclock mrs bazalgette breathed again she had thought herself committed to no and no was beginning to look lovely in consequence at eight the choice being offered her with impenetrable nonchalance by lucy she took lucys without a moments hesitation and sailed off gayly to her own room to put it on in which progress the ample peachcolored silk held out in both hands showed like cleopatras foresail and seemed to draw the dame along lucy too was happydemurely for in all this business the female novice la ruse sans le savoir had outwitted the veteran lucy had measured her whole aunt so she made dress a for her but told her she was to have dress b this at once gave her desires a perverse bent toward her own property the last direction they could have been warped into by any other means and so she was deluded to her good and fitted to a hair soul and body going to the ball one cloud darkened for an instant the matrons mind i am so afraid they will see it only cost nine pounds enfant replied lucy aetat at the ball mr hardie and lucy danced together and were the most admired couple the next day mr hardie announced that he was obliged to curtail his visit and go up to london mrs bazalgette remonstrated mr hardie apologized and asked permission to make out the rest of his visit on his return mrs b accorded joyfully but lucy objected aunt dont you be deluded into any such arrangement mr hardie is liable to another fortnight we have nothing to do with his mismanagement he comes to spend a fortnight with us he tries but fails i am sorry for mr hardie but the engagement remains in full force i appeal to you mr bazalgette you are so exact i dont see myself how he can get out of it with credit said bazalgette solemnly i am happy to find that my duty is on the side of my inclination said mr hardie he smiled well pleased and looked handsomer than ever they all missed him more or less but nobody more than lucy his conversation had a peculiar charm for her his knowledge of current events was unparalleled then there was a quiet potency in him she thought very becoming in a man and then his manner he was the first of our unfortunate sex who had reached beau ideal one was harsh another finicking a third loud a fourth enthusiastic a fifth timid and all failed in tact except mr hardie then other male voices were imperfect they were too insignificant or too startling too bass or too treble too something or too other mr hardies was a mellow tenor always modulated to the exact tone of good society like herself too he never laughed loud seldom out and even his smiles like her own did not come in unmeaning profusion so they told when they did come the bazalgettes led a very quiet life for the next fortnight for mrs bazalgette was husbanding invitations for mr hardies return mrs bazalgette yawned many times during this barren period but with considerate benevolence she shielded lucy from ennui lucy was a dressmaker gifted but inexperienced well then she would supply the latter deficiency by giving her an infinite variety of alterations to make in a multitude of garments there are egotists who charge for tuition but she would teach her dear niece gratis a mountain of dresses rose in the drawingroom a dozen metamorphoses were put in hand and a score more projected she pulled down she built up she rounded the angular and squared the round and here mr bazalgette took perverse views and misbehaved he was a very honest man but not a refined courtier he seldom interfered with these ladies one way or other except to provide funds which interference was never snubbed for was he not master of the house in that sense but having observed what was going on day after day in the drawingroom or workshop he walked in and behaved himself like a brute how much a week does she give you lucy said he looking a little red lucy opened her eyes in utter astonishment and said nothing her very needle and breath were suspended mrs bazalgette shrugged her shoulders to lucy but disdained words mr bazalgette turned to his wife i have often recommended economy to you jane i need not say with what success but this sort of economy is not for your credit or mine if you want to add a dressmaker to your staffwith all my heart send for one when you like and keep her to all eternity but this young lady is our ward and i will not have her made a servant of for your convenience put your work down dear said mrs bazalgette resignedly he does not understand our affection nor anything else except pounds shillings and pence oh yes i do i can see through varnished selfishness for one thing you certainly ought to be a judge of the unvarnished article retorted the lady having had it constantly under my eyes these twenty years rejoined the gentleman oh aunt oh mr bazalgette cried lucy rising and clasping her hands if you really love me never let me be the cause of a misunderstanding or an angry word between those i esteem it would make me too miserable and dear mr bazalgette you must let people be happy in their own way or you will be sure to make them unhappy my aunt and i understand one another better than you do she understands you my poor girl not so well as i do her but she knows i hate to be idle and love to do these bagatelles for her it is my doing from the first not hers she did not even know i could do it till i produced two dresses for the hunts ball so you see that is another matter all ladies play at work but you are in for three months hard labor look at that heap of vanity she is making a ladysmaid of you it is unjust it is selfish it is improper it is not for my credit of which i am more jealous than coquettes are of theirs besides lucy you must not think because i dont make a parade as she does that i am not fond of you i have a great deal more real affection for you than she has and so you will find if we are ever put to the test at this last absurdity mrs bazalgette burst out laughing but la rusee sans le savoir turned toward the speaker and saw that he spoke with a certain emotion which was not ordinary in him she instantly went to him with both hands gracefully extended i do think you have an affection for me if you really have show it me some other way and not by making me unhappy well then i will lucy look here if solomon was such a fool as to argue with one of you young geese you would shut his mouth in a minute there i am going but you will always be the slave of one selfish person or other you were born for it thus impotently growling the merchant prince retired from the field escorted with amenity by the courtier in the passage she suddenly dropped forward like a cypresstree and gave him her forehead to kiss he kissed it with some little warmth and confided to her in friendly accents that she was a fool and off he went grumbling inarticulately to his foreign loans and things the courtier returned to smooth her aunt in turn but that lady stopped her with a lofty gesture my plan is to look on these monstrosities as horrid dreams and go on as if nothing had happened happy philosophy lucy acquiesced with a smile and in an instant both immortal souls plunged and disappeared in silk satin feathers and point lace the afternoon post brought letters that furnished some excitement mr hardie announced his return and captain kenealy accepted an invitation that had been sent to him two days before but this was not all mrs bazalgette with something between a laugh and a crow handed lucy a letter from mr fountain in which that diplomatic gentleman availed himself of her kind invitation and with elephantine playfulness proposed as he could not stay a month with her to be permitted to bring a friend with him for a fortnight this friend had unfortunately missed her through absence from his countryhouse at the period of her visit to font abbey and had so constantly regretted his ill fortune that he fountain had been induced to make this attempt to repair the calamity his friends name was talboys he was a gentleman of lineage and in his numerous travels had made a collection of foreign costumes which were really worth inspecting and if agreeable to mrs bazalgette he should send them on before by wagon for no carriage would hold them lucy colored on reading this letter for it repeated a falsehood that had already made her blush the next moment remembering how very keenly her aunt must be eying her and reading her she looked straight before her and said coldly uncle fountain ought to be welcome here for his courtesy to you at font abbey but i think he takes rather a liberty in proposing a stranger to you rather a liberty say a very great liberty well then aunt why not write back that any friend of his would be welcome but that the house is full you have only room for uncle fountain but that is not true lucy said mrs bazalgette with sudden dignity lucy was staggered and abashed at this novel objection recovering she whined humbly but it is very nearly true it was plain lucy did not want mr talboys to visit them this decided mrs bazalgette to let his dresses and him come he would only be a foil to mr hardie and perhaps bring him on faster her decision once made on the above grounds she conveyed it in characteristic colors no my love where i give my affection there i give my confidence i have your word not to encourage this gentlemans addresses so why hurt your uncles feelings by closing my door to his friend it would be an ill compliment to you as well as to mr fountain he shall come her postscript to mr fountain ran thus your friend would have been welcome independently of the foreign costumes but as i am a very candid little woman i may as well tell you that now you have excited my curiosity he will be a great deal more welcome with them than without them and here i own that i the simpleminded should never have known all that was signified in these words but for the comment of john fountain esq it is all right talboys said he my bait has taken you must pack up these gimcracks at once and send them off or shell smile like a marble satan in your face and stick you full of pins and needles the next day mr bazalgette walked into the room haughtily overlooked the pyramid of dresses and asked lucy to come downstairs and see something she put her work aside and went down with him and lo two poniesa creamcolored and a bay oh you loves cried the virgin passionately and blushed with pleasure her heart was very accessibleto quadrupeds now you are to choose which of these you will have oh mr bazalgette have you forgotten what you told me try and make me happy some other way says you now i remembered hearing you say what a nice pony you had at font abbey so i sent a capable person to collect ponies for you these have both a reputation which will you have dear good kind uncle bazalgette they are ducks let us hope not a ducks paces wont suit you if you are as fond of galloping as other young ladies come jump up and see which is the best brute of the two what without my habit well get your habit on then let us see how quick you can be off ran lucy and soon returned fully equipped she mounted the ponies in turn and rode them each a mile or two in short distances finally she dismounted and stood beaming on the steps of the hall the groom held the ponies for final judgment the bay is rather the best goer dear said she timidly miss fountain chooses the bay tom no uncle i was going to ask you if i might have the creamcolored one he is so pretty ha ha ha heres a little goose why they are to ride not to wear come i see you are in a difficulty take them both to the stable tom no no no cried lucy oh mr bazalgette dont tempt me to be so wicked then she put both her fingers in her ears and screamed take the bay darling out of my sight and leave the creamcolored love and as she persisted in this order with her fingers in her ears and an inclination to stamp with her little feet the bay disappeared and color won the day then she dropped suddenly like a cypress toward mr bazalgette which meant you can kiss me this time it was her cheek she proffered all glowing with exercise and innocent excitement captain kenealy was the first arrival a wellappointed soldier eyes equally bright under calm and excitement mustache always clean and glossy power of assent prodigious he looked so warlike and was so inoffensive that he was in great request for miles and miles round the garrison town of the girls at first introduction to him admired him and waited palpitating to be torn from their mammas and carried half by persuasion half by force to their conquerors tent but after a bit they always found him out and talked before and at and across this ornament as if it had been a bronze mars or a mustachetipped shadow this the men viewing from a little distance envied the gallant captain and they might just as well have been jealous of a hairdressers dummy one eventful afternoon mrs bazalgette and miss fountain walked out taking the gallant captain between them as escort reginald hovered on the rear kenealy was charmingly equipped and lent the party a luster if he did not contribute much to the conversation he did not interrupt it for the ladies talked through him as if he had been a column of red air sing muse how often kenealy said yaas that afternoon on second thoughts dont i can weary my readers without celestial aid toot toot toot went a cheerful horn and the mailcoach came into sight round a corner and rolled rapidly toward them lucy looked anxiously round and warned master reginald of the danger now impending over infants the terrible child went instantly on the vitantes stulti vitia principle clean off the road altogether into the ditch and clayed not pipe his trousers to the knee as the coach passed a gentleman on the box took off his hat to the ladies and made other signs it was mr hardie mrs bazalgette proposed to return home to receive him they were about a mile from the house they had not gone far before the rearguard intermitted blackberrying for an instant and uttered an eldrich screech then proclaimed another coach another coach it was a light break coming gently along with two showy horses in it and a pony trotting behind at one and the same moment lucy recognized a fourfooted darling and the servant recognized her he drew up touched his hat and inquired respectfully whether he was going right for mr bazalgettes mrs bazalgette gave him directions while lucy was patting the pony and showering on him those ardent terms of endearment some ladies bestow on their lovers but this one consecrated to her trustees and quadrupeds in the break were saddles and a sidesaddle and other caparisons and a giant box the ladies looked first at it and then through kenealy at one another and so settled what was inside that box they had not walked a furlong before a travelingcarriage and four horses came dashing along and heads were put out of the window and the postboys ordered to stop mr talboys and mr fountain got out and the carriage was sent on introductions took place mrs bazalgette felt her spirits rise like a veterans when line of battle is being formed she was one of those ladies who are agreeable or disagreeable at will she decided to charm and she threw her enchantment over messrs fountain and talboys coming with hostile views and therefore guilty consciences they had expected a cold welcome they received a warm gay and airy one after a while she maneuvered so as to get between mr fountain and captain kenealy and leave lucy to mr talboys she gave her such a sly look as she did it it implied you will have to tell me all he says to you while we are dressing mr talboys inquired who was captain kenealy he learned by her answer that that officer had arrived today and she had no previous acquaintance with him whatever little embarrassment lucy might feel remembering her equestrian performance with mr talboys and its cause she showed none she began about the pony and how kind of him it was to bring it and yet said she if i had known i would not have allowed you to take the trouble for i have a pony here mr talboys was sorry for that but he hoped she would ride his now and then all the same oh of course my pony here is very pretty but a new friend is not like an old friend mr talboys was gratified on more accounts than one by this speech it gave him a sense of security she had no friend about her now she had known as long as she had him and those three months of constant intimacy placed him above competition his mind was at ease and he felt he could pop with a certainty of success and pop he would too without any unnecessary delay the party arrived in great content and delectation at the gates that led to the house stay said mrs bazalgette you must come across the way all of you here is a view that all our guests are expected to admire those that cry out charming beautiful oh i never we take them in and make them comfortable those that wont or cant ejaculate you put them in damp beds said mr fountain only half in jest worse than that sirwe flirt with them and disturb the placid current of their hearts forever and ever dont we lucy you know best aunt said lucy half malice half pout the others followed the gay lady and when the view burst ejaculated to order but mr fountain stood ostentatiously in the middle of the road with his legs apart like him of rhodes i choose the alternative cried he sooner than pretend i admire sixteen plowed fields and a hill as much as i do a lawn and flowerbeds i elect to be flirted and my what do ye call emmy stagnant currentturned into a whirlpool ere the laugh had well subsided caused by this imitation of hercules and his choice he struck up again good news for you young gentleman i smell a ball here is a fiddlecase making for this hospitable mansion no said mrs bazalgette i never ordered any musician to come here a tall but active figure came walking light as a feather with a large carpetbag on his back a boy behind carrying a violincase lucy colored and lowered her eyes but never said a word the young man came up to the gate and then mr talboys recognized him he hesitated a single moment then turned and came to the group and took off his hat to the ladies it was david dodd chapter xiv the new guests manner of presenting himself with his stick over his shoulder and his carpetbag on his back subjected him to a battery of stares from kenealy talboys fountain and abashed him sore this lasted but a moment he had one friend in the group who was too true to her flirtations while they endured and too strongwilled to let her flirtee be discouraged by mortal why it is mr dodd cried she with enthusiasm and she put forth both hands to him the palms downward with a smiling grace surely you know mr dodd said she turning round quickly to the gentlemen with a smile on her lip but a dangerous devil in her eye the mistress of the house is allpowerful on these occasions messrs talboys and fountain were forced to do the amiable raging within lucy anticipated them but her welcome was a cold one says mrs bazalgette tenderly and why do you carry that heavy bag when you have that great stout lad with you i think it is his business to carry it not yours and her eyes scathed the boy fiddle and all all the time she was saying this david was winking to her and making faces to her not to go on that tack his conduct now explained his pantomime here youngster said he you take these things indoors and here is your halfcrown lucy averted her head and smiled unobserved as soon as the lad was out of hearing david continued it was not worth while to mortify him the fact is i hired him to carry it but bless you the first mile he began to go down by the head and would have foundered so we shifted our cargoes this amused kenealy who laughed goodhumoredly on this david laughed for company there cried his inamorata with rapture that is mr dodd all over thinks of everybody high or low before himself there was a grunt somewhere behind her her quick ear caught it she turned round like a thing on a pivot and slapped the nearest face it happened to be fountains so she continued with such a treacle smile dont you remember sir how he used to teach your cub mathematics gratis the sweet smile and the keen contemporaneous scratch confounded mr fountain for a second as soon as he revived he said stiffly we can all appreciate mr dodd having thus established her adonis on a satisfactory footing she broke out all over graciousness again and smiling and chatting led her guests beneath the hospitable roof but one of these guests did not respond to her cheerful strain the norman knight was full of bitterness mr talboys drew his friend aside and proposed to him to go back again the senior was aghast dont be so precipitate was all that he could urge this time confound the fellow yes if that is the man she prefers to you i will go home with you tomorrow and the vile hussy shall never enter my doors again in this mind the pair went devious to their dressingrooms one day a witty woman said of a man that he played the politician about turnips and cabbages that might be retorted by a snob and brute on her own sex in general and upon mrs bazalgette in particular this sweet lady maneuvered on a carpet like marlborough on the south of france she was brimful of resources and they all tended toward one sacred object getting her own way she could be imperious at a pinch and knock down opposition but she liked far better to undermine it dissolve it or evade it she was too much of a woman to run straight to her jeleveux so long as she could wind thitherward serpentinely and by detour she could have said to mr hardie you will take down lucy to dinner and to mr dodd you will sit next me but no she must mold her malesas per sample to mr fountain she said your friend i hear is of old family came in with the conqueror madam then he shall take me down that will be the first step toward conquering meha ha fountain bowed well pleased to mr hardie she said will you take down lucy today i see she enjoys your conversation observe how disinterested i am hardie consented with twinkling composure before dinner she caught kenealy drew him aside and put on a long face i am afraid i must lose you today at dinner mr dodd is quite a stranger and they all tell me i must put him at his ease yaas well then you had better get next lucy as you cant have me yaas and captain kenealy you are my aiddecamp it is a delightful post you know and rather a troublesome one yaas you must help me be kind to this sailor yaas he is a good fellaa carried the baeg for the little caed oh did he and didnt maind been laughed at now that shows how intelligent you must be said the wily one the others could not comprehend the trait well you and i must patronize him merit is always so dreadfully modest yaas this arrangement was admirable but human consequently not without a flaw uncle fountain was left to chance like the flying atoms of epicurus and chance put him at bazalgettes right hand save one from this point his inquisitive eye commanded david dodd and mrs bazalgette and raked lucy and her neighbors who were on the opposite side of the table people who look bent on seeing everything generally see something item it is not always what they would like to see as they retired to rest for the night mr fountain invited his friend to his room we shall not have to go home i have got the key to our antagonist young dodd is her lover talboys shook his head with cool contempt what i mean is that she has invited him for her own amusement not her nieces i never saw a woman throw herself at any mans head as she did at that sailors all dinner her very husband saw it he is a cool hand that bazalgette he only grinned and took wine with the sailor he has seen a good many go the same roadsoldiers sailors tinkers tai talboys interrupted him i really must call you to order you are prejudiced against poor mrs bazalgette and prejudice blinds everybody politeness required that she should show some attention to her neighbor but her principal attention was certainly not bestowed on mr dodd fountain was surprised on whom then well to tell the truth on your humble servant fountain stared i observed she did not neglect you but when she turned to dodd her face puckered itself into smiles like a bag i did not see it and i was nearer her than you said talboys coldly but i was in front of her yes a mile off there being no jurisconsult present to explain to these two magistrates that if fifty people dont see a woman pucker her face like a bag and one does see her p h f l a b the affirmative evidence preponderates they were very near coming to a quarrel on this grave point it was fountain who made peace he suddenly remembered that his friend had never been known to change an opinion well said he let us leave that we shall have other opportunities of watching dodd and her meantime i am sorry i cannot convince you of my good news for i have some bad to balance it you have a rival and he did not sit next mrs bazalgette pray may i ask whom he did sit next sneered talboys he satlike a man who meant to winby the girl herself oh then it is that singsong captain you fear sir drawled talboys no sir no more than i dread the epergne try the other side what mr hardie why he is a banker and a rich one she would never marry a banker perhaps not if she were uninfluenced but we are not at talboys court or font abbey now we have fallen into a den of parvenues that hardie is a great catch according to their views and all mrs bazalgettes influence with lucy will be used in his favor i think not she spoke quite slightingly of him to me did she then that puts the matter quite beyond doubt why should she speak slightingly of him bazalgette spoke to me of him with grave veneration he is handsome well behaved and the girl talked to him nineteen to the dozen mrs bazalgette could not be sincere in underrating him she undervalued him to throw dust in your eyes it is not so easy to throw dust in my eyes i dont say it is but this woman will do it she is as artful as a fox she hoodwinked even me for a moment i really did not see through her feigned politeness in letting you take her down to dinner you mistake her character entirely she is coquettish and not so wellbred as her niece but artful she is not in fact there is almost a childish frankness about her at this stroke of observation fountain burst out laughing bitterly talboys turned pale with suppressed ire and went on doggedly you are mistaken in every particular mrs bazalgette has no fixed views for her niece and i by no means despair of winning her to my side she is anything but discouraging fountain groaned mr hardie is a new acquaintance and miss fountain told me herself she preferred old friends to new she looked quite conscious as she said it in a word mr dodd is the only rival i have to feargoodnight and he went out with a stately wave of the hand like royalty declining farther conference mr fountain sank into an armchair and muttered feebly goodnight there he sat collapsed till his friends retiring steps were heard no more then springing wildly to his feet he relieved his swelling mind with a long loud articulated roar of anglosaxon fool dolt coxcomb noodle puppy ass did ye ever read tully de amicitia david dodd was saved from misery by want of vanity his reception at the gate by miss fountain was cool and constrained but it did not wound him for the last month life had been a blank to him she was his sun he saw her once more and the bare sight filled him with life and joy his was naturally a sanguine contented mind some lovers equally ardent would have seen more to repine at than to enjoy in the whole situation not so david she sat between kenealy and hardie but her presence filled the whole room and he who loved her better than any other had the best right to be happy in the place that held her he had only to turn his eyes and he could see her what a blessing after a month of vacancy and darkness this simple idolatry made him so happy that his heart overflowed on all within reach he gave mrs bazalgette answers full of kindness and arch gayety combined he charmed an old married lady on his right his was the gay the merry end of the table and others wished themselves up at it after the ladies had retired his narrative powers bonhomie and manly frankness soon told upon the men and peals of genuine laughter echoed up to the very drawingroom bringing a deputation from the kitchen to the keyhole and irritating the ladies overhead who sat trickling faint monosyllables about their three little topics lucy took it philosophically now those are the good creatures that are said to be so unhappy without us it was a weight off their minds when the door closed on our retiring formsha ha it was a restraint taken off them my dear said mrs mordan a starched dowager stiffening to the naked eye as she spoke when they laugh like that they are always saying something improper oh the wicked things replied lucy mighty calmly i wish i knew what they are saying said eagerly another young lady then added oh and blushed observing her error mirrored in all eyes lucy the clement instructed her out of the depths of her own experience in impropriety they swear that is what mrs mordan means and so to the piano with dignity presently in came messrs fountain and talboys mrs bazalgette asked the former a little crossly how he could make up his mind to leave the gay party downstairs oh it was only that fellow dodd the dog is certainly very amusing but theres metal more attractive here coffee and tea were fired down at the other gentlemen by way of hints but dodd prevailed over all and it was nearly bedtime when they joined the ladies mr talboys had an hour with lucy and no rival by to ruffle him next day a ridingparty was organized mr talboys decided in his mind that kenealy was even less dangerous than hardie so lent him the quieter of his two nags and rode a hot rampageous brute whose very name was lucifer so that will give you an idea the grooms had driven him with a kickingstrap and two pair of reins and even so were reluctant to drive him at all but his steady companion had balanced him a bit lucy was to ride her old pony and mrs bazalgette the new the horses came to the door one of the grooms offered to put lucy up talboys waved him loftily back and then strange as it may appear david for the first time in his life saw a gentleman lift a lady into the saddle lucy laid her right hand on the pommel and resigned her left foot mr talboys put his hand under that foot and heaved her smoothly into the saddle that is clever thought simple david that chap has got more pith in his arm than one would think they cantered away and left him looking sadly after them it seemed so hard that another man should have her sweet foot in his hand should lift her whole glorious person and smooth her sacred dress and he stand by helpless and then the indifference with which that man had done it all to him it had been no sacred pleasure no great privilege a sense of loneliness struck chill on david as the clatter of her ponys hoofs died away he was in the house but in that house was a sort of inner circle of which she was the center and he was to be outside it altogether liable to great wrath upon great occasions he had little of that small irritability that goes with an egotistical mind and feminine fiber so he merely hung his head blamed nobody and was sad in a manly way while he leaned against the portico in this dejected mood a little hand pulled his coattail it was master reginald who looked up in his face and said timidly will you play with me the fact is mr reginalds natural audacity had received a momentary check he had just put this same question to mr hardie in the library and had been rejected with ignominy and recommended to go out of doors for his own health and the comfort of such as desired peaceable study of british and foreign intelligence that i will my little gentleman said david if i know the game oh i dont care what it is so that it is fun what is your name david dodd oh and what is yours what dontyouknow why reginald george bazalgette i am seven i am the eldest i am to have more money than the others when papa dies jane says i wonder when he will die when he does you will lose his love and that is worth more than his money so you take my advice and love him dearly while you have got him oh i like papa very well he is goodnatured all day long mamma is so illtempered till dinner and then they wont let me dine with her and then as soon as mamma has begun to be goodtempered upstairs in the drawingroom my bedtime comes directly its abominable the last word rose into a squeak under his sense of wrong david smiled kindly so it seems we all have our troubles said he what have you any troubles and reginald opened his eyes in wonder he thought size was an armor against care not so many as most folk thank god but i have some and david sighed why if i was as big as you id have no troubles id beat everybody that troubled me and i would marry lucy directly and at that beloved name my lord falls into a reverie ten seconds long david gave a start and an ejaculation rose to his lips he looked down with comical horror upon the little chubby imp who had divined his thought mr reginald soon undeceived him she is to be my wife you know dont you think she will make a capital one before david could decide this point for him the kaleidoscopic mind of the terrible infant had taken another turn come into the stableyard ill show you tom cried young master enthusiastically finally david had to make the boy a kite when made it took two hours for the paste to dry and as every ten minutes spent in waiting seemed an hour to one of mr reginalds kidney as the english classics phrase it he was almost in a state of frenzy at last and flew his new kite with yells but after a bit he missed a familiar incident it doesnt tumble down my other kites all tumble down more shame for them said david with a dash of contempt and explained to him that tumbling down is a flaw in a kite just as foundering at sea is a vile habit in a ship and that each of these descents however picturesque to childhoods eye implies a construction originally derective or some little subsequent mismanagement it appeared by reginalds retort that when his kite tumbled he had the tumultuous joy of flying it again but by its keeping the air like this monotony reigned so he now proposed that his new friend should fasten the string to the pumphandle and play at ball with him beneath the kite the goodnatured sailor consented and thus the little voluptuary secured a terrestrial and evervarying excitement while occasional glances upward soothed him with the mild consciousness that there was his property still hovering in the empyrean amid all which poor lovesick david was seized with a desire to hear the name of her he loved and her praise even from these small lips so you are very fond of miss lucy said he yes replied reginald dryly and said no more for it is a characteristic of the awfu bairn to be mute where fluency is required voluble where silence i wonder why you love her so much said david cunningly reginalds face instead of brightening with the spirit of explanation became instantly lackluster and doughlike for be it known to the everlasting discredit of human nature that his affection and matrimonial intentions as they were no secret so they were the butt of satire from grownup persons of both sexes in the house and of various social grades down to the very gardener all had had a fling at him but soon his natural cordiality gained the better of that momentary reserve well ill tell you said he because you have behaved well all day david was all expectation i like her because she has got red cheeks and does whatever one asks her oh breadth of statement why was not david one of your repeaters he would have gone and told lucy i should have liked her to know in what grand primitive colors peachbloom and queenly courtesy strike what mr tennyson is pleased to call the deep mind of dauntless infancy but david dodd was not a reporter and so i dont get my way and how few of us do not even mr reginald whose joyous companionship with david was now blighted by a footman at sight of the coming plush there now cried reginald he anticipated evil for messages from the ruling powers were nearly always adverse to his joys the footman came to say that his master would feel obliged if mr dodd would step into his study a minute david went immediately there now squeaked reginald rising an octave im never happy for two hours together this was true he omitted to add nor unhappy for one the dear child sought comfort in retaliation he took stones and pelted the footmans retiring calves his admirers if any will be glad to learn that this act of intelligent retribution soothed his deep mind a little mr bazalgette had been much interested by davids conversation the last night and hearing he was not with the ridingparty had a mind to chat with him david found him in a magnificent study lined with books and hung with beautiful maps that lurked in mahogany cylinders attached to the wall and you pulled them out by inserting a brasshooked stick into their rings and hauling mr bazalgette began by putting him a question about a distant port to which he had just sent out some goods david gave him full information began seamanlike with the entrance to the harbor and told him what danger his captain should look out for in running in and how to avoid it and from that went to the character of the natives their tricks upon the sailors their habits tastes and fancies and entering with intelligence into his companions business gave him some very shrewd hints as to the sort of cargo that would tempt them to sell the very rings out of their ears succeeding so well in this mr bazalgette plied him on other points and found him full of valuable matter and by a rare union of qualities very modest and very frank now i like this said mr bazalgette cheerfully this is a return to old customs a century or two ago you know the merchant and the captain felt themselves parts of the same stick and they used to sit and smoke together before a voyage and sup together after one and be always putting their heads together but of late the stick has got so much longer and so many knots between the handle and the point that we have quite lost sight of one another here we merchants sit at home at ease and send you fine fellows out among storms and waves and think more of a bale of cotton spoiled than of a captain drowned david and we eat your bread sir as if it dropped from the clouds and quite forget whose money and spirit of enterprise causes the ship to be laid on the stocks and then built and then rigged and then launched and then manned and then sailed from port to port well well if you eat our bread we eat your labor your skill your courage and sometimes your lives i am sorry to say merchants and captains ought really to be better acquainted well sir said david now you mention it you are the first merchant of any consequence i ever had the advantage of talking with the advantage is mutual sir you have given me one or two hints i could not have got from fifty merchants i mean to coin you captain dodd david laughed and blushed i doubt it will be but copper coin if you do but i am not a captain i am only first mate you dont say so why how comes that well sir i went to sea very young but i wasted a year or two in private ventures when i say wasted i picked up a heap of knowledge that i could not have gained on the china voyage but it has lost me a little in length of standing but on the other hand i have been very lucky it is not every one that gets to be first mate at my age and after next voyage if i can only make a little bit of interest i think i shall be a captain no sir i wish i was a captain i never wished it as now and david sighed deeply humph said mr bazalgette and took a note he then showed david his maps david inspected them with almost boyish delight and showed the merchant the courses of ships on eastern and western voyages and explained the winds and currents that compelled them to go one road and return another and in both cases to go so wonderfully out of what seems the track as they do bref the two ends of the mercantile stick came nearer my study is always open to you mr dodd and i hope you will not let a day pass without obliging me by looking in upon me david thanked him and went out innocently unconscious that he had performed an unparalleled feat in the hall he met captain kenealy who having received orders to amuse him invited him to play at billiards david consented out of goodnature to please kenealy thus the whole day passed and les facheux would not let him get a word with lucy at dinner he was separated from her and so hotly and skillfully engaged by mrs bazalgette that he had scarcely time to look at his idol after dinner he had to contest her with mr talboys and mr hardie the latter of whom he found a very able and sturdy antagonist mr hardie had also many advantages over him first the young lady was not the least shy of mr hardie but the parting scene beyond royston had put her on her guard against david and her instinct of defense made her reserved with him secondly mrs bazalgette was perpetually making diversions whose double object was to get david to herself and leave lucy to mr hardie with all this david found to his sorrow that though he now lived under the same roof with her he was not so near her as at font abbey there was a wall of etiquette and of rivals and as he now began to fear of her own dislike between them to read through that mighty transparent jewel a female heart nauta had recourseto what do you think to arithmetic he set to work to count how many times she spoke to each of the party in the drawingroom and he found that mr hardie was at the head of the list and he was at the bottom that might be an accident perhaps this was his black evening so he counted her speeches the next evening the result was the same droll statistics but sad and convincing to the simple david his spirits failed him his aching heart turned cold he withdrew from the gay circle and sat sadly with a book of prints before him and turned the leaves listlessly in a pause of the conversation a sigh was heard in the corner they all looked round and saw david all by himself turning over the leaves but evidently not inspecting them a sort of flash of satirical curiosity went from eye to eye but tact abounded at one end of the room if there was a dearth of it at the other la rusee sans le savoir made a sign to them all to take no notice at the same time she whispered going to sea in a few days for two years the thought will return now and then having said this with a look at her aunt that heaven knows how gave the others the notion that it was to mrs bazalgette she owed the solution of davids fit of sadness she glided easily into indifferent topics so then the others had a momentary feeling of pity for david miss lucy noticed this out of the tail of her eye that night david went to bed thoroughly wretched he could not sleep so he got up and paced the deck of his room with a heavy heart at last in his despair he said ill fire signals of distress so he sat down and took a sheet of paper and fired nothing has turned as i expected she treats me like a stranger i seem to drop astern instead of making any way here are three of us i do believe and all seem preferred to your poor brother and indeed the only thing that gives me any hope is that she seems too kind to be in earnest for it is not in her angelic nature to be really unkind and what have i done eve dear such a change from what she was at font abbey and that happy evening when she came and drank tea with us and lighted our little garden up and won your heart that was always a little set against her now it is so different that i sit and ask myself whether all that is not a dream can anyone change so in one short month i could not but who knows perhaps i do her wrong you know i never could read her at home without your help and dear eve i miss you now from my side most sadly without you i seem to be adrift without rudder or compass then as he could not sleep he dressed himself and went out at four oclock in the morning he roamed about with a heavy heart at last he bethought him of his fiddle since lucys departure from font abbey this had been a great solace to him it was at once a depository and vent to him he poured out his heart to it and by it sometimes he would fancy while he played that he was describing the beauties of her mind and person at others regretting the sad fate that separated him from her or hope reviving would see her near him and be telling her how he loved her and so great an inspirer is love he had invented more than one clear melody during the last month he who up to that time had been content to render the thoughts of others like most fiddlers and composers so he said to himself i had better not play in the house or i shall wake them out of their first sleep he brought out his violin got among some trees near the stableyard and tried to soothe his sorrowful heart he played sadly sweetly and dreamingly he bade the wooden shell tell all the world how lonely he was only the magic shell told it so tenderly and tunefully that he soon ceased to be alone the first arrival was on four legs pepper a terrier with a taste for sounds pepper arrived cautiously though in a state of profound curiosity and being too wise to trust at once to his ears avenue of sense by which we are all so much oftener deceived than by any other he first smelled the musician carefully and minutely all round what he learned by this he and his creator alone know but apparently something reassuring for as soon as he had thoroughly snuffed his orpheus he took up a position exactly opposite him sat up high on his tail cocked his nose well into the air and accompanied the violin with such vocal powers as nature had bestowed on him nor did the sentiment lose anything in intensity at all events by the vocalist if davids strains were plaintive peppers were lugubrious and what may seem extraordinary so long as david played softly the cerberus of the stableyard whined musically and tolerably in tune but when he played loud or fast poor pepper got excited and in his wild endeavors to equal the violin vented dismal and discordant howls at unpleasantly short intervals all this attracted davids attention and he soon found he could play upon pepper as well as the fiddle raising him and subduing him by turns only like the ocean pepper was not to be lulled back to his musical ripple quite so quickly as he could be lashed into howling frenzy while david was thus playing and pepper showing a fearful broadside of ivory teeth and flinging up his nose and sympathizing loudly and with a long face though not perhaps so deeply as he looked suddenly rang behind david a chorus of human chuckles david wheeled and there were six young womens faces set in the foliage and laughing merrily though perfectly aware that david would look round they seemed taken quite by surprise when he did look and with military precision became instantly two files for the four impudent ones ran behind the two modest ones and there by an innocent instinct tied their capstrings which were previously floating loose their custom ever in the early morning play us up something merry sir hazarded one of the mockmodest ones in the rear shant i be taking you from your work objected david dryly oh all work and no play is bad for the body replied the minx keeping ostentatiously out of sight goodnatured david played a merry tune in spite of his heart and even at that disadvantage it was so spiritstirring compared with anything the servants had heard it made them all frisky of which disposition tom the stable boy who just then came into the yard took advantage and leading out one of the housemaids by the polite process of hauling at her with both hands proceeded to country dancing in which the others soon demurely joined now all this was wormwood to poor david for to play merriment when the heart is too heavy to be cheered by it makes that heart bitter as well as sad but the goodnatured fellow said to himself poor things i dare say they work from morning till night and seldom see pleasure but at a distance why not put on a good face and give them one merry hour so he played hornpipes and reels till all their hearts were on fire and faces red and eyes glittering and legs aching and he himself felt ready to burst out crying and then he left off as for il penseroso pepper he took this intrusion of merry music upon his sympathies very ill he left singing and barked furiously and incessantly at these ancient english melodies and at the dancers and kept running from and running at the womens whirling gowns alternately and lost his mental balance and at last having by a happier snap than usual torn off two feet of the underhousemaids frock shook and worried the fragment with insane snarls and gleaming eyes and so zealously that his existence seemed to depend on its annihilation david gave those he had brightened a sad smile and went hastily indoors he put his violin into its case and sealed and directed his letter to eve he could not rest indoors so he roamed out again but this time he took care to go on the lawn nobody would come there he thought to interrupt his melancholy he was doomed to be disappointed in that respect as he sat in the little summerhouse with his head on the table he suddenly heard an elastic step on the dry gravel he started peevishly up and saw a lady walking briskly toward him it was miss fountain she saw him at the same instant she hesitated a single halfmoment then as escape was impossible resumed her course david went bashfully to meet her goodmorning mr dodd said she in the most easy unembarrassed way imaginable he stammered a goodmorning and flushed with pleasure and confusion he walked by her side in silence she stole a look at him and saw that after the first blush at meeting her he was pale and haggard on this she dashed into singularly easy and cheerful conversation with him told him that this morning walk was her custommy substitute for rouge you know i am always the first up in this languid house but i must not boast before you who i dare say turn outis not that the wordat daybreak but now i think of it no you would have crossed my hawse before mr dodd using naval phrases to flatter him it was my illluck i always cruised a mile off i had no idea this bit of gravel was your quarterdeck it is though because it is always dry you would not like a quarterdeck with that character would you oh yes i should id have my bowsprit always wet and my quarterdeck always dry but it is no use wishing for what we cannot have that is very true said lucy quietly david reflected on his own words and sighed deeply this did not suit lucy she plied him with airy nothings that no man can arrest and impress on paper but the tone and smile made them pleasing and then she asked his opinion of the other guests in such a way as implied she took some interest in his opinion of them but mighty little in the people themselves in short she chatted with him like an old friend and nothing more but david was not subtle enough in general nor just now calm enough to see on what footing all this cordiality was offered him his color came back his eye brightened happiness beamed on his face and the lady saw it from under her lashes how fortunate i fell in with you here you are yourself againon your quarterdeck i scarce knew you the last few days i was afraid i had offended you you seemed to avoid me nonsense mr dodd what is there about you to avoid plenty miss fountain i am so inferior to your other friends i was not aware of it mr dodd and i have heard your sex has gusts of caprice and i thought the cold wind was blowing upon me and that did seem very sad just when i am going out and perhaps shall never see your sweet face or hear your lovely voice again dont say that mr dodd or you will make me sad in earnest your prudence and courage and a kind providence will carry you safe through this voyage as they have through so many and on your return the acquaintance you do me the honor to value so highly will await youif it depends on me all this was said kindly and beautifully and almost tenderly but still with a certain majesty that forbade lovemakingrendered it scarce possible except to a fool but david was not captious he could not like the philosopher sift sunshine for some days he had been almost separated from her now she was by his side he adored her so that he could no longer realize sorrow or disappointment to come they were uncertainfuture the light of her eyes and voice and face and noble presence were here he basked in them he told her not to mind a word he had said it was all nonsense i am happier nowhappier than ever at this lucy looked grave and became silent david to amuse her told her there was a singing dog aboard and would she like to hear him this was a happy diversion for lucy she assented gayly david ran for his fiddle and then for pepper pepper wagged his tail but strong as his musical taste was would not follow the fiddle but at this juncture master reginald dawned on the stableyard with a huge slice of bread and butter pepper followed him so the party came on the lawn and joined lucy then david played on the violin and pepper performed exactly as hereinbefore related lucy laughed merrily and reginald shrieked with delight for the vocal terrier was mortal droll but setting pepper aside that is a very sweet air you are playing now mr dodd it is full of soul and feeling is it said david looking wonderstruck you know best who is the composer david looked confused and said no one of any note lucy shot a glance at him keen as lightning what with davids simplicity and her own remarkable talent for reading faces his countenance was a book to her wide open bible print the composers name is mr dodd said she quietly i little thought you would be satisfied with it replied david obliquely then you doubted my judgment as well as your own talent my talent i should never have composed an air that would bear playing but for one thing and what was that said lucy affecting vast curiosity she felt herself on safe ground nowthe fine arts you remember when you went away from font abbey and left us all so heavyhearted i remember leaving font abbey replied lucy with saucy emphasis and an air of lofty disbelief in the other incident well i used to get my fiddle and think of you so far away and sweet sad airs came to my heart and from my heart they passed into the fiddle now and then one seemed more worthy of you than the rest were and then i kept that one you mean you took the notes down said lucy coldly oh no there was no need i wrote it in my head and in my heart may i play you another of your tunes i call them your tunes lucy blushed faintly and fixed her eyes on the ground she gave a slight signal of assent and david played a melody it is very beautiful said she in a low voice play it again can you play it as we walk oh yes he played it again they drew near the hall door she looked up a moment and then demurely down again now will you be so good as to play the first one twice she listened with her eyelashes drooping tweedle dee tweedle dum tweedle dee and now we will go into breakfast cried lucy with sudden airy cheerfulness and almost with the word she darted up the steps and entered the house without even looking to see whether david followed or what became of him he stood gazing through the open door at her as she glided across the hall swift and elastic yet serpentine and graceful and stately as juno at nineteen et vera iucessu patuit lady these junones severe in youthful beauty fill us davids with irrational awe but the next moment they are treated like small children by the very first matron they meet they resign their judgment at once to hers and bow their wills to her lightest word with a slavish meanness creations unmarried lords realize your true positiongirls govern you and wives govern girls mrs bazalgette on lucys entrance ran a critical eye over her and scolded her like a sixyearold for walking in thin shoes only on the gravel aunt said the divine slave submissively no matter it rained last night i heard it patter you want to be laid up i suppose i will put on thicker ones in future dear aunt murmured the celestial serf now mrs bazalgette did not really care a button whether the servile angel wore thick soles or thin she was cross about something a mile off that as soon as she had vented her ill humor on a sham cause she could come to its real cause goodtemperedly and lucy love do manage better about mr dodd lucy turned scarlet luckily mrs bazalgette was evading her nieces eye so did not see her telltale cheek he was quite thrown out last night and really as he does not ride with us it is too bad to neglect him indoors oh excuse me aunt mr dodd is your protege you did not even tell me you were going to invite him i beg your pardon that i certainly did poor fellow he was out of spirits last night well but aunt surely you can put an admirer in good spirits when you think proper said lucy slyly humph i dont want to attract too much attention i see bazalgette watching me and i dont wish to be misinterpreted myself or give my husband pain she said this with such dignity that lucy who knew her regard for her husband had much ado not to titter but courtesy prevailed and she said gravely i will do whatever you wish me only give me a hint at the time a look will do you know the ladies separated they met again at the breakfastroom door laughter rang merrily inside and among the gayest voices was mr dodds lucy gave mrs bazalgette an arch look your patient seems better and they entered the room where sure enough they found mr dodd the life and soul of the assembled party a letter from mrs wilson aunt and pray who is mrs wilson my nurse she tells me it is five years since she has seen me and she is wearying to see me what a droll expression wearying ah said david dodd you have heard the word before mr dodd no i cant say i have but i know what it must mean lying becalmed at the equator eh dodd said bazalgette misunderstanding him mrs wilson tells me she has taken a farm a few miles from this interesting intelligence said mrs bazalgette and she says she is coming over to see me one of these days aunt said lucy with a droll expression half arch half rueful she added timidly there is no objection to that is there none whatever if she does not make a practice of it only mind these old servants are the greatest pests on earth i remember now said lucy thoughtfully mrs wilson was always very fond of me i cannot think why though no more can i said mr hardie dryly she must be a thoroughly unreasonable woman mr hardie said this with a good deal of grace and humor and a laugh went round the table i mean she only saw me at intervals of several years why lucy what an antiquity you are making yourself said fountain but lucy was occupied with her puzzle she calls me her nursling said lucy sotto voce to her aunt but of course quite audibly to the rest of the company her dear nursling and says she would walk fifty miles to see me nursling hum there is another word i never heard and i do not exactly knowthen she says taisezvous petite sotte said mrs bazalgette in a sharp whisper so admirably projected that it was intelligible only to the ear it was meant for lucy caught it and stopped short and sat looking by main force calm and dignified but scarlet and in secret agony i have said something amiss thought lucy and was truly wretched we dont believe in mrs wilsons affection on this side the table said mr hardie but her revelations interest us for they prove that miss fountain had a beginning now we had thought she rose from the foam like venus or sprung from joves brow like minerva or descended from some ancient pedestal flawless as the parian itself what sir cried bazalgette furiously did you think our niece was built in a day so fair a structure so accomplished a will you be quiet good people said mrs bazalgette she was born she was bred she was brought up in which i had a share and she is a very good girl if you gentlemen will be so good as not to spoil her for me with your flattery there said lucy courageously enforcing her aunts thunderbolt and she leaned toward mrs bazalgette and shot back a glance of defiance with arching neck at mr bazalgette after breakfast she ran to mrs bazalgette what was it oh nothing only the gentlemen were beginning to grin oh dear did i say anythingridiculous no because i stopped you in time mind lucy it is never safe to read letters out from people in that class of life they talk about everything and use words that are quite out of date i stopped you because i know you are a simpleton and so i could not tell what might pop out next oh thank you auntthank you cried lucy warmly then i did not expose myself after all no no you said nothing that might not be proclaimed at st pauls crossha ha am i a simpleton aunt inquired lucy in the tone of an indifferent person seeking knowledge not you replied this oblivious lady you know a great deal more than most girls of your age to be sure girls that have been at a fashionable school generally manage to learn one or two things you have no idea of naturally as you sayhe he but you make up for it my dear in other respects if the gentlemen take you for a pane of glass why all the better meantime shall i tell you your real character i have only just discovered it myself oh yes aunt tell me my character i should so like to hear it from you should you said the other a little satirically well then you are an innocent fox aunt an innocent fox so run and get your workbox i want you to run up a tear in my flounce lucy went thoughtfully for her workbox murmuring ruefully i am an innocent foxi am an innocent fox she did not like her new character at all it mortified her and seemed selfcontradictory as well as derogatory on her return she could not help remonstrating how can that be my character a fox is cunning and i despise cunning and i am sure i am not innocent added she putting up both hands and looking penitent with all this a shade of vexation was painted on her lovely cheeks as she appealed against her epigram mrs bazalgette with the calm inexorable superiority of matron despotism you are an innocent fox is your needle threaded here is the tear no not there i caught against the flowerpot frame and ill swear i heard my gown go look lower down dear dont give it up all which may perhaps remind the learned and sneering reader of another foxthe one that had a wound and he could not tell where they rode out today as usual and david had the equivocal pleasure of seeing them go from the door lucy was one of the first down and put her hand on the saddle and looked carelessly round for somebody to put her up david stepped hastily forward his heart beating seized her foot never waited for her to spring but went to work at once and with a powerful and sustained effort raised her slowly and carefully like a dead weight and settled her in the saddle his gripe hurt her foot she bore it like a spartan sooner than lose the amusement of his simplicity and enormous strength so drolly and unnecessarily exerted it cost her a little struggle not to laugh right out but she turned her head away from him a moment and was quit for a spasm then she came round with a face all candor thank you mr dodd said she demurely and her eyes danced in her head her foot felt encircled with an iron band but she bore him not a grain of malice for that and away she cantered followed by his longing eyes david bore the separation well tomorrow morning i shall have her all to myself said he he played with kenealy and reginald and chatted with bazalgette in the evening she was surrounded as usual and he obtained only a small share of her attention but the thought of the morrow consoled him he alone knew that she walked before breakfast the next morning he rose early and sauntered about till eight oclock and then he came on the lawn and waited for her she did not come he waited and waited and waited she never came his heart died within him she avoids me said he it is not accident i have driven her out of her very garden she always walked here before breakfast she said so till i came and spoiled her walk heaven forgive me david could not flatter himself that this interruption of her acknowledged habit was accidental on the other hand how kind and cheerful she had been with him on the same spot yesterday morning to judge by her manner his company on her quarterdeck was not unwelcome to her yet she kept her room today from the window of which she could probably see him walking to and fro longing for her the bitter disappointment was bad enough but here tormenting perplexity as to its cause was added and between the two the pining heart was racked this is the cruelest separation mere distance is the mildest where land and sea alone lie between two loving hearts they pine but are at rest a piece of paper and a few lines traced by the hand that reads like a face and the two sad hearts exult and embrace one another afresh in spite of a hemisphere of dirt and salt water that parts bodies but not minds but to be close yet kept aloof by redhot iron and chilling ice by rivals by etiquette and cold indifferenceto be near yet farthis is to be apartthis this is separation a gush of rage and bitterness foreign to his natural temper came over mr dodd since i cant have the girl i love i will have nobody but my own thoughts i cannot bear the others and their chat today i will go and think of her since that is all she will let me do and directly after breakfast david walked out on the downs and made by instinct for the sea the wounded deer shunned the lively herd the ladies as they sat in the drawingroom received visits of a less flattering character than usual reginald kept popping in inquiring where was mr dodd and would not believe they had not hid him somewhere he was followed by kenealy who came in and put them but one question where is dawd we dont know said mrs bazalgette sharply we have not been intrusted with the care of mr dodd kenealy sauntered forth disconsolate finally mr bazalgette put his head in and surveyed the room keenly but in silence so then his wife looked up and asked him satirically if he did not want mr dodd of course i do was the gracious reply what else should i come here for well he is lost you had better put him in the hue and cry la bazalgette was getting jealous of her own flirtee he attracted too much of that attention she loved so dear at last reginald despairing of dodd went in search of another playmatemaster christmas a young gentleman a year older than himself who lived within half a mile before he went he inquired what there was for his dinner and being informed roast mutton was not enraptured he then asked with greater solicitude what was the pudding and being told rice betrayed disgust and anger as was remembered when too late at two oclock the day being fine the ladies went for a long ride accompanied by talboys only kenealy excused himself he must see if he could not find dawd mrs bazalgette started in a pet but after the first canter she set herself to bewitch mr talboys just to keep her hand in she flattered him up hill and down dale lucy was silent and distraite from that hill you look right down upon the sea said mrs bazalgette what do you say it is only two miles farther on they cantered and leaving the high road dived into a green lane which led them by a gradual ascent to mariners folly on the summit of the cliff mariners folly looked at a distance like an enormous bush in the shape of a lion but when you came nearer you saw it was three remarkably large blackthorntrees planted together as they approached it at a walk mrs bazalgette told mr talboys its legend these trees were planted a hundred and fifty years ago by a retired buccaneer aunt now it was only a lieutenant be quiet lucy and dont spoil me i call him a buccaneer some say it is named his folly because you must know his ghost comes and sits here at times and that is an absurd practice shivering in the cold others more learned say it comes from a latin word folio or some such thing that means a leaf the mariners leafy screen she then added with reckless levity i wonder whether we shall find buckey on the other side looking at the ships through a ghostly telescopeha haah ah help mercy forgive me oh dear it is only mr dodd in his jacketyou frightened me so oh oh therei am ill catch me somebody and she dropped her whip and seeing davids eye was on her subsided backward with considerable courage and trustfulness and for the second time contrived to be in her flirtees arms i wish my friend aristotle had been there i think he would have been pleased at her greek presence of mind in turning even her terror of the supernatural so quickly to account and making it subservient to flirtation david sat heartstricken and hopeless gazing at the sea the hours passed by his heavy heart unheeded the leafy screen deadened the light sound of the horses feet on the turf and moreover his senses were all turned inward they were upon him and he did not move but still held his head in his hands and gazed upon the sea at mrs bazalgettes cries he started up and looked confusedly at them all but when she did the feinting business he thought she was going to faint and caught her in his arms and holding her in them a moment as if she had been a child he deposited her very gently in a sitting posture at the foot of one of the trees and taking her hand slapped it to bring her to oh dont you hurt me cried the lady in her natural voice lucy barbarous girl never came to her aunts assistance at the first fright she seemed slightly agitated but she now sat impassive on her pony and even wore a satirical smile now dear aunt when you have done mr dodd will put you on your horse again on this hint david lifted her like a child malgre a little squeak she thought it well to utter and put her in the saddle again she thanked him in a low murmuring voice she then plied david with a host of questions how came he so far from home why had he deserted them all day david hung his head and did not answer lucy came to his relief it would be as well if you would make him promise to be at home in time for dinner and by the way i have a favor to ask of you mr dodd a favor to ask of me oh you know we all make demands upon your goodnature in turn that is true said la bazalgette tenderly i dont know what will become of us all when he goes lucy then explained that the masked ball suggested by mr talboys beautiful dresses was to be very soon and she wanted mr dodd to practice quadrilles and waltzes with her it will be so much better with the violin and piano than with a piano alone and you are such an excellent timistwill you mr dodd that i will said david his eyes sparkling with delight thank you then as i shall practice before the gentlemen join us and it is four oclock now had you not better turn your back on the sea and make the best of your way home i will be there almost as soon as you indeed what on foot and we on horseback ay but i can steer in the winds eye aunt mr dodd proposes a race home with all my heart how much start are we to give him none at all said david are you ready then give way and he started down the hill at a killing pace the equestrians were obliged to walk down the hill and when they reached the bottom david was going as the crow flies across some meadows half a mile ahead a good canter soon brought them on a line with him but every now and then the turns of the road and the hills gave him an advantage lucy naturally kindhearted would have relaxed her pace to make the race more equal but talboys urged her on and as a horse is after all a faster animal than a sailor they rode in at the front gate while david was still two fields off come said mrs bazalgette regretfully we have beat him poor fellow but we wont go in till we see what has become of him as they loitered on the lawn henry the footman came out with a salver and on it reposed a soiled note henry presented it with demure obsequiousness then retired grinning furtively what is thisa beggingletter what a vile hand look lucy did you ever why it must be some pauper have a little mercy aunt said lucy piteously that hand has been formed under my care and daily superintendence it is reginalds oh that alters the case what can the dear child have to say to me ah the little wretch send the servants after him in every direction oh who would be a mother the letter was written in lines with two pernicious defects st they were like the wooden part of a bow instead of its string d they yielded to gravitykept tending down down to the righthand corner more and more in the use of capitals the writer had taken the copyhead as his model the style however was pithy and in writing that is the first christian graceno i forgot it is the second pellucidity is the first dear mama me and johnny cristmas are gone to the north pole his unkle went twise we shall be back in siks munths please give my love to lucy and papa and ask lucy to be kind to my ginnipigs i shall want them wen i come back too much cabiges is not good for ginnipigs wen i come back i hope there will be no rise left it is very unjust to give me those nasty messy pudens i am not a child there filthy there abbommanabel johny says it is funy at the north pole and there are bares and they are wite i remain your duteful son reginald george bazalgette this innocent missive set house and premises in an uproar henry was sent east through the dirt multa reluctantem in white stockings tom galloped north mrs bazalgette sat in the hall and did wellbred hysterics for kenealy and talboys lucy pinned up her habit and ran to the boundary hedge on the bare chance of seeing the figures of the truants somewhere short of the horizon lo and behold there was david dodd crossing the very nearest field and coming toward her an urchin in each hand lucy ran to meet them oh you dear naughty children what a fright you have given us oh mr dodd how good of you where did you find them under that hedge eating apples they tell me they sailed for the north pole this morning but fell in with a pirate close under the land so bout ship and came ashore again a pirate mr dodd oh i see a beggara tramp a deal worse than that miss lucy now youngster why dont you spin your own yarn yes tell me reggy well dear when i had written to mamma and johnny had folded itbecause i can write but i cant fold it and he can fold it but he cant write itwe went to the north pole and we got a mile and then we saw that nasty newfoundland dog sitting in the road waiting to torment us it is farmer johnsons and it plays with us and knocks us down and licks us and frightens us and we hate it so we came home ha ha good prudent children oh dear you have had no dinner oh yes we had lucy such a nice one we bought such a lot of apples of a woman i never had a dinner all apples before they always spoil them with mutton and things and that nasty nasty rice hear to that shouted david dodd they have been dining upon varjese verjuice and them growing children i shall take them into the kitchen and put some cold beef into their little holds this minute poor little lambs oh yes do and i will run and tell the good news she ran across the lawn and came into the hall red with innocent happiness and agitation they are found aunt they are found dont cry mr dodd found them close by they have had no dinner so that good kind mr dodd is taking them into the kitchen i will send master christmas home with a servant shall i bring you reggy to kiss no no wicked little wretch to frighten his poor mother whip him somebody and put him to bed in the evening soon after the ladies had left the diningroom the pianoforte was heard playing quadrilles in the drawingroom david fidgeted on his seat a little and presently rose and went for his violin and joined lucy in the drawingroom alone mrs b was trying on a dress between the tunes lucy chatted with him as freely and kindly as ever david was in heaven when the gentlemen came up from the diningroom his joy was interrupted but not for long the two musicians played with so much spirit and the fiddle in particular was so hearty that mrs bazalgette proposed a little quiet dance on the carpet and this drew the other men away from the piano and left david and lucy to themselves she stole a look more than once at his bright eyes and rich ruddy color and asked herself is that really the same face we found looking wan and haggard on the sea i think i have put an end to that at all events the consciousness of this sort of power is secretly agreeable to all men and all women whether they mean to abuse it or no she smiled demurely at her mastery over this great heart and said to herself one would think i was a witch later in the evening she eyed him again and thought to herself if my company and a few friendly words can make him so happy it does seem very hard i should select him to shun for the few days he has to pass in england now but then if i let him thinki dont know what to do with him poor mr dodd miss fountain did not torment her bolder aspirants with alternate distance and familiarity she rode out every fine day with mr talboys and was all affability she sat next mr hardie at dinner and was all affability narrative has its limits and to relate in some sequence the honest sailors tortures in love with a tactician i have necessarily omitted concurrent incidents of a still tamer character but the reader may by the help of his own intelligence gather their general results from the following dialogues which took place on the afternoon and evening of the terrible infants escapade mrs bazalgette well my dear friend and how does this naughty girl of mine use you mr hardie as well as i could expect and better than i deserve mrs b then she must be cleverer than any girl that ever breathed however she does appreciate your conversation she makes no secret of it mr h i have so little reason to complain of my reception that i will make my proposal to her this evening if you think proper mrs bazalgette started and glanced admiration on a man of eight thousand a year who came to the point of points without being either cajoled or spurred thither but she shook her head prudence my dear mr hardie prudence not just yet you are making advances every day and lucy is an odd girl with all her apparent tenderness she is unimpressionable that is only virgin modesty said hardie dogmatically fiddlestick replied mrs b goodhumoredly the greatest flirts i ever met with were virgins as you call them i tell you she is not disposed toward marriage as all other girls are until they have tasted its bitters mr h if i know anything of character she will make a very loving wife mrs b sharply that means a nice little negro well i think she might when once caught but she is not caught and she is slippery and if you are in too great a hurry she may fly off but above all we have a dangerous rival in the house just now mr h what that mr talboys i dont fear him he is next door to a fool mrs b what of that fools are dangerous rivals for a ladys favor we dont object to fools it depends on the employment there is one office we are apt to select them for mr h a husband eh the lady nodded mrs b i meant to marry a fool in bazalgette but i found my mistake the wretch had only feigned absurdity he came out in his true colors directly mr h a man of sense eh the sinister hypocrite he only wore the caps and bells to allure unguarded beauty and doffed them when he donned the weddingsuit mrs b yes but these are reminiscences so sweet that i shall be glad to return from them to your little affair seriously then mr talboys is not to be overlooked for this reason he is well backed by whom by some one who has influence with lucyher nearest relation mr fountain what is he nearer to her than you are certainly and she is fond of him to infatuation one day i did but hint that selfishness entered into his character he is eaten up with it and that he told fibs mr hardie she turned round on me like a tigressoh how she made me cry the keen hand hardie smiled satirically and after a pause answered with consummate coolness i believe thus much that she loves her uncle and that his influence exerted unscrupulously which it will be he may be strong enough to spoil us even though he should not be able to carry his own point now trust me my dear friend lucys preference is clearly for you but i know the weakness of my own sex and above all i know lucy fountain a mouse can help a lion in a matter of small threads too small for his nobler and grander wisdom to see let me be your mouse for once the little woman caught the great man with the everlasting hook and the discussion ended in claw me and i will claw thee and in the mutual selfcomplacency that follows that arrangement vide blackwood passim mr h i really think she would accept me if i offered today but i have so high an opinion of your sagacity and friendship for me madam that i will defer my judgment to yours i must however make one condition that you will not displace my plan without suggesting a distinct course of action for me to adopt in its place this smooth proposal made quietly but with twinkling eye would have shut the mouth of nine advisers in ten but it found the bazalgette prepared oh the pleasure of having a man of ability to deal with cried she with enthusiasm this is my advice then stay mr fountain out he must go in a day or two his time is up and i will drop a hint of fresh visitors expected when he is gone warm by degrees and offer yourself either in person or through bazalgette or me in person then certainly of all foibles employing another pair of eyes another tongue another person to make love for one is surely the silliest i am quite of your opinion cried the lady with a hearty laugh mr fountain so you are satisfied with the state of things mr talboys yes i think i have beaten the sailor out of the field well butthis hardie hardie a shopkeeper i dont fear him in that case why not propose i have been doing the preliminariessounding your praises mr talboys tyrannically i propose next saturday mr fountain very well talboys in the boat in the boat what boat theres no boat i have asked her to sail with me from in a boat there is a very nice little luggerrigged one i am having the seats padded and stuffed and lined and an awning put up and the boat painted white and gold bravo cleopatras galley i assure you she looks forward to it with pleasure she guesses why i want to get her into that boat she hesitated at first but at last consented with a looka conscious look i can hardly describe it there is no need cried fountain i know it the jade turned all eyelashes that is rather exaggerated but still but still i have described itto a hair ha ha talboys gravely well yes mr talboys i am bound to own was accurate during the last day or two lucy had taken a turn she had been bewitching she had flattered him with tact but deliciously had consulted him as to which of his beautiful dresses she should wear at the masked ball and when pressed to have a sail in the boat he was fitting for her she ended by giving a demure assent chorus of male readers oh les femmes les femmes david dodd had by nature a healthy as well as a high mind but the fever and ague of an absorbing passion were telling on it like many a great heart before his day his heart was tossed like a ship and went up to heaven and down again to despair as a girls humor shifted or seemed to shift for he forgot that there is such a thing as accident and that her sex are even more under its dominion than ours no whatever she did must be spontaneous voluntary premeditated even and her lightest word worth weighing her lightest action worth anxious scrutiny as to its cause still he had this about him that the peevish and puny lover has not her bare presence was joy to him even when she was surrounded by other figures he saw and felt but the one the rest were nothings but when she went out of his sight some bright illusion seemed to fade into cold and dark reality then it fell on him like a weighty icy hammer that in three days he must go to sea for two years and that he was no nearer her heart now than he was at font abbey was he even as near so the next afternoon he thrust in before talboys and put lucy on her horse by brute force and griped her stout little boot which she had slyly substituted for a shoe and touched her glossy habit and felt a thrill of bliss unspeakable at his momentary contact with her but she was no sooner out of sight than a hollow ache seized the poor fellow and he hung his head and sighed i say capting said a voice in his ear he looked up and there stood tom the stableboy with both hands in his pockets tom was not there by his own proper movement but was agent of betsy the underhousemaid female servants scan the male guests pretty closely too without seeming to do it and judge them upon lamentably broad principlesyouth health size beauty and good temper oh the coarseminded critics hence it befell that in their eyes especially after the fiddle business david was a king compared with his rivals if i look at him too long i shall eat him said the cookmaid he is a darling said the upper housemaid betsy aforesaid often opened a window to have a sly look at him and on one of these occasions she inspected him from an upper story at her leisure his manner drew her attention she saw him mount lucy and eye her departing form sadly and wistfully betsy glowered and glowered and hit the nail on the head as people will do who are so absurd as to look with their own eyes and draw their own conclusions instead of other peoples after this she took an opportunity and said to tom with a satirical air how are you off for nags your way oh we have got enough for our corn replied tom on the defensive it seems you cant find one for the captain among you will you give a kiss if i make you out a liar sooner than break my arm come you might tom now is it reasonable him never to get a ride with her and that useless lot prancing about with her all day long why dont you ride with em capting i have no horse i have got a horse for you sirmasters that would be taking a liberty liberty sir no master would be so pleased if you would but ride him he told me so then saddle him pray i have asaddled him you had better come in the stableyard capting then you can mount and follow you will catch them before they reach the downs in another minute david was mounted do you ride short or long capting inquired tom handling the stirrupleather david wore a puzzled look i ride as long as i can stick on and he trotted out of the stableyard as tom had predicted he caught the party just as they went off the turnpike on to the grass his heart beat with joy he cantered in among them his horse was fresh squeaked and bucked at finding himself on grass and in company and david announced his arrival by rolling in among their horses feet with the reins tight grasped in his fist the ladies screamed with terror david got up laughing his horse had hoped to canter away without him and now stood facing him and pulling no ye dont said david i held on to the tillerropes though i did go overboard then ensued a battle between david and his horse the one wanting to mount the other anxious to be unencumbered with sailors it was settled by david making a vault and sitting on the animals neck on which the ladies screamed again and lucy half whimpering proposed to go home dont think of it cried david i wont be beat by such a small craft as thishallo for the horse backing into talboys that gentleman gave him a clandestine cut and he bolted and being a little hardmouthed would gallop in spite of the tillerropes on came the other nags after him all misbehaving more or less so fine a thing is example when they had galloped half a mile the ground began to rise and davids horse relaxed his pace whereon david whipped him industriously and made him gallop again in spite of remonstrance the others drew the rein and left him to gallop alone accordingly he made the round of the hill and came back his horse covered with lather and its tail trembling there said he to lucy with an air of radiant selfsatisfaction he clapped on sail without orders from quarterdeck so i made him carry it till his bows were under water you will kill my uncles horse was the reply in a chilling tone heaven forbid look at its poor flank beating david hung his head like a schoolgirl rebuked but why did he clap on sail if he could not carry it inquired he ruefully of his monitress the others burst out laughing but lucy remained grave and silent david rode along crestfallen mrs bazalgette brought her pony close to him and whispered never mind that little crosspatch she does not care a pin about the horse you interrupted her flirtation that is all this piece of consolation soothed david like a bunch of stingingnettles while mrs bazalgette was consoling david with thorns kenealy and talboys were quizzing his figure on horseback he sat bent like a bow and visibly sticking on item he had no straps and his trousers rucked up halfway to his knee lucys attention being slyly drawn to these phenomena by davids friend talboys she smiled politely though somewhat constrainedly but the gentlemen found it a source of infinite amusement during the whole ride which by the way was not a very long one for miss fountain soon expressed a wish to turn homeward david felt guilty he scarce knew why the promised happiness was wormwood on dismounting she went to the lawn to tend her flowers david followed her and said bitterly i am sorry i came to spoil your pleasure miss fountain made no answer i thought i might have one ride with you when others have so many why of course mr dodd if you like to expose yourself to ridicule it is no affair of mine the ladys manner was a happy mixture of frigidity and crossness david stood benumbed and lucy having emptied her flowerpot glided indoors without taking any farther notice of him david stood rooted to the spot then he gave a heavy sigh and went and leaned against one of the pillars of the portico and everything seemed to swim before his eyes presently he heard a female voice inquire is miss lucy at home he looked and there was a tall strapping woman in conference with henry she had on a large bonnet with flaunting ribbons and a bushy cap infuriated by red flowers henrys eye fell upon these embellishments not at home chanted he sonorously eh dear said the woman sadly i have come a long way to see her not at home maam repeated henry like a vocal machine my name is wilson young man said she persuasively and the amazons voice was mellow and womanly spite of her coalscuttle full of field poppies i am her nurse and i have not seen her this five years come martinmas and the amazon gave a gentle sigh of disappointment not at home maam rang the inexorable plush but davids good heart took the womans part she is at home now said he coming forward i saw her go into the house scarce a minute ago oh thank you sir said mrs wilson but mr plushs face was instantly puckered all over with signals which david not comprehending he said can i say a word with you sir and drawing him on one side objected in an injured and piteous tone we are not at home to such gallimaufry as that it is as much as my place is worth to denounce that there bonnet to our ladies bonnet be dd roared david aloud it is her old nurse come heave ahead and he pointed up the stairs anything to oblige you captain said henry and sauntered into the drawingroom mrs wilson maam for miss fountain very well my niece will be here directly lucy had just gone to her own room for some working materials you had better come to an anchor on this seat mrs wilson said david thank ye kindly young gentleman said mrs wilson and she settled her stately figure on the seat i have walked a many miles today along of our horse being lame and i am a little tired you are one of the family i do suppose no i am only a visitor aint ye now well thank ye kindly all the same i have seen a worse face than yours i can tell you added she for in the midst of it all she had found time to read countenances more mulierurn and i have seen a good many hundred worse than yours mrs wilson mrs wilson laughed twenty years ago if you had said so i might have believed you or even ten but bless you i am an old woman now and can say what i choose to the men fortytwo next candlemas in the country they call themselves old at fortytwo because they feel young in town they call themselves young at fortytwo because they feel old david found that he had fallen in with a gossip and being in no humor for vague chat he left mrs wilson to herself with an assurance that miss fountain would be down to her directly in leaving her he went into worse companyhis own thoughts they were inexpressibly sad and bitter she hates me then said he everybody is welcome to her at all hours except me that lady said it was because i interrupted her flirtation aha well i shant interrupt her flirtation much longer i shant be in her way or anybodys long a few short hours and this bitter day will be forgotten and nothing left me but the memory of the kindness she had for me once or seemed to have and the angel face i must carry in my heart wherever i go by land or sea the sea would to god i was upon it this minute id rather be at sea than ashore in the dirtiest night that ever blew he had been walking to and fro a good halfhour deeply dejected and turning bitter when looking in accidentally at the hall door he caught sight of mrs wilson sitting all alone where he had left her why what on earth is the meaning of that thought he and he went into the hall and asked mrs wilson how she came to be there all alone that is what i have been asking myself a while past was the dry reply have you not seen her no sir i have not seen her and to my mind it is doubtful whether i am to see her but i say you shall see her no no dont put yourself out sir said the woman carelessly i dare say i shall have better luck next time if i should ever come to this house again which it is not very likely she added gently young folk are thoughtless we must not judge them too hardly thoughtless they may be but they have no business to be heartless i have a great mind to go up and fetch her down dont ye trouble sir it is not worth while putting you about for an old woman like me then suddenly dropping the mask of nonchalance which women of this class often put on to hide their sensibility she said very very gravely and with a sad dignity that one would not have expected from her gossip and her finery i begin to fear sir that the child i have suckled does not care to know me now she is a woman grown david dashed up the stairs with a red streak on his brow he burst into the drawingroom and there sat mrs bazalgette overlooking and lucy working with a face of beautiful calm she looked just then so very like a pure tranquil madonna making an altarcloth or something that davids intention to give her a scolding was withered in the bud and he gazed at her surprised and irresolute and said not a word anything the matter inquired mrs bazalgette attracted by the bruskness of his entry yes there is said david sternly lucy looked up miss fountains old nurse has been sitting in the hall more than half an hour and nobody has had the politeness to go near her oh is that all well dont look daggers at me there is lucy give her a lesson in goodbreeding mr dodd this was said a little satirically and rather nettled david perhaps it does not become me to set up for a teacher of that i know my own deficiencies as well as anybody in this house knows them but this i know that if an old friend walked eight miles to see me it would not be goodbreeding in me to refuse to walk eight yards to see her and another thing everybodys time is worth something if i did not mean to see her i would have that much consideration to send down and tell her so and not keep the woman wasting her time as well as her trouble and vexing her heart into the bargain where is she mr dodd asked lucy quickly where is she cried david getting louder and louder why she is cooling her heels in the hall this half hour and more they hadnt the manners to show her into a room i will go to her mr dodd said lucy turning a little pale dont be angry i will go directly and having said this with an abject slavishness that formed a miraculous contrast with her late crossness and imperious chilliness she put down her work hastily and went out only at the door she curved her throat and cast back parthianlike a glance of timid reproach as much as to say need you have been so very harsh with a creature so obedient as this is that deprecating glance did mr dodds business it shot him with remorse and made him feel a brute ha ha that is the way to speak to her mr dodd the other gentlemen spoil her it was very unbecoming of me to speak to her harshly like that pooh nonsense these girls like to be ordered about it saves them the trouble of thinking for themselves but what is to become of me you have sent off my workwoman i will do her work for her what can you sew where is the sailor that cant sew delightful then please to sew these two thick ends together here is a large needle david whipped out of his pocket a round piece of leather with strings attached and fastened it to the hollow of his hand what is that it is a sailors thimble he took the work held it neatly and shoved the needle from behind through the thick material he worked slowly and uncouthly but with the precision that was a part of his character and made exact and strong stitches his taskmistress looked on and under the pretense of minute inspection brought a face that was still arch and pretty unnecessarily close to the marine milliner in which attitude they were surprised by mr bazalgette who having come in through the open foldingdoors stood looking mighty sardonic at them both before they were even aware he was in the room omphale colored faintly but hercules gave a cool nod to the newcomer and stitched on with characteristic zeal and strict attention to the matter in hand at this bazalgette uttered a sort of chuckle at which mrs bazalgette turned red david stitched on for the bare life i came to offer to invite you to my study but i cant come just now said david bluntly i am doing a ladys work for her so i see retorted bazalgette dryly we all dine with the hunts but you and mr dodd said mrs bazalgette so you will be en teteatete all the evening all the better for us both and with this ingratiating remark mr bazalgette retired whistling mrs bazalgette heaved a gentle sigh pity me my friend said she softly what is the matter inquired david rather bluntly mr bazalgette is so harsh to meahto me who longs so for kindness and gentleness that i feel i could give my very soul in exchange for them the bait did not take it is only his manner said david goodnaturedly his heart is all right i never met a better what sort of a knot is that you are tying why that is a grannys knot and he looked morose at which she looked amazed so he softened and explained to her with benevolence the rationale of a knot a knot is a fastening intended to be undone again by fingers and not to come undone without them accordingly a knot is no knot at all if it jams or if it slips a grannys knot does both when you want to untie it you must pick at it like taking a nail out of a board and for all that sooner or later it always comes undone of itself now you look here and he took a piece of string out of his pocket and tied her a sailors knot bidding her observe that she could untie it at once but it could never come untied of itself he showed her with this piece of string half a dozen such knots none of which could either jam or slip tie me a lovers knot suggested the lady in a whisper ay ay and he tied her a lovers knot as imperturbably as he had the reef knot bowlingknot fishermans bend etc this is very interesting said mrs bazalgette ironically she thought david might employ a teteatete with a flirt better than this what a time lucy is gone all the better why and she looked down in mock confusion because poor mrs wilson will be glad mrs bazalgette was piqued at this unexpected answer you seem quite captivated with this mrs wilson it was for her sake you took lucy to task apropos you need not have scolded her for she did not know the woman was in the house what do you mean i mean lucy was not in the room when mrs wilson was announced i was but i did not tell her the allimportant circumstance had escaped my memory where are you running to now where why to ask her pardon to be sure mrs b brute david ran down the stairs to look for lucy but he found somebody else insteadhis sister eve whom the servant had that moment admitted into the hall it was oh eve and oh david directly and an affectionate embrace you got my letter david no well then you will before long i wrote to tell you to look out for me i had better have brought the letter in my pocket i didnt know i was coming till just an hour before i started mother insisted on my going to see the last of you cousin mary had invited me to so i shall see you off davy dear after all i thought id just pop in and let you know i was in the neighborhood mary and her husband are outside the gate in their fourwheel i would not let them drive in because i want to hear your story and they would have bothered us eve dear i have no good news for you your words have come true i have been perplexed up and down hot and cold till i feel sometimes like going mad eve i cannot fathom her she is deeper than the ocean and more changeable what am i saying the sea and the wind they are to be read they have their signs and their warnings but she there there that is the old song i tell you it is only a girla creature as shallow as a puddle and as easy to fathom as you call it only men are so stupid especially boys now just you tell me all she has said all she has done and all she has looked and i will turn her inside out like a glove in a minute cheered by this audacious pledge david pumped upon eve all that has trickled on my readers and some minor details besides and repeated lucys every word sweet or bitter and recalled her lightest actionmeminerunt omnia amantesand every now and then he looked sadly into eves keen little face for his doom she heard him in silence until the last fatal incident lucys severity on the lawn then she put in a question were those her exact words do i ever forget a syllable she says to me dont be angry i forgot what a ninny she has made of you well david it is all as plain as my hand the girl likes youthat is all the girl likes me what do you mean how can you say that what sign of liking is there there are two she avoids you and she has been rude to you and those are signs of liking are they said david bitterly why of course they are stupid tell me now does she shun this captain keely kenealy no does she shun mr harvey hardie no does she shun mr talboys oh eve you break my heartno no she shuns no one but poor david now think a little here are three on one sort of footing and one on a different footing which is likeliest to be the man the one or the three you have gained a point since we were all together she distinguishes you but what a way to distinguish me it looks more like hatred than love or liking either not to my eye why should she shun you you are handsome you are goodtempered and good company why should she be shy of you she is afraid of you that is why and why is she afraid of you because she is afraid of her own heart that is how i read her then as for her snubbing you if her character was like mine that ought to go for nothing for i snub all the world but this is a little queen for politeness i cant think she would go so far out of her way as to affront anybody unless she had an uncommon respect for him listen to that now i am on my beamends now think a minute david said eve calmly ignoring his late observation did you ever know her snub anybody never did you no and she never would unless she took an uncommon interest in the person when a girl likes a man she thinks she has a right to illuse him a little bit he has got her affection to set against a scratch or two the others have not so she has not the same right to scratch them la listen to me teaching him a b c why david you know nothing its scandalous eves confidence communicated itself at last to david but when he asked her whether she thought lucy would consent to be his wife her countenance fell in her turn that is a very different thing i am pretty sure she likes you how could she help it but i doubt she will never go to the altar with you dont be angry with me davy dear you are in love with her and to you she is an angel but i am of her own sex and see her as she is no matter who she likes she will never be content to make a bad match as they call it she told me so once with her own lips but she had no need to tell me worldliness is written on her david david you dont know these great houses nor the fairspoken creatures that live in them with tongues tuned to sentiment and mild eyes fixed on the main chance their drawingrooms are carpeted marketplaces you may see the stones bulge through the flowery pattern there the ladies sell their faces the gentlemen their titles and their money and much i fear miss fountains hand will go like the restto the highest bidder if i thought so my love deep as it is would turn to contempt i would tear her out of my heart though i tore my heart out of my body he added i will know what she is before many hours do david take her off her guard and make hot love to her that is your best chance it is a pity you are so much in love with her you might win her by a surprise if you only liked her in moderation how so dear eve the battle would be more even your adoring her gives her the upper hand of you she is sure to say no at first and then i am afraid you will leave off instead of going on hotter and hotter the very look she will put on to check you will check you you are so green what a pity i cant take your place for half an hour i would have her against her will i would take her by storm if she said no twenty times she should say yes the twentyfirst but you are afraid of her fancy being afraid of a woman come david you must not shillyshally but attack her like a man and if she is such a fool she cant see your merit forgive her like a man and forget her like a man come promise me you will i promise you this that if i lose her it shall not be for want of trying to win her and if she refuses me because i am not her fancy i shall die a bachelor for her sake eve sighed but if she is the mercenary thing you take her forif she owns to liking me but prefers money to love then from that moment she is no more to me than a picture or a statue or any other lovely thing that has no soul with these determined words he gave his sister his arm and walked with her through the grounds to the road where her cousin was waiting for her lucy found mrs wilson in the hall come into the library mrs wilson said she i have only just heard you were here wont you sit down are you not well mrs wilson you tremble you are fatigued i fear pray compose yourself may i ring for a glass of wine for you no no miss lucy said the woman smiling it is only along of you coming to me so sudden and you so grown eh sure can this fine young lady be the little girl i held in my lap but tother day as it seems there was an agitation and ardor about mrs wilson that coupled with the flaming bonnet made miss fountain uneasy she thought mrs wilson must be a little cracked or at least flighty pray compose yourself madam said she soothingly but with that dignity nobody could assume more readily than she could i dare say i am much grown since i last had the pleasure of seeing you but i have not outgrown my memory and i am happy to receive you or any of our old servants that knew my dear mother then i must not look for a welcome said mrs wilson with feminine logic for i was never your servant nor your mammas lucy opened her eyes and her face sought an explanation i never took any money for what i gave you so how could i be a servant to see me a dangling of my heels in your hall so long one would say i was a servant but i am not a servant nor like to be please god unless i should have the ill luck to bury my two boys as i have their father so perhaps the best thing i can do miss is to drop you my courtesy and walk back as i came the amazons manner was singularly independent and calm but the telltale tears were in the large gray honest eyes before she ended lucys natural penetration and habit of attending to faces rather than words came to her aid wait a minute mrs wilson said she i think there is some misunderstanding here perhaps the fault is mine and yet i remember more than one nurserymaid that was kind enough to me but i have heard nothing of them since their blood is not in your veins as mine is unless the doctors have lanced it out i never was bled in my life if you mean that madam but i must ask you to explain how i can possibly have thethe advantage of possessing your blood in my veins mrs wilson eyed her keenly perhaps i had better tell you the story from first to last young lady said she quietly if you please said the courtier mastering a sigh for in mrs wilson there was much that promised fluency well miss when you came into the world your mamma could not nurse you i do notice the gentry that eat the fat of the land are none the better for it for a poor woman can do a mothers part by her child but highborn and highfed folk cant always so you had to be brought up by hand miss and it did not agree with you and that is no great wonder seeing it is against nature well my little girl that was born just two days after you died in my arms of convulsion fits when she was just a month old she had only just been buried and me in bitter grief when doesnt the doctor call and ask me as a great favor would i nurse mrs fountains child that was pining for want of its natural food i bade him get out of my sight i felt as if no woman had a right to have a child living when my little darling was gone but my husband a just man as ever was said take a thought mary the child is really pining by all accounts well i would not listen to him but next sunday after afternoon church my mother that had not said a word till then comes to me and puts her hand on my shoulder with a quiet way she had mary says she i am older than you and have known more she had buried six of us poor thing says she scarce above a whisper suckle that failing child it will be the better for her and the better for you mary my girl well miss my mother was a woman that didnt interfere every minute and seldom gave her reasons but if you scorned her advice you mostly found them out to your cost and then she was my mother and in those days mothers were more thought of leastways by us that were women and had suffered for our children and so learned to prize the woman that had suffered for us well then i said if you say so mother i suppose i didnt ought to gainsay you on the lord his day for you see my mother was one that chose her time for speakingeh but she was wise mother says i to oblige you so be it and with that i fell to crying sore on my mothers neck and she wasnt long behind me you may be sure whiles we sat a crying in one anothers arms in comes john and goes to speak a word of comfort it is not that says my mother she have given her consent to nurse mrs fountains little girl it is much to her credit says he says he i will take her up to the house myself what for says i them that grants the favor has no call to run after them that asks it you see miss lucy that was my ignorance we were small farmers too independent to be fawning and not high enough to weed ourselves of upishness your mamma she was a real lady so she had no need to trouble about her dignity she thought only of her child and she didnt send the child but she came with it herself well she came into our kitchen and made her obeisance and we to her and mother dusted her a seat she was palelike and a mothers care was in her face and that went to my heart this is very very kind of you mrs wilson said she those were her words mayhap it is says i and my heart felt like lead mother made a sign to your mamma that she should not hurry me i saw the signal for i was as quick as she was but i never let on i saw it at last i plucked up a bit of courage and i said let me see it so mother took you from the girl that held you all wrapped up and mother put you on my knees and i took a good look at you you had the sweetest little face that ever came into the world but all peaked and pining for want of nature with you being on my knees my bosom began to yearn over you it did the child is starved said i that is all its grief and you did right to bring it here your mother clasps her hands oh mrs wilson says she god grant it is not too late so then i smiled back to her and i said dont you fret in a fortnight you shant know her you see i was beginning to feel proud of what i knew i could do for you i was a healthy young woman and could have nursed two children as easy as some can one to make a long story short i gave you the breast then and there and you didnt leave us long in doubt whether cows milk or mothers milk is gods will for sucklings well your mamma put her hands before her face and i saw the tears force their way between her fingers so when she was gone i said to my mother what was that for i shant tell you says she do mother says i so she said i wonder at your having to ask cant you see it was jealousylike do you think she has not her burden to bear in this world as well as you how would you like to see another woman do a mothers part for a child of yours and you sit looking on like a toymother eh miss lucy but i was vexed for her at that and my heart softened and i used to take you up to the great house and spend nearly the whole day there not to rob her of her child more than need be oh mrs wilson oh you kind noblehearted creature surely heaven will reward you that is past praying for my dear heaven wasnt going to be long in debt to a farmers wife you may be sure not a day not an hour i had hardly laid you to my breast when you seemed to grow to my heart my milk had been tormenting me for one thing my good mother had thought of that ill go bail and of course you relieved me but above all you numbed the wound in my heart and healed it by degrees a part of my love that lay in the churchyard seemed to come back like and settle on the little helpless darling that milked me at whiles i forgot you were not my own and even when i remembered it it wasi dont knowsomehowas if it wasnt so i knew in my head you were none of mine but what of that i didnt feel it here well miss i nursed you a year and two months and a finer little girl never was seen and such a weight and of course i was proud of you and often your dear mother tried to persuade me to take a twentypound note or ten but i never would i could not sell my milk to a queen id refuse it or id make a gift of it and the love that goes with it which is beyond price i didnt say so to her in so many words but i did use to tell her i was as much in her little girls debt as she was in mine and so i was but as for a silk gown and a shawl and the like i didnt say no to them who ever does nurse my lamb can you ever forgive me for confounding you with a servant i am so inexperienced i knew nothing of all this oh miss lucy let that flea stick in the wall as the saying is but dear mrs wilson now only think that your affection for me should have lasted all these years you speak as if such tenderness was common i fear you are mistaken there most nurses go away and think no more of those to whom they have been as mothers in infancy how do you know that miss lucy who can tell what passes inside those poor women that are ground down into slaves and never dare show their real hearts to a living creature certainly hirelings will be hirelings and a poor creature that is forced to sell her breast and is bundled off as soon as she has served the grand folks turn why she behooves to steel herself against nature and she knows that from the first but whether she always does get to harden herself i take leave to doubt miss lucy i knew an unfortunate girl that nursed a young gentleman leastways a young nobleman it was and years after that i have known her to stand outside the hedge for an hour to catch a sight of him at play on the lawn among the other children ay and if she had a penny piece to spare she would go and buy him sugarplums and lay wait for him and give them him and he heir to thousands a year poor thing poor thing next to the tie of blood miss lucy the tie of milk is a binding affection when you went to live twenty miles from us i behooved to come in the cart and see you from time to time i remember nurse i remember when i came to our new farm hard by you were away but as soon as i heard you were come back it was like a magnet drawing me i could not keep away from you heaven forbid you should and i will come and see you dear nurse will ye now do now i have got a nice little parlor for you it is a very good house for a farmhouse and there we can set and talk at our ease and no fine servants dressed like lords coming staring in lucy now proffered a timid request that mrs wilson would take off her bonnet i want to see your good kind face without any ornament hear to that now the darling and off came the bonnet now your cap well i dont know i hadnt time to do my hair as should be before coming what does that matter with me i must see you without that cap what dont you like my new cap isnt it a pretty cap why i bought it a purpose to come and see you in oh it is a very pretty cap in itself said the courtier but it does not suit the shape of your face oh what a difference ah now i see your heart in your face will you let me make you a cap will you now miss lucy i shall be so proud wearing it our house will scarce hold me at this juncture a footman came in with a message from mrs bazalgette to remind lucy that they dined out i must go and dress nurse she then kissed her and promised to ride over and visit her at her farm next week and spend a long time with her quietly and so these new old friends parted lucy pondered every word mrs wilson had said to her and said to herself what a child i am still how little i know how feebly i must have observed the party at dinner consisted of mr bazalgette david and reginald who taking advantage of his mothers absence and lucys had prevailed on the servants to let him dine with the grownup ones halo urchin said mr bazalgette to what do we owe this honor papa said reginald quaking at heart if i dont ever begin to be a man what is to become of me mr reginald did not exhibit his full powers at dinnertime he was greatest at dessert peaches and apricots fell like blackberries he topped up with the ginger and other preserves then he uttered a sigh and his eye dwelt on some candied pineapple he had respited too long putting the pineapples escape and the sigh together mr bazalgette judged that absolute repletion had been attained come reginald said he run away now and let mr dodd and me have our talk before the words were even out of his mouth a howl broke from the terrible infant he had evidently feared the proposal and got this dismal howl all ready oh papa oh oh what is the matter dont make me go away with the ladies this time jane says i am not a man because i go away when the ladies go and cousin lucy wont marry me till i am a man oh papa do let me be a man this once let him stay sir said david then he must go and play at the end of the room and not interrupt our conversation mr reginald consented with rapture he had got a new puzzle he could play at it in a corner all he wanted was to be able to stop janes mouth should she ever jeer him again reginald thus disposed of mr bazalgette courted david to replenish his glass and sit round to the fire the fire was huge and glowing the cut glass sparkled and the ruby wine glowed and even the faces shone and all invited genial talk yet david on the eve of his departure and of his fate oppressed with suspense and care was out of the reach of those genial superficial influences he could only just mutter a word of assent here and there then relapsed into his reverie and eyed the fire thoughtfully as if his destiny lay there revealed mr bazalgette on the contrary glowed more and more in manner as well as face and like many of his countrymen seemed to imbibe friendship with each fresh glass of port at last under the double influence of his real liking for david and of the englishmanthawing portuguese decoction he gave his favorite a singular proof of friendship it came about as follows observing that he had all the talk to himself he fixed his eyes with an expression of paternal benevolence on his companion and was silent in turn david looked up as we all do when a voice ceases and saw this mild gaze dwelling on him dodd my boy you dont say a word what is the matter i am very bad company sir that is the truth well fill your glass then and ill talk for you i have got something to say for you young gentleman david filled his glass and forced himself to attend after a while no effort was needed dodd resumed the mature merchant i need hardly tell you that i have a particular regard for you the reason is you are a young man of uncommon merit mr bazalgette sir i dont know which way to look when you praise me like that it is your goodness you overrate me no i dont i am a judge of men i have seen thousands and seen them too close to be taken in by their outside you are the only one of my wifes friends that ever had the run of my study what do you think of that now i am very proud of it sir that is all i can find to say well young man that same good opinion i have of you induces me to do something else that i have never done for any of your predecessors mr bazalgette paused davids heart beat quick as lightning it darted through his mind he is going to ask a favor for me promotion why not he is a merchant he has friends in the company i am going to interfere in your concerns dodd you are very good sir well perhaps i am i have to overcome a natural reluctance but you are worth the struggle i shall therefore go against the usages of the world which i dont care a button for and my own habits which i care a great deal for and give you humpha piece of friendly advice david looked blank dodd my boy you are playing the fool in this house david looked blanker it is not your fault you are led into it by one of those sweet creatures that love to reduce men to the level of their own wisdom you are in love or soon will be david colored all over like a girl and his face of distress was painful to see you need not look so frightened i am your friend not your enemy and do you really think others besides me have not seen what is going on now dodd my dear fellow i am an old man and you are a young one moreover i understand the lady and you dont that is true sir i feel i cannot fathom her poor fellow well but i have known her longer than you that is true sir and on closer terms of intimacy no doubt sir then listen to me she is all very charming outside and full of sensibility outside but she has no more real feeling than a fish she will go a certain length with you or with any agreeable young man but she can always stop where it suits her no lady in england values position and luxury more than she does or is less likely to sacrifice them to love a passion she is incapable of here then is a game at which you run all the risk no leave her to puppies like kenealy they are her natural prey you must not play such a heart as yours against a marble taw it is not an even stake david groaned audibly his first thought was eve says the same of her his second all the world is against her poor thing is she to bear the blame of my folly why not she is the cause of your folly it began with her setting her cap at you no sir you do her wrong she is modesty itself ta ta ta you are a sailor green as seaweed mr bazalgette as i am a gentleman she never has encouraged me to love her as i do your statement sir is one which becomes a gentlemanunder the circumstances but i happen to have watched her it is a thing i have taken the trouble to do for some time past it was my interest in you that made me curious and apprehensiveon your account then if you have watched her you must have seen her avoid me pooh pooh that was drawing the bait these old stagers can all do that old stagers and david looked as if blasphemy had been uttered bazalgette wore a grin of infinite irony dont be shocked said he of course i mean old in flirtation no lady is old in years she is not at all events it is agreed there are legal fictions and why not social ones i dont understand you sir and in truth it is all a puzzle to me you dont seem angry with me why of course not my poor fellow i pity you yet you discourage me mr bazalgette but not from any selfish motive i want to spare you the mortification that is in store for you remember i have seen the end of about a dozen of you good heavens and what is the end of us the cold shoulder without a days warning and another fool set in your place and the house door slammed in your face etc etc oh with her there is but one step from flirtation to detestation not one of her flames is her friend at this moment david hung his head and his heart turned sick there was a silence of some seconds during which bazalgette eyed him keenly sir said david at last your words go through me like a knife never mind it is a friendly surgeons knife not an assassins yet you say it is only out of regard for me you warn me so against her i repeat it then sir if by heavens mercy you should be mistaken in her characterif little as i deserve it i should succeed in winning her regardi might reckon on your permissionon your kindsupport hardly said mr bazalgette hastily he then stared at the honest earnest face that was turned toward him well said he you modest gentlemen have a marvelous fund of assurance at bottom no sir with the exception of this piece of friendly advice i shall be strictly neutral in return for it if you should succeed be so good as to take her out of the house that is the only stipulation i venture to propose i should be sure to do that cried david lifting his eyes to heaven with rapture but i shall not have the chance so i keep telling you you might as well hope to tempt a statue of the goddess flirtation she infinitely prefers wealth and vanity to anything even to vice vice sir is that a term for us to apply to a lady like her whom we are all unworthy to approach and david turned very red well you need not quarrel with me about her as i dont with you quarrel with you dear sir i hope i feel your kindness and know my duty better but sir i am agitated and my heart is troubled and surely you go beyond reason she is not old enough to have had so many lovers humph she has made good use of her time even could i believe that she who seems to me an angel is a coquette still she cannot be hard and heartless as you describe her it is impossible it does not belong to her years you keep harping on her age dodd do you know her age if you do you have the advantage of me i have not seen her baptismal register have you no sir but i know what she says is her age that is only evidence of what is not her age but there is her face sir that is evidence you have never seen her face it is always got up to deceive the public i have seen it at the dawn before any of you were up what is that halo the deucewhere in the garden in the garden oh she does not jump off her downbed on to a flowerbed she had been an hour at work on that face before ever the sun or you got leave to look on it ill stake my head i tell her age within a year mr bazalgette no you will not nor within ten years that is soon seen i call her oneandtwenty oneandtwenty you are mad why she has had a child that would be fifteen now if it had lived miss lucy a child fifteen years what on earth do you mean what do you mean what has miss lucy to do with it you know very well it is my wife i am warning you against not that innocent girl at this david burst out in his turn your wife and have you so vile an opinion of me as to think i would eat your bread and tempt your wife under your roof oh mr bazalgette is this the esteem you profess for me go to the devil shouted bazalgette in double ire at his own blunder and at being taken to task by his own telemachus he added but in a very different tone you are too good for this world the best things we say miss fire in conversation only secondrate shots hit the mind through the ear this we will suppose is why david derived no amusement or delectation from mr bazalgettes inadvertent but admirable bonmot go to the devil you are too good for this world he merely rose and said gravely heaven forgive you your unjust suspicions and god bless you for your other kindness goodby why where on earth are you going to stow away my things to pack up as they call it come back come back why what a terrible fellow you are you make no allowances for metaphors there forgive me and shake hands now sit down i esteem you more than ever you have come down from another age and a much better one than this now let us be calm quiet sensible tranquil hallo starting up in agitation a sudden light bursts on me you are in love and not with my wife then it is my ward it is too late to deny it sir that is far more serious than the other said bazalgette very gravely the old one would have been sure to cure you of your fancy for her soon or late but lucy now just look at that young buffers eyes glaring at us like a pair of saucers i am not listening papa i havent heard a word you and mr dodd have said about naughty ladies i have been such a good boy minding my puzzle i wish he may not have been minding ours instead muttered his sire and rang the bell and ordered the servant to take away master reginald and bring coffee the pair sipped their coffee in dead silence it was broken at last by david saying sadly and a little bitterly i fear sir your good opinion of me does not go the length of letting me come into your family the merchant seemed during the last five minutes to have undergone some starching process so changed was his whole manner now so distant dignified and stiff mr dodd said he i am in a difficult position insincerity is no part of my character when i say i have a regard for a man i mean it but i am the young ladys guardian sir she is a minor though on the verge of her majority and i cannot advise her to a match which in the received sense would be a very bad one for her on the other hand there are so many insuperable obstacles between you and her that i need not combat my personal sentiments so far as to act against you it would indeed hardly be just as i have surprised your secret unfairly though with no unfair intention my promise not to act hostilely implies that i shall not reveal this conversation to mrs bazalgette if i did i should launch the deadliest of all enemiesirritated vanityupon you for she certainly looks on you as her plaything not her nieces and you would instantly be the victim of her spite and of her influence over lucy if she discovered you have the insolence to escape her and pursue another of her sex i shall therefore keep silence and neutrality meantime in the character not of her guardian but of your friend i do strongly advise you not to think seriously of her she will never marry you she is a good kind amiable creature but still she is a girl of the worldhas all its lessons at her finger ends bless your heart these meek beauties are as ambitious as lucifer and this ones ambition is fed by constant admiration by daily matrimonial discussions with the old stager and i believe by a good offer every now and then which she refuses because she is waiting for a better come now it only wants one good wrench david interrupted him mildly then sir said he thoughtfully the upshot is that if she says yes you wont say no the mature merchant stared if said he and with this short sentence and a sardonic grin he broke off trying to fetter flame with flaxen band so nothing more was said or done that evening worth recording the next day being the day of the masquerade was devoted by the ladies to the making altering and trying on of dresses in their bedrooms this turned the downstairs rooms so dark and unlovely that the gentlemen deserted the house one after the other kenealy and talboys rode to see a cricket match ten miles off hardie drove into the town of and david paced the gravel walk in hopes that by keeping near the house he might find lucy alone for he was determined to know his fate and end his intolerable suspense he had paced the walk about an hour when fortune seemed to favor his desires lucy came out into the garden davids heart beat violently to his great annoyance mr fountain followed her out of the house and called her she stopped and he joined her and very soon uncle and niece were engaged in a conversation which seemed so earnest that david withdrew to another part of the garden not to interfere with them he waited and waited and waited till they should separate but no they walked more and more slowly and the conversation seemed to deepen in interest david chafed if he had known the nature of that conversation he would have writhed with torture as well as fretted with impatience for there the hand of her he loved was sought in marriage before his eyes and within a few steps of him on such threads hangs human life had he been at the hall door instead of in the garden he might have anticipated mr fountain as it was mr fountain stole the march on him chapter xv tomorrow lucy had agreed to sail and in the boat mr talboys was to ask and win her band but from the first mr fountain had never a childlike confidence in the scheme and his understanding kept rebelling more and more the man that means to pop pops said he one neednt go to seato pop terra firma is poppable on if it is nothing else these young fellows are like novices with a gun the bird must be in a position or they cant shoot itwith their popguns the young sparks in my day could pop them down flying we popped out walking popped out riding popped dancing popped psalmsinging talboys could not pop on horseback because the ladys pony fidgeted not his well it will be so tomorrow the boat will misbehave or the wind will be easterly and i shall be told southerly is the popping wind the truth is he is fainthearted his sires conquered england and he is afraid of a young girl ill end this nonsense he shall pop by proxy in pursuance of this resolve seeing his niece pass through the hall with her garden hat on he called to her that he would get his hat and join her they took one turn together almost in silence fountain was thinking how he should best open the subject and lucy waiting after her own fashion for she saw by the old mans manner he had something to say to her lucy my dear i leave you in a day or two so soon uncle and it depends on you whether i am to go away a happy or a disappointed old man at these words to which she was too cautious to reply in words lucy wore a puzzled air but underneath it a keen observer might have noticed her cheek pale a little a very little and a quiver of suppressed agitation pass over her like a current of air in summer over a smooth lake receiving no answer mr fountain went on to remind her that he was her only kinsman mrs bazalgette being her relation by halfblood only and told her that looking on himself as her father he had always been anxious to see her position in life secured before his own death i have been ambitious for you my dear said he but not more so than your beauty and accomplishments and your family name entitle us to be well my ambition for you and my affection for you are both about to be gratified at least it now rests with you to gratify them will you be mrs talboys lucy looked down and said demurely what a question for a third person to put should i put it if i had not a right i dont know you ought to know lucy mr talboys has authorized you dear he has then this is a formal proposal from mr talboys of course it is said the old gentleman fearlessly for lucys manner of putting these questions was colorless nobody would have guessed what she was at she now drew her arm round her uncles neck and kissed him which made him exult prematurely then dear uncle said she lovingly you must tell mr talboys that i thank him for the honor he does me and that i decline accept you mean no i dontha ha her laugh died rapidly away at sight of the effect of her words mr fountain started and his face turned red and pale alternately refuse my friendrefuse talboys in that way thoughtless girl you dont know what you are doing his family is all but noble what am i saying noble why half the house of peers is sprung from the dregs of the people and got there either by pettifogging in the courts of law or selling consciences in the lower house and of the other half that are gentlemen of descent not two in twenty can show a pedigree like talboys and with that name a princely mansionantiquity stamped on itstands in its own park in the middle of its vast estates with titledeeds in blackletter girl but uncle all this is encumbered it is false whoever told you so there is not a mortgage on any part of itonly a few trifling copyholds and peppercorn rents you misunderstand me i was going to say it is encumbered with a gentleman for whom i could never feel affection because he does not inspire me with respect nonsense he inspires universal respect it must be by his estates then not his character you know uncle the world is more apt to ask what has he then what is he he is a polished gentleman but not a wellbred one the best bred i ever saw then you never looked in a glass dear no dear uncle i will tell you mr talboys has seen the world has kept good society is at his ease a great point and is perfect in externals but his good manners arewhat shall i saycoat deep his politeness is not proof against temptation however petty the reason is it is only a spurious politeness real politeness is founded and built on the golden rule however delicate and artificial its superstructure may be but leaving out of the question the politeness of the heart he has not in any sense the true art of goodbreeding he has only the common traditions put him in a novel situation with no rules and examples to guide him he would be maladroit as a schoolboy he is just the counterpart of mr dodd in that respect poor mr dodd is always shocking one by violating the commonest rules of society but every now and then he bursts out with a flash of natural courtesy so bright so refined so original yet so worthy of imitation that you say to yourself this is geniusthe genius of goodbreeding mr fountain chafed with impatience during this tirade in which he justly suspected an attempt to fritter away a serious discussion come off your hobby lucy cried he and speak to me like a woman and like my niece if this is your objection overcome it for my sake i would dear said lucy but it is only one of my objections and by no means the most serious on being invited to come at once to the latter lucy hesitated would not that be unamiable on my part mr talboys has just paid me the highest compliment a gentleman can pay a lady it is for me to decline him courteously not abuse him to his friend and representative no humbug lucy if you please i am in no humor for it we should all be savages without a little of it i am waiting then pledge me your word of honor no word of what i now say to the disadvantage of poor mr talboys shall ever reach him you may take your oath of that then he is a detractor a character i despise who does he detract from i never heard him from all his superiorsin other words from everybody he meets did you ever know him fail to sneer at mr hardie oh that is the offense is it no it is the same with others there the other day mr dodd joined us on horseback he did not dress for the occasion he had no straps on he came in a hurry to have our society not to cut a dash but there was mr talboys who can only do this one thing well and who thanks to his servant had straps on sneering the whole time at mr dodd who has mastered a dozen far more difficult and more honorable accomplishments than putting on straps and sitting on horses but he is always backbiting and sneering he admires nothing and nobody he has admired you ever since he saw you what has he never sneered at me never ungrateful girl never how humiliating he takes me for his inferior his superiors he always sneers at if he had seen anything good or spirited in me he could not have helped detracting from me is not this a serious reasonthat i despise the person who now solicits my love honor and obedience well then there is anothera stronger still but perhaps you will call it a womans reason i know you dont like himthat is you fancy you dont and cant no uncle it is not that i dont like him it is that i hate him you hate him and mr fountain looked at her to see if it was his niece lucy who was uttering words so entirely out of character i am but a poor hater i have but little practice but with all the power of hating i do possess i hate that mr talboys oh how delicious it is to speak ones mind out nice and rudely it is a luxury i seldom indulge in yes uncle said lucy clinching her white teeth i hate that man and i did hope his proposal would come from himself then there would have been nothing to alloy my quiet satisfaction at mortifying one who is so ready to mortify others but no he has bewitched you and you take his part and you look vexed so all my pleasure is turned to pain it is all selfdeception gasped fountain in considerable agitation you girls are always deceiving yourselves you none of you hate any manunless you love him he tells me you have encouraged him of late you had better tell me that is a lie a lie uncle what an expression mr talboys is a gentleman he would not tell a falsehood i presume aha it is true then you have encouraged him a little there you see the moment we come from the generalities to facts what a simpleton you are proved to be come now did you or did you not agree to go in a boat with him i did dear that was a pretty strong measure lucy very strong i think i can tell you i hesitated now you see how you have mistaken your own feelings lucy hung her head oh uncle you call me simpleand look at you fancy not seeing why i agreed to godans cette galere it was that mr talboys might declare himself and so i might get rid of him forever i saw that if i could not bring him to the point he would dangle about me for years and perhaps at last succeed in irritating me to rudeness but now of course i shall stay on shore with my uncle tomorrow quirais je faire dana cette galere you have done it all for me oh my dear dear uncle i am so grateful to you she showed symptoms of caressing mr fountain but he recoiled from her angrily viper but no this is not you there is a deeper hand than you in all this this is that mrs bazalgettes doings no indeed uncle give me a proof it is not with pleasure any proof that is in my power then promise me not to marry mr hardie my dear uncle mr hardie has never asked me but he will what right have i to say so what right have i to constitute mr hardie my admirer i would not for all the world put it into any gentlemans power to say why say no miss fountain before i have asked you to say yes oh and with this lucy put her face into her hands but they were not large enough to hide the deep blush that suffused her whole face at the bare idea of being betrayed into an indelicacy of this sort how could he say that how could he know said mr fountain pettishly uncle i cannot i dare not you and my aunt hate one another so you might be tempted to tell her and she would be sure to tell him besides i cannot my very instinct revolts from it it would not be modest i love you uncle let me know your wishes and have some faith in my affection but pray do not press me further oh what have i done to be spoken of with so many gentlemen lucy was in evident agitation and the blushes glowed more and more round her snowy hands and between her delicate fingers and there is something so sacred about the modesty alarmed of an intelligent young womanit is a feeling which however fantastical is so genuine in her and so manifestly intense beyond all we can ourselves feel of the kind that no man who is not utterly stupid or depraved can see it without a certain awe even mr fountain who looked on lucys distress as transcendent folly with a dash of hypocrisy could not go on making her cheek burn so there there cried he dont torment yourself lucy i will spare your fanciful delicacy though you have no pity on meon your poor old uncle whose heart you will break if you decline this match at these words and the old mans change from anger to sadness lucy looked up in dismay and the vivid color died like a retiring wave out of her cheek you look surprised lucy what do you think this will not be a heartbreaking disappointment to me if you knew how i have schemed for itwhat i have done and endured to bring it about to quarter the arms of fontaine and talboys i put by the pounds directly and as much more of my own that you should not go into that noble family without a proper settlement it was the dream of my heart i could have died contented the next hour more fool i to care for anybody but myself your selfish people escape these bitter disappointments well it is a lesson from this hour i will live for myself and care for nobody for nobody cares for me these words uttered with great agitation and i believe with perfect sincerity on his own unselfishness and hard fate were terrible to lucy she wreathed her arms suddenly round him oh uncle she cried despairingly kill me send me to heaven send me to my mother but dont stab me with such bitter words and she trembled with an emotion so much more powerful and convulsing than his in which temper had a large share that she once more cowed him there there he muttered i dont want to kill you child god knows or to hurt you in any way lucy trembled and tried to smile the good nature which was the upper crust of this mans character got the better of him there there dont distress yourself so i know who i have to thank for all this she has not the power said lucy in a faint voice to make me ungrateful to you mind is more rapid than lightning at this moment in the middle of a sentence it flashed across lucy that her aunt had convinced her sore against her will that there was a strong element of selfishness in mr fountain but it is that he deceives himself thought lucy he would sacrifice my happiness to his hobby and think he has done it for love of me enlightened by this rapid reflection she did not say to him as one of his own sex would look in your own heart and you will see that all this is not love of me but of your own schemes oh dear no that would not have been the woman she took him round the neck and fixing her sapphire eyes lovingly on his she said it is for love of me you set your heart on this great match you wish to see me well settled in the world and above all happy of course it is i told you so what other object can i have then if you saw me wretched and degraded in my own eyes your heart would bleed for your poor niecetoo late well uncle i love you too and i save you this day from remorse oh think what it must be to hate and despise a man and link yourself body and soul to that man for life oh think and shudder with me i have a quick eye i have seen your lip curl with contempt when that fool has been talkingah you blush you are too much his superior in everything but fortune not to despise him at heart see the thing as it is speak to me as you would if my mother stood here beside us uncle and to speak to me you must look her in the face could you say to me before her i love you marry a man we both despise mr fountain made no answer he was disconcerted nothing is so easy to resist as logic solo we see it as a general rule resisted with great success in public and private every day but when it comes in good company a voice of music an angel face gentle persuasive caresses and imploring eyes it ceases to revolt the understanding and so caught in his own trap foiled baffled soothed caressed all in one breath mr fountain hung his head and could not immediately reply lucy followed up her advantage no cried she say to me i love you lucy marry nobody stay with your uncle and find your happiness in contributing to his comfort what is the use my saying that when i have got mother bazalgette against me and her shopkeeper never mind uncle you say it and time will show whether your influence is small with me and my affections small for you and she looked in his face with glistening eyes well then said he i do say it and i suppose that means i must urge you no more about poor talboys a shower of kisses descended upon him that moment moral lose no time in sealing a good bargain come now lucy you must do me a favor oh thank you thank you what is it ah but it is about talboys too never mind faltered lucy if it is anything short of full stop it is a long way short of that look here lucy i must tell you the truth he intends to ask your hand himself he confided this to me but he never authorized me to commit him as i have done so that this conversation cannot be acted on it must be a secret between you and me oh dear and i thought i had got rid of him so nicely dont be alarmed groaned fountain such matches as this can always be dropped the difficulty is to bring them on all i ask of you then is not to make mischief between me and my friend the proudest man in england if you dont value his friendship i do you must not let him know i have got him insulted by a refusal for instance you had better go out sailing with him tomorrow as if nothing had passed will your affection for me carry you as far as that the proposal was wormwood to lucy so she smiled and said eagerly is that all why i will do it with pleasure dear it is not like being in the same boat with him for life you know can you give me nothing more than that to do for you no it does not do to test peoples affection too severely you have shown me that go on with your walk lucy i shall go in may i not come with you no my head aches with all this if i dont mind i shall eat no dinner agitation and vexation dont agree with me i have carefully avoided them all my life i must go in and lie down for an hour and he left her rather abruptly she looked after him her subtle eye noticed directly that he walked a little more feebly than usual she ascribed this to his disappointment justly perhaps for at his age the body has less elastic force to resist a mental blow the sight of him creeping away disappointed and leaning heavier than usual on his stick knocked at her cool but affectionate heart she began to cry bitterly when he was quite out of sight she turned and paced the gravel slowly and sadly it was new to her to refuse her uncle anything still more strange to have to refuse him a serious wish she was prepared thoroughly prepared for the proposal but not to find the old mans heart so deeply set upon it a wild impulse came over her to call him back and sacrifice herself but the high spirit and intelligence that lay beneath her tenderness and complaisance stood firm yet she felt almost guilty and very very unhappy as we call it at her age she kept sighing poor uncle and paced the gravel very slowly hanging her sweet head and crying as she went at the end of the walk david dodd stood suddenly before her he came flurried on his own account but stopped thunderstruck at her tears what is the matter miss lucy said he anxiously oh nothing mr dodd and they flowed afresh can i do anything for you miss lucy no mr dodd wont you tell me what is the matter are you not friends with me today i was put out by a very foolish circumstance mr dodd and it is one with which i shall not trouble you nor any person of sense i prefer to retain your sympathy by not revealing the contemptible cause of my babyishthere she shook her head proudly as if tears were to be dispersed like dewdrops there she repeated and at this second effort she smiled radiantly it is like the sun coming out after a shower cried david rapturously that reminds me i must be going in mr dodd dont say that miss lucy what for to arrange another shower one of pearls on a dress i am to wear tonight david sighed ah miss lucy at sight of me you always make for the hall door lucy colored oh do i i really was not aware of that then i suppose i am afraid of you is that what you would insinuate no miss lucy you are not afraid of me but i sometimes fear and he hesitated it must blow very hard that day said lucy with a world of politeness her tongue was too quick for him he found it so and announced the fact after his fashion i cant tack fast enough to follow you said he despondently but you are not required to follow me replied this amiable eel with hypocritical benignity i am going to my aunts room to do what i told you i leave you in charge of the quarterdeck so saying she walked slowly up the steps and left david standing sorrowfully on the gravel at the top step miss lucy turned and inquired gently when he was to sail he told her the ship was expected to anchor off the fort tomorrow but she would not sail till she had got all her passengers on board oh said lucy with an air of reflection she then leaned in an easy posture against the wall and whether it was that she relented a little or that having secured her retreat she was now indifferent to flight certain it is that she did after her own fashion what many a daughter of eve has done before her and many a duchess and many a dairymaid will do after la fountain and i are gone from earth a minute ago it had been she must go directly the more opposition to her departure the more inexorable the necessity for her going opposition withdrawn and the door open she stayed no end full twenty minutes did that young lady stand there unsolicited and chat with david dodd in the kindest sweetest most amicable way imaginable she little knew she had an auditora female auditor keen as a lynx all this day reginald george bazalgette esq might have been defined a pest in search of a playmate tom had got a holiday lucy only came out of her workshop to be seized by mr fountain david who was waiting in the garden for lucy begged reginald to excuse him for once the young gentleman had recourse as a pis aller to his mamma he invaded her bedroom and besought her piteously to play at battledoor that lady sighing deeply at being taken from her dress consented her soul not being in it she played very badly her cub did not fail to tell her so why i can keep up a hundred with mr dodd said he oh we all know mr dodd is perfection said the lady with a sneer she was piqued with david he had gone and left her in a brutal way to make his apologies to lucy no he is not said reginald i have found him out he is as unjust as the rest of them dear me and pray what has he done i will tell you mamma if you will promise not to tell papa because he told me not to listen and i didnt listen mamma because you know a gentleman always keeps his word but they talked so loud the words would come into my ear i could not keep them out mamma are there any naughty ladies here no my dear then what did papa mean warning mr dodd against one mrs bazalgette began to listen as he wished oh he called her all the names he said she was a statue of flirtation who lucy lucy no the naughty ladythe one that had twelve husbands he kept warning him and warning him and then mr dodd and papa they began to quarrel almost because mr dodd said the naughty lady was quite young and papa said she was ever so old mr dodd said she was twentyone but papa told him she must be more than that because she had a child that would be fifteen years old only it died how old would sister emily be if she was alive mamma la mamma how pretty you are you have got red cheeks like lucyredder oh ever so much redderand in general they are so pale before dinner let me kiss you mamma i do love the ladies when their cheeks are red there there now go on dear tell me some more it is very interesting isnt it dear mamma it is amusing at all events no it is not amusingat least what came after isnt it is wicked it is unjust it is abominable tell me dear it turned out it wasnt the naughty lady mr dodd was in love for and who do you think he is in love of i have not an idea my lucy nonsense child no no mamma it is not he owned it plump are you quite sure love upon my honor what did they say next oh next papa began to talk his fine words that i dont know what the meaning of them is one bit but mr dodd he could make them out i suppose for he said so then the upshot is there now what is upshot i dont know how stupid grownup people are they keep using words that one doesnt know the meaning of never mind love tell me what came after upshot said mrs bazalgette soothingly with great apparent calmness and flashing eye how kind you are today mamma that is twice you have called me love and three times dear only think i should love you if you were always so kind and your cheeks as red as they are now never mind my cheeks what did mr dodd say try and remembercomethe upshot was the upshot waswhat was the upshot i forget no i remember the upshot was if lucy said yes papa would not say no that meant to marry him now didnt you promise me her ever so long agothe day you and i agreed if i went a whole day without being naughty once i should have her for ever and ever and i did go go to lucys room and tell her to come to me said mrs bazalgette in a stern thoughtful voice which startled poor reginald coming so soon after the calinerie however he told her it was no use his going to lucys room for she was out in the garden he had seen her there walking with mr fountain reginald then ran to the window which commanded the garden to look for lucy he had scarcely reached it when he began to squeak wildly come here come here come here mrs bazalgette was at the window in a moment and lo at the end of the garden walking slowly side by side were lucy and mr dodd ridiculous as it may appear a pang of jealousy shot through the married flirts heart that made her almost feel sick this was followed at the interval of half a second by as pretty a flame of hatred as ever the spretoe injuria formoe lighted up in a coquettes heart doubt drove in its smaller sting besides and at sight of the couple she resolved to have better evidence than reginalds especially as to lucys sentiments the plan she hit upon was effective but vulgar and must not be witnessed by a boy of inconvenient memory and mistimed fluency she got rid of him with highprincipled dexterity reginald said she sadly you are a naughty boy a disobedient boy to listen when your papa told you not and to tell me a pack of falsehoods i must either tell your papa or i must punish you myself i prefer to do it myself he would whip you so with this she suddenly opened her dressingroom door and pushed the terrible infant in and locked the door she then told him through the keyhole he had better cease yelling because if he kept quiet his punishment would only last half an hour and she flew downstairs there was a large hothouse with two doors one of which came very near to the house door that opened into the garden mrs bazalgette entered the hothouse at the other end and hidden by the exotic trees and flowers made rapidly for the door lucy and david must pass she found it wide open she half shut it and slipped behind it listening like a hare and spying like a hawk through the hinges and strange as it may appear she had an idea she should make a discovery as the finished sportsman watches a narrow ride in the wood not despairing by a snapshot to bag his hare as she crosses it though seen but for a moment so the bazalgette felt sure that as the couple passed her ambush something either in the two sentences they might utter or more probably in their tones and general manner would reveal to one of her experience on what footing they were a shrewd calculation but things will be things they take such turns i might without exaggeration say twists that calculation is baffled and prophecy dissolved into pitch and toss this thing turned just as not expected primo instead of getting only a snapshot mrs bazalgette heard every word of a long conversation and secundo when she had heard it she could not tell for certain on what footing the lady and gentleman were at first from their familiarity she inclined to think they were lovers but the more she listened the more doubtful she seemed lucy was the chief speaker and what she said showed an undisguised interest in her companion but the subject accounted in great measure for that she was talking of his approaching voyage of the dangers and hardships of his profession and of his return two years hence his chances of promotion etc but here was no proof positive of love they were acquaintances of some standing then lucys manner struck her as rather amicable than amorous she was calm kind selfpossessed and almost voluble as for david he only got in a word here and there when he did there was something so different in his voice from anything he had ever bestowed on her that she hated him and longed to stick scissors into him from the rear unseen at last lucy suddenly recollected or seemed to recollect she was busy and retired hastilyso hastily that david saw too late his opportunity lost but the music of her voice had so charmed him that he did not like to interrupt it even to speak of that which was nearest his heart david sighed deeply standing there alone mrs bazalgette clinched her little fists and looked round for the means of vengeance david went down on his knees la bazalgette glared through the crack and wondered what on earth he was at now oh he was praying he loves her he is eccentricity itself so he is praying for her and on my doorsteps the householder wounded as well as the flirt it was lucky she had not a thunderbolt in her eyeshakespeare or a celestial messenger of the wrong sort would have descended on the devout mariner it was more than mrs bazalgette could bear she had now and then not often unladylike impulses one of them had set her crouching behind the door of an outhouse and listening through a crack and now she had another an irresistible one it was to take that empty flowerpot fling it as hard as ever she could at the devotee then shut the door quick fly out at the other door and leave her faithless swain in the agony of knowing himself detected and exposed by some unknown and undiscoverable enemy for a vengeance extemporized in less than half a second this was very respectable well she clawed the flowerpot noiselessly put her other hand on the door cast a hasty glance at the means of retreat andthings took another twist she heard the rustle of a coming gown and drew back again and out came lucy and nearly ran over david who was not on his knees after all but down on his nose prostrate orientally the fact is lucy among her other qualities good and bad was a born housewife and solicitously careful of certain odds and ends called property she found she had dropped one of her gloves in the garden and she came back in a state of disproportionate uneasiness to find it and nearly ran over david dodd what are you doing mr dodd david arose from his oriental position and being a young man whose impulse always was to tell the simple truth replied i was kissing the place where you stood so long he did not feel he had done anything extraordinary so he gave her this information composedly but her face was scarlet in an instant and he seeing that began to blush too for once lucys tact was baffled she did not know what on earth to say and she stood blushing like a girl of fifteen then she tried to turn it off mr dodd how can you be so ridiculous said she affecting humorous disdain but david was not to be put down now he was launched i am not ridiculous for loving and worshiping you for you are worthy of even more love than any human heart can hold oh hush mr dodd i must not hear this miss lucy i cant keep it any longeryou must you shall hear me you can despise my love if you will but you shall know it before you reject it mr dodd you have every right to be heard but let me persuade you not to insist oh why did i come back the first moment i saw you miss lucy it was a new life to me i never looked twice at any girl before it is not your beauty onlyoh no it is your goodnessgoodness such as i never thought was to be found on earth dont turn your head from me i know my defects could i look on you and not see them my manners are blunt and rudeoh how different from yours but you could soon make me a fine gentleman i love you so and i am only the first mate of an indiaman but i should be a captain next voyage miss lucy and a sailor like me has no expenses all he has is his wifes the first lady in the land will not be petted as you will if you will look kindly on me listen to me trying to tempt her no miss lucy i have nothing to offer you worth your acceptance only my love no man ever loved woman as i love you it is not love it is worship it is adoration ah she is going to speak to me at last lucy presented at this moment a strange contrast of calmness and agitation her bosom heaved quickly and she was pale but her voice was calm and though gentle decided i know you love me mr dodd and i feared this i have tried to save you the mortification of being declined by one who in many things is your inferior i have even been rude and unkind to you forgive me for it i meant it kindly i regret it now mr dodd i thank you for the honor you do me but i cannot accept your love there was a pause but davids tongue seemed glued to the roof of his mouth he was not surprised yet he was stupefied when the blow came at last he gasped out you love some other man lucy was silent answer me for pitys sake give me something to help me you have no right to ask me such a question buti have no attachment mr dodd ah then one word more is it because you cannot love me or because i am poor and only first mate of an indiaman that i will not answer you have no right to question a lady why shestay you wish to despise me well why not if that will cure you of this unfortunatethink what you please of me mr dodd murmured lucy sadly ah you know i cant cried david despairingly i know that you esteem me more than i deserve well i esteem you mr dodd why then can we not be friends you have only to promise me you will never return to this subjectcome me promise not to love you what is the use me be your friend and nothing more and stand looking on at the heaven that is to be anothers and never to be mine it is my turn to decline never betrothed lovers or strangers but nothing between it would drive me mad away from you and out of sight of your sweet face i may make shift to live and go through my duty somehow for my mothers and sisters sake you are wiser than i was mr dodd yes we must part of course we must i have got my answer and a kinder one than i deserve and now what is the polite thing for me to do i wonder david said this with terrible bitterness you frighten me sighed lucy dont you be frightened sweet angel there i have been used to obey orders all my life and i am like a ship tossed in the breakers and you are calmcalm as death give me my orders for gods sake it is not for me to command you mr dodd i have forfeited that right but listen to her who still asks to be your friend and she will tell you what will be best for you and kindest and most generous to her tell me about that last the other is a waste of words i will then your sister is somewhere in the neighborhood she is at how did you know i saw her on your arm i am glad she is so nearoh so glad bid my uncle and aunt goodby make some excuse go to your sister at once she loves you she is better than i am if you will but see us as we really are go to her at once faltered lucy who disliked eve and eve her i will i will i have thought too little of my own flesh and blood shall i go now yes murmured lucy softly trying to disarm the fatal word forget meandforgive me and with this last word scarce audible she averted her face and held out her hand with angelic dignity modesty and pity the kind words and the gentle action brought down the stout heart that had looked death in the face so often without flinching forgive you sweet angel he cried i pray heaven to bless you and to make you as happy as i am desolate for your sake oh you show me more and more what i lose this day god bless you god bless and davids heart filled to choking and he burst out sobbing despairingly and the hot tears ran suddenly from his eyes over her hand as he kissed and kissed it then with an almost savage feeling of shame for these were not eyes that were wont to weep he uttered one cry of despair and ran away leaving her pale and panting heavily she looked piteously at her hand wet with a heros tears and for the second time today her own began to gush she felt a need of being alone she wanted to think on what she had done she would hide in the garden she ran down the steps lo there was mr hardie coming up the gravelwalk she uttered a little cry of impatience and dashed impetuously into the hothouse driving the halfopen door before her with her person as well as her arm a scream of terror and pain issued from behind it with a crash of pottery lucy wheeled round at the sound and there was her aunt flattened against the flowerframe lucy stood transfixed but soon her look of surprise gave way to a frown ay and a somber one chapter xvi that readyminded lady extricated herself from the pots and wriggled out of the moral situation i was a listener dear an unwilling listener but now i do not regret it how nobly you behaved and with this she came at her with open arms crying my own dear niece her own dear niece recoiled with a shiver and put up both her hands as a shield oh dont touch me please i never heard of a lady listening she then turned her back on her aunt in a somewhat uncourtierlike manner and darted out of the place every fiber of her frame strung up tight with excitement she felt she was not the calm dispassionate being of yesterday and hurried to her own room and locked herself in mrs bazalgette remained behind in a state of bitter mortification and breathing fury on her small scale but what could she do david would be out of her reach in a few minutes and lucy was scarce vulnerable in the absence of any definite spite she thought she could not go wrong in thwarting whatever lucy wished and her wish had been that david should go besides if she kept him in the house who knows she might pique him with lucy and even yet turn him her way so she lay in wait for him in the hall he soon appeared with his bag in his hand she inquired with great simplicity where he was going he told her he was going away she remonstrated first tenderly then almost angrily we all counted on you to play the violin we cant dance to the piano alone i am very sorry but i have got my orders then this subtle lady said carelessly lucy will be au desespoir she will get no dancing she said to me just now aunt do try and persuade mr dodd to stay over the ball we shall miss him so when did she say that just this minute standing at the door there very well then ill stay over the ball and without a word more he carried his bag and violincase up to his room again oh how la bazalgette hated him she now resigned all hope of fighting with him and contented herself with the pleasure of watching him and lucy together one would be wretched and the other must be uncomfortable lucy did not come down to dinner she was lying down with headache she even sent a message to mrs bazalgette to know whether she could be dispensed with at the ball answer impossible at halfpast eight she got up put on her costume took it off again and dressed in white watered silk her assumption of a character was confined to wearing a little crown rising to a peak in front many of the guests had arrived when she glided into the room looking every inch a queen david was dazzled at her and awestruck at her beauty and mien and at his own presumption her eye fell on him she gave a little start but passed on without a word the carpets had been taken up and the dancing began mrs bazalgette arranged that lucy and david should play pianoforte and violin until some lady could be found to take her part i incline to think mrs bazalgette spiteful as mortified vanity is apt to be did not know the depth of anguish her subtle vengeance inflicted on david dodd he was pale and stern with the bitter struggle for composure he ground his teeth fixed his eyes on the musicbook and plowed the merry tunes as the fainting ox plows the furrow he dared not look at lucy nor did he speak to her more than was necessary for what they were doing nor she to him she was vexed with him for subjecting himself and her to unnecessary pain and in the eye of societyher divinity another unhappy one was mr fountain he sat disconsolate on a seat all alone mrs bazalgette fluttered about like a butterfly and sparkled like a chinese firework two young ladies sisters went to the piano to give miss fountain an opportunity of dancing she danced quadrilles with four or five gentlemen including her special admirers she declined to waltz i have a little headache nothing to speak of she then sat down to the piano again i can play alone mr dodd you have not danced at all i am not in the humor very well this time they played some of the tunes they had rehearsed together that happy evening and davids lip quivered lucy eyed him unobserved was this wiseto subject yourself to this i must obey orders whatever it costs meri tum ti tum ti tum ti tum who ordered you to neglect my adviceri tum tum tum you didri tum ti tum tiddy iddy a look of silent disdain ri tum ti tum tiddy iddy ah perdona for relating things as they happen and not as your grand writers pretend they happen between the quadrilles she asked an explanation your aunt met me with my bag in my hand and told me you wanted me to play to the company when he said this david heard a sound like the click of a trigger he looked up it was lucy clinching her teeth convulsively but time was up the woman of the world must go on like the prizefighter the couples were waiting ri tum ti tum ti tum ti tum tiddy iddy for all that she did not finish the tune in the middle of it she said to david ri tum ti tum can you get through this without meri tum if i can get through life without you i can surely get through this twaddle ri tum ti tum ti tum ti tum tiddy iddy lucy started from her seat leaving david plowing solo she started from her seat and stood a moment looking like an angel stung by vipers her eye went all round the room in one moment in search of some one to blight it surprised mr hardie and mrs bazalgette sitting together and casting ironical glances pianoward so she has been betraying to mr hardie the secret she gained by listening thought lucy the pair were probably enjoying davids mortification his misery she walked very slowly down the room to this couple she looked them long and full in the face with that confronting yet overlooking glance which women of the world can command on great occasions it fell and pressed on them both like lead they could not have told you why they looked at one another ruefully when she had passed them and then their eyes followed her they saw her walk straight up to her uncle and sit down by him and take his hand they exchanged another uneasy look uncle said lucy speaking very quickly you are unhappy i am the cause i am come to say that i promise you not to marry anyone my aunt shall propose to me my dear girl then you wont marry that shopkeeper there what need of names still less of epithets i will marry no friend of hers ah now you are my brothers daughter again no i love you no better than i did this morning but the celestial happiness diffused itself over old fountains face and lucy glided back to the piano just as the quadrille ended give me your arm mr dodd said she authoritatively she took his arm and made the tour of the room leaning on him and chatting gayly she introduced him to the best people and contrived to appear to the whole room joyous and flattered leaning on davids arm the young fellows envied him so every now and then david felt her noble white arm twitch convulsively and her fingers pinch the cloth of his sleeve where it was loose she guided him to the supperroom it was empty oblige me with a glass of water he gave it her she drank it mr dodd the advice i gave you with my own lips i never retracted my aunt imposed upon you it was done to mortify you it has failed as you may have observed my head aches so it is intolerable when they ask you where i am say i am unwell and have retired to my room i shall not be at breakfast directly after breakfast go to your sister and tell her your friend lucy declined you though she knows your value and would not let you be mortified by nullities and heartless fools goodby mr dodd try and believe that none of us you leave in this house are worth remembering far less regretting she vanished haughtily david crept back to the ballroom it seemed dark by comparison now she who lent it luster was gone he stayed a few minutes then heavyhearted to bed the next morning he shook hands with mr bazalgette the only one who was up kissed the terrible infant who suddenly remembering his many virtues formally forgave him his one piece of injustice and as he came so he went away his bag on his shoulder and his violincase in his hand he went to cousin mary and asked for eve cousin marys face turned red you will find her at no in this street she is gone into lodgings the fact is the cousins had had a tiff and eve had left the house that moment oh my sweet my beloved heroinesyou young vipers when will you learn to be faultless like other people you have turned my face into a peony blushing for you at every fourth page david came into her apartment he smiled sweetly but sadly well it is all over i have offered and been declined at seeing him so quiet and resigned eve burst out crying dont you cry dear said david it is best so it is almost a relief anything before the suspense i was enduring then eve recovering her spirits by the help of anger began to abuse lucy for a coldhearted deceitful girl but david stopped her sternly not a word against hernot a word i should hate anyone that miscalled her she speaks well of you eve why need you speak ill of her she and i parted friends and friends let us be there is no hate can lie alongside love in a true heart no let nobody speak of her at all to me i shant my thoughts they are my own go to your sister said she and here i am and i beg your pardon eve for neglecting you as i have of late oh never mind that david our affection will outlast this folly many a long year please god your hand in mine eve my lamb and let us talk of ourselves and mother the time is short they sat hand in hand and never mentioned lucys name again and strange to say it was david who consoled eve for now the battle was lost her spirit seemed to have all deserted her and she kept bursting out crying every now and then irrelevantly it was three in the afternoon david was sitting by the window and eve packing his chest in the same room not to be out of his sight a minute when suddenly he started up and cried there she is and an instinctive unreasonable joy illumined his face the next moment his countenance fell the carriage passed down the street i remember now muttered david i heard she was to go sailing and mr talboys was to be skipper of the boat ah well well let them sail david it is not your business that it is not evenobodys less than mine eve there is plenty of wind blowing up from the noreast is there i am afraid that will bring your ship down quick yes but it is not that i am afraid that lubber wont think of looking to windward nonsense about the wind it is a beautiful day come david it is no use lighting against nature put on your hat then and run down to the beach and see the last of her only for my sake dont let the others see you to jeer you no no and mind and be back to dinner at four i have got a nice roast fowl for you ay ay a little before four oclock a sailor brought a note from david written hastily in pencil it was sent up to eve she read it and clasped her hands vehemently oh david she was born to be your destruction chapter xvii mr fountain miss fountain and mr talboys started to go on the boating expedition as they were getting into the boat mr fountain felt a little ill and begged to be excused mr talboys offered to return with him he declined have your little sail i will wait at the inn for you this pantomime had i blush to say been arranged beforehand miss fountain we may be sure saw through it but she gave no sign a lofty impassibility marked her demeanor and she let them do just what they liked with her the boat was launched the foresail set and fountain remained on shore in anything but a calm and happy state but friendships like these are not free from dross and i must confess that among the feelings which crossed his mind was a hope that talboys would pop and be refused as he had been why should he fountain monopolize defeat we should share all things with a friend meantime by one of those caprices to which her sex are said to be peculiarly subject lucy seemed to have given up all intention of carrying out her plan for getting rid of mr talboys instead of leading him on to his fate she interposed a subtle but almost impassable barrier between him and destruction her manner and deportment were of a nature to freeze declarations of love upon the human lip she leaned back languidly and imperially on the luxurious cushions and listlessly eyed the sky and the water and ignored with perfect impartiality all the living creatures in the boat mr talboys endeavored in vain to draw her out of this languid mood he selected an interesting subject of conversation tohimself he told her of his feats yachting in the mediterranean he did not tell her though that his yacht was sailed by the master and not by him her proprietor in reply to all this lucy dropped out languid monosyllables at last talboys got piqued and clapped on sail there had not been a breath of air until half an hour before they started but now a stiff breeze had sprung up so they had smooth water and yet plenty of wind and the boat cut swiftly throughthe bubbling water she walks well said the yachtsman lucy smiled a gracious though still rather too queenly assent i think the motion was pleasing her lively motion is very agreeable to her sex this is a very fast boat said mr talboys i should like to try her speed what do you say miss fountain with all my heart said lucy in a tone that expressed her utter indifference here is this lateenrigged boat creeping down on our quarter we will stand east till she runs down to us and then we will run by her and challenge her accordingly talboys stood east but he did not get his race for somewhat to his surprise the lateenrigged boat instead of holding her course which was about southsouthwest bore up directly and stood east keeping about half a mile to windward of talboys this puzzled talboys they are afraid to try it said he if they are afraid of us sailing on a wind they would not have much chance with us in beating to windward a lugger can lie two points nearer the wind than a schooner all this science was lost on lucy she lay back languid and listless mr talboys crew consisted of a man and a boy he steered the boat himself he ordered them to go about and sail due west it was no sooner done than lo and behold the schooner came about and sailed west keeping always half a mile to windward that boat is following us miss fountain what for inquired she is it my uncle coming after us no i see no one aboard but a couple of fishermen they are not fishermen put in the boy they are sailorscoastguard men likely besides said mr talboys your uncle would run down to us at once but these keep waiting on us and dogging us confound their impudence it is all fancy said lucy run away as fast as you can that way and she pointed down the wind and you will see nobody will take the trouble to run after us hoist the mainsail cried talboys they had hitherto been sailing under the foresail only in another minute they were running furiously before the wind with both sails set the boat yawed and lucy began to be nervous still the increased rapidity of motion excited her agreeably the lateenschooner sailing under her foresail only luffed directly and stood on in the luggers wake lucys cheek burned but she said nothing there cried talboys now do you believe me i think we gain on her though we are going three knots to her two sir said the old man but it is by her good will that is the fastest boat in the town sailing on a wind at beating to windward we could tackle her easy enough but not at running free ah there goes her mainsel up i thought she would not be long before she gave us that oh how beautiful cried lucy it is like a falcon or an eagle sailing down on us it seems all wings why dont we spread wings too and fly away you see miss explained the boatman that schooner works her sails different from us going down wind she can carry her mainsel on one side of the craft and her foresel on the other by that she keeps on an even keel and what is more her mainsel does not take the wind out of her foresel bless you that little schooner would run past the fastest frigate in the kings service with the wind dead aft as we have got it now she is coming up with us hand over head and as stiff on her keel as a rock this is her point of sailing beating to windward is ours why if they aint reefing the foresel to make the race even and there go three reefs into her mainsel too the old boatman scratched his head who is aboard her dick they are strangers to me by taking in so many reefs the lateen had lowered her rate of sailing and she now followed in their wake keeping a quarter of a mile to windward talboys lost all patience who is it i wonder that has the insolence to dog us so and he looked keenly at miss fountain she did not think herself bound to reply and gazed with a superior air of indifference on the sky and the water i will soon know said talboys what does it matter inquired lucy probably somebody who is wasting his time as we are the road we are on is as free to him as to us suggested the old boatman with a fine sense of natural justice he added but if you will take my advice sir you will shorten sail and put her about for home it is blowing half a gale of wind and the sea will be getting up and that wont be agreeable for the young lady gale of wind nonsense said talboys it is a fine breeze oh thank you sir said lucy to the old man i love the sea but i should not like to be out in a storm the old boatman grinned storm is a word that an old salt reserves for one of those hurricanes that blow a field of turnips flat and teeth down your throat you can turn round and lean your back against it like a post and a carrioncrow making for the next parish gets fanned into another county that is a storm the old boatman went forward grinning and he and his boy lowered the mainsail then talboys at the helm brought the boats head round to the wind she came down to her bearings directly which is as much as to say that to lucy she seemed to be upsetting lucy gave a little scream the sail too made a report like the crack of a pistol oh what is that cried lucy wind mum replied the boatman composedly what is that purple line on the water sir out there a long way beyond the other boat wind mum it seems to move it is coming this way ay mum that is a thing that always makes to leeward said the old fellow grinning ill take in a couple of reefs before it comes to us meantime the moment the lugger lowered her mainsail the schooner divining as it appeared her intention did the same and luffed immediately and was on the new tack first of the two ay my lass said the old boatman you are smartly handled no doubt but your square stern and your tryhanglar sail they will take you to leeward of us pretty soon do what you can the event seemed to justify this assertion the little lugger was on her best point of sailing and in about ten minutes the distance between the two boats was slightly but sensibly diminished the lateen no doubt observed this for she began to play the game of short tacks and hoisted her mainsail and carried on till she seemed to sail on her beamends to make up as far as possible by speed and smartness for what she lost by rig in beating to windward they go about quicker than we do said talboys of course they do they have not got to dip their sail as we have every time we tack this was the true solution but mr talboys did not accept it we are not so smart as we ought to be now you go to the helm and i and the boy will dip the lug the old boatman took the helm as requested and gave the word of command to mr talboys stand by the foretack yes said mr talboys here i am let go the foretack and contemporaneously with the order he brought the boats head round now this operation is always a nice one particularly in these small luggers where the lug has to be dipped that is to say lowered and raised again on the opposite side of the mast for the lug should not be lowered a moment too soon or the boat losing her way would not come round nor a moment too late lest the sail owing to the new position the boat is taking under the influence of the rudder should receive the wind while between the wind and the mast and so the craft be taken aback than which nothing can well happen more disastrous mr talboys though not the accomplished sailor he thought himself knew this as well as anybody and with the boys help he lowered the sail at the right moment but getting his head awkwardly in the way the yard in coming down hit him on the nose and nearly knocked him on to his beamends it would have been better if it had done so quite instead of bounding off his nose on to his shoulder and there resting for as it was the descent of the sail being thus arrested halfway at the critical moment and the boats head coming round all the same a gust of wind caught the sail and wrapped it tight round the mast to windward the boy uttered a cry of terror so significant that lucy trembled all over and by an uncontrollable impulse leaned despairingly back and waved her white handkerchief toward the antagonist boat the old boatman with an oath darted forward with an agility he could not have shown ashore the effect on the craft was alarming if the whole sail had been thus taken aback she would have gone down like lead for as it was she was driven on her side and at the same time driven back by the stern the whole sea seemed to rise an inch above her gunwale the water poured into her at every drive the gusts of wind gave her and the only wonder seemed why the waves did not run clean over her in vain the old boatman cursing and swearing tugged at the canvas to free it from the mast it was wrapped round it like dejaniras shirt and with as fatal an effect the boat was filling and as this brought her lower in the water and robbed her of much of her buoyancy and as the fatal cause continued immovable her destruction was certain every cheek was blanched with fear but lucys and hers was red as fire ever since she waved her handkerchief so powerful is modesty with her sex a true virgin can blush in deaths very grasp in the midst of this agitation and terror suddenly the boat was hailed they all looked up and there was the lateen coming tearing down on them under all her canvas both her broad sails spread out to the full one on each side she seemed all monstrous wing the lugger being now nearly head to wind she came flying down on her weather bow as if to run past her then lowering her foresail made a broad sweep and brought up suddenly between the lugger and the wind as her foresail fell a sailor bounded over it on to the forecastle and stood there with one foot on the gunwale active as mercury eye glowing and a rope in his hand stand by to lower your mast roared this sailor in a voice of thunder to the boatman of the lugger and the moment the schooner came up into the wind athwart the luggers bows he bounded over ten feet of water into her and with a turn of the hand made the rope fast to her thwart then hauling upon it brought her alongside with her head literally under the schooners wing he and the old boatman then instantly unstepped the mast and laid it down in the boat sail and all it was not his great strength that enabled them to do this a dozen of him could not have done it while the wind pressed on the mast it was his address in taking all the wind out of the lug by means of the schooners mainsail the old man never said a word till the work was done then he remarked that was clever of you the newcomer took no notice whatever reef that sail jack he cried it will be in the ladys face by and by and heave your bailer in here their boat is full of water not so full as it would if you hadnt brought up alongside said the old boatman do you want to frighten the lady replied the sailor in his driest and least courtierlike way i am not frightened mr dodd said lucy i was but i am not now come and help me get the water out of her jack stay miss fountain had better step into the dry boat meantime now jack look alive lash her longside aft this done the two sailors one standing on the luggers gunwale one on the schooners handed miss fountain into the schooner and gave her the cushions of the lugger to sit upon they then went to work with a will and bailed half a ton of water out when she was dry david jumped back into his own boat now miss fountain your boat is dry but the sea is getting up and i think if i were you i would stay where you are i mean to said the lady calmly mr talboys would you mind coming into this boat we shall be safer here itit is larger the gentleman thus addressed was embarrassed between two mortifications one on each side him if he came into davids boat he would be second fiddle he who had gone out of port first fiddle if he stuck to the lugger lucy would go off with dodd and he would look like a fool coming ashore without her he hesitated david got impatient come sir he cried dont you hear the lady invite you and every moment is precious and he held out his hand to him talboys decided on taking it and he even unbent so far as to jump vigorouslyso vigorously that david pulling him with force at the same moment he came flying into the schooner like a cannonball and toppling over on his heels went down on the seat with his head resting on the weather gunwale and his legs at a right angle with his back that is one way of boarding a craft muttered david a little discontentedly then to the old boatman here fling us that tarpaulin i say here is more wind coming are you sure you can work that lugger you two we will be ashore before you can now theres nobody to bother us was the prompt reply then cast loose here we are drifting out to sea the old man cast the rope loose david hauled it on board and the schooner shot away from her companion and bore up northnorthwest leaving the luggar rocking from side to side on the rising waves but the next minute lucy saw her sail rise and she bore up and stood northeast goodby to you little horror said lucy we shall fall in with her a good many times more before we make the land said david dodd lucy inquired what he meant but he had fallen to hauling the sheet aft and making the sail stand flatter and did not answer her indeed he seemed much more taken up with jack than with her and above all entirely absorbed in the business of sailing the boat she was a little mortified at this behavior and held her tongue talboys was sulky and held his it was a curious situation in the hurry and bustle none of the parties had realized it but now as the boat breasted the waves and all was silent on board they had time to review their position talboys grew gloomier and gloomier at the poor figure he cut lucy kept blushing at intervals as she reflected on the obligation she had laid herself under to a rejected lover the rejected lover alone seemed to mind his business and nothing else and as he was almost ludicrously unconscious that he was doing a chivalrous action a misfortune to which those who do these things are singularly liable he did not gild the transaction with a single graceful speech and permitted himself to be more occupied with the sails than with rescued beauty succeeding events however explained and in some degree excused this commonplace behavior the next time they tacked some spray came flying in and wetted all hands lucy laughed the lugger had also tacked and the two boats were now standing toward each other when they met the lugger had weathered on them some sixty or seventy yards a furious rain now came on almost horizontally and the sailors arranged the tarpaulin so as to protect mr talboys and miss fountain but you will be wet through yourself mr dodd will you not come under shelter too and who is to sail the boat he added i am glad to see the rain i hope it will still the wind if it doesnt we shall have to try something else that is all pray when do you undertake to land us mr dodd inquired mr talboys superciliously well sir if it does not blow any harder about eight bells eight bells why that means midnight exclaimed talboys wind and tide both dead against us replied david coolly oh mr dodd tell me the truth is there any danger danger not that i see but it is very uncomfortable and unbecoming for you to be beating to windward against the tide for so many hours when you ought to be sitting on the sofa at home however next time you run out of port i hope those that take charge of you will look to the almanac for the tide and look to windward for the weather jack the lugger lies nearer the wind than we do a little sir will you take the helm a minute mr talboys and you come forward and unbend this the two sailors put their heads together amidships and spoke in an undertone the wind is rising with the rain instead of falling seems so sir what do you think yourself well sir it has been blowing harder and harder ever since we came out and very steady it will turn out one of those dry noreasters jack i shouldnt wonder sir i wish she was cutterrigged sir a boat has no business to be any other rig but cutter there ought to be a nact o parliamt against these outlandish rigs i dont know i have seen wonders done with this lateen rig in the pacific the lugger forereaches on us sir a little but for all that i am glad she is on board our craft we have got more beam and if it comes to the worst we can run the lugger cant with her sharp stern ill go to the helm just as david was stepping aft to take the helm a wave struck the boat hard on the weather bow close to the gunwale and sent a bucket of salt water flying all over him he never turned his head eventook no more notice of it than a rock does when the sea spits at it lucy shrieked and crouched behind the tarpaulin david took the helm and seeing talboys white said kindly why dont you go forward sir and make yourself snug under the folksel deck she is sure to wet us abaft before we can make the land no talboys resisted his inclination and the deadly nausea that was creeping over him thank you but i like to see what is going on and with an heroic attempt at seaslang i like a wet boat they now fell in with the lugger again lying on the opposite tack and a hundred yards at least to windward just before they crossed her wake david sang out to jack our mastsare they sound brannew sir best norway pine what dye think think we are wasting time and daylight then stand by the main sheet yes sir slack the main sheet ay ay sir the boat instantly fell off into the wind and as she went round david stood up in the sternsheets and waved his cap to the men on board the lugger who were watching him the old man was seen to shake his head in answer to the signal and point to his lugsail standing flat as a board and the next moment they parted company and the lateen was running closereefed before the wind mr talboys was sitting collapsed in the lethargy that precedes seasickness he started up what are you doing he shrieked keep quiet sir and dont bother said david with calm sternness and in his deepest tones pray dont interfere with mr dodd said lucy he must know best you dont see what he is doing then cried talboys wildly the madman is taking us out to sea are you taking us out to sea mr dodd inquired lucy with dismay i am doing according to my judgment of tide and wind and the abilities of the craft i am sailing said david firmly and on board my own craft i am skipper and skipper i will be go forward sir if you please and dont speak except to obey orders mr talboys sick despondent and sulky went gloomily forward coiled himself up under the forecastle deck and was silent and motionless dont send me cried lucy for i will not go nothing but your eye keeps up my courage i dont mind the water added she hastily and a little timidly anxious to meet every reason that could be urged for imprisoning her in the forecastle hold you are all right where you are miss said jack cheerfully we shant have no more spray come aboard us it wont come in by the can full if it doesnt come by the ton will you belay your jaw roared david in a fury that lucy did not comprehend at the time what a set of tarnation babblers in one little boat i wont speak any more mr dodd i wont speak bless your heart it isnt you i meant twould be hard if a lady might not put her word in but a man is different i do love to see a man belay his jaw and wait for orders and then do his duty hoist the mainsel you ay ay sir shake out a couple of reefs ay ay sir and the lateen spread both her great wings like an albatross and leaped and plunged and flew before the mighty gale chapter xviii this is nice the boat does not upset or tumble as it did it only courtesies and plunges i like it the sea has not got up yet miss said jack hasnt it the waves seem very large lord love you wait till we have had four or five hours more of this belay your jaw jack ay ay sir why so mr dodd objected lucy gently i am not so weak as you think me do not keep the truth from me i share the danger let me share the sense of danger too you shall not blush for me danger there is not a grain of it unless we make danger by inattentionand babbling you will not do that said lucy equivoque missed fire not while you are on board replied david simply lucy felt inclined to give him her hand she had it out halfway but he had lately asked her to marry him so she drew it back and her eyes rested on the bottom of the boat the wind rose higher the masts bent so that each sail had every possible reef taken in her canvas thus reduced she scudded as fast as before such was now the fury of the gale the sea rose so that the boat seemed to mount with each wave as high as the second story of a house and go down again to the cellar at every plunge talboys prostrated by seasickness in the forehold lay curled but motionless like a crooked log and almost as indifferent to life or death lucy pale but firm put no more questions that she felt would not be answered but scanned david dodds face furtively yet closely the result was encouraging to her his cheek was not pale as she felt her own on the contrary it was slightly flushed his eye bright and watchful but lionlike he gave a word or two of command to jack every now and then very sharply but without the slightest shade of agitation and jacks ay ay came back as sharply but cheerfully the principal feature she discerned in both sailors was a very attentive businesslike manner the romantic air with which heroes face danger in story was entirely absent and so being convinced by his yarns that david was a hero she inferred that their situation could not be dangerous but as david himself had inferred merely one in which watchfulness was requisite the sun went down red and angry the night came on dark and howling no moon a murky sky like a black bellying curtain above and huge ebony waves that in the appalling blackness seemed all crested with devouring fire hemmed in the tossing boat and growled and snarled and raged above below and around her then in that awful hour lucy fountain felt her littleness and the littleness of man she cowered and trembled the sailors rough but tender nurses wrapped shawls round her one above the other to make her snug for the night they said they seemed to her to be mocking her snug who could hope to outlive such a fearful night and what did it matter whether she was drowned in one shawl or a dozen david being amidships bailing the boat out and jack at the helm she took the opportunity and got very close to the latter and said in his ear mr jack we are in danger not exactly in danger miss but of course we must mind our eye but i have often been where i have had to mind my eye and hope to be again mr jack said lucy shivering what is our danger tell me the nature of it then i shall not be so cowardly will the boat break lord bless you no will it upset no fear of that will not the sea swallow us no miss how can the sea swallow us she rides like a cork and there is the skipper bailing her out to make her lighter still no ill tell you miss all we have got to mind is two things we must not let her broach to and we must not get pooped but why must we not why because we mustnt but i mean what would be the consequence ofbroaching to jack opened his eyes in astonishment why the sea would run over her quarter and swamp her oh and if we get pooped we shall go to davy jones like a bullet who is davy jones the old one you knowdown below leastways you wont go there miss you will go aloft and perhaps the skipper but davy will have me so i wont give him a chance if i can help it lucy cried where are we mr jack british channel i know that but whereabouts heaven knows and no doubt the skipper he knows but i dont i am only a common sailor shall i hail the skipper he will tell you no no no he is so angry if we speak he wont be angry if you speak to him miss said jack with a sly grin that brought a faint color into lucys cheek you should have seen him how anxious he was about you before we came alongside and the moment that lubber went forward to dip the lug says he jack there will be mischief up mainsail and run down to them i have no confidence in that tall boy he do seem a long weedy useless sort of lubber lord bless you miss we luffed and were running down to you long before you made the signal of distress with your little white flag lucys cheeks got redder no miss if the skipper speaks severe to you jack painter is blind with one eye and cant see with tother lucys cheeks were carnation but the next moment they were white for a terrible event interrupted this chat two huge waves rolled one behind the other an occurrence which luckily is not frequent the boat descending into the valley of the sea had the wind taken out of her sails by the high wave that was coming her sails flapped she lost her speed and as she rose again the second wave was a moment too quick for her and its combing crest caught her the first thing lucy saw was jack running from the helm with a loud cry of fear followed by what looked an arch of fire but sounded like a lion rushing growling on its prey and directly her feet and ankles were in a pool of water david bounded aft swearing and splashing through it and it turned into sparks of white fire flying this way and that he seized the helm and discharged a loud volley of curses at jack fling out ballast ye dd cowardly useless lubber cried he and while jack who had recoiled into his normal state of nerves with almost ridiculous rapidity was heaving out ballast david discharged another rolling volley at him oh pray dont cried lucy trembling like an aspen leaf oh think we shall soon be in the presence of our makerof him whose name you not we cried david with broad cheerful incredulity we have lots more mischief to dothat lubber and i and if he thinks he is going there let him end like a man not like a skulking lubber running from the helm and letting the craft come up in the wind no no it was the sea he ran from who would not the lubber if it had been a tiger or a bear id say nothing but what is the use of trying to run from the sea should have stuck to his post and set that thundering back of his upits broad enoughand kept the sea out of your boots the sea indeed i have seen the sea come on board me and clear the deck fore and aft but it didnt come in the shape of a cupful o water and a spoonful o foam here davids wrath and contempt were interrupted by jack singing waggishly at his work ceaserude boreasblusteringrailer at which sly hit david was pleased and burst into a loud boisterous laugh lucy put her hands to her ears oh dont dont this is worse than your blasphemieslaughing on the brink of eternity these are not menthey are devils do you hear that jack come you behave roared david a faint snarl from talboys the water had penetrated him and roused him from a state of sick torpor he lay in a tidy little pool some eight inches deep the boat was bailed and lightened but lucys fears were not set at rest what was to hinder the recurrence of the same danger and with more fatal effect she timidly asked davids permission to let her keep the sea out instead of snubbing her as she expected david consented with a sort of paternal benevolence tinged with incredulity she then developed her plan it was that david jack and she should sit in a triangle and hold the tarpaulin out to windward and fence the ocean out jack being summoned aft to council burst into a hoarse laugh but david checked him there is more in it than you see jackmore than she sees perhaps my only doubt is whether it is possible but you can try lucy and jack then tried to get the tarpaulin out to windward instead of which it carried them to leeward by the force of the wind the mast brought them up or heaven knows where their new invention would have taken them with infinite difficulty they got it down and kneeled upon it and even then it struggled but lucy would not be defeated she made jack gather it up in the middle and roll it first to the right then to the left till it became a solid roll with two narrow open edges they then carried it abaft and lowered it vertically over the sternport then suddenly turned it round and sat down crack the wind opened it and wrapped it round the boat and the trio hallo cried david it is foul of the rudder and he whipped out his knife and made a slit in the stuff it now clung like a blister there mr dodd will not that keep the sea out asked lucy triumphantly at any rate it may help to keep us ahead of the sea why jack i seem to feel it lift her it is as good as a mizzen but oh mr dodd there is another danger we may broach to how can she broach to when i am at the helm here is the arm that wont let her broach to then i feel safe you are as safe as on your own sofa it is the discomfort you are put to that worries me dont think so meanly of me mr dodd if it was not for my cowardice i should enjoy this voyage far more than the luxurious ease you think so dear to me i despise it mr dodd now i am no longer afraid i am oh so sleepy no wondergo to sleep it is the best thing you can do thank you sir i am aware my conversation is not very interesting having administered this sudden bloodless scratch to show that at sea or ashore in fair weather or foul she retained her sex lucy disposed herself to sleep david steering the boat with his left hand arranged the cushion with his right she settled herself to sleep for an irresistible drowsiness had followed the many hours of excitement she had gone through twice the heavy plunging sea brought her into light contact with david she instantly awoke and apologized to him with gentle dismay for taking so audacious a liberty with that great man commander of the vessel the third time she said nothing a sure sign she was unconscious then david for fear she might hurt herself curled his arm around her and let her head decline upon his shoulder her bonnet fell off he put it reverently on the other side the helm the air now cleared but the gale increased rather than diminished and now the moon rose large and bright the boat and masts stood out like white stonework against the flintcolored sky and the silver light played on lucys face there she lay all unconscious of her posture on the mans shoulder who loved her and whom she had refused her head thrown back in sweet helplessness her rich hair streaming over davids shoulder her eyes closed but the long lovely lashes meeting so that the double fringe was as speaking as most eyes and her lips half open in an innocent smile the storm was no storm to her now she slept the sleep of childhood of innocence and peace and david gazed and gazed on her and joy and tenderness almost more than human thrilled through him and the storm was no storm to him either he forgot the past despised the future and in the delirium of his joy blessed the sea and the wind and wished for nothing but instead of the channel a boundless ocean and to sail upon it thus her bosom tenderly grazing him and her lovely head resting on his shoulder for ever and ever and ever thus they sailed on two hours and more and jack now began to nod all of a sudden lucy awoke and opening her eyes surprised david gazing at her with tenderness unspeakable awaking possessed with the notion that she was sleeping at home on a bed of down she looked dumfounded an instant but davids eyes soon sent the blood into her cheek her whole supple person turned eellike and she glided quickly but not the least bruskly from him the latter might have seemed discourteous oh mr dodd she cried what am i doing you have been getting a nice sleep thank heaven yes and making use of you even in my sleep but we all impose on your goodness why did you awake you were happy you felt no care and i was happy seeing you so lucys eyes filled kind true friend she murmured how can i ever thank you as i ought i little deserved that you should watch over my safety as you have done and alas risk your own any other but you would have borne me malice and let me perish and said it serves her right malice miss lucy what for in heavens name forfor the affront i put upon you for thethe honor i declined hate cannot lie alongside love in a true heart i see it cannot in a noble one and then you are so generous you have never once recurred to that unfortunate topic yet you have gained a right to request meto reconsidermr dodd you have saved my life what do you praise me because i dont take a mean advantage that would not be behaving like a man i dont know that you overrate your sexand mine we dont deserve such generosity the proof is we reward those who are not sodelicate i dont trouble my head about your sex they are nothing to me and never will be if you think i have done my duty like a man and as much like a gentleman as my homely education permits that is enough for me and i shall sail for china as happy as anything on earth can make me now lucy answered this by crying gently silently tenderly dont ye cry have i said something to vex you oh no no are you alarmed still oh no i have such faith in you then go to sleep again like a lamb i will then i shall not tease you with my conversation now there is a way to put it forgive me that i will if you will take some repose there i will lash you to my arm with this handkerchief then you can lie the other way and hold on by the handkerchiefthere she closed her eyes and fell apparently to sleep but really to thinking then david nudged jack and waked him speak low now jack what is it sir land ahead jack looked out and there was a mountain of jet rising out of the sea and to a landsmans eye within a stones throw of them is it the french coast sir i must have been asleep french coast no channel islandsmallest of the lot better give it a wide berth sir we shall go smash like a teacup if we run on to one of them rocky islands why jack said david reproachfully am i the man to run upon a leeshore and such a night as this not likely you will keep her head for cherbourg or st malo sir it is our only chance it is not our only chance nor our best we have been running a little ahead of this gale jack there is worse in store for us the sea is rolling mountains high on the french coast this morning i know we are like enough to be pooped before we get there or swamped on some harborbar at last well sir we must take our chance take our chance what with heads on our shoulders and an angel on board that heaven has given us charge of no i shant take my chance i shall try all i know and hang on to life by my eyelids listen to me knowledge is gold a little of it goes a long way i dont know much myself but i do know the soundings of the british channel i have made them my study on the south side of this rocky point there is forty fathoms water close to the shore and good anchorageground then i wish we could jump over the thundering island and drop on the lee side of it but as we cant whats the use we may be able to round the point there will be an awful sea running off that point sir of course there will i mean to try it for all that so be it sir that is what i like to hear i hate palaver let one give his orders and the rest obey them we are not above half a mile from it now you had better wake the landsman we must have a third hand for this no said a womans voice sweet but clear and unwavering i shall be the third hand curse it cried david she has heard us every word and i have no confidence in mr talboys and believe me i am more to be trusted than he is see my cowardice is all worn out do but trust me and you shall find i want neither courage nor intelligence david eyed her keenly and full in the face she met his glance calmly with her fine nostrils slightly expanding and her compressed lip curving proudly it is all right jack it is not a flash in the pan she is as steady as a rock he then addressed her rapidly and businesslike but with deference you will stand by the helm on this side and the moment i run forward you will take the helm and hold it in this position that will require all your strength come try it well done how the sea struggles with me but i am strong you see cried lucy her brow flushed with the battle very good you are strong and what is better resolute now observe me this is port this is starboard and this is amidships i see but how am i to know which to do i shall give you the word of command and all i have to do is to obey it that is all but you will find it enough because the sea will seem to fight you it will shake the boat to make you leave go and will perhaps dash in your face to make you leave go forewarned forearmed mr dodd i will not let go i will hold on by my eyelids sooner than add to your danger jack she is on fire she gives me double heart so she does me she makes it a pleasure they were now near enough the point to judge what they had to do and the appearance of the sea was truly terrible the waves were all broken and a surge of devouring fire seemed to rage and roar round the point and oppose an impassable barrier between them and the inky pool beyond where safety lay under the lee of the high rocks i dont like it said david it looks to me like going through a strip of hell fire but it is narrow said lucy that is our chance and the tide is coming in we will try it she will drench us but i dont much think she will swamp us are you ready all hands oh please wait a minute till i do up my hair take a minute but no more there it is done mr dodd one word if all should fail and death be inevitable tell me so just before we perish and i shall have something to say to you now i am ready jump forward jack yes sir stand by to jibe the foresail ay ay sir see our sweeps all clear ay david now handled the main sheet and at the same time looked earnestly at lucy who met his eye with a look of eager attention starboard a little that will do steadysteady as you go as the boat yielded to the helm jack gathered in on the sheet took two turns round the cleat and eased away till the sail drew its best so far so good both sails were now on the same side of the boat the wind on her port quarter but now came the dangerous operation of coming to the wind in a rough and broken sea among the eddies of wind and tide so prevalent off headlands david with the main sheet in his right hand directed lucy with his left as well as his voice starboard the helmstarboard yetnow meet herso and as she rounded to jack and he kept hauling the sheets aft and the boat her course and trim altered darted among the breakers like a brave man attacking danger after the first plunge she went up and down like a pickax coming down almost where she went up but she held her course with the waves roaring round her like a pack of hellhounds more than half the terrible strip was passed starboard yet cried david and she headed toward the high mainland under whose lee was calm and safety alas at this moment a snorter of a sea broke under her broadside and hove her to leeward like a cork and a tide eddy catching her under the counter she came to more than two points and her canvas thus emptied shook enough to tear the masts out of her by the board port your helm port port roared david in a voice like the roar of a wounded lion and in his anxiety he bounded to the helm himself but lucy obeyed orders at half a word and david seeing this sprang forward to help jack flatten in the foresheet the boat which all through answered the helm beautifully fell off the moment lucy ported the helm and thus they escaped the impending and terrible danger of her making sternway helm amidships and all drew again the black water was in sight but will they ever reach it she tosses like a cork bang a breaker caught her bows and drenched david and jack to the very bone she quivered like an aspenleaf but held on starboard one point cried david sitting down and lifting an oar out from the boat but just as lucy in obeying the order leaned a little over the lee gunwale with the tiller a breaker broke like a shell upon the boats broadside abaft stove in her upper plank and filled her with water some flew and slapped lucy in the face like an open hand she screamed but clung to the gunwale and griped the helm her arm seemed iron and her heart was steel while she clung thus to her work blinded by the spray and expecting death she heard oars splash into the water and mellow stentorian voices burst out singing in amazement she turned squeezed the brine out of her eyes and looked all round and lo the boat was in a trifling bobble of a sea and close astern was the surge of fire raging and growling and blazing in vain and the two sailors were pulling the boat with superhuman strength and inspiration into a monster millpool that now lay right ahead black as ink and smooth as oil singing loudly as they rowed cheerily oh oh pull cheerily oh oh pull to port we go oh pull to port we go pull flare a great flaming eye opened on them in the center of the universal blackness look look cried lucy a fire in the mountain it was the lantern of a french sloop anchored close to the shore the crew had heard the sailors voices at sight of it david and jack cheered so lustily that talboys crawled out of the water and glared vaguely the sailors pulled under the sloops lee quarter a couple of ropes were instantly lowered the lantern held aloft ruby heads and hands clustered at the gangway and in another minute the boats party were all upon deck under a hailstorm of french and the boat fast to her stern chapter xix the skipper of the ship hearing a commotion on deck came up and taking off his cap made lucy a bow in a style remote from an english sailors she courtesied to him and to his surprise addressed him in parisian french when he learned she was from england and had rounded that point in an open boat he was astonished diables danglais said he the goodnatured frenchman insisted on lucy taking sole possession of his cabin in which was a cheerful stove his crew were just as kind to david jack and talboys this latter now resumed his right placeat the head of mankind being the only one who could talk french he interpreted for his companions he improved upon my narrative in one particular he led the frenchmen to suppose it was he who had sailed the boat from england and weathered the point who can blame him dry clothes were found them and grog and beef while employed on the victuals a little anglofrank aged ten suddenly rolled out of a hammock and offered aid in the sweet accents of their native tongue the sound of the knives and forks had woke the urchin out of a deep sleep david filled the hybrid and then sent him to lucys cabin to learn how she was getting on he returned and told them the lady was sitting on deck dear me said david she ought to be in her bed he rose and went on deck followed by mr talboys had you not better rest yourself said david no thank you mr dodd i had a delicious sleep in the boat here talboys put in his word and made her a rueful apology for the turn his pleasureexcursion had taken she stopped him most graciously on the contrary i have to thank you indirectly for one of the pleasantest evenings i ever spent i never was in danger before and it is delightful i was a little frightened at first but it soon wore off and i feel i should shortly revel in it only i must have a brave man near just to look at then i gather courage from his eye do i not now mr dodd indeed you do said david simply enough lucy fountains appearance and manner bore out her words talboys was white even david and jack showed some signs of a night of watching and anxiety but the young ladys cheek was red and fresh her eye bright and she shone with an inspired and sprightly ardor that was never seen or never observed in her before they had found the way to put her blood up after allthe blood of the funteyns such are thoroughbreds they rise with the occasion snobs descend as the situation rises see that straightnecked smallnosed mare stepping delicately on the turnpike why it is languor in person picking its way among eggs now the hounds cry and the horn rings put her at timber stream and plowed field in pleasing rotation and see her now up ears open nostril nerves steel heart immovable eye of fire foot of wind and ho there what stuck in that last arable dead stiff as the rosinantes in trafalgar square all but one limb which goes like a waterwagtails why by jove if it isnt the hero of the turnpike road the gallant impatient foaming champing spacedevouring curveting cocktail out of consideration for her male companions infirmities and observing that they were ashamed to take needful rest while she remained on deck lucy at length retired to her cabin she slept a good many hours and was awakened at last by the rocking of the sloop the wind had fallen gently but it had also changed to due east which brought a heavy groundswell round the point into their little haven lucy made her toilet and came on deck blooming like a rose the first person she encountered was mr talboys she saluted him cordially and then inquired for their companions oh they are gone gone what do you mean sailed half an hour ago look there is the boat coasting the island no not that waywestward out there just weathering that point dont you see are they making a tour of the island then here the little anglofrank put in his word no maainselle gone to catch sheep bound for ze east indeeze gone gone for good and lucy turned very pale the next moment offended pride sent the blood rushing to her brow that is just like mr dodd there is not another gentleman in the world would have had the illbreeding to go off like that to india without even bidding us goodmorning or goodby did he bid you goodby mr talboys no there now it is insolentit is barbarous her vexation at the affront david had put on mr talboys soon passed into indignation this was done to insultto humiliate us a noble revenge you know we used sometimes to quiz him a little ashore especially you so now out of spite he has saved our lives and then turned his back arrogantly upon us before we could express our gratitude that is as much as to say he values us as so many dogs or cats flings us our lives haughtily and then turned his back disdainfully on us life is not worth having when given so insultingly talboys soothed the offended fair i really dont think he meant to insult us but you know dodd he is a goodnatured fellow but he never had the slightest pretension to goodbreeding dont you think replied the lady it would be as well to leave off detracting from mr dodd now that he has just saved your life talboys opened his eyes why you began it oh mr talboys do not descend to evasion what i say goes for nothing mr dodd and i are fast friends and nobody will ever succeed in robbing me of my esteem for him but you always hated him and you seize every opportunity of showing your dislike poor mr dodd he has too many great virtues not to be enviedand hated talboys stood puzzled and was at a loss which way to steer his tongue the wind being so shifty at last he observed a little haughtily that he never made mr dodd of so much importance as all this he owned he had quizzed him but it was not his intention to quiz him any more for i do feel under considerable obligations to mr dodd he has brought us safe across the channel at the same time i own i should have been more grateful if he had beat against the wind and landed us on our native coast the lugger is there long before this and our boat was the best of the two absurd replied lucy with cold hauteur the lugger had a sharp stern but ours was a square stern so we were obliged to run if we had beat we should all have been drowned directly talboys was staggered by this sudden influx of science but he held his ground there is something in that said he but still aa there mr talboys said the young lady suddenly assuming extreme languor after delivering a facer pray do not engage me in an argument i do not feel equal to one especially on a subject that has lost its interest can you inform me when this vessel sails not till tomorrow morning then will you be so kind as to borrow me that little boat it is dangling from the ship so it must belong to it i wish to land and see whether he has cast us upon an in or an uninhabited island the sloops boat speedily landed them on the island and lucy proposed to cross the narrow neck of land and view the sea they had crossed in the dark this was soon done and she took that opportunity of looking about for the lateen for her mind had taken another turn and she doubted the report that david had gone to intercept the eastindiaman a short glance convinced her it was true about seven miles to leeward her course westnorthwest her hull every now and then hidden by the waves her white sails spread like a birds the lateen was flying through the foam at its fastest rate lucy gazed at her so long and steadfastly that talboys took the huff and strolled along the cliff when lucy turned to go back she found the french skipper coming toward her with a scrap of paper in his hand he presented it with a low bow she took it with a courtesy it was neatly folded though not as letters are folded ashore and it bore her address she opened it and read it was not worth while disturbing your rest just to see us go off god bless you miss lucy the frenchman is bound for and will take you safe and mind you dont step ashore till the plank is fast yours respectfully david dodd that was all she folded it back thoughtfully into the original folds and turned away when she had gone but a few steps she stopped and put her rejected lovers little note into her bosom and went slowly back to the boat hanging her sweet head and crying as she went chapter xx mr fountain remained in the town waiting for his nieces return six oclock cameno boat eight oclockno boat and a heavy gale blowing he went down to the beach in great anxiety and when he got there he soon found it was shared to the full by many human beings there were little knots of fishermen and sailors discussing it and one poor woman mother and wife stealing from group to group and listening anxiously to the mens conjectures but the most striking feature of the scene was an old whitehaired man who walked wildly throwing his arms about the others rather avoided him but mr fountain felt he had a right to speak to him so he came to him and told him his niece was on board and you too i fear have some one dear to you in danger the old man replied sorrowfully that his lovely new boat was in dangerin such danger that he should never see her again then added going suddenly into a fury that as to the two rascally bluejackets that were on board of her and had borrowed her of his wife while he was out all he wished was that they had been swamped to all eternity long ago then they would not have been able to come and swamp his dear boat peppery old fountain cursed him for a heartless old vagabond and joined the group whose grief and anxiety were less ostentatious being for the other boat that carried their own flesh and blood but all night long that whitehaired old man paced the shore flinging his arms weeping and cursing alternately for his dear schooner oh holy loveof property how venerable you looked in the moonlight with your white hairs streaming how well you imitated how close you rivaled the holiest effusions of the heart and not for the first time nor the last my daughter my ducats my ducats my daughter etc the morning broke no sign of either boat the wind had shifted to the east and greatly abated the fishermen began to have hopes for their comrades these communicated themselves to mr fountain it was about one oclock in the afternoon when this latter observed people streaming along the shore to a distant point he asked a coastguard man whom he observed scanning the place with a glass what it was the man lowered his voice and said well sir it will be something coming ashore by the way the folk are running mr fountain got a carriage and urging the driver to use speed was hastily conveyed by the road to a part whence a few steps brought him down to the sea he thrust wildly in among the crowd make way said the rough fellows they saw he was one of those who had the best right to be there he looked and there scarce fifty yards from the shore was the lugger keel uppermost drifting in with the tide the old man staggered and was supported by a beach man when the wreck came within fifteen yards of the shore she hung owing to the under suction and could get neither way the cries of the women broke out afresh at this then half a dozen stout fellows swam in with ropes and with some difficulty righted her and in another minute she was hauled ashore the crowd rushed upon her she was empty not an oar not a boathooknothing but jammed in between the tiller and the boat they found a purple veil the discovery was announced loudly by one of the females but the consequent outcry was instantly hushed by the men and the oldest fisherman there took it and in a sudden dead and solemn silence gave it with a world of subdued meaning to mr fountain chapter xxi mr fountains grief was violent the more so perhaps that it was not pure sorrow but heated with anger and despair he had not only lost the creature he loved better than anyone else except himself but all his plans and all his ambition were upset forever i am sorry to say there were moments when he felt indignant with heaven and accused its justice at other times the virtues of her he had lost came to his recollection and he wept genuine tears now she was dead he asked himself a question that is sometimes reserved for that occasion and then asked with bitter regret and idle remorse at its postponement what can i do to show my love and respect for her the poor old fellow could think of nothing now but to try and recover her body from the sea and to record her virtues on her tomb he employed six men to watch the coast for her along a space of twelve miles and he went to a marblecutter and ordered a block of beautiful white marble he drew up the record of her virtues himself and spelled her fontaine and so settled that question by brute force oh you may giggle but men are not most sincere when they are most reasonable nor most reasonable when most sincere when a mans heart is in a thing it is in itwise or nonsensical it is all one so it is no use talking i lack words to describe the gloom that fell on mr bazalgettes home when the sad tidings reached it and indeed it would be trifling with my reader to hang many more pages with black when he and i both know lucy fontaine is alive all the time meantime the french sloop lay at her anchor and lucy fretted with impatience at noon the next day she sailed and being a slow vessel did not anchor off the port of till daybreak the day after then she had to wait for the tide and it was nearly eleven oclock when lucy landed she went immediately to the principal inn to get a conveyance on the road whom should she meet but mr hardie he gave a joyful start at sight of her and with more heart than she could have expected welcomed her to life again from him she learned all the proofs of her death this made her more anxious to fly to her aunts house at once and undeceive her mr hardie would not let her hire a carriage he would drive her over in half the time he beckoned his servant who was standing at the inn door and ordered it immediately meantime miss fountain if you will take my arm i will show you something that i think will amuse you though we have found it anything but amusing as you may well suppose lucy took his arm somewhat timidly and he walked her to the marblecutters shop look there said he lucy looked and there was an unfinished slab on which she read these words sacred to the memory of lucy fontaine who was drowned at sea on the th sept as her beauty endeared her to all eyes so her modesty piety docilit at this point in her moral virtues the chisel had stopped eleven oclock struck and the chisel went for its beer for your english workman would leave the d in god half finished when strikes the hour of beer the fact is that the shopkeeper had newly set up was proud of the commission and whenever the chisel left off he whipped into the workshop and brought the slab out pro tem into his window for an advertisement hardie pointed it out to lucy with a chuckle lucy turned pale and put her hand to her heart hardie saw his mistake too late and muttered excuses lucy gave a little gasp and stopped him pray say no more it is my fault if people will feign death they must expect these little tributes my uncle has lost no time and two unreasonable tears swelled to her eyes and trickled one after another down her cheeks then she turned her back quickly on the thing and mr hardie felt her arm tremble i think mr hardie said she presently with marked courtesy i should under the circumstances prefer to go home alone my aunts nerves are sensitive and i must think of the best way of breaking to her the news that i am alive it would be best miss fountain and to tell the truth i feel myself unworthy to accompany you after being so maladroit as to give you pain in thinking to amuse you oh mr hardie said lucy growing more and more courteous you are not to be called to account for my weakness that would be unjust i shall have the pleasure of seeing you at dinner certainly since you permit me he put lucy into the carriage and off she drove come thought mr hardie i have had an escape what a stupid blunder for me to make she is not angry though so it does not matter she asked me to dinner said lucy to herself the man is a fool poor mr dodd he would not have shown me my tombstoneto amuse me and she dismissed the subject from her mind she sent away the carriage and entered mr bazalgettes house on foot after some consideration she determined to employ jane a girl of some tact to break her existence to her aunt she glided into the drawingroom unobserved fully expecting to find jane at work there for mrs bazalgette but the room was empty while she hesitated what to do next the handle of the door was turned and she had only just time to dart behind a heavy windowcurtain when it opened and mrs bazalgette walked slowly and silently in followed by a woman mrs bazalgette seated herself and sighed deeply her companion kept a respectful silence after a considerable pause mrs bazalgette said a few words in a voice so thoroughly subdued and solemn and every now and then so stifled that lucys heart yearned for her and nothing but the fear of frightening her aunt into a hysterical fit kept her from flying into her arms i need not tell you said mrs bazalgette why i sent for you you know the sad bereavement that has fallen on me but you cannot know all i have lost in her nobody can tell what she was to all of us but most of all to me i was her darling and she was mine here tears choked mrs bazalgettes words for a while recovering herself she paid a tribute to the character of the deceased it was a soul without one grain of selfishness all her thoughts were for others not one for herself she loved us allindeed she loved some that were hardly worthy of so pure a creatures love but the reason was she had no eye for the faults of her friends she pictured them like herself and loved her own sweet image in them and such a temper and so free from guile i may truly say her mind was as lovely as her person she was indeed a sweet young lady sighed the woman she was an angel baldwinan angel sent to bear us company a little while and now she is a saint in heaven ah maam the best goes first that is an old saying so i have heard but my niece was as healthy as she was lovely and good everything promised long life i hoped she would have closed my eyes in the bloom of health one day and the next lying cold stark and drenched oh how terrible oh my poor lucy oh oh oh in the midst of life we are in death maam i am sure it is a warning to me maam as well as to my betters it is indeed baldwin a warning to all of us who have lived too much for vanities to think of this sweet flower snatched in a moment from our bosoms and from the world we ought to think of it on our knees and remember our own latter end that last skirt you sent me was rather scrimped my poor baldwin was it maam oh it does not matter i shall never wear it now and under such a blow as this i am in no humor to find fault indeed with my grief i neglect my household and my very children i forget everything what did i send for you for and she looked with lackluster eyes full in mrs baldwins face jane did not say maam but i am at your orders oh of course i am distracted it was to pay the last tribute of respect to her dear memory ah baldwin often and often the black dress is all but here the heart mourns beyond the power of grief to express by any outward trappings no matter the world the shallow world respects these signs of woe and let mine be the deepest mourning ever worn and the richest and out of that mourning i shall never go while i live no maam said baldwin soothingly do you doubt me asked the lady with a touch of sharpness that did not seemed called for by baldwins humble acquiescence oh no maam it is a very natural thought under the present affliction and most becoming the sad occasion well maam the deepest mourning if you please i should say cashmere and crape yes that would be deep oh baldwin it is her violent death that kills me well cashmere and crape maam and with nothing white about the neck and arms yes oh yes but will not that be rather unbecoming well maam and baldwin hesitated i hardly see how i could wear that it makes one look so old now dont you think black glace silk and trimmed with loveribbon black of course but scalloped that would be very rich indeed maam and very becoming to you but being so near and dear it would not be so deep as you are desirous of why baldwin you dont attend to what i say i told you i was never going out of mourning again so what is the use of your proposing anything to me that i cant wear all my life now tell me can i always wear cashmere and crape oh no maam that is out of the question and if it is for a permanency i dont see how we could improve on glace silk with crape and loveribbons would you like the body trimmed with jet maam oh dont ask me i dont know if my darling had only died comfortably in her bed then we could have laid out her sweet remains and dressed them for her virgin tomb it would have been a satisfaction maam a sad one at the best but now the very earth perhaps will never receive her oh yes anything you likethe body trimmed with jet if you wish it and let me see a gauze bodice goffered fastened to the throat that is all i think the sleeves confined at the wrist just enough not to expose the arm and yet look lightyou understand yes maam she kissed me just before she went on that fatal excursion baldwin she will never kiss me againoh oh you must call on dejazet for me and bespeak me a bonnet to match it is not to be supposed i can run about after her trumpery at such a time besides it is not usual indeed maam you are in no state for it i will undertake any purchases you may require thank you my good baldwin you are a good kind feeling useful soul oh baldwin if it had pleased heaven to take her by disease it would have been bad enough to lose her but to be drowned her clothes all wetted through and through her poor hair drenched too and then the water is so cold at this time of yearoh oh send me a cross of jet and jet beads with the dress and a jet brooch and a set of jet buttons in casebesidesoh oh ohi expect every moment to see her carried home all pale and wetted by the nasty seaoh ohand an evening dress of the samethe newest fashion i leave it to you dont ask me any questions about it for i cant and wont go into that i can try it on when it is madeoh oh ohit does not do to love any creature as i loved my poor lost lucyand a black fanoh ohand a dozen pair of black kid glovesohand a mourningringand stop aunt or your love for me will be your ruin said lucy coldly and stood suddenly before the pair looking rather cynical what lucy alive no her ghostah ah be calm aunt i am alive and well now dont be childish dear i have been in danger but here i am mrs bazalgette and mrs baldwin flew together and trembled in one anothers arms lucy tried to soothe them but at last could not help laughing at them this brought baldwin to her senses quicker than anything but mrs bazalgette who like many false women was hysterical went off into spasmsgenuine ones they gave her saltsin vain slapped her handsin vain then lucy cried to baldwin quick the tumbler i must sprinkle her face and bosom oh dont spoil my lilac gown gasped the sufferer and with a mighty effort she came to she would have come back from the edge of the grave to shield silk from water finally she wreathed her arms round lucy and kissed her so tenderly warmly and sobbingly that lucy got over the shock of her shallowness and they kissed and cried together most joyously while baldwin after a heroic attempt at jubilation retired from the room with a face as long as your arm a bas les revenants she went to the housekeepers room the housekeeper persuaded her to stay and take a bit of dinner and soon after dinner she was sent for to mrs bazalgettes room lucy met her coming out of it i fear i came mal apropos mrs baldwin if i had thought of it i would have waited till you had secured that munificent order i am much obliged to you miss i am sure but you were always a considerate young lady youll be glad to learn miss it makes no difference i have got the order it is all right that is fortunate replied lucy kindly otherwise i should have been tempted to commit an extravagance with you myself well and what is my aunts new dress to be now oh the same miss the same why she is not going into mourning on my return ha ha la bless you miss mourning you cant call that mourningglace silk and loveribbons scalloped out and cetera of course it was not my business to tell her so but i could not help thinking to myself if that is the way my folk are going to mourn for me they may just let it alone however that is all over now and your aunt sent for me and says she black becomes me you will make the dresses all the same and baldwin retired radiant lucy put her hand to her bosom make the dresses all the sameall the same whether i am alive or dead no i will not cry no i will not who is worth a tear what is worth a tear all the same it is not to be forgottennor forgiven poor mr dodd mr fountain learned the good news in the town so his meeting with lucy was one of pure joy mr talboys did not hear anything he had business up in london and did not stay ten minutes in the house revived and jubilabat jubilabat but after the first burst of triumph things went flat david dodd was gone and was missed and lucy was changed she looked a shade older and more than one shade graver and instead of living solely for those who happened to be basking in her rays she was now and then comparatively inattentive thoughtful and distraite mr fountain watched her keenly ditto mrs bazalgette a slight reaction had taken place in both their bosoms hang the girl there were we breaking our hearts for her and she was alive she had beguiled them of their tearsothello but they still loved her quite well enough to take charge of her fate a sort of itch for settling other peoples destinies and so gaining a title to their curses for our pragmatical and fatal interference is the commonest of all the forms of sanctioned lunacy moreover these two had imbibed the spirit of rivalry and each was stimulated by the suspicion that the other was secretly at work lucys voluntary promise in the ballroom was a double sheetanchor to mr fountain it secured him against the only rival he dreaded talboys too was out of the way just now and the absence of the suitor is favorable to his success where the lady has no personal liking for him to work went our machiavel again heart and soul and whom do you think he had the cheek or as the french say the forehead to try and win overmrs bazalgette this bold step however was not so strange as it would have been a month ago the fact is i have brought you unfairly close to this pair when you meet them in the world you will be charmed with both of them and recognize neither there are those whose faults are all on the surface these are generally disliked there are those whose faults are all at the core they charm creation mrs bazalgette is allowed by both sexes to be the most delightful amiable woman in the county and will carry that reputation to her grave fountain is the jolliest old buck ever went on two legs i myself would rather meet twelve such agreeable humbugssix of a sexat dinner than the twelve apostles and so would you though you dont know it these two then had long ere this found each other mighty agreeable the woman saw the mans vanity and flattered it the man the womans and flattered it neither sawam i to sayhis own or her own or what hang language in short they had long ago oiled one anothers asperities and their intercourse was smooth and frequent they were always chatting togetherstrewing flowers of speech over their mines and countermines mr fountain then who in virtue of his sex had the less patience broke ground my dear mrs bazalgette i would not have missed this visit for a thousand pounds certainly there is nothing like contact for rubbing off prejudices i little thought when i first came here the principal attraction of the place would prove to be my fair hostess i know you were prejudiced my dear mr fountain i cant say i ever had any against you but certainly i did not know half your good qualities however your courtesy to me when i invaded you at font abbey prepared me for your real character and now this visit i trust makes us friends ah my dear mrs bazalgette one thing only is wanting to make you my benefactor as well as friendif i could only persuade you to withdraw your powerful opposition to a poor old fellows dream what poor old fellow me you why you are not so very old you are not above fifty ah fair lady you must not evade me come can nothing soften you i dont know what you mean mr fountain and the mellifluous tones dried suddenly you are too sagacious not to know everything you know my heart is set on marrying my niece to a man of ancient family with all my heart you have only to use your influence with her if she consents i will not oppose you cruel little lady you know it is not enough to withdraw opposition i cant succeed without your kind aid and support now mr fountain i am a great coward but really i could almost venture to scold you a little is not a poor little woman to be allowed to set her heart on things as well as a poor old gentleman who does not look fifty you know my poor little heart is bent on her marrying into our own set yet you can ask me to influence her the other wayme who have never once said a word to her for my own favorites no the fairest kindest and best way is to leave her to select her own happiness a fine thing it would be if young people were left to marry who they like retorted fountain my dear lady i would never have asked your aid so long as there was the least chance of her marrying mr hardie but now that she has of her own accord declined him what is that declined mr hardie when did he ever propose for her you misunderstand me she came to me and told me she would never marry him when was that i dont believe it it was in the ballroom mrs bazalgette reflected then she turned very red well sir said she dont build too much on that for four months ago she made me a solemn promise she would never marry any lover you should find her and she repeated that promise in your very house i dont believe it madam that is polite sir come mr fountain you are agitated and cross and it is no use being cross either with me or with lucy you asked my cooperation you gentlemen can ask anything and you are wise to do these droll things that is where you gain the advantage over us poor cowards of women well i will cooperate with you now listen lucys penchant is neither for mr hardie nor mr talboys but for mr dodd you dont mean it oh she does not care much for him she has refused him to my knowledge and would again besides he is gone to india so there is an end of him she seems a little languid and out of spirits it may be because he is gone now then is the very time to press a marriage upon her the very worst time surely if she is really such an idiot as to be fretting for a fellow who is away mrs bazalgette informed her new ally condescendingly that he knew nothing of the sex he had undertaken to tackle when a coldblooded girl like this who has no strong attachment is out of spirits and all that sort of thing then is the time she falls to any resolute wooer she will yield if we both insist and we will insist only keep your temper and let nothing tempt you to say an unkind word to her she then rang the bell and desired that miss fountain might be requested to come into the drawingroom for a minute but what are you going to do give her the choice of two husbandsmr talboys or mr hardie she will take neither i am afraid oh yes she will which ah the one she dislikes the least by jove you are rightyou are an angel and the old gentleman in his gratitude to her who was outwitting him and vice versa kissed mrs bazalgettes hand with great devotion in which act he was surprised by lucy who floated through the foldingdoors she said nothing but her face volumes sit down love yes aunt she sat down and her eye mildly bored both relatives like if you can imagine a gentle gimlet worked by insinuation not force then the favored fountain enjoyed the inestimable privilege of beholding a small bout of female fence the accomplished actress of forty began the novice held herself apparently all open with a sweet smile the eye being the only weapon that showed point my love your uncle and i who were not always just to one another have been united by our love for you so i observed as i came inahem henceforth we are one where your welfare is concerned and we have something serious to say to you now there is a report dearest creeping about that you have formed an unfortunate attachmentto a person beneath you who told you that aunt name as they say in the house no matter these things are commonly said without foundation in this wicked world but still it is always worth our while to prove them false not of course directlyqui sexcuse saccusebut indirectly i agree with you and i shall do so in my uncles presence you were present auntthough uninvitedwhen the gentleman you allude to offered me what i consider a great honor and you heard me decline it you are therefore fully able to contradict that report whose source by the by you have not given me and of course you will contradict it mrs bazalgette colored a little but she said affectionately these silly rumors are best contradicted by a good marriage love and that brings me to something more important we have two proposals for you and both of them excellent ones now in a matter where your happiness is at stake your uncle and i are determined not to let our private partialities speak we do press you to select one of these offers but leave you quite free as to which you take mr talboys is a gentleman of old family and large estates mr hardie is a wealthy and able and rising man they are both attached to you both excellent matches whichever you choose your uncle and i shall both feel that an excellent position for life is yours and no regret that you did not choose our especial favorite shall stain our joy or our love with this generous sentiment tears welled from her eyes whereat fountain worshiped her and felt his littleness but lucy was of her own sex and had observed what an unlimited command of eyewater an hysterical female possesses she merely bowed her head graciously and smiled politely thus encouraged to proceed her aunt dried her eyes with a smile and with genial cheerfulness proceeded well then dear which shall it bemr talboys lucy opened her eyes so innocently my dear aunt i wonder at that question from you did you not make me promise you i would never marry that gentleman nor any friend of my uncles and did you cried fountain i did replied the penitent hanging her head my aunt was so kind to me about something or other i forget what fountain bounced up and paced the room mrs bazalgette lowered her voice it is to be mr hardie then mr hardie cried lucy rather loudly to attract her uncles attention oh no the same objection applies there i made my uncle a solemn promise not to marry any friend of yours aunt poor uncle i refused at first but he looked so unhappy my resolution failed and i gave my promise i will keep it uncle dont fear me it caused mrs bazalgette a fierce struggle to command her temper both she and fountain were dumb for a minute then elastic mrs bazalgette said we were both to blame you and i did not really know each other the best thing we can do now is to release the poor girl from these silly promises that stand in the way of her settlement in life i agree madam so do i there lucy choose for we both release you thank you said lucy gravely but how can you no unfair advantage was taken of me i plighted my word knowingly and solemnly and no human power can release persons of honor from a solemn pledge besides just now you would release me but you might not always be in the same mind no i will keep faith with you both and not place my truth at the mercy of any human being nor of any circumstance if that is all please permit me to retire the less a young lady of my age thinks or talks about the other sex the more time she has for her books and her needle and having delivered this precious sentence with a deliberate and most deceiving imitation of the pedantic prude she departed and outside the door broke instantly into a joyous chuckle at the expense of the plotters she had left looking moonstruck in one anothers faces if the new allies had been both fountain the apple of discord this sweet novice threw down between them would have dissolved the alliance as the sly novice meant it to do but while the gentleman went storming about the room ripe for civil war the lady leaned back in her chair and laughed heartily come mr fountain it is no use your being cross with a female or she will get the better of you she has outwitted us we took her for a fool and she is a clever girl illtellyouwhat she is a very clever girl never mind that she is only a girl and if you will be ruled by me her happiness shall be secured in spite of her and she shall be engaged in less than a week fountain recognized his superior and put himself under the ladys ordersin an evil hour for lucy the poor girls triumph over the forces was but momentary her ground was not tenable the person promised can release the person who promisesvolenti non fit injuria lucy found herself attacked with female weapons that you and i sir should laugh at but they made her miserable cold looks short answers solemnity distance hints at ingratitude and perverseness kisses intermitted all day and the parting one at night degraded to a dignified ceremony under this impalpable persecution the young thoroughbred that had steered the boat across the breakers winced and pined she did not want a husband or a lover but she could not live without being loved she was not sent into the world for that she began secretly to hate the two gentlemen that had lost her her relations affection and she looked round to see how she could get rid of them without giving fresh offense to her dear aunt and uncle if she could only make it their own act now a man in such a case inclines to give the obnoxious parties a chance of showing themselves generous and delicate he would reveal the whole situation to them and indicate the generous and manly course but your thorough woman cannot do this it is physically as well as morally impossible to her misogynists say it is too wise and not cunning enough so what does miss lucy do but turn round and make love to captain kenealy and the cold virgin being at last by irrevocable fate driven to lovemaking i will say this for her she did not do it by halves she felt quite safe here the goodnatured hollow captain was fortified against passion by selfadmiration she said to herself now here is a peg with a military suit hanging to it if i can only fix my eyes on this piece of wood and regimentals and make warm love to it the love that poets have dreamed and romances described i may surely hope to disgust my two admirers and then they will abandon me and despise me ah i could love them if they would only do that well for a young lady that had never to her knowledge felt the tender passion the imitation thereof which she now favored that little society with was a wonderful piece of representation was kenealy absent behold lucy uneasy and restless was he present but at a distance her eye demurely devoured him was he near her she wooed him with such a godlike mixture of fire of tenderness of flattery of tact she did so serpentinely approach and coil round the soldier and his mental cavity that all the males in creation should have been permitted to defile past like the beasts going into the ark and view this sweet picture a moment and infer how women would be wooed and then go and do it effect talboys and hardie mortified to the hearts core thought they had altogether mistaken her character she is a lovesick fool on bazalgette ass dodd was worth a hundred of him on kenealy made him twirl his mustache on fountain filled him with dismay there remained only one to be hoodwinked scena a letter is brought in and handed to captain kenealy he reads it and looks a littlea very littlevexed nobody else notices it lucy what is the matter oh what has occurred kenealy nothing particulaa lucy dont deceive us it is an order for you to join the horrid army clasps her hands you are going to leave us kenealy no it is from my tailaa he waunts to be paed glares astonished lucy pay the creature and nevermore employ him kenealy cant havent got the money uncle wont daie the begaa knows i cant pay him that is the reason why he duns lucy he knows it then what business has he to annoy you thus take my advice return no reply that is not courteous but when the sole motive of an application is impertinence silent contempt is the course best befitting your dignity kenealy twirling his mustache dem the fellaa shant take any notice of him mrs bazalgette to lucy in passing do you think we are all fools ibi omnis effusus amor for la bazalgette undeceived her ally and mr hardie and the screw was put harder still on poor lucy she was no longer treated like an equal but made for the first time to feel that her uncle and aunt were her elders and superiors and that she was in revolt all external signs of affection were withdrawn and this was like docking a strawberry of its water a young girl may have flashes of spirit heroism even but her mind is never steel from top to toe it is sure to be wax in more places than one nobody loves me now that poor mr dodd is gone sighed lucy nobody ever will love me unless i consent to sacrifice myself well why not i shall never love any gentleman as others of my sex can love i will go and see mrs wilson so she ordered out her captain and rode to mrs wilson and made her captain hold her pony while she went in mrs wilson received her with a tenor scream of delight that revived lucys heart to hear and then it was nothing but one broad gush of hilarity and cordialityshowed her the house showed her the cows showed her the parlor at last and made her sit down come set ye down set ye down and let me have a downright good look at ye it is not often i clap eyes on ye or on anything like ye for that matter arent ye well my dear oh yes are ye sure havent ye ailed anything since i saw ye up at the house no dear nurse then you are in care bless you it is not the same faceto a stranger belike but not to the one that suckled you why there is next door to a wrinkle on your pretty brow and a little hollow under your eye and your face is drawn like and not half the color you are in trouble or grief of some sort miss lucy andwho knowsmayhap you be come to tell it your poor old nurse you might go to a worse part ay what touches you will touch me my nursling dear all one as if it was your own mother ah you love me cried lucy i dont know why you love me so i have not deserved it of you as i have of others that look coldly on me yes you love me or you would not read my face like this it is true i am a littleoh nurse i am unhappy and in a moment she was weeping and sobbing in mrs wilsons arms the amazon sat down with her and rocked to and fro with her as if she was still a child dont check it my lamb said she have a good cry never drive a cry back on your heart and so lucy sobbed and sobbed and mrs wilson rocked her when she had done sobbing she put up a grateful face and kissed mrs wilson but the good woman would not let her go she still rocked with her and said ay ay it wasnt for nothing i was drawed so to go to your house that day i didnt know you were there but i was drawed i was wanted tell me all my lamb never keep grief on your heart give it a vent put a part ont on me i do claim it you will see how much lighter your heart will feel is it a young man oh no no i hate young men i wish there were no such things but for them no dissension could ever have entered the house my uncle and aunt both loved me once and oh they were so kind to me yes since you permit me i will tell you all and she told her a part she told her the whole talboys and hardie part mrs wilson took a broad and somewhat vulgar view of the distress why miss lucy said she if that is all you can soon sew up their stockings you dont depend on them anyways you are a young lady of property oh am i sure i have heard your dear mother say often as all her money was settled on you by deed why you must be of age miss lucy or near it the day after tomorrow nurse there now i knew your birthday could not be far off well then you must wait till you are of age and then if they torment you or put on you goodmorning says you if we cant agree together lets agree to part says you what leave my relations it is their own fault good friends before bad kindred they only want to make a handle of you to get em rich soninlaws you pluck up a sperrit miss lucy theres no getting through the world without a bit of a sperrit youll get put upon at every turn else and if they dont vally you in that house why off to another yaint chained to their door i do suppose but nurse a young lady cannot live by herself there is no instance of it all wisdom had a beginning oh shant i spoil the pudding once i cut it quoth jacks wife what would people say what could they say you come to me which i am all the mother you have got left upon earth and what scandal could they make out of that i should like to know let them try it but dont let me catch it atween their lips or down they do go on the bare ground and their caps in pieces to the winds of heaven and she flourished her hand and a massive arm with a gesture free inspired and formidable ah nurse with you i should indeed feel safe from every ill but for all that i shall never go beyond the usages of society i shall never leave my aunts house i dont say as you will but i shall get your room ready this afternoon and no later no nurse you must not do that tellee i shall then whether you come or not there tis and when they put on you you have no call to fret says you theres my room awaiting and likewise my welcome too at dame wilsons i dont need to stand no more nonsense here than i do choose says you dear heart even a little foolish simple thought like that will help keep your sperrit up youll see elseyoull see oh nurse how wise you are you know human nature well i am older than you miss a precious sight and if i hadnt got one eye open at this time of day why when should i you know after this a little homemade wine forcibly administered and then much kissing and lucy rode away revivified and cheered and quite another girl her spirits rose so that she proposed to kenealy to extend their ride by crossing the country to she wanted to buy some gloves yaas said the assenter and off they cantered in the gloveshop who should lucy find but eve dodd she held out her hand but eve affected not to observe and bowed distantly lucy would not take the hint after a pause she said have you any news of mr dodd i have was the stiff reply he left us without even saying goodby did he yes after saving all our lives need i say that we are anxious in our turn to hear of his safety it was still very tempestuous when he left us to catch the great ship and he was in an open boat my brother is alive miss fountain if that is what you wish to know alive is he not well has he met with any accident any misfortune is he in the east indiaman has he written to you you are very curious it is rather late in the day but if i am to speak about my brother it must be at home and not in an open shop i cant trust my feelings are you going home miss dodd yes shall i come with you if you like it is close by lucys heart quaked eve was so stern and her eyes like basilisks sit down miss fountain and i will tell you what you have done for my brother i did not court this you know i would have avoided your eye if i could it is your doing yes miss dodd faltered lucy and i should do it again i have a right to inquire after his welfare who saved my life well then miss fountain his saving your life has lost him his ship and ruined him for life oh he came in sight of the ship but the captain that was jealous of him like all the rest made all sail and ran from him he chased her and often was near catching her but she got clear out of the channel and my poor david had to come back disgraced ruined for life and brokenhearted the company will never forgive him for deserting his ship his career is blighted and all for one that never cared a straw for him oh miss fountain it was an evil day for my poor brother when first he saw your face eve would have said more for her heart was burning with wrath and bitterness but she was interrupted lucy raised both her hands to heaven and then bowing her head wept tenderly and humbly a womans tears do not always affect another woman but one reason is they are very often no sign of grief or of any worthy feeling the sex accustomed to read the nicer shades of emotion distinguishes tears of pique tears of disappointment tears of spite tears various from tears of grief but lucys was a burst of regret so sincere of sorrow and pity so tender and innocent that it fell on eves hot heart like the dew ah well she cried it was to be it was to be and i suppose i oughtnt to blame you but all he does for you tells against himself and that does seem hard it isnt as if he and you were anything to one another then i shouldnt grudge it so much he has lost his character as a seaman oh dear he valued it a deal more than his life he was always ready to throw that away for you or anybody else he has lost his standing in the service oh you see he has no interest like some of them he only got on by being better and cleverer than all the rest so the company wont listen to any excuses from him and indeed he is too proud to make them he will never be captain of a ship now captain of a ship will he ever leave the bed of sickness he lies on the bed of sickness is he ill oh what have i done is he ill what do you think my brother is made of iron out all night with youthen off with scarce a wink of sleep then two days and two nights chasing the combermere sometimes gaining sometimes losing and his credit and his good name hanging on it then to beat back against wind heartbroken and no food on board oh it is too horrible he staggered into me white as a ghost i got him to bed he was in a burning fever in the night he was lightheaded and all his talk was about you he kept fretting lest you should not have got safe home it is always so we care the most for those that care the least for us is he in the indiaman no miss fountain he is not in the indiaman cried eve her wrath suddenly rising again he lies there miss fountain in that room at deaths door and you to thank for it at this stab lucy uttered a cry like a wounded deer but this cry was followed immediately by one of terror the door opened suddenly and there stood david dodd looking as white as his sister had said but as usual not in the humor to succumb me at deaths port did you say cried he in a loud tone of cheerful defiance tell that to the marines chapter xxii i heard your voice miss lucy i would know it among a million so i rigged myself directly why what is the matter oh mr dodd sobbed lucy she has told me all you have gone through and i am the wicked wicked cause david groaned if i didnt think as much i heard the mill going ah eve my girl your jawingtackle is too well hung eve is a good sister to me miss lucy and where i am concerned let her alone for making a mountain out of a molehill if you believe all she says you are to blame the thing that went to my heart was to see my skipper run out his stunsel booms the moment he saw me overhauling him it was a dirty action and him an old shipmate i am glad now i couldnt catch her for if i had my foot would not have been on the deck two seconds before his carcass would have been in the channel and pray eve what has miss fountain got to do with that the dirty lubber wasnt bred at her school or he would not have served an old messmate so belay all that and lets hear something worth hearing now miss lucy you tell meoh lord eve i say isnt the thundering old dingy room bright nowyou spin me your own yarn if you will be so good here you are safe and sound the lord be praised but i left you under the lee of that thundering island wasnt very polite was it but you will excuse wont you duty you knowa seaman must leave his pleasure for his duty tell me now how did you come on was the vessel comfortable you would not sail till the wind fell had you a good voyage a tiresome one i am afraid the sloop wasnt built for fast sailing when did you land to this fire of eager questions lucy was in no state to answer oh no mr dodd she cried i cant i am choking yes miss dodd i am the heartless unfeeling girl you think me then with a sudden dart she took davids hand and kissed it and both her hands hiding her blushing face she fled and a single sob she let fall at the door was the last of her so sudden was her exit it left both brother and sister stupefied eve she is offended said david with dismay what if she is retorted eve no she is not offended but i have made her feel at last and a good job too why should she escape she has done all the mischief come you go to bed not i i have been long enough on my beamends and i have heard her voice and have seen her face and they have put life into me i shall cruise about the port i have gone to leeward of john companys favor but there are plenty of coastingvessels i may get the command of one ill try a seaman never strikes his flag while theres a shot in the locker here put me up captain kenealy oh do pray make haste dont dawdle so off cantered lucy and fanned her pony along without mercy at the door of the house she jumped off without assistance and ran to mr bazalgettes study and knocked hastily and that gentleman was not a little surprised when this unusual visitor came to his side with some signs of awe at having penetrated his sanctum but evidently driven by an overpowering excitement oh uncle bazalgette oh uncle bazalgette why what is the matter why the child is ill dont gasp like that lucy come pluck up courage i am sure to be on your side you know what is it uncle you are always so kind to me you know you are oh am i noble old fellow oh dont make me laugh ha ha oh oh oh ha oh confound it i have sent her into hysterics no she is coming round ten thousand million devils has anybody been insulting the child in my house they have my wife for a guinea no no no it is about mr dodd mr dodd oho i have ruined him how have you managed that my dear then lucy all in a flutter told mr bazalgette what the reader has just learned he looked grave lucy said he be frank with me is not mr dodd in love with you i will be frank with you dear uncle because you are frank poor mr dodd did love me once but i refused him and so his good sense and manliness cured him directly so now that he no longer loves you you love him that is so like you girls oh no uncle how ridiculous if i loved mr dodd i could repair the cruel injuries i have done him with a single word i have only to recall my refusal and hebut i do not love mr dodd esteem him i do and he has saved my life and is he to lose his health and his character and his means of honorable ambition for that do you not see how shocking this is and how galling to my pride yes uncle i have been insulted his sister told me to my face it was an evil day for him when he and i first metthat was at uncle fountains well and what am i to do lucy dear uncle what i thought was if you would be so kind as to use your influence with the company in his favor tell them that if he did miss his ship it was not by a fault but by a noble virtue tell them that it was to save a fellow creatures lifea young ladys lifeone that did not deserve it from him your own nieces tell them it is not for your honor he should be disgraced oh uncle you know what to say so much better than i do bazalgette grinned and straightway resolved to perpetrate a practical joke and a very innocent one well said he the best way i can think of to meet your views will be i think to get him appointed to the new ship the company is building lucy opened her eyes and the blood rushed to her cheek oh uncle do i hear right a ship are you so powerful are you so kind do you love your poor niece so well as all this oh uncle bazalgette there is no end to my power said the old man solemnly no limit to my goodness no bounds to my love for my poor niece are you in a hurry my poor niece shall we have his commission down tomorrow or wait a month tomorrow is it possible oh yes i count the minutes till i say to his sister there miss dodd i have friends who value me too highly to let me lie under these galling obligations dear dear uncle i dont mind being under them to you because i love you kisses and not mr dodd no dear and that is the reason i would rather give him a ship thanthe only other thing that would make him happy and really but for your goodness i should have been tempted toha ha oh i am so happy now no much as i admire my preservers courage and delicacy and unselfishness and goodness i dont love him so but for this he must have been unhappy for life and then i should have been miserable forever perfectly clear and satisfactory my dear now if the commission is to be down tomorrow you must not stay here because i have other letters to write to go by the same courier that takes my application for the ship and do you really think i will go till i have kissed you uncle bazalgette on a subject so important i hardly venture to give an opinhallo kissing indeed why it is like a young wolf flying at horseflesh then that will teach you not to be kinder to me than anybody else is lucy ran out radiant and into the garden here she encountered kenealy and coming on him with a blaze of beauty and triumph fired a resolution that had smoldered in him a day or two he twirled his mustache andpopped briefly chapter xxiii after the first start of rueful astonishment the indignation of the just fired lucys eyes she scolded him well was this his return for all her late kindness she hinted broadly at the viper of aesop and indicated more faintly an animal that when one bestows the choicest favors on it turns and rends one then becoming suddenly just to the brute creation she said no it is only your abominable sex that would behave so perversely so ungratefully dont understand drawled kenealy i thought you would laike it well you see i dont laike it you seemed to be getting rather spooney on me spooney what is that one of your messroom terms i suppose yaas so i thought you waunted me to pawp captain kenealy this subterfuge is unworthy of you you know perfectly well why i distinguished you others pestered me with their attachments and nonsense and you spared me that annoyance in return i did all in my power to show you the grateful friendship i thought you worthy of but you have broken faith you have violated the clear though tacit understanding that subsisted between us and i am very angry with you i have some little influence left with my aunt sir and unless i am much mistaken you will shortly rejoin the army sir what a boa what a demd boa and dont swear that is another foolish custom you gentlemen have it is almost as foolish as the other yes ill tell my aunt of you and then you will see what a boa how horrid spaiteful you are well i am rather vindictive but my aunt is ten times worse as her deserter shall find unless unless whawt unless you beg my pardon directly and at this part of the conversation lucy was fain to turn her head away for she found it getting difficult to maintain that severe countenance which she thought necessary to clothe her words with terror and subjugate the gallant captain well then i apolojaize said kenealy and i accept your apology and dont do it again i wont pon honaa look heah i swear i didnt mean to affront yah i dont waunt yah to mayrry me i only proposed out of civility come then it was not so black as it appeared courtesy is a good thing and if you thought that after staying a month in a house you were bound by etiquette to propose to the marriageable part of it it is pardonable only dont do it again please ill take caaill take caa i say your tempaa is notquitewhat those other fools think it isno by jove and the captain glared nonsense i am only a little fiendish on this one point well then steer clear of it and you will find me a good crechaa on every other kenealy vowed he would profit by the advice then there is my hand we are friends again you wont tell your aunt nor the other fellaas captain kenealy i am not one of your garrison ladies i am a young person who has been educated your extra civility will never be known to a soul and you shall not join the army but as a volunteer then dem me miss fountain if i wouldnt be cut in pieces to oblaige you just you tray me and youll faind if i am not very braight i am a man of honah if those ether begaas annoy you jaast tell me and ill parade em at twelve paces dem me i must try and find some less insane vent for your friendly feelings and what can i do for you yah couldnt go on pretending to be spooney on me could yah oh no no what for i laike it makes the other begaas misable what worthy sentiments it is a sin to balk them i am sure there is no reason why i should not appear to adore you in public so long as you let me keep my distance in private but persons of my sex cannot do just what they would like we have feelings that pull us this way and that and after all this i am afraid i shall never have the courage to play those pranks with you again and that is a pity since it amused you and teased those that tease me in short the house now contained two holy alliances instead of one unfortunately for lucy the hostile one was by far the stronger of the two and even now it was preparing a terrible coup this evening the storm that was preparing blew good to one of a depressed class which cannot fail to gratify the just mrs bazalgette jane come to my room a minute i have something for you here is a cashmere gown and cloak the cloak i want i can wear it with anything but you may have the gown oh thank you mum it is beautiful and amost as good as new i am sure mum i am very much obliged to you for your kindness no no you are a good girl and a sensible girl by the by you might give me your opinion upon something does miss lucy prefer any one of our guests you understand me well mum it is hard to say miss lucy is as reserved as ever oh i thought she mightahem no mum i do assure you not a word well but you are a shrewd girl tell me what you think now for instance suppose she was compelled to choose between say mr hardie and mr talboys which would it be well mum if you ask my opinion i dont think miss lucy is the one to marry a fool and by all accounts theres a deal more in mr hardiess head than what there isnt in mr talboyseses you are a clever girl you shall have the cloak as well and if my niece marries you shall remain in her service all the same thank you kindly mum i dont desire no better mistress married or single and mr hardies is much respected in the town and heaps o money so miss and me we couldnt do no better neither of us your servant mum and thanks you for your bounty and jane courtesied twice and went off with the spoils in the corridor she met old fountain stop jane said he i want to speak to you at your service sir in the first place i want to give you something to buy a new gown and he took out a couple of sovereigns where am i to put them in your breastpocket put them under the cloak sir murmured jane tenderly she loved sovereigns he put his hand under the heap of cashmere and a quick little claw hit the coins and closed on them by almighty instinct now i want to ask your opinion is my niece in love with anyone well mr fountains if she is she dont show it but doesnt she like one man better than another you may take your oath of that if we could but get to her mind which does she like best this hardie or mr talboys come tell me now well sir you know mr talboys is an old acquaintance and like brother and sister at font abbey i do suppose she have been a scare of times alone with him for one with mr hardies that she should take up with a stranger and jilt an old acquaintance now is it feasible why of course not it was a foolish question you are a young woman of sense heres a pound note for you you must not tell i spoke to you now is it likely sir my character would be broken forever and you shall be with my niece when she is mrs talboys i might do worse sir and so might she he is respected far and wide and a grand house and a carriage and four and everything to make a lady comfortable your servant sir and wishes you many thanks and such as jane was all true servants are the ancients used to bribe the oracle of delphi curious chapter xxiv lucys twentyfirst birthday dawned but it was not to her the gay exulting day it is to some last night her uncle and aunt had gone a step further and instead of kissing her ceremoniously had evaded her they were drawing matters to a climax once of age each day would make her more independent in spirit as in circumstances this morning she hoped custom would shield her from unkindness for one day at least but no they made it clear there was but one way back to their smiles their congratulations at the breakfasttable were cold and constrained her heart fell and long before noon on her birthday she was crying thus weakened she had to encounter a thoroughly prepared attack mr bazalgette summoned her to his study at one oclock and there she found him and mrs bazalgette and mr fountain seated solemnly in conclave the merchant was adding up figures come now business said he dick has added them up his figures are in that envelope break the seal and open it lucy if his total corresponds with mine we are right if not i am wrong and you will all have to go over it with me till we are right a general groan followed this announcement luckily the sum totals corresponded to a fraction then mr bazalgette made lucy a little speech my dear in laying down that office which your amiable nature has rendered so agreeable i feel a natural regret on your account that the property my colleague there and i have had to deal with on your account has not been more important however as far as it goes we have been fortunate consols have risen amazingly since we took you off land and funded you the rise in value of your little capital since your mothers death is calculated on this card you have also some loose cash which i will hand over to you immediately let me seeeleven hundred and sixty pounds and five shillings write your name in full on that paper lucy he touched a bell a servant came he wrote a line and folded it inclosing lucys signature let this go to mr hardies bank immediately hardie will give you three per cent for your money better than nothing you must have a checkbook he sent me a new one yesterday here it is you shall have it i wonder whether you know how to draw a check no uncle look here then you note the particulars first on this counterfoil which thus serves in some degree for an accountbook in drawing the check place the sum in letters close to these printed words and the sum in figures close to the pound for want of this precaution the holder of the check has been known to turn a pound check into pounds oh how wicked mind what you say dexterity is the only virtue left in england so we must be on our guard especially in what we write with our name attached i must say mr bazalgette you are unwise to put such a sum of money into a young girls hands the young girl has been a woman an hour and ten minutes and come into her property movables and cash aforesaid if you were her real friend you would take care of her money for her till she marries the eighth commandment my dear the eighth commandment and other primitive axioms suum cuique and such odd sayings him as keeps what isnt hisn soon or late shall go to prison with similar apothegms total let us keep the british merchant and the newgate thief as distinct as the times permit fountain and bazalgette account squared books closed and im off oh uncle pray stay said lucy when you are by me rectitude and sense seem present in person and i can lean on them lean on yourself the law has cut your leadingstrings why patch em it has made you a woman from a baby rise to your new rank rectitude and sense are just as much wanted in the town of where i am due as they are in this house besides sense has spoken uninterrupted for ten minutes prodigious so now it is nonsenses turn for the next ten hours he made for the door then suddenly returning said i will leave a grain of sense etc behind me what is marriage do you give it up marriage is a contract who are the parties the papas and mammas uncles and aunts by george you would think so to hear them talk no the contract is between two parties and these two only it is a printed contract anybody can read it gratis none but idiots sign a contract without reading it none but knaves sign a contract which having read they find they cannot execute matrimony is a mercantile affair very well then import into it sound mercantile morality go to market sell well but dn it all deliver the merchandise as per sample viz a woman warranted to love honor and obey the purchaser if you swindle the other contracting party in the essentials of the contract dont complain when you are unhappy are shufflers entitled to happiness and what are those who shuffle and prevaricate in a church any better than those who shuffle and prevaricate in a countinghouse and the brute bolted my husband is a worthy man said mrs bazalgette languidly but now and then he makes me blush for him our good friend is a humorist replied fountain goodhumoredly and dearly loves a paradox and they poohpoohed him without a particle of malice then mrs bazalgette turned to lucy and hoped that she did her the justice to believe she had none but affectionate motives in wishing to see her speedily established oh no aunt said lucy why should you wish to part with me i give you but little trouble in your great house trouble child you know you are a comfort to have in any house this pleased lucy it was the first gracious word for a long time having thus softened her mrs bazalgette proceeded to attack her by all the weaknesses of her sex and age and for a good hour pressed her so hard that the tears often gushed from lucys eyes over her red cheeks the girl was worn by the length of the struggle and the pertinacity of the assault she was as determined as ever to do nothing but she had no longer the power to resist in words seeing her reduced to silence and not exactly distinguishing between impassibility and yielding mrs bazalgette delivered the coupdegrace i must now tell you plainly lucy that your character is compromised by being out all night with persons of the other sex i would have spared you this but your resistance compels those who love you to tell you all owing to that unfortunate trip you are in such a situation that you must marry the world is surely not so unjust as all this sighed lucy you dont know the world as i do was the reply and those who live in it cannot defy it i tell you plainly lucy neither your uncle nor i can keep you any longer except as an engaged person and even that engagement ought to be a very short one what aunt what uncle your house is no longer mine and she buried her head upon the table well lucy said mr fountain of course we would not have told you this yesterday it would have been ungenerous but you are now your own mistress you are independent young persons in your situation can generally forget in a day or two a few years of kindness you have now an opportunity of showing us whether you are one of that sort here mrs bazalgette put in her word you will not lack people to encourage you in ingratitudeperhaps my husband himself but if he does it will make a lasting breach between him and me of which you will have been the cause heaven forbid said lucy with a shudder why should dear mr bazalgette be drawn into my troubles he is no relation of mine only a loyal friend whom may god bless and reward for his kindness to a poor fatherless motherless girl aunt uncle if you will let me stay with you i will be more kind more attentive to you than i have been be persuaded be advised if you succeeded in getting rid of me you might miss me indeed you might i know all your little ways so well lucy we are not to be tempted to do wrong said mrs bazalgette sternly choose which of these two offers you will accept choose which you please if you refuse both you must pack up your things and go and live by yourself or with mr dodd mr dodd why is his name introduced was it necessary to insult me and her eyes flashed nobody wishes to insult you lucy and i propose madam we give her a day to consider thank you uncle with all my heart only until she decides she must excuse me if i do not treat her with the same affection as i used and as i hope to do again i am deeply wounded and i am one that cannot feign you need not fear me aunt my heart is turned to ice i shall never intrude that love on which you set no value may i retire mrs bazalgette looked to mr fountain and both bowed acquiescence lucy went out pale but dryeyed despair never looked so lovely or carried its head more proudly i dont like it said mr fountain i am afraid we have driven the poor girl too hard what are you afraid of pray she looked to me just like a woman who would go and take an ounce of laudanum poor lucy she has been a good niece to me after all and the water stood in the old bachelors eyes mrs bazalgette tapped him on the shoulder and said archly but with a tone that carried conviction she will take no poison she will hate us for an hour then she will have a good cry tomorrow she will come to our terms and this day next year she will be very much obliged to us for doing what all women like forcing her to her good with a little harshness chapter xxv said lucy as she went from the door thank heaven they have insulted me this does not sound logical but that is only because the logic is so subtle and swift she meant something of this kind i am of a yielding nature i might have sacrificed myself to retain their affection but they have roused a vice of mine my pride against them so now i shall be immovable in right thanks to my wicked pride thank heaven they have insulted me she then laid her head upon her bed and moaned for she was stricken to the heart then she rose and wrote a hasty note and putting it in her bosom came downstairs and looked for captain kenealy he proved to be in the billiardroom playing the spotted ball against the plain one oh captain kenealy i am come to try your friendship you said i might command you yaas then will you mount my pony and ride with this to mrs wilson to that farm where i kept you waiting so long and you were not angry as anyone else would have been yaas but not a soul must see it or know where you are gone all raight miss fountain dont you be fraightened im close as the grave and ill be there in less than haelf an hour yes but dont hurt my dear pony either dont beat him and above all dont come back without an answer ill bring you an answer in an hour and twenty minutes the captain looked at his watch and went out with a smartness that contrasted happily with his slowness of speech lucy went back to her own room and locked herself in and with trembling hands began to pack up her jewels and some of her clothes but when it came to this wounded pride was sorely taxed by a host of reminiscences and tender regrets and every now and then the tears suddenly gushed and fell upon her poor hands as she put things out or patted them flat to wander on the world while she is thus sorrowfully employed let me try and give an outline of the feelings that had now for some time been secretly growing in her since without their cooperation she would never have been driven to the strange step she now meditated lucy was a very unselfish and very intelligent girl the first trait had long blinded her to something the second had lately helped to open her eyes if ever you find a person quick to discover selfishness in others be sure that person is selfish for it is only the selfish who come into habitual collision with selfishness and feel how sharppointed a thing it is when unselfish meets selfish each acts after his kind unselfish gives way selfish holds his course and so neither is thwarted and neither finds out the others character lucy then of herself would never have discovered her relatives egotism but they helped her and she was too bright not to see anything that was properly pointed out to her when fountain kept showing and proving mrs bazalgettes egotism and mrs bazalgette kept showing and proving mr fountains egotism lucy ended by seeing both their egotisms as clearly as either could desire and as she despised egotism she lost her respect for both these people and let them convince her they were both persons against whom she must be on her guard this was the direct result of their mines and countermines heretofore narrated but not the only result it followed indirectly but inevitably that the present holy alliance failed lucy had not forgotten the past and to her this seemed not a holy but an unholy hollow and empty alliance they hate one another said she but it seems they hate me worse since they can hide their mutual dislike to combine against poor me another thing lucy was one of those women who thirst for love and though not vain enough to be always showing they think they ought to be beloved have quite secret amour propre enough to feel at the bottom of their hearts that they were sent here to that end and that it is a folly and a shame not to love them more or less if ever madame ristori plays maria stuarda within a mile of you go and see her dont chatter you can do that at home attend to the scene the worst play ever played is not so unimproving as chitchat then when the scaffold is even now erected and the poor queen pale and tearful palpitates in deaths grasp you shall see her suddenly illumined with a strange joy and hear her say with a marvelous burst of feminine triumph i have been amata molto uttered under a scaffold as the italian utters it this line is a revelation of womanhood the english virgin of our humbler tale had a soul full of this feeling only she had never learned to set the love of sex above other loves but mark you for that very reason a mortal insult to her heart from her beloved relatives was as mortifying humiliating and unpardonable as is to other highspirited girls an insult from their favored lover what could she do more than she had done to win their love no their hearts were inaccessible to her they wish to get rid of me well they shall they refuse me their houses well i will show them the value of their houses to me it was their hearts i clung to not their houses a tap came to lucys door who is that i am busy oh miss said an agitated voice may i speak to youthe captain what captain inquired lucy without opening the door knealys miss i will come out to you now has captain kenealy returned already la no miss he havent been anywhere as i know of he had them about him as couldnt spare him something is the matter jane what is it jane lowered her voice mysteriously well miss the captain isin trouble oh

all out of one of the men as its a army tailor which he wrote again and again and sent his bill and the captain he took no notice then the tailor he sent him a writ and the captain he took no notice then the tailor he lawed him but the captain he kep on a taking no more notice nor if it was a dog a barking and then a putting all them ere barks one after another in a letter and sending them by the post so the end is the captain is arrested and now he behooves to attend a bit to what is a going on around an about him as the saying is and so he is waiting to pay you his respects before he starts for bridewell my fatal advice i ruin all my friends keep dark says he dont tell a soul except miss fountain where is he oh jane offered to show her that and took her to the stable yard arriving with a face full of tender pity and concern lucy was not a little surprised to find the victim smoking cigars in the center of his smoking captors the men touched their hats and captain kenealy said isnt it a boa miss fountain they wont let me do your little commission in london they will go anywhere with a fellaa london ye knows explained the assistant but this here is full of hins and houts and

beautifulwrote checks to the bank the cry is always no assets but uncle bazalgette said everybody would give me money for it what is mr bazalgette your uncle marm then you go to him and get his check in place of yours and the captain will be free as the birds in the hair oh thank you sir cried lucy and the next minute she was in mr bazalgettes study uncle dont be angry with me it is for no unworthy purpose only dont ask me it might mortify another but would you give me a check of your own for mine they will not receive mine mr bazalgette looked grave and even sad but he sat quietly down without a word and drew her a check taking hers which he locked in his desk the tears were in lucys eyes at his gravity and his delicacy some day i will tell you said she i have nothing to reproach myself indeedindeed make the rogueor jadegive you a receipt groaned bazalgette all right marm this time captain the world is hall before you where to chewse but this is for ninety marm and he put his

creditors verehas we hare honly servants of the ke veen suggested no hashing his mistresss english stow your gab bill and mizzle let the captain thank the lady goodday marm oh my poor friend what language and my ill advice threw you into their company captain kenealy told her in his brief way that the circumstance was one of no import except in so far as it had impeded his discharge of his duty to her he then mounted the pony which had been waiting for him more than half an hour but it is five oclock said lucy you will be too late for dinner dinner be demd drawled the man of action and rode off like a flash it is to be then said lucy and her heart ebbed it had ebbed and flowed a good many times in the last hour or two captain kenealy reappeared in the middle of dinner lucy scanned his face but it was like the outside of a copybook and she was on thorns being too late he lost his place near her at dinner and she could not whisper to him however when the ladies retired he opened the door and lucy let fall a word at his feet come up before the rest acting on this order kenealy came up and found lucy playing sad tunes softly on the piano and mrs bazalgette absent she was trying something on upstairs he gave lucy a note from mrs wilson she opened it and the joyful color suffused her cheek and she held out her hand to him but as she turned her head away mighty prettily at the same time she did not see the captain was proffering a second document and she was a little surprised when instead of a warm grasp all friendship and no love a piece of paper was shoved into her delicate palm she took it looked first at kenealy then at it and was sore puzzled the document was in kenealys handwriting and at first lucy thought it must be intended as a mere specimen of caligraphy for not only was it beautifully written but in letters of various sizes there were three gigantic vowels i o u there were little wee notifications of time and place and other particulars of medium size the general result was that henry kenealy od lucy fountain ninety pound for value received per loan lucy caught at the meaning but my dear friend said she innocently you mistake i did not lend it you i meant to give it you will you not accept it are we not friends much oblaiged couldnt do it dishonable oh pray do not let me wound your pride i know what it is to have ones pride wounded call it a loan if you wish but dear friend what am i to do with this when you want the money order your man of business to present it to me and if i dont pay lock me up for i shall deserve it i think i understand this is a memoranduma sort of reminder yaas then clearly i am not the person to whom it should be given no if you want to be reminded of this mighty matter put this in your desk if it gets into mine you will never see it again i will give you fair warning therehide itquickhere they come they did come all but mr bazalgette who was at work in his study mr talboys came up to the piano and said gravely miss fountain are you aware of the fate of the luggerof the boat we went out in indeed i am i have sent the poor widow some clothes and a little money i have only just been informed of it said mr talboys and i feel under considerable obligations to mr dodd the feeling does you credit should you meet him will you do me the honor to express my gratitude to him i would with pleasure mr talboys but there is no chance whatever of my seeing mr dodd his sister is staying in market street no and if you would call on them or write to them it would be a kindness and i think they would both feel it humph said talboys doubtfully here a servant stepped up to miss fountain master would be glad to see you in his study miss i have got something for you lucy i know what it is so run away with it and read it in your own room for i am busy he handed her a long sealed packet she took it trembling and flew to her own room with it like a hawk carrying off a little bird to its nest she broke the enormous seal and took out the inclosure it was david dodds commission he was captain of the rajah the new ship of eleven hundred tons burden while she gazes at it with dilating eye and throbbing heart i may as well undeceive the reader this was not really effected in fortyeight hours bazalgette only pretended that partly out of fun partly out of nobility ever since a certain interview in his study with david dodd who was a man after his own heart he had taken a note and had worked for him with the company for bazalgette was one of those rare men who reduce performance to a certainty long before they promise his promises were like piecrust made to be eaten and eaten hot lucy came out of her room and at the same moment issued forth from hers mrs bazalgette in a fine new dress it was that black glace silk divested of gloom by cheerful accessories in which she had threatened to mourn eternally lucys watery fate fire flashed from the young ladys eyes at the sight of it she went down to her uncle muttering between her ivory teeth all the sameall the same and her heart flowed the next minute at sight of mr bazalgette it ebbed she came into his room saying oh uncle bazalgette it is not to thank youthat i can never do worthily it is to ask another favor do pray let me spend this evening with you let me be where you are i will be as still as a mouse see i have brought some work or if you would but let me help you indeed uncle i am not a fool i am very quick to learn at the bidding of those i love let me write your letters for you or fold them up or direct them or somethingdo pray oh the caprices of young ladies well can you write large and plain not you i can imitate anything or anybody imitate this hand then ill walk and dictate you sit and write oh how nice delicious the first is tohetherington now lucy this is a dishonest ungrateful old rogue who has made thousands by me and now wants to let me into a mine with nothing in it but water it would suck up twenty thousand pounds as easily as that blottingpaper will suck up our signature heartless traitor monster cried lucy are you ready yes and her eye flashed and the pen was to her a stiletto bazalgette dictated my dear sir what to a cheat custom child ill have a stamp made besides if we let them see we see through them they would play closer and closer my dear sirin answer to yours of date th instant i regret to saythat circumstances preventmy closingwith your obligingand friendly offer they wrote eight letters and lucys quick fingers folded up prospectuses and her rays brightened the room when the work was done she clung round mr bazalgette and caressed him and seemed strangely unwilling to part with him at all in fact it was twelve oclock and the drawingroom empty when they parted at one oclock the whole house was dark except one room and both windows of that room blazed with light and it happened there was a spectator of this phenomenon a man stood upon the grass and eyed those lights as if they were the stars of his destiny it was david dodd poor david he had struck a bargain and was to command a coasting vessel and carry wood from the thames to our southern ports an irresistible impulse brought him to look before he sailed on the place that held the angel who had destroyed his prospects and whom he loved as much as ever though he was too proud to court a second refusal she watches too thought david but it is not for me as i for her at half past one the lights began to dance before his wearied eyes and presently david weakened by his late fever dozed off and forgot all his troubles and slept as sweetly on the grass as he had often slept on the hard deck with his head upon a gun luck was against the poor fellow he had not been unconscious much more than ten minutes when lucys window opened and she looked out and he never saw her nor did she see him for though the moon was bright it was not shining on him he lay within the shadow of a tree but lucy did see somethinga light upon the turnpike road about forty yards from mr bazalgettes gates she slipped cautiously down a bandbox in her hand and unbolting the door that opened on the garden issued out passed within a few yards of dodd and went round to the front and finally reached the turnpike road there she found mrs wilson with a lightcovered cart and horse and a lantern at sight of her mrs wilson put out the light and they embraced then they spoke in whispers come darling dont tremble have you got much more oh yes several things look at that now but dear heart i was the same at your age and should be now like enough fetch them all as quick as you like i am feared to leave blackbird or id help you down with em is there nobody with you to take care of us what do you meanmen folk not if i know it you are right you are wise oh how courageous and she went back for her finery and certain it is she had more baggage than i should choose for a forced march but all has an endeven a female luggage train so at last she put out all her lights and came down stepping like a fairy with a large basket in her hand now it happened that by this time the moons position was changed and only a part of david lay in the shade his head and shoulders glittered in broad moonlight and lucy taking her farewell of a house where she had spent many happy days cast her eyes all around to bid goodby and spied a man lying within a few paces and looking like a corpse in the silver sheen she dropped her basket her knees knocked together with fear and she flew toward mrs wilson but she did not go far for the features indistinct as they were by distance and pale light struck her mind and she stopped and looked timidly over her shoulder the figure never moved then with beating heart she went toward him slowly and so stealthily that she would have passed a mouse without disturbing it and presently she stood by him and looked down on him as he lay and as she looked at him lying there so pale so uncomplaining so placid under her windows this silent proof of love and the thought of the raging sea this helpless form had steered her through and all he had suffered as well as acted for her made her bosom heave and stirred all that was woman within her he loved her still then or why was he here and then the thought that she had done something for him too warmed her heart still more toward him and there was nothing for her to repel now for he lay motionless there was nothing for her to escapehe did not pursue her nothing to negativehe did not propose anything to her her instinct of defense had nothing to lay hold of so womanlike she had a strong impulse to wake him and be kind to himas kind as she could be without committing herself but on the other hand there was shy trembling virgin modesty and shame that he should detect her making a midnight evasion and fear of letting him think she loved him while she stood thus with something drawing her on and something drawing her back and palpitating in every fiber mrs wilsons voice was heard in low but anxious tones calling her a feather turned the balanced scale she must go fate had decided for her she was called then the sprites of mischief tempted her to let david know she had been near him she longed to put his commission into his pocket but that was impossible it was at the very bottom of her box she took out her tablets wrote the word adieu tore out half the leaf and bending over david attached the little bit of paper by a pin to the tail of his coat if he had been ever so much awake he could not have felt her doing it for her hand touching him and the white paper settling on his coat was all done as lights a spot of down on still water from the bending neck of a swan no dear mrs wilson we must not go yet i will hold the horse and you must go back for me for something im agreeable what is it why what is up how you do pant i have made a discovery there is a gentleman lying asleep there on the wet grass lackadaisy why you dont say so it is a friend and he will catch his death why of course he will he will have had a drop too much miss lucy ill wake him and we will take him along home with us oh not for the world nurse i would not have him see what i am doing oh not for all the world where is he in there under the great tree well you get into the cart miss and hold the reins and mrs wilson went into the grounds and soon found david she put her hand on his shoulder and he awoke directly and looked surprised at mrs wilson are you better sir said the good woman why if it isnt the handsome gentleman that was so kind to me now do ee go in sirdo ee go in you will catch your death o cold she made sure he was staying at the house david looked up at lucys windows yes i will go home mrs wilson there is nothing to stay for now and he accompanied her to the cart but mrs wilson remembered lucys desire not to be seen so she said very loud im sure its very lucky me and my niece happened to be coming home so late and see you lying there well one good turn deserves another come and see me at my farm you go through the village of harrowden and anybody there will tell you where dame wilson do live i would ask you tonight but she hesitated and lucy let down her veil no thank you not now my sister will be fretting as it is goodmorning and his steps were heard retreating as mrs wilson mounted the cart well i should have liked to have taken him home and warmed him a bit said the good woman to lucy it is enough to give him the rheumatics for life however he is not the first honest man as has had a drop too much and taken s rest without a featherbed alack miss why you are all of a tremble what ails you im a fool to ask ah well youll soon be at home and naught to vex you that is right have a good cry do ay ay tis hard to be forced to leave our nest but all places are bright where love abides and theres honest hearts both here and there and the same sky above us wherever we wander and the god of the fatherless above that and better a peaceful cottage than a palace full of strife and with many such homely sayings the rustic consoled her nursling on their little journey not quite in vain chapter xxvi next morning the house was in an uproar servants ran to and fro and the fishpond was dragged at mr fountains request but on these occasions everybody claims a right to speak and jane came into the breakfastroom and said if you please mum miss lucy isnt in the pond for she have taken a good part of her clothes and all her jewels this piece of common sense convinced everybody on the spot except mrs bazalgette that lady if she had decided on making a hole in the water would have sat on the bank first and clapped on all her jewels and all her richest dresses one on the top of another finally mr bazalgette who wore a somber air and had not said a word requested everybody to mind their own business i have a communication from lucy said he and i do not at present disapprove the step she has taken all eyes turned with astonishment toward him and the next moment all voices opened on him like a pack of hounds but he declined to give them any further information between ourselves he had none to give the little note lucy left on his table merely begged him to be under no anxiety and prayed him to suspend his judgment of her conduct till he should know the whole case it was his strong good sense which led him to pretend he was in the whole secret by this means he substituted mystery for scandal and contrived that the girls folly might not be irreparable at the same time he was deeply indignant with her and above all with her hypocrisy in clinging round him and kissing him the very night she meditated flight from his house i must find the girl out and get her back said he and directly after breakfast he collected his myrmidons and set them to discover her retreat the outward framework of the holy alliance remained standing but within it was dissolving fast each of the allies was even now thinking how to find lucy and make a separate peace during the flutter which now subsided one person had done nothing but eat pigeonpie it was kenealy captain of horse now eating pigeonpie is not in itself a suspicious act but ladies are so sharp mrs bazalgette said to herself this creature alone is not a bit surprised for bazalgette is fibbing why is this creature not surprised humph captain kenealy said she in honeyed tones what would you advise us to do advertaize drawled the captain as cool as a cucumber advertise what publish her name no no names ill tell you and he proceeded to drawl out very slowly from memory the following advertisement n bthe captain was a great reader of advertisements and of little else wanderaa retarn if l f will retarnto her afflictedrelativesshe shall be received with open aams and shall be forgotten and forgivenand reunaited affection shall solace every wound that is the style it always brings em backdayvilish good paiehave some moa mr fountain and mrs bazalgette raised an outcry against the captains advice and when the table was calm again mrs bazalgette surprised them all by fixing her eyes on kenealy and saying quietly you know where she is she added more excitedly now dont deny it on your honor sir have you no idea where my niece is upon my honah i have an idea then tell me id rayther not perhaps you would prefer to tell me in private no prefer not to tell at all then the whole table opened on him and appealed to his manly feeling his sense of hospitality his humanityto gratify their curiosity kenealy stretched himself out from the waist downward and delivered himself thus with a double infusion of his drawl see yah all demd first at noon on the same day by the interference of mrs bazalgette the british army was swelled with kenealy captain of horse the whole day passed and lucys retreat was not yet discovered but more than one hunter was hemming her in the next day being the second after her elopement with her nurse at eleven in the forenoon lucy and mrs wilson sat in the little parlor working mrs wilson had seen the poultry fed the butter churned and the pudding safe in the pot and her mind was at ease for a good hour to come so she sat quiet and peaceful lucy too was at peace her eye was clear and her color coming back she was not bursting with happiness for there was a sweet pensiveness mixed with her sweet tranquillity but she looked every now and then smiling from her work up at mrs wilson and the dame kept looking at her with a motherly joy caused by her bare presence on that hearth lucy basked in these maternal glances at last she said nurse my dear if you had never done anything for me still i should know you loved me should ye now oh yes there is the look in your eye that i used to long to see in my poor aunts but it never came well miss lucy i cant help it to think it is really you setting there by my fire i do feel like a cat with one kitten you should check me glaring you out o countenance like that check you i could not bear to lose one glance of that honest tender eye i would not exchange one for all the flatteries of the world i am so happy here so tranquil under my nurses wing with this declaration came a little sigh mrs wilson caught it is there nothing wanting dear no well i do keep wishing for one thing what is that oh i cant help my thoughts but you can help keeping them from me nurse well my dear i am like a mother i watch every word of yours and every look and it is my belief you deceive yourself a bit many a young maid has done that i do judge there is a young man that is more to you than you think for who on earth is that nurse asked lucy coloring the handsome young gentleman oh they are all handsomeall my pests the one i found under your window miss lucy he wasnt in liquor so what was he there for and you know you were not at your ease till you had made me go and wake him and send him home and you were all of a tremble im a widdy now and can speak my mind to menfolk all one as womenfolk but ive been a maid and i can mind how i was in those days liking did use to whisper me to do so and so shyness up and said la not for all the world whatll he think oh nurse do you believe me capable of loving one who does not love me no who said he doesnt love you what was he there for i stick to that now nurse dear be reasonable if mr dodd loved me would he go to sleep in my presence eh miss lucy the poor soul was maybe asleep before you left your room it is all the same he slept while i stood close to him ever so long slept while iif i loved anybody as these gentlemen pretend they love us should i sleep while the being i adored was close to me you are too hard upon him the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak why miss we do read of eutychus how he snoozed off setting under paul himselfup in a windyand down atumbled but parson says it wasnt that he didnt love religion or why should paul make it his business to bring him to life again stead of letting un lie for a warning to the sleepyheaded ones twas a wearied body not a heart cold to god says our parson now nurse i take you at your word if eutychus had been eutycha and in love with st paul eutycha would never have gone to sleep though st paul preached all day and all night and if dorcas had preached instead of st paul and eutychus been in love with her he would never have gone to sleep and you know it at this homethrust mrs wilson was staggered but the next moment her sense of discomfiture gave way to a broad expression of triumph at her nurslings wit eh miss lucy cried she showing a broadside of great white teeth in a rustic chuckle but yeve got a tongue in your head yeve sewed up my stocking and tisnt many of them can do that lucy followed up her advantage and nurse even when he was wide awake and stood by the cart no inward sentiment warned him of my presence a sure sign he did not love me though i have never experienced love i have read of it and know all about it justice des femmes well miss lucy have it your own way after all if he loves you he will find you out of course he would and you will see he will do nothing of the kind then i wish i knew where he was i would pull him in at my door by the scruf of the neck and then i should jump out at the window come try on your new cap nurse that i have made for you and let us talk about anything you like except gentlemen gentlemen are a sore subject with me gentlemen have been my ruin la miss lucy i assure you they have why have they not set my uncles heart against me and my aunts and robbed me of the affection i once had for both i believe gentlemen to be the pests of society and oh the delight of being here in this calm retreat where love dwells and no gentleman can find me ah ah oh what is that for a heavy blow descended on the door that is jennys knock said mrs wilson dryly come in jenny the servant thus invited burst the door open as savagely as she had struck it and announced with a knowing grin a gentlemanfor miss fountain chapter xxvii david and eve sat together at their little breakfast and pressed each other to eat but neither could eat davids night excursion had filled eve with new misgivings it was the act of a madman and we know the fears that beset her on that head and their ground he had come home shivering and she had forced him to keep his bed all that day he was not well now and bodily weakness added to his other afflictions bore his spirit down though nothing could cow it when are you to sail inquired eve sicklike in three days cargo wont be on board before a coasting vessel a man can do his duty in a coaster as well as a merchantman or a frigate but he sighed would to god you had never seen her dont blame herblame me i had good advice from my little sister but i was willful never mind eve i neednt to blush for loving her she is worthy of it all well think so david if you can and eve thoroughly depressed relapsed into silence the postmans rap was heard and soon after a long inclosure was placed in eves hand poor little eve did not receive many letters and sad as she was she opened this with some interest but how shall i paint its effect she kept uttering shrieks of joy one after another at each sentence and when she had shrieked with joy many times she ran with the large paper round to david you are captain of the rajah ah the new ship ah eleven hundred tons oh david oh my heart oh oh oh and the poor little thing clasped her arms round her brothers neck and kissed him again and again and cried and sobbed for joy all men and most women go through life without once knowing what it is to cry for joy and it is a comfort to think that eves pure and deep affection brought her such a moment as this in return for much trouble and sorrow david stouthearted as he was was shaken as the sea and the wind had never yet shaken him he turned red and white alternately and trembled captain of the rajah it is too goodit is too good i have done nothing for it and he was incredulous eve was devouring the inclosure it is her doing she cried it is all her doing whose who do you think i am in the air i am in heaven bless heroh god bless her for this never speak against coldblooded folk before me they have twice the principle of us hot ones i always said so she is a good creature she is a true friend and you accused her of ingratitude that i never did you didrajahhe he ohand i defended her here take and read that is that a commission or not now you be quiet and let us see what she says no i cant i cannot keep the tears out of my eyes do take and read it david im blind david took the letter kissed it and read it out to eve and she kept crowing and shedding tears all the time dear miss doddi admire too much your true affection for your brother to be indifferent to your good opinion think of me as leniently as you can perhaps it gives me as much pleasure to be able to forward you the inclosed as the receipt of it i hope may give you it would i think be more wise and certainly more generous not to let mr dodd think he owes in any degree to me that which if the world were just would surely have been his long ago only some few months hence when it can do him no harm i could wish him not to think his friend lucy was ungrateful or even cold in his service who saved her life and once honored her with so warm an esteem but all this i confide to your discretion and your justice dear miss dodd those who give pain to others do not escape it themselves nor is it just they should my insensibility to the merit of persons of the other sex has provoked my relatives they have punished me for declining mr dodds inferiors with a bitterness mr dodd with far more cause never showed me so you see at each turn i am reminded of his superiority the result is i am separated from my friends and am living all alone with my dear old nurse at her farmhouse since then i am unhappy and you are generous you will i think forgive me all the pain i have caused you and will let me in bidding you adieu subscribe myself yours affectionately lucy fountain it is the letter of a sweet girl david with a noble heart and she has taken a noble revenge of me for what i said to her the other day and made her cry like a little brute as i am why how glum you look eve said david do you think i will accept this from her without herself of course you will dont be too greedy david leave the girl in peace she has shown you what she will do and what she wont one such friend as this is worth a hundred lovers give me her dear little note while eve was persuing it david went out but soon returned with his best coat on and his hat in his hand eve asked in some surprise where he was going in such a hurry to her well david now i come to read her letter quietly it is a womans letter all over you may read it which way you like what need had she to tell me she has just refused offers and then she tells me she is all alone that sounds like a hint the company of a friend might he agreeable brush your coat first at any rate theres something white on it it is a paper it is pinned on come here why what is this it is written on adieu and eve opened her eyes and mouth as well she asked him when he wore the coat last the day before yesterday were you in company of any girls not i but this is written by a girl and it is pinned on by a girl see how it is quilted in thats proof positive oh oh oh look here look at these two adieusthe one in the letter and this they are the sameprecisely the same what in heavens name is the meaning of this were you in her company that night no will you swear that no i cant swear it because i was asleep a part of the time but waking in her company i was not it is her writing and she pinned it on you how can that be eve i dont know i am sure she did though look at this adieu and that youll never get it out of my head but what one hand wrote them both you are so green a girl would come behind you and pin it on you and you never feel her while saying these words eve slyly repinned it on him without his feeling or knowing anything about it david was impatient to be gone but she held him a minute to advise him tell her she must and shall dont take a denial if you are cowardly she will be bold but if you are bold and resolute she will knuckle down mind that and dont go about it with such a face as that as long as my arm if she says no you have got the ship to comfort you oh i am so happy no eve said david if she wont give me herself ill never take her ship id die a foretopman sooner and with these parting words he renewed all his sisters anxiety she sat down sorrowfully and the horrible idea gained on her that there was mania in davids love for lucy chapter xxviii david had one advantage over others that were now hunting lucy mrs wilson had unwittingly given him pretty plain directions how to find her farmhouse and as eve in the exercise of her discretion or indiscretion had shown david lucys letter he had only to ride to harrowden and inquire but on the other hand his competitors were a few miles nearer the game and had a days start david got a horse and galloped to harrowden fed him at the inn and asked where mrs wilsons farm was the waiter a female did not know but would inquire meantime david asked for two sheets of paper and wrote a few lines on each then folded them both in those days envelopes were not but did not seal them mrs wilsons farm turned out to be only two miles from harrowden and the road easy to find he was soon there gave his horse to one of the farmboys and went into the kitchen and asked if miss fountain lived there this question threw him into the hands of jenny who invited him to follow her and unlike your powdered and noiseless lackey pounded the door with her fist kicked it open with her foot and announced him with that thunderbolt of language which fell so inopportunely on lucys selfcongratulations the look mrs wilson cast on lucy was droll enough but when davids square shoulders and handsome face filled up the doorway a second look followed that spoke folios lucy rose and with heightened color but admirable selfpossession welcomed david like a valued friend mrs wilsons greeting was broad and hearty and very soon after she had made him sit down she bounced up crying you will stay dinner now you be come and i must see as they dont starve you so saying out she went but looking back at the door was transfixed by an arrow of reproach from her nurslings eye lucys reception of david kind as it was was not encouraging to one coming on davids errand for there was the wrong shade of amity in it in times past it would have cooled david with misgivings but now he did not give himself time to be discouraged he came to make a last desperate effort and he made it at once miss lucy i have got the rajah thanks to you thanks to me mr dodd thanks to your own high character and merit no miss lucy you know better and i know better and there is your own sweet handwriting to prove it miss dodd has showed you my letter how could she help it what a pity how injudicious the truth is like the light why keep it out yes what i have worked for and battled the weather so many years and been sober and prudent and a hard student at every idle hourthat has come to me in one moment from your dear hand it is a shame bless you miss lucy cried david not noting the remark lucy blushed and the water stood in her eyes she murmured softly you should not say miss lucy it is not customary you should say lucy or miss fountain this apropos remark by way of a female diversion then let me say lucy today for perhaps i shall never say that or anything that is sweet to say again lucy you know what i came for oh yes to receive my congratulations more than that a great dealto ask you to go halves in the rajah lucys eyebrows demanded an explanation she is worth two thousand a year to her commander and that is too much for a bachelor lucy colored and smiled why it is only just enough for bachelors to live upon it is too much for me alone under the circumstances said david gravely and there was a little silence lucy i love you with you the rajah would be a godsend she will help me keep you in the company you have been used to and were made to brighten and adorn but without you i cannot take her from your hand and to speak plain i wont oh mr dodd no lucy before i knew you to command a ship was the height of my ambitionher quarterdeck my heaven on earth and this is a clipper i own it i saw her in the docks but you have taught me to look higher share my ship and my heart with me and certainly the ship will be my child and all the dearer to me that she came to us from her i love but dont say to me me you shant have you are not good enough for that but there is a ship for you in my place i wouldnt accept a star out of the firmament on those terms how unreasonable on the contrary you should say i am doubly fortunate i escape a foolish weak companion for life and i have a beautiful ship but friendship such as mine for you was never appreciated i do you injustice you only talk like that to tease me and make me unhappy oh lucy lucy did you ever know me there now forgive me and own you are not in earnest this will show you said david sadly and he took out two letters from his bosom here are two letters to the secretary in one i accept the ship with thanks and offer to superintend her when her rigging is being set up and in this one i decline her altogether with my humble and sincere thanks oh yes you are very humble sir said lucy nowdear friendlisten to reason you have others excuse my interrupting you but it is a rule with me never to reason about right and wrong i notice that whoever does that ends by choosing wrong i dont go to my head to find out my duty i go to my heart and what little manhood there is in me all cries out against me compounding with the woman i love and taking a ship instead of her how unkind you are it is not as if i was under no obligations to you is not my life worth a ship an angel like me i cant see it so it was a greater pleasure to me to save your life as you call it than it could be to you i cant let that into the account a woman is a woman but a man is a man and i will be under no obligation to you but one what arrogance dont you be angry ill love you and bless you all the same but i am a man and a man ill die whether i die captain of a ship or of a foretop poor eve see how power tries people and brings out their true character since you commanded the rajah you are all changed you used to be submissive now you must have your own way entirely you will fling my poor ship in my face unless i give youbut this is really using forceyes mr dodd this is using force somebody has told you that my sex yield when downright compulsion is used it is true and the more ungenerous to apply it and she melted into a few placid tears david did not know this sign of yielding in a woman and he groaned at the sight and hung his head advise me what i had better do to this singular proposal david listening to the ill advice of the fiend generosity groaned out why should you be tormented and made cry why indeed nothing can change me i advise you to cut it short oh do you very well why did you say poor eve ah poor thing she cried for joy when she read your letter but when i go back she will cry for grief and his voice faltered i will cut this short mr dodd give me that paper which the wicked one where you refuse my rajah david hesitated you are no gentleman sir if you refuse a lady give it me this instant cried lucy so haughtily and imperiously that david did not know her and gave her the letter with a halfcowed air she took it and with both her supple white hands tore it with insulting precision exactly in half there sir and there sir exactly in four and there in eight with malicious exactness and there and though it seemed impossible to effect another separation yet the taper fingers and a resolute will reduced it to tiny bits she then made a gesture to throw them in the fire but thought better of it and held them david looked on almost amused at this zealous demolition of a thing he could so easily replace he said part sadly part doggedly part apologetically i can write another but you will not oh mr dodd dont you see he looked up at her eagerly to his surprise her haughty eagle look had gone and she seemed a pitying goddess all tenderness and benignity only her mantling burning cheek showed her to be woman she faltered in answer to his wild eager look was i ever so rude before what right have i to tear your letter unless i the characteristic full stop and above all the heaving bosom the melting eye and the red cheek were enough even for poor simple david heaven seemed to open on him his burning kisses fell on the sweet hands that had torn his deathwarrant no resistance she blushed higher but smiled his powerful arm curled round her she looked a little scared but not much he kissed her sweet cheek the blush spread to her very forehead at that but no resistance as the winged and rapid bird if her feathers be but touched with a speck of birdlime loses all power of flight so it seemed as if that one kiss the first a stranger had ever pressed on lucys virgin cheek paralyzed her eellike and evasive powers under it her whole supple frame seemed to yield as david drew her closer and closer to him till she hid her forehead and wet eyelashes on his shoulder and murmured how could i let you be unhappy neither spoke for a while each felt the others heart beat and david drank that ecstasy of silent delirious bliss which comes to great hearts once in a life had he not earned it chapter xxix by some mighty instinct mrs wilson knew when to come in she came to the door just one minute after lucy had capitulated and turning the handle but without opening the door bawled some fresh directions to jenny this was to enable lucy to smooth her ruffled feathers if necessary and look agnes but lucys actual contact with that honest heart seemed to have made a change in her instead of doing agnes she confronted after a fashion of her own the situation she had so long evaded oh nurse she cried and wreathed her arms round her dont cry my lamb i can guess cry oh no i would not pay him so poor a compliment it was to say dear nurse you must love mr dodd as well as me now the dame received this indirect intelligence with hearty delight that wont cost me much trouble said she he is the one id have picked out of all england for my nursling when a young man is kind to an old woman it is a good sign but la his face is enough for me who ever saw guile in such a face as that arent ye hungry by this time dinner will be ready in about a minute nurse can i speak to you a word yes sure it was to inquire whether she would invite miss dodd she loves her brother very dearly and it is cruel to separate them mr dodd will be nearly always here now will he not you may take your davy of that in a very few minutes a note was written and mrs wilsons eldest son a handsome young farmer started in the covered cart with his mothers orders to bring the young lady willynilly the holy allies both openly scouted kenealys advice and both slyly stepped down into the town and acted on it mr fountain then returned to font abbey their two advertisements appeared side by side and exasperated them after dinner mrs wilson sent lucy and david out to take a walk at the gate they met with a little interruption a carriage drove up the coachman touched his hat and mrs bazalgette put her head out of the window i came to take you back love david quaked thank you aunt but it is not worth while now ah said mrs bazalgette casting a venomous look on david i am too late am i poor girl lucy soothed her aunt with the information that she was much happier now than she had been for a long time past for this was a fencingmatch may i have a word in private with my niece inquired mrs bazalgette bitterly of david why not said david stoutly but his heart turned sick as he retired lucy saw the look of anxiety lucy said mrs bazalgette you left me because you are averse to matrimony and i urged you to it of course with those sentiments you have no idea of marrying that man there i dont suspect you of such hypocrisy and therefore i say come home with me and you shall marry nobody your inclination shall be free as air aunt said lucy demurely why didnt you come yesterday i always said those who love me best would find me first and you let mr dodd come first i am so sorry then your pretended aversion to marriage was all hypocrisy was it lucy informed her that marriage was a contract and the contracting parties two and no morethe bride and bridegroom and that to sign a contract without reading it is silly and meaning not to keep it is wicked so said she i read the contract over in the prayerbook this morning for fear of accidents my reader may perhaps be amused at this admission but mrs bazalgette was disgusted and inquired what stuff is the girl talking now it is called common sense well i find the contract is one i can carry out with mr dodd and with nobody else i can love him a little can honor him a great deal and obey him entirely i begin now there he is and if you feel you cannot show him the courtesy of making him one in our conversation permit me to retire and relieve his solitude mighty fine and if you dont instantly leave him and come home you shall never enter my house again unless sickness or trouble should visit your house and then you will send for me and i shall come mrs bazalgette to the coachmanhome lucy made her a polite obeisance to keep up appearances before the servants and the farmpeople who were gaping she whose breeding was inferior flounced into a corner without returning it the carriage drove off david inquired with great anxiety whether something had not been said to vex her not in the least replied lucy calmly little things and little people can no longer vex me i have great duties to think of and a great heart to share them with me let us walk toward harrowden we may perhaps meet a friend sure enough just on this side harrowden they met the covered cart and eve in it radiant with unexpected delight the engaged onesfor such they had become in those two milesmounted the cart and the two men sat in front and eve and lucy intertwined at the back and opened their hearts to each other eve and you have taken the paper off again lucy what paper it was no longer applicable chapter xxx i have already noticed that lucy after capitulation laid down her arms gracefully and sensibly when she was asked to name a very early day for the wedding she opposed no childish delay to davids happiness for the rajah was to sail in six weeks and separate them so the license was got and the weddingday came and all lucys previous study of the contract did not prevent her from being deeply affected by the solemn words that joined her to david in holy matrimony she bore up though stoutly for her sense of propriety and courtesy forbade her to cloud a festivity but when the postchaise came to convey bride and bridegroom on their little tour and she had to leave mrs wilson and eve for a whole week the tears would not be denied and to show how perilous a road matrimony is these two risked a misunderstanding on their weddingday thus lucy all alone in the postchaise with david dissolveda perfect niobegushing at short intervals sometimes a faint explanation gurgled out with the tears poor eve her dear little face was working so not to cry oh oh i should not have minded so much if she had cried right out then again it was poor mrs wilson i was only a week with her for all her love i have made a cats ppaw of heroh then again uncle bazalgette has never noticed us he thinks me a hhypocrite but quite as often they flowed without any accompanying reason now if david had been a poetaster he would have said why these tears she has got me am i not more than an equivalent to these puny considerations and all this salt water would have burned into his vanity like liquid caustic if he had been a poet he would have said alas i make her unhappy whom i hoped to make happy and with this he would have been sad and so prolonged her sadness and perhaps ended by sulking but david had two good thingsa kind heart and a skin not too thin and such are the men that make women happy in spite of their weak nerves and craven spirits he gave her time soothed her kindly but did not check her weakness dead short at last my lady chesterfield said to him penitently this is a poor compliment to you mr dodd and then niobized again partly i believe with regret that she was behaving so discourteously it is very natural said david kindly but we shall soon see them all again you know presently she looked in his radiant face with wet eyes but a halfsmile you amaze me you dont seem the least terrified at what we have done not a bit cried david like a cheerful horn i have been in worse peril than this and so have you our troubles are all over i see nothing but happiness ahead he then drew a sunny picture of their future life to all which she listened demurely and in short he treated her little feminine distress as the summer sun treats a mist that tries to vie with it he soon dried her up and when they reached their journeys end she was as bright as himself chapter xxxi they had been married a week a slight change but quite distinct to an observer of her sex bloomed in lucys face and manner a new beauty was in her facethe blossom of wifehood her eyes though not less modest were less timid than before and now they often met davids full and seemed to sip affection at them when he came near her her lovely frame showed itself conscious of his approach his queen though he did not know it was his vassal they sat at table at a little inn twenty miles from harrowden for they were on their return to mrs wilson lucy went to the window while david settled the bill at the window it is probable she had her own thoughts for she glided up behind david and fanning his hair with her cool honeyed breath she said in the tone of a humble inquirer seeking historical or antiquarian information i want to ask you a question david are you happy too david answered promptly but inarticulately so his reply is lost to posterity conjecture alone survives one disappointment awaited lucy at mrs wilsons there were several letters for both david and her but none from mr bazalgette she knew by that she had lost his respect she could not blame him for she saw how like disingenuousness and hypocrisy her conduct must look to him i must trust to time and opportunity she said with a sigh she proposed to david to read all her letters and she would read all his he thought this a droll idea but nothing that identified him with his royal vassal came amiss the first letter of lucys that david opened was from mr talboys dear madami have heard of your marriage with mr dodd and desire to offer both you and him my cordial congratulations i feel under considerable obligation to mr dodd and should my house ever have a mistress i hope she will be able to tempt you both to renew our acquaintance under my roof and so give me once more that opportunity i have too little improved of showing you both the sincere respect and gratitude with which i am your very faithful servant reginald talboys lucy was delighted with this note who says it was nothing to have been born a gentleman the second letter was from reginald no and if i only give the reader a fragment of it i still expect his gratitude all one as if i had disinterred a fragment of orpheus or tiresias dear lucy it is very ungust of you to go and mary other peeple wen you promised me but it is mr dod so i dont so much mind i like mr dod he is a duc and they all say i am too litle and jane says sailors always end by been drouned so it is only put off but you reely must keep your promise to me wen i am biger and mr dod is drouned my ginny pigs here a white hand drew the pleasing composition out of davids hand and dropped it on the floor two piteous tearful eyes were bent on him and a white arm went tenderly round his neck to save him from the threatened fate at this sight eve pounced on the horrid scroll and hurled it with general acclamation into the flames thus that sweet infant revenged himself and like sampson hit hardest of all at partingin tears and flame vanished from written fiction and i conclude went back to gavarni there was a letter from mr fountainall fire and fury she was never to write or speak to him any more he was now looking out for a youth of good family to adopt and to make a fontaine of by act of parliament etc etc a fusillade of written thunderbolts there was another from mrs bazalgette written with creamof tartar and oilof vitriol she forgave her niece and wished her every happiness it was possible for a young person to enjoy who had deceived her relations and married beneath her she felt pity rather than anger and there was no reason why mr and mrs dodd should not visit her house as far as she was concerned but mr bazalgette was a man of very stern rectitude and as she could not make sure that he would treat them with common courtesy after what had passed she thought a temporary separation might be the better course for all parties i may as well take this opportunity of saying that these two egotists carried out the promise of their respective letters mr fountain blustered for a year or two and then showed manifest signs of relenting mrs bazalgette kept cool and wrote in oils twice a year to mrs dodd et gardait tout doucement une haine irreconciliable lucy had to answer these letters in signing one of them she took a look at her new signature and smiled what a dear quaint little name mine is said she lucy dodd and she kissed the signature a month after marriage the dodds took a house in london and eve came up to them david was nearly all day superintending the ship but spent the whole evening with his wife at home zeal always produces irritation the servant that is anxious for his employers interest is sure to get into a passion or two with the deadness indifference and heartless injustice of the genuine hireling so david was often irritated and worried and in hot water while superintending the rajah but the moment he saw his own door away he threw it all and came into the house like a jocund sunbeam nothing wins a woman more than this provided she is already inclined in the mans favor as the hour that brought david approached lucys spirits and eves used both to rise by anticipation and that anticipation his hearty genial temper never disappointed one day lucy came to david for information david there is a singular change in me it is since we came to london i used to be a placid girl now i am a fidget i dont see it love no how should you dear it always goes away when you come now listen when five oclock comes near i turn hot and restless and can hardly keep from the window and if you are five minutes after your time i really cannot keep from the window and my nerves se crispent and i cannot sit still it is very foolish what does it mean can you tell me of course i can i am just the same when people are unpunctual it is inexcusable and nothing is so vexing i ought to be oh david what nonsense it is not that could i ever be vexed with my david well then there is eve well ask her if you dare sir and mrs dodd was carnation four years after the above events two ladies were gossiping st lady what i like about mrs dodd is that she is so truthful d lady oh is she st lady yes she is indeed certainly she is not a woman that blurts out unpleasant things without any necessity she is kind and considerate in word and deed but she is always true she has got an eye that meets you like a little lions eye and a tongue without guile i do love mrs dodd dearly two qui his were talking in leadenhall street st qui hi well so you are going out again d qui hi yes they have offered me a commissionership i must make another lac for the children st qui hi when do you sail d qui hi by the first good ship i should like a good ship st qui hi well then you had better go out with gentleman dodd d qui hi gentleman dodd i should prefer sailor dodd i dont want to founder off the cape st qui hi oh but this is a firstrate sailor and a firstrate fellow altogether d qui hi then why do you call him gentleman dodd st qui hi oh because he is so polite he wont stand an oath within hearing of his quarterdeck and is particularly kind and courteous to the passengers especially to the ladies his ship is always full d qui hi is it then ill go out with gentleman dodd to my male readers i see with some surprise that there still linger in the field of letters writers who think that in fiction when a personage speaks with an air of conviction the sentiments must be the authors own when two of his personages give each other the lie which represents the author both i must ask you to shun this error for instance do not go and take eve dodds opinion of my heroine or mrs bazalgettes for mine miss dodd in particular however epigrammatic she may appear is shallow her criticism peche par la base she talks too much as if young girls were in the habit of looking into their own minds like little metaphysicians and knowing all that goes on there but on the contrary this is just what women in general dont do and young women cant do no male will quite understand lucy fountain who does not take instinct and selfdeception into the account but with those two dews and your own intelligence you cannot fail to unravel her and will i hope thank me in your hearts for leaving you something to study and not clogging my sluggish narrative with a mass of comment and explanation the end
