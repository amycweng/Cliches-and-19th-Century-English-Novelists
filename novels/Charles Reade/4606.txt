it is never too late to mend by charles reade this attempt at a solid fiction is with their permission dedicated to the president fellows and demies of st mary magdalen college oxford by a grateful son of that ancient learned and most charitable house chapter i george fielding cultivated a small farm in berkshire this position is not so enviable as it was years ago the farmers of england had they been as intelligent as other traders could have purchased the english soil by means of the huge percentage it offered them but now i grieve to say a farmer must be as sharp as his neighbors or like his neighbors he will break what do i say there are soils and situations where in spite of intelligence and sobriety he is almost sure to break just as there are shops where the lively the severe the industrious the lazy are fractured alike this last fact i make mine by perambulating a certain great street every three months and observing how name succeeds to name as wave to wave readers hardened by the times will not perhaps go so far as to weep over a body of traders for being reduced to the average condition of all other traders but the individual trader who fights for existence against unfair odds is to be pitied whether his shop has plate glass or a barn door to it and he is the more to be pitied when he is sober intelligent proud sensitive and unlucky george fielding was all these who a few years ago assisted by his brother william filled the grove as nasty a little farm as any in berkshire discontented as he was the expression hereinbefore written would have seemed profane to young fielding for a farmer's farm and a sailor's ship have always something sacred in the sufferer's eyes though one sends one to jail and the other the other to jones it was four hundred acres all arable and most of it poor sour land george's father had one hundred acres grass with it but this had been separated six years ago there was not a tree nor even an old stump to show for this word grove but in the country oral tradition still flourishes there had been trees in the grove only the title had outlived the timber a few centuries on the morning of our tale george fielding might have been seen near his own homestead conversing with the honorable frank winchester this gentleman was a character that will be common some day but was nearly unique at the date of our story he had not an extraordinary intellect but he had great natural gayety and under that he had enormous good sense his good sense was really brilliant he had a sort of universal healthy mind that i can't understand how people get he was deeply in love with a lady who returned his passion but she was hopelessly out of his reach because he had not much money or expectations instead of sitting down railing or sauntering about whining what did me the honorable frank winchester he looked over england for the means of getting this money and not finding it there he surveyed the globe and selected australia where they told him a little money turns to a deal instead of dissolving in the hand like a lozenge in the mouth as it does in london so here was an earl's son in this age of commonplace events going to australia with five thousand pounds as sheep farmer and general speculator he was trying hard to persuade george fielding to accompany him as bailiff or agricultural adviser and manager he knew the young man's value but to do him justice his aim was not purely selfish he was aware that fielding had a bad bargain in the grove and the farmer had saved his life at great personal risk one day that he was seized with cramp bathing in the turbid waters of cleve millpool and he wanted to serve him in return this was not his first attempt of the kind and but for one reason perhaps he might have succeeded you know me and i know you said mr winchester to george fielding i must have somebody to put me in the way stay with me one year and after that i'll square accounts with you about that thundering millpool oh mr winchester said george hastily and blushing like fire that's an old story sir with a sweet little half cunning smile that showed he was glad it was not forgotten not quite replied the young gentleman dryly you shall have five hundred sheep and a run for them and we will both come home rich and consequently respectable it is a handsome offer sir and a kind offer and like yourself sir but transplanting one of us continued george dear me sir it's like taking up an oak tree thirty years in the ground besides besides did you ever notice my cousin susanna sir notice her why do you think i am a heathen and never go to the parish church miss merton is a lovely girl she sits in the pew by the pillar isn't she sir said george mr winchester endeavored to turn this adverse topic in his favor he made a remark that produced no effect at the time he said people don't go to australia to die they go to australia to make money and come home and marry and it is what you must do this grove is a millstone round your neck will you have a cigar farmer george consented premising however that hitherto he had never got beyond a yard of clay and after drawing a puff or two he took the cigar from his mouth and looking at it said i say sir seems to me the fire is uncommon near the chimbly mr winchester laughed he then asked george to show him the blacksmith shop i must learn how to shoe a horse said the honorable frank well i never thought george the first nob in the country going to shoe a horse but with his rustic delicacy he said nothing and led mr winchester to the blacksmith's shop while this young gentleman is hammering nails into a horse's hoof and australia into an english farmer's mind we must introduce other personages susanna merton was beautiful and good george fielding and she were acknowledged lovers but marriage was not spoken of as a near event and latterly old merton had seemed cool whenever his daughter mentioned the young man's name susanna appeared to like george though not so warmly as he loved her but at all events she accepted no other proffers of love for all that she had besides a host of admirers other lovers besides george and what is a great deal more singular for a woman's eye is quick as lightning in finding out who loves her there was more than one of whose passion she was not conscious william fielding george's brother was in love with his brother's sweetheart but though he trembled with pleasure when she was near him he never looked at her except by stealth he knew he had no business to love her on the morning of our tale susan's father old merton had walked over from his farm to the grove and was inspecting a field behind george's house when he was accosted by his friend mr meadows who had seen him and giving his horse to a boy to hold had crossed the stubbles to speak to him mr meadows was not a common man and merits some preliminary notice he was what is called in the country a lucky man everything he had done in life had prospered the neighbors admired respected and some of them even hated this respectable man who had been a carter in the midst of them and now at forty years of age was a rich corn factor and land surveyor all this money cannot have been honestly got said the envious ones among themselves yet they could not put their finger on any dishonest action he had done to the more candid the known qualities of the man accounted for his life of success this john meadows had a cool head an iron will a body and mind alike indefatigable and an eye never diverted from the great objects of sober industrious men wealth and respectability he had also the soul of business method at one hour he was sure to be at church at another at market in his office at a third and at home when respectable men should be at home by this means mr meadows was always to be found by any man who wanted to do business and when you had found him you found a man superficially coy perhaps but at bottom always ready to do business and equally sure to get the sunny side of it and give you the windy meadows was generally respected by none more than by old merton and during the last few months the intimacy of these two men had ripened into friendship the corn factor often hooked his bridle to the old farmer's gate and took a particular interest in all his affairs such was john meadows in person he was a tall stout man with iron gray hair a healthy weather colored complexion and a massive brow that spoke to the depth and force of the man's character what taking a look at the farm mr merton it wants some of your grass put to it doesn't it i never thought much of the farm was the reply it lies cold the sixty acre field is well enough but the land on the hill is as poor as death now this idea which merton gave out as his had dropped into him from meadows three weeks before farmer said meadows in an undertone they are thrashing out new wheat for the rent you don't say so why i didn't hear the flail going they have just knocked off for dinner you need not say i told you but will fielding was at the bank this morning trying to get money on their bill and the bank said no they had my good word too the people of the bank sent over to me they had his good word but not his good tone he had said well their father was a safe man but the accent with which he eulogized the parent had somehow locked the bank cash box to the children i never liked it especially of late mused merton but you see the young folk being cousins that is it cousins put in meadows it is not as if she loved him with all her heart and soul she is an obedient daughter isn't she never gainsaid me in her life she has a high spirit but never with me my word is law you see she is a very religious girl is susan well then a word from you would save her but there all that is your affair not mine added he of course it is was the reply you are a true friend i'll step round to the barn and see what is doing and away went susan's father uneasy in his mind meadows went to the black horse the village public house to see what farmers wanted to borrow a little money under the rose and would pawn their wheat ricks and pay twenty per cent for that overrated merchandise at the door of the public house he was met by the village constable and a stranger of gentlemanly address and clerical appearance the constable wore a mysterious look and invited meadows into the parlor of the public house i have news for you sir said he leastways i think so your pocket was picked last martinmas fair of three farnborough bank notes with your name on the back it was is this one of them said the man producing a note meadows examined it with interest compared the number with a memorandum in his pocketbook and pronounced that it was who passed it inquired he a chap that has got the rest a stranger robinson that lodges at the grove with george fielding that is if his name is robinson but we think he is a londoner come down to take an airing you understand sir meadows' eyes flashed actual fire for so rich a man he seemed wonderfully excited by this circumstance to an inquiry who was his companion the constable answered sotto voce gentleman from bow street come to see if he knows him the constable went on to inform meadows that robinson was out fishing somewhere otherwise they would already have taken him but we will hang about the farm and take him when he comes home you had better be at hand sir to identify the notes said the gentleman from bow street whose appearance was clerical meadows had important business five miles off he postponed it he wrote a line in pencil put a boy upon his black mare and hurried him off to the rendezvous while he stayed and entered with strange alacrity into this affair stay cried he if he is an old hand he will twig the officer oh i'm dark sir was the answer he won't know me till i put the darbies on him the two men then strolled as far as the village stocks keeping an eye ever on the farm house thus a network of adverse events was closing round george fielding this day he was all unconscious of them he was in good spirits robinson had showed him how to relieve the temporary embarrassment that had lately depressed him draw a bill on your brother said robinson and let him accept it the farnborough bank will give you notes for it these country banks like any paper better than their own i dare say they are right george had done this and expected william every minute with this and other moneys and then susanna merton was to dine at the grove to day and this though not uncommon was always a great event with poor george dilly would not come to be killed just when he was wanted in other words robinson who had no idea how he was keeping people waiting fished tranquilly till near dinner time neither taking nor being taken this detained meadows in the neighborhood of the farm and was the cause of his rencontre with a very singular personage whose visit he knew at sight must be to him as he hovered about among george fielding's ricks the figure of an old man slightly bowed but full of vigor stood before him he had a long gray beard with a slight division in the center hair abundant but almost white and a dark swarthy complexion that did not belong to england his thick eyebrows also were darker than his hair and under them was an eye like a royal jewel his voice had the oriental richness and modulation this old man was isaac levi an oriental jew who had passed half his life under the sun's eye and now though the town of farnborough had long been too accustomed to him to wonder at him he dazzled any thoughtful stranger so exotic and apart was he so romantic a grain in a heap of vulgarity he was as though a striped jasper had crept in among the paving stones of their marketplace or a cactus grandiflora shone among the nettles of a berkshire meadow isaac levi unlike most jews was familiar with the hebrew tongue and this and the eastern habits of his youth colored his language and his thoughts especially in his moments of emotion and above all when he forgot the money lender for a moment and felt and thought as one of a great nation depressed but waiting for a great deliverance he was a man of authority and learning in his tribe at sight of isaac levi meadows' brow towered and he called out rather rudely without allowing the old gentleman to speak if you are come to talk to me about that house you are in you may keep your breath to cool your porridge meadows had bought the house isaac rented and had instantly given him warning to leave isaac who had become strangely attached to the only place in which he had ever lived many years had not doubted for a moment that meadows merely meant to raise the rent to its full value so he had come to treat with his new landlord mr meadows said he persuasively i have lived there twenty years i pay a fair rent but if you think any one would give you more you shall lose nothing by me i will pay a little more and you know your rent is secure i do was the answer thank you sir well then well then next lady day you turn out bag and baggage nay sir said isaac levi hear me for you are younger than i mr meadows when this hair was brown i traveled in the east i sojourned in madras and benares in bagdad ispahan mecca and bassora and found no rest when my hair began to turn gray i traded in petersburg and rome and paris vienna and lisbon and other western cities and found no rest i came to this little town where least of all i thought to pitch my tent for life but here the god of my fathers gave me my wife and here he took her to himself again what the deuce is all this to me man much sir if you are what men say for men speak well of you be patient and hear me two children were born to me and died from me in the house you have bought and there my leah died also and there at times in the silent hours i seem to hear their voices and their feet in another house i shall never hear them i shall be quite alone have pity on me sir an aged and a lonely man tear me not from the shadows of my dead let me prevail with you no was the stern answer no cried levi a sudden light darting into his eye then you must be an enemy of isaac levi yes was the grim reply to this rapid inference aha cried the old jew with a sudden defiance which he instantly suppressed and what have i done to gain your enmity sir said he in a tone crushed by main force into mere regret you lend money a little sir now and then a very little that is to say when the security is bad you have no money in hand but when the security is good nobody has ever found the bottom of isaac levi's purse our people said isaac apologetically can trust one another they are not like yours we are brothers and that is why money is always forthcoming when the deposit is sound well said meadows what you are i am what i do on the sly you do on the sly old thirty per cent the world is wide enough for us both good sir it is was the prompt reply and it lies before you isaac go where you like for the little town of farnborough is not wide enough for me and any man that works my business for his own pocket but this is not enmity sir meadows gave a coarsish laugh you are hard to please cried he i think you will find it is enmity nay sir this is but matter of profit and loss well let me stay and i promise you shall gain and not lose our people are industrious and skillful in all bargains but we keep faith and covenant so be it let us be friends i covenant with you and i swear by the tables of the law you shall not lose one shilling per annum by me i'll trust you as far as i can fling a bull by the tail you gave me your history take mine i have always put my foot on whatever man or thing has stood in my way i was poor i am rich and that is my policy it is frail policy said isaac firmly some man will be sure to put his foot on you soon or late what do you threaten me roared meadows no sir said isaac gently but steadily i but tell you what these old eyes have seen in every nation and read in books that never lie goliath defied armies yet he fell like a pigeon by a shepherd boy's sling samson tore a lion in pieces with his hands but a woman laid him low no man can defy us all sir the strong man is sure to find one as strong and more skillful the cunning man one as adroit and stronger than himself be advised then do not trample upon one of my people nations and men that oppress us do not thrive let me have to bless you an old man's blessing is gold see these gray hairs my sorrows have been as many as they his share of the curse that is upon his tribe has fallen upon isaac levi then stretching out his hands with a slight but touching gesture he said i have been driven to and fro like a leaf these many years and now i long for rest let me rest in my little tent till i rest forever oh let me die where those i loved have died and there let me be buried age sorrow and eloquence pleaded in vain for they were wasted on the rocks of rocks a strong will and a vulgar soul but indeed the whole thing was like epic poetry wrestling with the limerick chronicle or tuam gazette i am almost ashamed to give the respectable western brute's answer what you quote scripture eh i thought you did not believe in that hear t'other side abraham and lot couldn't live in the same place because they both kept sheep and we can't because we fleece 'em so abraham gave lot warning as i give it you and as for dying on my premises if you like to hang yourself before next lady day i give you leave but after lady day no more jewish dogs shall die in my house nor be buried for manure in my garden black lightning poured from the old jew's eyes and his pent up wrath burst out like lava from an angry mountain irreverent cur do you rail on the afflicted of heaven the founder of your creed would abhor you for he they say was pitiful i spit upon ye and i curse ye be accursed and flinging up his hands like st paul at lystra he rose to double his height and towered at his insulter with a sudden eastern fury that for a moment shook even the iron meadows be accursed he yelled again whatever is the secret wish of your black heart heaven look on my gray hairs that you have insulted and wither that wish ah ah he screamed you wince all men have secret wishes heaven fight against yours may all the good luck you have be wormwood for want of that that that that may you be near it close to it upon it pant for it and lose it may it sport and smile and laugh and play with you till gehenna burns your soul upon earth the old man's fiery forked tongue darted so keen and true to some sore in his adversary's heart that he in turn lost his habitual self command white and black with passion he wheeled round on isaac with a fierce snarl and lifting his stick discharged a furious blow at his head fortunately for isaac wood encountered leather instead of gray hairs attracted by the raised voices and unseen in their frenzy by either of these antagonists young george fielding had drawn near them he had luckily a stout pig whip in his hand and by an adroit turn of his muscular wrist he parried a blow that would have stopped the old jew's eloquence perhaps forever as it was the corn factor's stick cut like a razor through the air and made a most musical whirr within a foot of the jew's ear the basilisk look of venom and vengeance he instantly shot back amounted to a stab not if i know it said george and he stood cool and erect with a calm manly air of defiance between the two belligerents while the stick and the whip still remained in contact meadows glared at isaac's champion with surprise and wrath and a sort of half fear half wonder that this of all men in the world should be the one to cross weapons with and thwart him you are joking master meadows said george coolly why the man is twice your age and nothing in his hand but his fist who are ye old man and what d'ye want it's you for cursing anyway he insults me cried meadows because i won't have him for a tenant against my will who is he a villainous old jew yes young man said the other sadly i am isaac levi a jew and what is your religion he turned upon meadows it never came out of judea in any name or shape d'ye call yourself a heathen ye lie ye cur the heathen were not without starlight from heaven they respected sorrow and gray hairs you shall smart for this i'll show you what my religion is said meadows inadvertent with passion and the corn factor's fingers grasped his stick convulsively don't you be so aggravating old man said the good natured george and you mr meadows should know how to make light of an old man's tongue why it's like a woman's it's all he has got to hit with leastways you mustn't lift hand to him on my premises or you will have to settle with me first and i don't think that would suit your book or any man's for a mile or two round about farnborough said george with his little berkshire drawl he shrieked isaac he dare not see see and he pointed nearly into the man's eye he doesn't look you in the face any soul that has read men from east to west can see lion in your eye young man and cowardly wolf in his lady day lady day snorted meadows who was now shaking with suppressed rage ah cried isaac and he turned white and quivered in his turn lady day said george uneasily confound lady day and every day of the sort there don't you be so spiteful old man why if he isn't all of a tremble poor old man he went to his own door and called sarah a stout servant girl answered the summons take the old man in and give him whatever is going and his mug and pipe then he whispered her and don't go lumping the chine down under his nose now i thank you young man faltered isaac i must not eat with you but i will go in and rest my limbs which fail me and compose myself for passion is unseemly at my years arrived at the door he suddenly paused and looking upward said peace be under this roof and comfort and love follow me into this dwelling thank ye kindly said young fielding a little surprised and touched by this how old are you daddy if you please added he respectfully my son i am threescore years and ten a man of years and grief grief for myself grief still more for my nation and city men that are men pity us men that are dogs have insulted us in all ages well said the good natured young man soothingly don't you vex yourself any more about it now you go in and forget all your trouble awhile please god by my fireside my poor old man isaac turned the water came to his eyes at this after being insulted so a little struggle took place in him but nature conquered prejudice and certain rubbish he called religion he held out his hand like the king of all asia george grasped it like an englishman isaac levi is your friend and the expression of the man's whole face and body showed these words carried with them a meaning unknown in good society he entered the house and young fielding stood watching him with a natural curiosity now isaac levi knew nothing about the corn factor's plans when at one and the same moment he grasped george's hand and darted a long lingering glance of demoniacal hatred on meadows he coupled two sentiments by pure chance and meadows knew this but still it struck meadows as singular and ominous when with the best of motives one is on a wolf's errand it is not nice to hear a hyena say to the shepherd's dog i am your friend and see him contemptuously shoot the eye of a rattlesnake at one's self the misgiving however was but momentary meadows respected his own motives and felt his own power an old jew's wild fury could not shake his confidence he muttered one more down to your account george fielding and left the young man watching isaac's retreating form george who didn't know he was gone said old man's words seem to knock against my bosom mr meadows gone eh that man thought george fielding has everybody's good word parson's and all who'd think he'd lift his hand leastways his stick it was and that's worse against a man of three score and upward ugh thought george fielding yeoman of the midland counties and unaffected wonder mingled with his disgust his reverie was broken by william fielding just ridden in from farnborough better late than never said the elder brother impatiently couldn't get away sooner george here's the money for the sheep pounds s no offer for the cow jem is driving her home well but the money the pounds will william looked sulkily down i haven't got it george there's your draft again the bank wouldn't take it a keen pang shot across george's face as much for the affront as the disappointment they wouldn't take it gasped he ay will our credit is down the whole town knows our rent is overdue i suppose you know money must be got some way any way is better than threshing out new wheat at such a price said william sullenly ask a loan of a neighbor oh will appealed george to ask a loan of a neighbor and be denied it is bitterer than death you can do it i am i master here retorted the younger the farm is not farmed my way nor ever was no give me the plow handle and i'll cut the furrow george no doubt no doubt said the other very sharply you'd like to draw the land dry with potato crops and have fourscore hogs snoring in the farmyard that's your idea of a farm oh i know you want to be elder brother well i tell'ee what do you kill me first bill fielding and then you will be elder brother and not afore here was a pretty little burst of temper we have all our sore part so be it george replied william you got us into the mud elder brother you get us out of the mire george subdued his tone directly who shall i ask said he as one addressing a bosom counselor uncle merton or or mr meadows the corn factor he lends money at times to friends it would not be much to either of them show my empty pockets to susanna's father oh will how can you be so cruel meadows then no use for me i've just offended him a hit beside he's a man that never knew trouble or ill luck in his life they are like flints all that sort well look here i'm pretty well with meadows i'll ask him if you will try uncle the first that meets his man to begin that sounds fair said george but i can't well yes said he suddenly changing his mind i agree said he with simple cunning and lowered his eyes but suddenly raising them he said cheerfully why you're in luck bill here's your man and he shot like an arrow into his own kitchen confound it said the other fairly caught meadows it is to be observed was wandering about the premises until such time as robinson should return and while the brothers were arguing he had been in the barn and finding old merton there had worked still higher that prudent man's determination to break off matters between his daughter and the farmer of the grove after the usual salutations william fielding sore against the grain began i did not know you were here sir i want to speak to you i am at your service mr willum well sir george and i are a little short just at present it is only for a time and george says he should take it very kind if you would lend us a hundred pound just to help us over the stile why mr willum replied meadows i should be delighted and if you had only asked me yesterday i could have done it as easy as stand here but my business drinks a deal of money mr willum and i laid out all my loose cash yesterday but of course it is of no consequence another time good morning mr willum away sauntered meadows leaving william planted there as the french say george ran out of the kitchen well he says he has got no money loose he is a liar he paid pounds into the bank yesterday and you knew it didn't you tell him so no what use a man that lies to avoid lending won't be driven to lend you don't play fair retorted george you could have got it from meadows if you had a mind but you want to drive your poor brother against his sweetheart's father you are false my lad you are the only man that ever said so and you durstn't say it if you weren't my brother if it wasn't for that i'd say a deal more well show your high stomach to uncle merton for there he is hy uncle cried william to merton who turned instantly and came toward them george wants to speak to you said william and shot like a cross bow bolt behind the house that is lucky said merton for i want to speak to you who would have thought of his being about muttered george while george was calling up his courage and wits to open his subject mr merton who had no such difficulties was beforehand with him you are threshing out new wheat said merton gravely yes answered george looking down that is a bad lookout a farmer has no business to go to his barn door for his rent where is he to go then to the church door and ask for a miracle no to his ship fold to be sure ay you can you have got grass and water and everything to hand and so must you young man or you'll never be a farmer now george i must speak to you seriously george winced you are a fine lad and i like you very well but i love my own daughter better so do i said george simply and i must look out for her resumed merton i have seen a pretty while how things are going here and if she marries you she will have to keep you instead of you her heaven forbid matters are not so bad as that uncle you are too much of a man i hope continued merton to eat a woman's bread and if you are not i am man enough to keep the girl from it these are hard words to bear gasped george so near my own house old man well plain speaking is best when the mind is made up was the reply is this from susanna as well as you said george with a trembling lip and scarce able to utter the words susan is an obedient daughter what i say she'll stand to and i hope you know better than to tempt her to disobey me you wouldn't succeed enough said answered george very sternly enough said old man i've no need to tempt any girl good morning george and away stumped merton good morning uncle ungrateful old thief william cried he to his brother who came the next minute to hear the news our mother took him out of the dirt i have heard her say as much or he'd not have a ship fold to brag of oh my heart oh will well will he lend the money i never asked him you never asked him cried william bill he began upon me in a moment said george looking appealingly into his brother's face he sees we are going down hill and he as good as bade me think no more of susan well said the other harshly it was your business to own the truth and ask him help us over the stile he's our own blood you want to let me down lower than i would let that carlo dog of yours you're no brother of mine retorted george fiercely and bitterly a bargain is a bargain replied the other sullenly i asked meadows and he said no you fell talking with uncle about susan and never put the question to him at all who is the false one eh if you call me false i'll knock your ugly head off sulky bill you're false and a fool into the bargain bragging george what you will have it then if you can give it me well if it is to be said george i'll give you something to put you on your mettle the best man shall farm 'the grove' and the other shall be a servant on it or go elsewhere for i am sick of this and so am i cried william hastily and have been any time this two years they tucked up their sleeves a little shook hands and then retired each one step and began to fight and how came these two honest men to forget that the blood they proposed to shed was thicker than water was it the farm money agricultural dissension temper they would have told you it was and perhaps thought it was it was susanna merton the secret subtle influence of jealousy had long been fermenting and now it exploded in this way and under this disguise ah william fielding and all of you beware of jealousy cursed jealousy it is the sultan of all the passions and the tartar chief of all the crimes other passions affect the character this changes and if good always reverses it mind that reverses it turns honest men to snakes and doves to vultures horrible unnatural mixture of love with hate you poison the whole mental constitution you bandage the judgment you crush the sense of right and wrong you steel the bowels of compassion you madden the brain you corrupt the heart you damn the soul the fieldings then shook hands mechanically and receding each a step began to spar each of these farmers fancied himself slightly the best man but they both knew they had an antagonist with whom it would not do to make the least mistake they therefore sparred and feinted with wary eye before they ventured to close george however the more impetuous was preparing to come to closer quarters when all of a sudden to the other's surprise he dropped his hands by his sides and turned the other way with a face anything but warlike fear being now the prominent expression william followed the direction of his eye and then william partook his brother's uneasiness however he put his hands in his pockets and began to saunter about in a circumference of three yards and to get up a would be careless whistle while george's hands became dreadfully in his way so he washed them in the air while they were employed in this peaceful pantomime a beautiful young woman glided rapidly between the brothers her first words renewed their uneasiness what is this cried she haughtily and she looked from one to the other like a queen rebuking her subjects george looked at william william had nothing ready so george said with some hesitation but in a mellifluous voice william was showing me a trick he learned at the fair that is all susan that is a falsehood george replied the lady the first you ever told me george colored you were fighting you two boys i saw your eyes flash the rueful wink exchanged by the combatants at this stroke of sagacity was truly delicious oh fie oh fie brothers by one mother fighting in a christian land within a stone's throw of a church where brotherly love is preached as a debt we owe to strangers let alone our own blood yes it is a sin susan said william his conscience suddenly illuminated so i ask your pardon susanna oh it wasn't your fault i'll be bound was the gracious reply what a ruffian you must be george to shed your brother's blood la susan said george with a doleful whine i wasn't going to shed the beggar's blood i was only going to give him a hiding for his impudence or take one for your own replied william coolly that is more likely said susan george take william's hand take it this instant i say cried she with an air imperative and impatient well why not don't you go in a passion susan about nothing said george coaxingly they took hands she made them hold one another by the hand which they did with both their heads hanging down while i speak a word to you two said susan merton you ought both to go on your knees and thank providence that sent me here to prevent so great a crime and as for you your character must change greatly george fielding before i trust myself to live in a house of yours is all the blame to fall on my head said george letting go william's hand with no great apparent reluctance of course it is william is a quiet lad that quarrels with nobody you are always quarreling you thrashed our carter last candlemas he spoke saucy words about you susan smiling inwardly made her face as repulsive outside as lay in her power i don't believe it said susan your time was come round to fight and be a ruffian and so it was to day no doubt ah said george sorrowfully it is always poor george that does all the wrong oh replied the lady an arch smile playing for a moment about her lips i could scold william too if you think i am as much interested in his conduct and behavior as in yours no no cried george brightening up don't think to scold anybody but me susan and william said he suddenly and frankly i ask your pardon no more about it george if you please answered william in his dogged way susan said george you don't know all i have to bear my heart is sore susan dear uncle twitted me not an hour ago with my ill luck and almost bade me to speak to you no more leastways as my sweetheart and that was why when william came at me on the top of such a blow it was more than i could bear and susan susan uncle said you would stand to whatever he said george said susan gently i am very sorry my father was so unkind thank ye kindly susan that is the first drop of dew that has fallen on me to day but obedience to parents continued susan interrogating as it were her conscience is a great duty i hope i shall never disobey my father faltered she oh answered the goose george hastily i don't want any girl to be kind to me that does not love me i am so unlucky it would not be worth her while you know at this susan answered still more sharply no i don't think it would be worth any woman's while till your character and temper undergo a change george never answered a word but went and leaned his head upon the side of a cart that stood half in and half out of a shed close by at this juncture a gay personage joined the party he had a ball waistcoat as alarming tie a shooting jacket wet muddy trousers and shoes and an empty basket on his back he joined our group just as george was saying to himself very sadly i am in everybody's way here and he attacked him directly everybody is in this country the reader is to understand that this robinson was last from california and california had made such an impression upon him that he turned the conversation that way oftener than a well regulated understanding recurs to any one topic except perhaps religion he was always pestering george to go to california with him and it must be owned that on this one occasion george had given him a fair handle come out of it continued robinson and make your fortune you did not make yours there said susan sharply i beg your pardon miss i made it or how could i have spent it no doubt said william what comes by the wind goes by the water alluding to the dust inquired the cockney gold dust especially retorted susan merton robinson laughed the ladies are sharp even in berkshire said he mr robinson then proceeded to disabuse their minds about the facility of gold a crop of gold said he does not come by the wind any more than a crop of corn it comes by harder digging than your potatoes ever saw and harder work than you ever did oxen and horses perspire for you fielding no did you ever see a horse or an ox mow an acre of grass or barley retorted william dryly don't brag replied the other they'll eat all you can mow and never say a word about it this repartee was so suited to their rustic idea of wit that robinson's antagonists laughed heartily except george what is the matter with him said robinson sotto voce indicating george oh he is cross never mind him replied susan ostentatiously loud george winced but never spoke back to her robinson then proceeded to disabuse the rural mind of the notion that gold is to be got without hard toil even in california he told them how the miners' shirts were wet through and through in the struggle for gold he told them how the little boys demanded a dollar apiece for washing these same garments and how the miners to escape this extortion sent their linen to china in ships on monday morning and china sent them back on saturday only it was saturday six weeks next mr robinson proceeded to draw a parallel between england and various nations on the other side of the atlantic not at all complimentary to his island home above all he was eloquent on the superior dignity of labor in new countries i heard one of your clodhoppers say the other day 'the squire is a good gentleman he often gives me a day's work' now i should think it was the clodhopper gave the gentleman the day's work and the gentleman gave him a shilling for it and made five by it william fielding scratched his head this was a new view of things to him but there seemed to be something in it ay rake that into your upper soil cried our republican orator then collecting into one his scattered items of argument he invited his friend george to take his muscle pluck wind backbone and self out of this miserable country and come where the best man has a chance to win come george he cried england is the spot if you happen to be married to a duke's daughter and got fifty thousand a year and three houses and a coach and a brougham and a curricle and ten brace of pointers and a telescope so big the stars must move to it instead of it to the stars and no end of pretty housemaids and a butler with a poultice round his neck and whiskers like a mop head and a silver tub full of rose water to sit in and read the morning post and a green house full of peaches and green peas all the year round and a pew in the church warmed with biling eau de cologne and a carpet a foot thick and a piano forte in every blessed room in the house but this island is the dead sea to a poor man he then diverging from the rhetorical to the metropolitan style proposed to his friend to open one eye that will show you this hole you are in is all poor hungry arable ground you know you can't work it to a profit george winced no steal borrow or beg pounds carry out a cargo of pea jackets and fourpenny bits to swap for gold dust a few tools a stout heart and a light pair of 'oh no we never mention them their name is never heard' and we'll soon fill both pockets with the shiney in california all this mr robinson delivered with a volubility to which berkshire had hitherto been a stranger a crust of bread in england before buffalo beef in california was george's reply but it was not given in that assured tone with which he would have laughed at robinson's eloquence a week ago i could not live with all those thieves and ruffians that are settled down there like crows on a dead horse but i thank you kindly my lad all the same said the tender hearted young man strange thought he that so many should sing me the same tune and he fell back into his reverie here they were all summoned to dinner with a dash of asperity by sarah the stout farm servant susan lingered an instant to speak to george she chose an unfortunate topic she warned him once more against mr robinson my father says that he has no business nor trade and he is not a gentleman in spite of his red and green cravat so he must be a rogue of some sort shall i tell you his greatest fault was the bitter reply he is my friend he is the only creature that has spoken kind words to me to day oh i saw how cross you looked at him susan's eyes flashed and the color rose in her cheek and the water in her eyes you are a fool george said she you don't know how to read a woman nor her looks nor her words either and susan was very angry and disdainful and did not speak to george all dinner time as for poor george he followed her into the house with a heart both sick and heavy this berkshire farmer had a proud and sensitive nature under a homely crust old merton's words had been iron passing through his soul and besides he felt as if everything was turning cold and slippery and gliding from his hand he shivered with vague fears and wished the sun would set at one o'clock and the sorrowful day come to an end chapter ii the meal passed almost in silence robinson was too hungry to say a word and a weight hung upon george and susan as they were about to rise william observed two men in the farmyard who were strangers to him the men seemed to be inspecting the hogs it struck him as rather cool but apparently the pig is an animal which to be prized needs but to be known for all connoisseurs of him are also enthusiastic amateurs when i say the pig i mean the four legged one william fielding partly from curiosity to hear these strangers' remarks partly hoping to find customers in them strolled into the farmyard before his companions rose from the table the others looking carelessly out of the window saw william join the two men and enter into conversation with them but their attention was almost immediately diverted from that group by the entrance of meadows he came in radiant his face was a remarkable contrast to the rest of the party susan could not help noticing it why mr meadows cried she you look as bright as a may morning it is quite refreshing to see you we are all rather down here this morning meadows said nothing and did not seem at his ease under this remark george rose from the table so did susan robinson merely pushed back his chair and gave a comfortable little sigh but the next moment he cried hallo they looked up and there was william's face close against the window william's face was remarkably pale and first he tried to attract george's attention without speaking but finding himself observed by the whole party he spoke out george will you speak a word said he george rose and went out but susan's curiosity was wakened and she followed him accompanied by meadows none but you george said william with a voice half stern half quivering george looked at his brother out with it cried he it is some deadly ill luck i have felt it coming all day but out with it what can't i bear after the words i have borne this morning william hung his head george there is a distress upon the farm for the rent george did not speak at first he literally staggered under these words his proud spirit writhed in his countenance and with a groan he turned his back abruptly upon them all and hid his face against the corner of his own house the cold hard bricks meadows by strong self command contrived not to move a muscle of his face up to this day and hour susan merton had always seemed cool compared with her lover she used to treat him a little de haut en bas but when she saw his shame and despair she was much distressed george george she cried don't do so can nothing be done where is my father they told me he was here he is rich he shall help you she darted from them in search of merton ere she could turn the angle of the house he met her you had better go home my girl said he gravely oh no no i have been too unkind to george already and she turned toward him like a pitying angel with hands extended as if they would bring balm to a hurt soul meadows left chuckling and was red and white by turns merton was one of those friends one may make sure of finding in adversity there cried he george i told you how it would end george wheeled round on him like lightning what do you come here to insult over me i must be a long way lower than i am before i shall be as low as you were when my mother took you up and made a man of you george george cried susan in dismay stop for pity's sake before you say words that will separate us forever father cried the peace making angel how can you push poor george so hard and him in trouble and we have all been too unkind to him to day ere either could answer there was happily another interruption a smart servant in livery walked up to them with a letter with the instinctive feeling of class they all endeavored to conceal their agitation from the gentleman's servant he handed george the note and saying i was to wait for an answer farmer fielding sauntered toward the farm stables from mr winchester said george after a long and careful inspection of the outside in the country it is a point of honor to find out the writer of a letter by the direction not the signature the honorable francis winchester what does he write to you cried merton in a tone of great surprise this too was not lost on george human nature is human nature he was not sorry to be able to read a gentleman's letter in the face of one who had bitterly reproached him and of others who had seen him mortified and struck down seems so said george dryly and with a glance of defiance and he read out the letter george fielding my fine fellow think of it again i have two berths in the ship that sails from southampton to morrow you will have every comfort on the voyage a great point i will do what i said for you he promised me five hundred sheep and a run i must have an honest man and where can i find as honest a man as george fielding thank you mr winchester george fielding thanks you sir and there was something noble and simple in the way the young farmer drew himself up and looked fearlessly in all his companions' eyes you saved my life i can do nothing for you here and you are doing no good at 'the grove' everybody says so everybody says so and george fielding winced at the words and it really pains me my brave fellow to go without you where i know i could put you on the way of fortune my heart is pretty stout but home is home and be assured that i wait with some anxiety to know whether my eyes are to look on nothing but water for the next four months or are to be cheered by the sight of something from home the face of a thoroughbred english yeoman and a friend and and poor george could read no more the kind words coming after his affronts and troubles brought his heart to his mouth susan took the letter from him and read out and an upright downright honest man and so you are george cried she warmly drawing to george's side and darting glances of defiance vaguely around then she continued to read if the answer is favorable a word is enough meet me at 'the crown' in newborough to night and we will go up to town by the mail train the answer is yes said george to the servant who was at some distance susan bending over the letter heard but could not realize the word but the servant now came nearer george said to him tell your master yes yes george cried susan what do you mean by yes it is about going to australia the answer is yes said george the servant went away with the answer the others remained motionless this nobleman's son respects me if worse folk don't but it is not the great bloodhounds and greyhounds that bark at misfortune's heels it is only the village curs when all is done this is my path i'll pack up my things and go and he did not look at susan or any of them but went into the house like a man walking in his sleep there was a stupefied pause then susan gave a cry like a wounded deer father what have you done merton himself had been staggered but he replied stoutly no more than my duty girl and i hope you will do no less than yours at this moment robinson threw up the window and jumped out into the yard meadows under stronger interests had forgotten robinson but now at sight of him he looked round and catching the eye of a man who was peering over the farmyard wall made him a signal what is the matter cried robinson george is going to australia replied merton coldly australia roared robinson australia he's mad who ever goes there unless they are forced he shan't go there i wouldn't go there if my passage was paid and a new suit of clothes given me and the governor's gig to take me ashore to a mansion provided for my reception fires lighted beds aired and pipes laid across upon the table as robinson concluded this tirade the policeman and constable who had crept round the angle of the farm house came one on each side put each a hand on one of his elbows and took him he looked first down at their hands in turn then up at their faces in turn and when he saw the metropolitan's face a look of simple disgust diffused itself over his whole countenance ugh interjected robinson ay replied the policeman while putting handcuffs on him to australia you'll go for all that tom lyon alias scott alias robinson and you'll have a new suit of clothes mostly one color and voyage paid and a large house ashore waiting for you and the governor's gig will come alongside for you provided they can't find the convicts' barge and the official was pleased with himself and his wit and allowed it to appear but by this time robinson was on his balance again gentlemen answered he with cold dignity what am i to understand by this violence from persons to whom i am an utter stranger and he might have set for the picture of injured innocence i am not acquainted with you sir added he and by the titles you give me it seems you are not acquainted with me the police laughed and took out of this injured man's pocket the stolen notes which meadows instantly identified then mr robinson started off into another key equally artistical in its way miss merton snuffled he appearances are against me but mark my words my innocence will emerge all the brighter for this temporary cloud susan merton ran indoors saying oh i must tell george she was not sorry of an excuse to be by george's side and remind him by her presence that if home had its thorns it had its rose tree too news soon spreads rustic heads were seen peeping over the wall to see the finale of the fine gentleman from lunnun meantime the constable went to put his horse in a four wheeled chaise destined to convey robinson to the county jail if the rural population expected to see this worthy discomposed by so sudden a change of fortune they were soon undeceived well jacobs said he with sudden familiarity you seem uncommon pleased and i am content i would rather have gone to california but any place is better than england laugh those who win i shall breathe a delicious climate you will make yourself as happy as a prince that is to say miserable upon fifteen shillings and two colds a week my sobriety and industry will realize a fortune under a smiling sun let chaps that never saw the world and the beautiful countries there are in it snivel at leaving this island of fogs and rocks and taxes and nobs the rich man's paradise the poor man's i never swear it's vulgar while he was crushing his captors with his eloquence george and susan came together from the house george's face betrayed wonder and something akin to horror a thief cried he have i taken the hand of a thief it is a business like any other said robinson deprecatingly if you have no shame i have i long to be gone now george whined the culprit who strange to say had become attached to the honest young farmer did ever i take tithe of you you have got a silver candle cup a heavenly old coffee pot no end of spoons double the weight those rogues the silversmiths make them now they are in a box under your bed in your room added he looking down count them they are all right and miss merton your bracelet the gold one with the cameo i could have had it a hundred times miss merton ask him to shake hands with me at parting i am so fond of him and perhaps i shall never see him again shake hands with you answered george sternly if your hands were loose i doubt i should ram my fist down your throat but there you are not worth a thought at such a time and you are a man in trouble and i am another i forgive you and i pray heaven i may never see your face again and honesty turned his back in theft's face robinson bit his lip and said nothing but his eyes glistened just then a little boy and girl who had been peering about mighty curious took courage and approached hand in hand the girl was the speaker as a matter of course farmer fielding said she curtsying a mode of reverence which was instantly copied by the boy we are come to see the thief they say you have caught one oh dear and her bright little countenance was overcast i couldn't have told it from a man we don't know all that is in the hearts of the wicked robinson was observed to change color at these silly words mr jacobs said he addressing the policeman have you authority to put me in the pillory before trial he said this coldly and sternly and then added perhaps you are aware that i am a man and i might say a brother for you were a thief you know then changing his tone entirely i say jacobs said he with cheerful briskness do you remember cracking the silversmith's shop in lambeth along with jem salisbury and black george and there the gig is ready cried mr jacobs you come along and the ex thief pushed the thief hastily off the premises and drove him away with speed george fielding gave a bitter sigh this was a fresh mortification he had for the last two months been defending robinson against the surmises of the village villages are always concluding there is something wrong about people what does he do inquired our village where does he get his blue coat with brass buttons his tartan waistcoat and green satin tie with red ends we admit all this looks like a gentleman but yet somehow a gentleman is a horse of another color than this robinson george had sometimes laughed at all this sometimes been very angry and always stood up stoutly for his friend and lodger and now the fools were right and he was wrong his friend and protege was handcuffed before his eyes and carried off to the county jail amid the grins and stares of a score of gaping rustics who would make a fine story of it this evening in both public houses and a hundred voices would echo some such conversational tristich as this st rustic i tawld un as much dinn't i now jarge d rustic that ye did richard for i heerd ee st rustic but la bless ye he don't vally advice he don't george fielding groaned out i'm ready to go now i'm quite ready to go i am leaving a nest of insults and he darted into the house as much to escape the people's eyes as to finish his slight preparations for so great a journey two men were left alone sulky william and respectable meadows both these men's eyes followed george into the house and each had a strong emotion they were bent on concealing and did conceal from each other but was it concealed from all the world the farm house had two rooms looking upon the spot where most of our tale has passed the smaller one of these was a little state parlor seldom used by the family here on a table was a grand old folio bible the names births and deaths of a century of fieldings appeared in rusty ink and various handwritings upon its fly leaf framed on the walls were the first savage attempts of woman at worsted work in these islands there were two moral commonplaces and there was the forbidden fruit tree whose branches diverged at set distances like the radii of a circle from its stem a perpendicular line exactly at the end of each branch hung one forbidden fruit pre raphaelite worsted work there were also two prints of more modern date one agricultural one manufactural no was a great show of farming implements at doncaster no showed how one day in the history of man and of mutton a sheep was sheared her wool washed teased carded etc and the cloth 'd and 'd and 'd and 'd and a coat shaped and sewed and buttoned upon a goose whose preparations for inebriating the performers and spectators of his feat appeared in a prominent part of the picture the window of this sunny little room was open and on the sill was a row of flower pots from which a sweet fresh smell crept with the passing air into the chamber behind these flower pots for two hours past had crouched all eye and ear and mind a keen old man to isaac levi age had brought vast experience and had not yet dimmed any one of his senses more than forty five years ago he had been brought to see that men seldom act or speak so as to influence the fortunes of others without some motive of their own and that these motives are seldom the motives they advance and that their real motives are not always known to themselves and yet can nearly always be read and weighed by an intelligent bystander so for near half a century isaac levi had read that marvelous page of nature written on black white and red parchments and called man one result of his perusal was this that the heads of human tribes differ far more than their hearts the passions and the heart he had found intelligible and much the same from indus to the pole the people of our tale were like men walking together in a coppice they had but glimpses of each others' minds but to isaac behind his flower pots they were a little human chart spread out flat before him and not a region in it he had not traveled and surveyed before to day what to others passed for accident to him was design he penetrated more than one disguise of manner and above all his intelligence bored like a center bit into the deep heart of his enemy meadows and at each turn of the center bit his eye flashed his ear lived and he crouched patient as a cat keen as a lynx he was forgotten but not by all meadows a cautious man was the one to ask himself where is that old heathen and what is he doing to satisfy himself meadows had come smoothly to the door of the little apartment and burst suddenly into it there he found the reverend israelite extended on a little couch a bandana handkerchief thrown over his face calmly reposing meadows paused eyed him keenly listened to his gentle but audible equable breathing relieved his mind by shaking his fist at him and went out thirty seconds later isaac awoke spat in the direction of meadows and crouched again behind the innocent flowers patient as a cat keen as a lynx so then when george was gone in william fielding and mr meadows both felt a sudden need of being alone each longed to indulge some feeling he did not care the other should see so they both turned their faces away from each other and strolled apart isaac levi caught both faces off their guard and read the men as by a lightning flash to the bottom line of their hearts for two hours he had followed the text word by word deed by deed letter by letter and now a comment on that text was written in these faces that comment said that william was rejoiced at george's departure and ashamed of himself for the feeling that meadows rejoiced still more and was ashamed anybody should know he had the feeling isaac withdrew from his lair his task was done those men both love that woman and this meadows loves her with all his soul and she aha and triumph flashed from under his dark brows but at his age calm is the natural state of the mind and spirits he composed himself for the present and awaited an opportunity to strike his enemy with effect the aged man had read mr meadows aright under that modulated exterior raged as deep a passion as ever shook a strong nature for some time he had fought against it she is another man's sweetheart he had said to himself no good will come of courting her but by degrees the flax bonds of prudence snapped one by one as the flame every now and then darted at them meadows began to reason the matter coolly they can never marry those two i wish they would marry or break off to put me out of this torture but they can't marry and my sweet susan is wasting her prime for nothing for a dream besides it is not as if she loved him the way i love her she is like many a young maid the first comer gets her promise before she knows her value they walk together get spoken of she settles down into a groove and so goes on whether her heart is in it or not it is habit more than anything then he watched the pair and observed that susan's manner to george was cool and off hand and that she did not seem to seek opportunities of being alone with him having got so far he now felt it his duty to think of her interest he could not but feel that he was a great match for any farmer's daughter whereas poor young fielding said he compassionately is more likely to break as a bachelor than to support a wife and children upon 'the grove' he next allowed his mind to dwell with some bitterness upon the poor destiny that stood between him and the woman he loved george fielding a dull dog that could be just as happy with any other girl as with my angel an oaf so little alive to his prize that he doesn't even see he has rivals doesn't see that his brother loves her ah but i see that though lovers' eyes are sharp doesn't see me who mean to take her from both these fieldings and what harm it isn't as if their love was like mine heaven forbid i should meddle if it was a few weeks and a few mugs of ale would wash her from what little mind either of them have but i never loved a woman before and never could look at another after her and so by degrees meadows saw that he was quite justified in his resolve to win susan merton provided it was done fairly this resolve taken all this man's words and actions began to be colored more or less by his secret wishes and it is not too much to say that this was the hand which was gently but adroitly with a touch here and a touch there pushing george fielding across the ocean you see a respectable man can do a deal of mischief more than a rogue could a shrug of the shoulders from meadows had caused the landlord to distrain a hint from meadows had caused merton to affront george about susan a tone of meadows had closed the bank cash box to the fieldings' bill of exchange and so on and now finding it almost impossible to contain his exultation for george once in australia he felt he could soon vanquish susan's faint preference the result of habit he turned off and went to meet his mare at the gate the boy had just returned with her he put his foot in the stirrup but ere he mounted it occurred to him to ask one of the farm servants whether the old jew was gone i sin him in the barn just now was the reply meadows took his foot out of the stirrup never leave an enemy behind you was one of his rules and why does the old heathen stay meadows asked himself he clinched his teeth and vowed he would not leave the village till george fielding was on his way to australia he sent his mare to the black horse and strolled up the village then he showed the boy a shilling and said you be sure and run to the public house and let me know when george fielding is going to start i should like to see the last of him this was true chapter iii and now passed over the grove the heaviest hours it had ever known hours as weary as they were bitter to george fielding the grove was nothing to him now in mind he was already separated from it his clothes were ready he had nothing more to do and he wished he could fling himself this moment into the ship and hide his head and sleep and forget his grief until he reached the land whose fat and endless pastures were to make him rich and send him home a fitter match for susan as the moment for parting drew nearer there came to him that tardy consolation which often comes to the honest man then when it can but add to his pangs of regret perhaps no man is good manly tender generous honest and unlucky quite in vain at last when such a man is leaving all who have been unjust or cold to him scales fall from their eyes a sense of his value flashes like lightning across their half empty skulls and tepid hearts they feel and express some respect and regret and make him sadder to leave them so did the neighbors of the grove to young fielding some hands gave him now their first warm pressure and one or two voices even faltered as they said god bless thee lad and now the carter's lad ran in with a message from a farmer at the top of the hill oh master george farmer dodd says if you please he couldn't think to let you walk you are to go in his gig to newbury if you'll walk up as fur as his farm he's afeared to come down our hill a says because if he did his mare 'ud kick his gig into toothpicks he says oh master george i be sorry you be going and the boy who had begun quite cheerfully ended in a whimper i thank him take my bag boy and i'll follow in half an hour sarah brought out the bag and opened it and weeping bitterly put into it a bottle with her name on a bit of paper tied round the neck to remind poor george he was not forgotten at the grove and then she gave george the key and went sadly in her apron to her eyes and now george fixed his eye on his brother william and said to him wilham will you come with me if you please ay george sure they went through the farmyard side by side neither spoke and george took a last look at the ricks and he paused and seemed minded to speak but he did not he only muttered not here then george led the way out into the paddock and so into the lane and very soon they saw the village church william wondered george did not speak they passed under the yewtree into the churchyard william's heart fluttered they found the vicar's cow browsing on the graves william took up a stone george put out his hand not to let him hurt her and george turned her gently into the lane then he stepped carefully among the graves william followed him his heart fluttering more and more with vague fears william knew now where they were going but what was george going to say to him there his heart beat faint like by and by the brothers came to this drawing of grave the grave was between the two men and silence both looked down george whispered good by mother she never thought we should be parted this way then he turned to william and opened his mouth to say something more to him doubtless that which he had come to say but apparently it was too much for him i think he feared his own resolution he gasped and with a heavy sigh led the way home william walked with him not knowing what to think or do or say at last he muttered i wouldn't go if my heart was here i shall go will replied george rather sternly as it seemed when they came back to the house they found several persons collected old fielding the young men's grandfather was there he had made them wheel him in his great chair out into the sun grandfather fielding had reached the last stage of human existence he was ninety two years of age the lines in his face were cordage his aspect was stony and impassible and he was all but impervious to passing events his thin blood had almost ceased to circulate in his extremities for every drop he had was needed to keep his old heart a beating at all instead of stopping like a clock that has run down meadows had returned to see george off and old merton was also there and he was one of those whose hearts gave them a bit of a twinge george said he i'm vexed for speaking unkind to you to day of all days in the year i didn't think we were to part so soon lad no more about it uncle faltered george what does it matter now susan merton came out of the house she had caught her father's conciliatory words she seemed composed but pale she threw her arms round her father's neck oh father said she imploringly i thought it was a dream but he is going he is really going oh don't let him go from us speak him fair father his spirit is so high susan replied the old farmer mayhap the lad thinks me his enemy but i'm not my daughter shall not marry a bankrupt farmer but you bring home a thousand pounds just one thousand pounds to show me you are not a fool and you shall have my daughter and she shall have my blessing meadows exulted your hand on that uncle cried george with ardor your hand on that before heaven and all present the old farmer gave george his hand upon it but father cried susan your words are sending him away from me susan said george sorrowfully but firmly i am to go but don't forget it is for your sake i leave you my darling susan to be a better man for your sake uncle since your last words there is no ill will but bluntly i can't speak my heart before you i'll go george i'll go shan't be said my sister's son hadn't leave to speak his mind to letbe who atool at such a time let be who it will cui libet merton turned to leave them but ere he had taken two steps a most unlooked for interruption chained him to the spot an old man with a long beard and a glittering eye was among them before they were aware of him he fixed his eye upon meadows and spoke a single word but that word fell like a sledge hammer no said isaac levi in the midst no repeated he to john meadows meadows understood perfectly what no meant a veto upon all his plans hopes and wishes young man said isaac to george you shall not wander forth from the home of your fathers these old eyes see deeper than yours and he sent an eye stab at meadows you are honest all men say so i will lend you the money for your rent and one who loves you and he gave another eye stab at meadows will bless me oh yes i bless you cried susan innocently the late exulting meadows was benumbed at this surely heaven sends you to me cried susan it is mr levi of farnborough here was a diversion meadows cursed the intruder and his own evil star that had raised him up so malignant an enemy all my web undone in a moment thought he and despair began to take possession of him susan on the other hand was all joy and hope william more or less despondent the old jew glanced from one to another read them all and enjoyed his triumph but when his eye returned to george fielding he met with something he had not reckoned upon the young man showed no joy no emotion he stood immovable like a statue of a man and when he opened his lips it was like a statue speaking with its marble mouth no susan no old man i am honest though i'm poor and proud though you have seen me put to shame near my own homestead more than once to day to borrow without a chance of paying is next door to stealing and i should never pay you my eyes are opened in spite of my heart i can't farm 'the grove' with no grass and wheat at forty shillings i've tried all i know and i can't do it will there is dying to try and he shall try and may heaven speed his plow better than it has poor george's i am not thinking of the farm now george said william i'm thinking of when we were boys and used to play marbles together upon the tombstones and he faltered a little mr levi seems you have a kindness for me show it to my brother when i'm away if you will be so good hum said isaac doubtfully i care not to see your stout young heart give way as it will ah me i can pity the wanderer from home i will speak a word with you and then i will go home he drew george aside and made him a secret communication merton called susan to him and made her promise to be prudent then he shook hands with george and went away now meadows from the direction of isaac's glance and a certain half surprised half contemptuous look that stole over george's face suspected that his enemy whose sagacity he could no longer doubt was warning george against him this made him feel very uneasy where he was and this respectable man dreaded some exposure of his secret so he said hastily i'll go along with you farmer and in a moment was by merton's side as that worthy stopped to open the gate that led out of george's premises his feelings were anything but pleasant when george called to him no sir stop you are as good a witness as i could choose of what i have to say step this way if you please sir meadows returned clinched his teeth and prepared for the worst but inwardly he cursed his uneasy folly in staying here instead of riding home the moment george had said yes to australia george now looked upon the ground a moment and there was something in his manner that arrested the attention of all meadows turned hot and cold i am going to speak to my brother mr meadows said he syllable by syllable to meadows in a way brimful of meaning to me george said william a little uneasy to you fall back a bit some rustics were encroaching upon the circle fall back if you please this is a family matter isaac levi instead of going quite away seated himself on a bench outside the palings it was now william's turn to flutter he said however to himself it is about the farm it must be about the farm george resumed i've often had it on my mind to speak to you but i was ashamed now that's the truth but now i am going away from her i must speak out and i will william yes george you've taken a fancy to my susan william at these words which though they had cost him so much to say george spoke gravely and calmly like common words william gave one startled look all round then buried his face directly in his hands in a paroxysm of shame susan who was looking at george remonstrated loudly how can you be so silly george i am sure that is the last idea poor william george drew her attention to william by a wave of the hand she held her tongue in a moment and turned very red and lowered her eyes to the ground it was a very painful situation to none more than to meadows who was waiting his turn george continued oh it is not to reproach you my poor lad who could be near her and not warm to her but she is my lass will and no other man's it is three years since she said the word and though it was my hard luck there should be some coolness between us this bitter day she will think of me when the ocean rolls between us if no villain undermines me villain george groaned william that is a word i never thought to hear from you that's why i speak in time said george i do suppose i am safe against villainy here and his eye swept lightly over both the men anyway it shan't be a mistake or a misunderstanding it shall be villainy if 'tis done speak susanna merton and speak your real mind once for all oh george cried susan fluttering with love you shall not go in doubt of me we are betrothed this three years and i never regretted my choice a single moment i never saw i never shall see the man i could bear to look on beside you my beautiful george take my ring and my promise george and she put her ring on his little finger and kissed his hand while you are true to me nothing but death shall part us twain there never was any coolness between us dear you only thought so you don't know what fools women are how they delight to tease the man they love and so torment themselves ten times more i always loved you but never as i do to day so honest so proud so unfortunate i love you i honor you i adore you oh my love my love my love she saw but george she thought but of george and how to soften his sorrow and remove his doubts if he had any and she poured out these words of love with her whole soul with blushes and tears and all the fire of a chaste and passionate woman's heart and she clung to her love and her tender bosom heaved against his and she strained him with tears and sighs to her bosom and he kissed her beautiful head and his suffering heart drew warmth from this heavenly contact the late exulting meadows turned as pale as ashes and trembled from head to foot do you hear william said george i hear george replied william in an iron whisper with his sullen head sunk upon his breast george left susan and came between her and william then susan said he rather loud here is your brother william winced william here is my life and he pointed to susan let no man rob me of it if one mother really bore us it went through william's heart like a burning arrow and this was why george had taken him to their mother's grave that flashed across him too the poor sulky fellow's head was seen to rise inch by inch till he held it as erect as a king's never he cried half shouting half weeping never s'help me god she's my sister from this hour no more no less and may the red blight fall on my arm and my heart if i or any man takes her from you any man he cried his temples flushing and his eye glittering sooner than a hundred men should take her from you while i am here i'd die at their feet a hundred times well done sullen and rugged but honest man the capital temptation of your life is wrestled with and thrown that is always to every man a close a deadly a bitter struggle and we must all wade through this deep water at one hour or another of our lives it is as surely our fate as it is one day to die it is a noble sight to see an honest man cleave his own heart in twain and fling away the baser part of it these words that burst from william's better heart knocked at his brother's you may be sure he came to william i believe you said he i trust you i thank you then he held out his hand but nature would have more than that in a moment his arm was round his brother's neck where it had not been this many a year he withdrew it as quickly half ashamed and anne fielding's two sons grasped one another's hands and holding hands turned away their heads and tried to hide their eyes they are stronger than bond deed or indenture these fleshly compacts written by moist eyes stamped by the grip of eloquent hands in those moments full of soul when men's hearts beat from their bosoms to their fingers' ends isaac levi came to the brothers and said to william yes i will now and then he went slowly and thoughtfully away to his own house and now faltered george i feel strong enough to go and i'll go he looked round at all the familiar objects he was leaving as if to bid them farewell and last while every eye watched his movements he walked slowly up to his grandfather's chair grandfather said he i am going a long journey and mayhap shall never see you again speak a word to me before i go the impassive old man took no notice so susan came to him grandfather speak to george poor george is going into a far country when she had repeated this in his ear their grandfather looked up for a moment george fetch me some snuff from where you're going a spasm crossed george's face he was not to have a word of good omen from the aged man friends said he looking appealingly to all the rest meadows included i wanted him to say god bless you but snuff is all his thought now well old man george won't forget your last word such as 'tis in a hutch near a corner of the house was william's pointer carlo carlo observing by the general movement that there was something on foot had the curiosity to come out to the end of his chain and as he stood there giving every now and then a little uncertain wag of his tail george took notice of him and came to him and patted his head good by carlo faltered george poor carlo you and i shall never go after the partridges again carlo the dog shows more understanding than the christian by carlo then he looked wistfully at william's dog but he said nothing more william watched every look of george but he said nothing at the time good by little village church where i went to church man and boy good by churchyard where my mother lies there will be no church bells susan where i am going no sunday bells to remind me of my soul and home these words which he spoke with great difficulty were hardly out of young fielding's mouth when a very painful circumstance occurred one of those things that seem the contrivance of some malignant spirit the church bells in a moment struck up their merriest peal george fielding started he turned pale and his lips trembled are they mocking me he cried do they take a thought what i am going through this moment the hard hearted no no no cried william don't think it george i know what 'tis i'll tell ye what's it well it is well george it is tom clarke and esther borgherst married to day only they couldn't have the ringers till the afternoon why will they have only kept company a year and susan and i have kept company three years and tom and esther are married to day and what are george and susan doing to day god help me oh god help me what shall i do what shall i do and the stout heart gave way and george fielding covered his face with his hands and burst out sobbing and crying susan flung her arms round his neck oh george my pride is all gone don't go don't think to go have pity on us both and don't go and she clung to him her bonnet fallen off her hair disheveled and they sobbed and wept in one another's arms meadows writhed with the jealous anguish this sad sight gave him and at that moment he could have cursed the whole creation he tried to fly but he was rooted to the spot he leaned sick as death against the palings george and susan cried together and then they wiped one another's eyes like simple country folk with one pocket handkerchief and then they kissed one another in turn and made each other's tears flow fast again and again wiped one another's eyes with one handkerchief meadows griped the palings convulsively hell was in his heart poor souls god help them said william to himself in his purified heart the silence their sorrow caused all around was suddenly invaded by a voice that seemed to come from another world it was grandfather fielding the autumn sun is not so warm as she used to be yes there was the whole map of humanity on that little spot in the county of berks the middle aged man a schemer watching the success of his able scheme and stunned and wounded by its recoil and old age callous to noble pain all alive to discomfort yet man to the last blaming any one but number one cackling against heavenly bodies accusing the sun and the kitchen fire of frigidity not his own empty veins and the two poor young things sobbing as if their hearts would break over their first great earthly sorrow george was the first to recover himself shame upon me he cried he drew susan to his bosom and pressed a long burning kiss upon her brow and now all felt the wrench was coming george with a wild half terrified look signaled william to come to him help me will you see i have no more manhood than a girl susan instinctively trembled george once more pressed his lips to her as if they would grow there william took her hand she trembled more and more take my hand take your brother's hand my poor lass said he she trembled violently and then george gave a cry that seemed to tear his heart and darted from them in a moment poor susan uttered more than one despairing scream and stretched out both her hands for george he did not see her for he dared not look back bob loose the dog muttered william hastily in a broken voice the dog was loosed and ran after george who he thought was only going for a walk susan was sinking pale and helpless upon her brother's bosom pray sister said gentle william pray sister as i must a faint shiver was all the answer her senses had almost left her when george was a little way up the hill something ran suddenly against his legs he started it was carlo he turned and lifted up his hands to heaven and william could see that george was blessing him for this carlo was more than a dog to poor george at that cruel moment soon after that george and carlo reached the crown of the hill george's figure stood alone a moment between them and the sky he was seen to take his hat off and raise his hands once more to heaven while he looked down upon all he loved and left and then he turned his sorrowful face again toward that distant land and they saw him no more chapter iv the world is full of trouble while we are young we do not see how true this ancient homely saying is that wonderful dramatic prologue the first chapter of job is but a great condensation of the sorrows that fall like hail upon many a mortal house job's black day like the day of the poetic prophets the true sacri vates of the ancient world is a type of a year a bitter human year it is terrible how quickly a human landscape all gilded meadow silver river and blue sky can cloud and darken george fielding had compared himself this very day to an oak tree even so am i rooted to my native soil his fate accepted his simile the oak of centuries yields to an impalpable antagonist whose very name stands in proverbs for weakness and insignificance this thin light trifle rendered impetuous by motion buffets the king of the forest tears his roots with fury out of the earth and lays his towering head in the dust and even so circumstances none of them singly irresistible converging to one point buffeted sore another oak pride of our fields and for aught i know of our whole island an honest english yeoman and tore him from his farm from his house hard by his mother's grave from the joy of his heart his susan and sent him who had never traveled a hundred miles in his life across a world of waters to keep sheep at the antipodes a bereaved and desolate heart went with farmer dodd in the gig to newborough sad desolate and stricken hearts remained behind when two loving hearts are torn bleeding asunder it is a shade better to be the one that is driven away into action than the bereaved twin that petrifies at home the bustle the occupation the active annoyances are some sort of bitter distraction to the unfathomable grief it is one little shade worse to lie solitary and motionless in the old scenes from which the sunlight is now fled it needed but a look at susan merton as she sat moaning and quivering from head to foot in george's kitchen to see that she was in no condition to walk back to grassmere farm to night so as she refused almost violently refused to stay at the grove william harnessed one of the farm horses to a cart and took her home round by the road it is six miles that way 'stead of three but then we shan't jolt her going that way thought william he walked by the side of the cart in silence she never spoke but once all the journey and that was about half way to complain in a sort of hopeless pitiful tone that she was cold it was a burning afternoon william took off his coat and began to tie it round her by means of the sleeves susan made a little silent peevish and not very rational resistance william tied it round her by brotherly force they reached her home when she got out of the cart her eye was fixed her cheek white she seemed like one in a dream she went into the house without speaking or looking at william william was sorry she did not speak to him however he stood disconsolately by the cart asking himself what he could do next for her and george presently he heard a slight rustle and it was susan coming back along the passage she has left something in the cart thought he and he began to look in the straw she came like one still in a dream and put her hand out to william and it appeared that was what she had come back for william took her hand and pressed it to his bosom a moment at this susan gave a hysterical sob or two and crept away again to her own room what she suffered in that room the first month after george's departure i could detail perhaps as well as any man living but i will not there is a degree of anguish one shrinks from intruding upon too familiarly in person and even on paper the microscope should spare sometimes these beatings of the bared heart it will be enough if i indicate by and by her state after time and religion and good habits had begun to struggle sometimes gaining sometimes losing against the tide of sorrow for the present let us draw gently back and leave her for she is bowed to the earth fallen on her knees her head buried in the curtains of her bed dark faint and leaden on the borders of despair a word often lightly used through ignorance heaven keep us all from a single hour here or hereafter of the thing the word stands for and heaven comfort all true and loving hearts that read me when their turn shall come to drain the bitter cup like susan merton chapter v the moment george fielding was out of sight mr meadows went to the public house flung himself on his powerful black mare and rode homeward without a word one strong passion after another swept across his troubled mind he burned with love he was sick with jealousy cold with despondency and for the first time smarted with remorse george fielding was gone gone of his own accord but like the flying parthian he had shot his keenest arrow in the moment of defeat what the better am i thus ran this man's thoughts i have opened my own eyes and susan seems farther from me than ever now my heart is like a lump of lead here i wish i had never been born so much for scheming i would have given a thousand pounds for this and now i'd give double to be as i was before i had honest hopes then now where are they how lucky it seemed all to go too ah that is it 'may all your good luck turn to wormwood' that was his word his very word and my good luck is wormwood so much for lifting a hand against gray hairs jew or gentile why did the old heathen provoke me then i'd as soon die as live this day that's right start at a handful of straw lie down in it one minute and tremble at the sight of it the next ye idiot oh susan susan why do i think of her why do i think of her she loves that man with every fiber of her body how she clung to him how she grew to him and i stood there and looked on it and did not kill them both seen it i see it now it is burned into my eyes and my heart forever i am in hell i am in hell hold up you blundering fool has the devil got into you too perdition seize him may he die and rot before the year's out ten thousand miles from home may his ship sink to the bottom of the what right have i to curse the man as well as drive him across the sea curse yourself john meadows they are true lovers and i have parted them and looked on and seen their tears heaven pity them and forgive me so he knew of his brother's love for her after all why didn't he speak to me i wonder as well as to will fielding the old jew warned him against me i'll swear why why because you are a respectable man john meadows and he thought a hint was enough to a man of character 'i do suppose i am safe from villainy here' says he that lad spared me he could have given me a red face before them all now if there are angels that float in the air and see what passes among us sinners how must john meadows have looked beside george fielding that moment this love will sink my soul i can't breathe between these hedges my temples are bursting oh you want to gallop do you gallop then and faster than you ever did since you were foaled confound ye with this he spurred his mare furiously up the bank and went crushing through the dead hedge that surmounted it he struck his hat at the same moment fiercely from his head it was fast by a black ribbon to his button hole and as they lighted by a descent of some two feet on the edge of a grass field he again drove his spurs into his great fiery mare all vein and bone black rachel snorted with amazement at the spur and with warlike delight at finding grass beneath her feet and free air whistling round her ears she gave one gigantic bound like a buck with arching back and all four legs in the air at once it would have unseated many a rider but never moved the iron meadows and with dilating nostril and ears laid back she hurled herself across country like a stone from a sling meadows' house was about four miles and a half distant as the crow flies and he went home to day as the crow flies only faster none would have known the staid respectable meadows in this figure that came flying over hedge and ditch and brook his hat dangling and leaping like mad behind him his hand now and then clutching his breast his heart tossed like a boat among the breakers his lips white his teeth clinched and his eyes blazing the mare took everything in her stride but at last they came somewhat suddenly on an enormous high stiff fence to clear it was impossible by this time man and beast were equally reckless they went straight into it and through it as a bullet goes through a pane of glass and on again over brook and fence plowed field and meadow till meadows found himself he scarce knew how at his own door his old deaf servant came out from the stable yard and gazed in astonishment at the mare whose flank panted whose tail quivered whose back looked as if she had been in the river while her belly was stained with half a dozen different kinds of soil and her rider's face streamed with blood from a dozen scratches he had never felt meadows flung himself from the saddle and ran up to his own room he dashed his face and his burning hands into water this seemed to do him a little good he came downstairs he lighted a pipe we are the children of habit he sat with his eyebrows painfully bent people called on him he fiercely refused to see them for the first time in his life he turned his back on business he sat for hours by the fireplace a fierce mental struggle wrenched him to and fro evening came still he sat collapsed by the fireplace from his window among other objects two dwellings were visible one distant four miles was a whitewashed cottage tiled instead of thatched adorned with creepers and roses and very clean but in other respects little superior to laborers' cottages the other distant six long miles was the grassmere farmhouse where the mertons lived the windows seemed burnished gold this evening in the small cottage lived a plain old woman a methodist she was meadows' mother she did not admire worldly people still less envied them he was too good a churchman and man of business to permit conventicles or psalm singing at odd hours in his house so she preferred living in her own which moreover was her own her very own the old woman never spoke of her son and checked all complaints of him and snubbed all experimental eulogies of him meadows never spoke of his mother paid her a small allowance with the regularity and affectionate grace of clock work never asked her if she didn't want any more would not have refused her if she had asked for double this evening while the sun was shining with all his evening glory on susan merton's house meadows went slowly to his window and pulled down the blind and drawing his breath hard shut the loved prospect out he then laid his hand upon the table and he said i swear by the holy bread and wine i took last month that i will not put myself in the way of this strong temptation i swear i will go no more to grassmere farm never so long as i love susan he added faintly unless they send for me and they won't do that and i won't go of my own accord i swear it i have sworn it however and i swear it again unless they send for me then he sat by the fire with his head in his hands a posture he never was seen in before next he wrote a note and sent it hastily with a horse and cart to that small whitewashed cottage old mrs meadows sat in her doorway reading a theological work called believers' buttons she took the note looked at it why this is from john i think what can he have to say to me she put on her spectacles again which she had taken off on the messenger first accosting her and deliberately opened smoothed and read the note it ran thus mother i am lonely come over and stay awhile with me if you please your dutiful son john meadows here hannah cried the old woman to a neighbor's daughter that was nearly always with her hannah a comely girl of fourteen came running in here's john wants me to go over to his house get me the pen and ink girl out of the cupboard and i'll write him a word or two any way is there anything amiss said she quickly to the man he came in with the black mare all in a lather just after dinner and he hasn't spoke to a soul since that's all i know missus i think something has put him out and he isn't soon put out you know he isn't hannah left the room after placing the paper as she was bid you will all be put out that trust to an arm of flesh all of ye master or man dick messenger said the disciple of john wesley somewhat grimly ay and be put out of the kingdom of heaven too if ye don't take heed is that the news i'm to take back to farnborough missus said messenger with quiet rustic irony no i'll write to him the old woman wrote a few lines reminding meadows that the pursuit of earthly objects could never bring any steady comfort and telling him that she should be lost in his great house that it would seem quite strange to her to go into the town after so many years' quiet but that if he was minded to come out and see her she would be glad to see him and glad of the opportunity to give him her advice if he was in a better frame for listening to it than last time she offered it to him and that was two years come martinmas then the old woman paused next she reflected and afterward dried her unfinished letter and as she began slowly to fold it up and put it in her pocket hannah cried she thoughtfully hannah appeared in the doorway i dare say you may fetch my cloak and bonnet why if the wench hasn't got them on her arm what you made up your mind that i should go then that i did replied hannah your warm shawl is in the cart mrs meadows oh you did did you young folks are apt to be sure and certain i was in two minds about it so i don't see how the child could be sure said she dividing her remark between vacancy and the person addressed a grammatical privilege of old age oh but i was sure for that matter replied hannah firmly and what made the little wench so sure i wonder said the old woman now in her black bonnet and scarlet cloak why la says hannah because it's your son ma'am and you're his mother dame meadows chapter vi john meadows had always been an active man but now he was indefatigable he was up at five every morning and seemed ubiquitous added a gray gelding to his black mare and rode them both nearly off their legs he surveyed land in half a dozen counties he speculated in grain in half a dozen markets and did business in shares his plan in dealing with this ticklish speculation was simple he listened to nothing anybody said examined the venture himself and if it had a sound basis bought when the herd was selling and sold wherever the herd was buying hence he bought cheap and sold dear he also lent money and contrived to solve the usurers' problem perfect security and huge interest he arrived at this by his own sagacity and the stupidity of mankind mankind are not wanting in intelligence but as a body they have one intellectual defect they are muddle heads now these muddle heads have agreed to say that land is in all cases five times a surer security for money lent than movables are whereas the fact is that sometimes it is and sometimes it is not owing to the above delusion the proprietor of land can always borrow money at four per cent and other proprietors are often driven to give ten twenty thirty so john meadows lent mighty little upon land but much upon oat ricks wagons advantageous leases and such things solid as land and more easily convertible into cash thus without risk he got his twenty per cent not that he appeared in these transactions he had too many good irons in the fire to let himself be called a usurer he worked this business as three thousand respectable men are working it in this nation he had a human money bag whose strings he went behind a screen and pulled the human money bag of meadows was peter crawley this peter crawley some years before our tale lay crushed beneath a barrowful of debts many of them to publicans in him others saw a cunning fool and a sot meadows an unscrupulous tool meadows wanted a tool and knew the cheapest way to get the thing was to buy it so he bought up all crawley's debts sued him got judgments out against him and raising the ax of the law over peter's head with his right hand offered him the left hand of fellowship with his left down on his knees went crawley and resigned his existence to this great man human creatures whose mission it is to do whatever a man secretly bids them are not entitled to long and interesting descriptions crawley was fifty wore a brown wig the only thing about him that did not attempt disguise and slouched in a brown coat and a shirt peppered with snuff in this life he was an infinitesimal attorney previously unless pythagoras was a goose he had been a pole cat meadows was ambidexter the two hands he gathered coin with were meadows and crawley the first his honest hard working hand the second his three fingered jack his prestidigital hand with both he now worked harder than ever he hurried from business to business could not wait to chat or drink a glass of ale after it it was all work work work money money money with john meadows and everything he touched turned to gold in his hands yet for all this burning activity the man's heart had never been so little in business his activity was the struggle of a sensible strong mind to fight against its one weakness cedit amor rebus res age tutus eris is a very wise saying and meadows by his own observation and instinct sought the best antidote for love but the latins had another true saying that nobody is wise at all hours after his day of toil and success he used to be guilty of a sad inconsistency he shut himself up at home for two hours and smoked his pipe and ran his eye over the newspaper but his mind over susan merton worse than this in his frequent rides he used to go a mile or two out of his way to pass grassmere farmhouse and however fast he rode the rest of his journey he always let his nag walk by the farmhouse and his eye brightened with hope as he approached it and his heart sank as he passed it without seeing susan he now bitterly regretted the vow he had made never to visit the mertons again unless they sent for him they have forgotten me altogether said he bitterly well the best thing i can do is to forget them now susan had forgotten him she was absorbed in her own grief but merton was laboring under a fit of rheumatism and this was the reason why meadows and he did not meet in fact farmer merton often said to his daughter john meadows has not been to see us a long while hasn't he father was susan's languid and careless reply one sunday meadows weakened by his inner struggle could not help going to grassmere church at least he would see her face he had seated himself where he could see her she took her old place by the pillar nobody was near her the light from a side window streamed full upon her she was pale and the languor of sorrow was upon every part of her face but she was lovely as ever meadows watched her and noticed that more than once without any visible reason her eyes filled with tears but she shed none he saw how hard she tried to give her whole soul to the services of the church and to the word of the preacher he saw her succeed for a few minutes at a time and then with a lover's keen eye he saw her heart fly away in a moment from prayer and praise and consolation and follow and overtake the ship that was carrying her george farther and farther away from her across the sea and then her lips quivered with earthly sorrow even as she repeated words that came from heaven and tried to bind to her heavy heart the prayers for succor in every mortal ill the promises of help in every mortal woe with which holy church and holier writ comfort her and all the pure of heart in every age then meadows who up to this moment had been pitying himself had a better thought and pitied susan he even went so far as to feel that he ought to pity george but he did not do it he could not he envied him too much but he pitied susan and he longed to say something kind and friendly to her even though there should not be a word or a look of love in it susan went out by one of the church doors meadows by another intending to meet her casually upon the road home susan saw his intention and took another path so that he could not come up with her without following her meadows turned upon his heel and went home with his heart full of bitterness she hates the sight of me was his interpretation poor susan she hated nobody she only hated to have to speak to a stranger and to listen to a stranger and in her present grief all were strangers to her except him she had lost and her father she avoided meadows not because he was meadows but because she wanted to be alone meadows rode home despondently then he fell to abusing his folly and vowed he would think of her no more the next day finding himself at six o'clock in the evening seated by the fire in a reverie he suddenly started fiercely up saddled his horse and rode into newborough and putting up his horse strolled about the streets and tried to amuse himself looking at the shops before they closed now it so happened that stopping before a bookseller's shop he saw advertised a work upon the australian colonies confound australia said meadows to himself and turned on his heel but the next moment with a sudden change of mind he returned and bought the book he did more he gave the tradesman an order for every approved work on australia that was to be had the bookseller as it happened was going up to london next day so that in the evening meadows had some dozen volumes in his house and a tolerably correct map of certain australian districts let me see said meadows what chance that chap has of making a thousand pounds out there this was no doubt the beginning of it but it did not end there the intelligent meadows had not read a hundred pages before he found out what a wonderful country this australia is how worthy a money getter's attention or any thoughtful man's it seemed as if his rival drew meadows after him wherever he went so fascinated was he with this subject and now all the evening he sucked the books like a leech men observed about this time an irritable manner in mr meadows which he had never shown before and an eternal restlessness they little divined the cause or dreamed what a vow he had made and what it cost him every day to keep it so strong was the struggle within him that there were moments when he feared he should go mad and then it was that he learned the value of his mother's presence in the house there was no explanation between them there could be no sympathy had he opened his heart to her he knew she would have denounced his love for susan merton as a damnable crime once she invited his confidence what ails you john said the old woman you had better tell me you would feel easier i'm thinking but he turned it off a little fretfully and she never returned to the charge but though there could be no direct sympathy yet there was a soothing influence in this quaint old woman's presence she moved quietly about protecting his habits not disturbing them she seemed very thoughtful too and cast many a secret glance of inquiry and interest at him when he was not looking at her this had gone on some weeks when one afternoon meadows who had been silent as death for a full half hour started from his chair and said with sudden resolution mother i must leave this part of the country for a while that is news john yes i shall go into the mining district for six months or a year perhaps well go john you want a change i think you can't do better than go i will and no later than to morrow that is sudden if i was to give myself time to think i should never go at all he went out briskly with the energy of this determination the same evening about seven o'clock as he sat reading by the fire an unexpected visitor was announced mr merton he came cordially in and scolded meadows for never having been to see him i know you are a busy man said the old farmer but you might have given us a look in coming home from market it is only a mile out of the way and you are pretty well mounted in a general way then the old man a gossip took up one of meadows' books australia ah grunted merton and dropped it like a hot potato he tried another why this is australia too why they are all australia as i am a living sinner and he looked with a rueful curiosity into meadows' face meadows colored but soon recovered his external composure i have friends there said he hastily who tell me there are capital investments in that country and they say no more than the truth do you think he will do any good out there asked the old man lowering his voice i can't say answered meadows dryly tell us something about that country john said merton and if you was to ask me to take a glass of your home brewed ale i don't think i should gainsay you the ale was sent for and over it meadows whose powers of acquisition extended to facts as well as money and who was full of this new subject poured the agricultural contents of a dozen volumes into mr merton the old farmer sat open mouthed transfixed with interest listening to his friend's clear intelligent and masterly descriptions of this wonderful land at last the clock struck nine he started up in astonishment i shall get a scolding if i stay later said he and off he went to grassmere have you nothing else to say to me asked meadows as the farmer put his foot in the stirrup not that i know of replied the other and cantered away confound him muttered meadows he comes and stops here three hours drinks my ale gets my knowledge without the trouble of digging for't and goes away and not a word from susan or even a word about her one word would have paid me for all this loss of time but no i was not to have it i will be in devonshire this time to morrow no to morrow is market day but the day after i will go i cannot live here and not see her nor speak to her 'twill drive me mad the next morning as meadows mounted his horse to ride to market a carter's boy came up to him and taking off his hat and pulling his head down by the front lock by way of salute put a note into his hand meadows took it and opened it carelessly it was a handwriting he did not know but his eye had no sooner glanced at the signature than his eyes gleamed and his whole frame trembled with emotion he could hardly hide this was the letter dear mr meadows we have not seen you here a long time and if you could take a cup of tea with us on your way home from market my father would be glad to see you if it is not troubling you too much i believe he has some calves he wishes to show you i am yours respectfully susan merton p s father has been confined by rheumatism and i have not been well this last month meadows turned away from the messenger and said quietly tell miss merton i will come if possible he then galloped off and as soon as there was no one in sight gave vent to his face and his exulting soul now he congratulated himself on his goodness in making a certain vow and his firmness in keeping it i kept out of their way and they have invited me my conscience is clear he then asked himself why susan had invited him and he could not but augur the most favorable results from this act on her part true his manner to her had never gone beyond friendship but women he argued are quick to discern their admirers under every disguise she was dull and out of spirits and wrote for him to come to her this was a great point a good beginning the sea is between her and george and i am here with time and opportunity on my side said meadows and as these thoughts coursed through his heart his gray nag spurred by an unconscious heel broke into a hand gallop and after an hour and a half hard riding they clattered into the town of newborough the habit of driving hard bargains is a good thing for teaching a man to suppress his feelings and feign indifference yet the civil nonchalance with which meadows on his return from newborough walked into the merton's parlor cost him no ordinary struggle the farmer received him cordially susan civilly and with a somewhat feeble smile the former soon engaged him in agricultural talk susan meanwhile made the tea in silence and meadows began to think she was capricious and had no sooner got what she asked for than she did not care for it after a while however she put in a word here and there but with a discouraging languor presently farmer merton brought her his tea cup to be replenished and upon this opportunity susan said a word to her father in an undertone oh ay replied the farmer very loud indeed and susan colored what was you saying to me about that country that christmas day is the hottest day in the year began mr merton meadows assented and merton proceeded to put other questions in order it appeared to draw once more from meadows the interesting information of last night meadows answered shortly and with repugnance then susan put in and is it true sir that the flowers are beautiful to the eye but have no smell and that the birds have all gay feathers but no song then susan scarcely giving him time to answer proceeded to put several questions and her manner was no longer languid but bright and animated she wound up her interrogatories with this climax and do you think sir it is a country where george will be able to do any good and will he have his health in that land so far from every one to take care of him and this doubt raised the bright eyes were dimmed with tears in a moment meadows gasped out why not why not but soon after muttering some excuse about his horse he went out with a promise to return immediately he was no sooner alone than he gave way to a burst of rage and bitterness so she only sent for me here to make me tell her about that infernal country where her george is i'll ride home this instant this very instant without bidding them good by cooler thoughts came he mused deeply a few minutes and then clinching his teeth returned slowly to the little parlor he sat down and took his line with a brisk and cheerful air you were asking me some questions about australia i can tell you all about that country for i have a relation there who writes to me and i have read all the books about it too as it happens susan brightened up meadows by a great histrionic effort brightened up too and poured out a flood of really interesting facts and anecdotes about this marvelous land then in the middle of a narrative which enchained both his hearers he suddenly looked at his watch and putting on a fictitious look of dismay and annoyance started up with many excuses and went home not however till susan had made him promise to come again next market day as he rode home in the moonlight susan's face seemed still before him the bright look of interest she had given him the grateful smiles with which she had thanked him for his narration all this had been so sweet at the moment so bitter upon the least reflection his mind was in a whirl at last he grasped at one idea and held it as with a vise i shall be always welcome to her if i can bring myself to talk about that detestable country well i will grind my tongue down to it she shall not be able to do without my chat that shall be the beginning the middle shall be different the end shall be just the opposite the sea is between him and her i am here with opportunity resolution and money i will have her the next morning his mother said to him john do you think to go to day where mother the journey you spoke of what journey among the mines not i you have changed your mind then what didn't you see i was joking no very dryly soon after this little dialogue dame meadows proposed to end her visit and return home her son yielded a cheerful assent she went gravely and quietly back to her little cottage meadows had determined to make himself necessary to susan merton he brought a woman's cunning to bear against a woman's for the artifice to which his strong will bent his supple talent is one that many women have had the tact and temporary self denial to carry out but not one man in a hundred men try to beat an absent rival by sneering at him etc by which means the asses make their absent foe present to her mind and enlist the whole woman in his defense but meadows was no ordinary man susan had given his quick intelligence a glimpse of a way to please her he looked at the end and crushed his will down to the thorny means twice a week he called on the mertons and much of his talk was australia susan was grateful to hear of the place where george would soon be was the nearest approach she could make to hearing of george as for meadows he gained a great point but he went through tortures on the way he could not hide from himself why he was so welcome and many a time as he rode home from the mertons he resolved never to return there but he took no more oaths it had cost him so much to keep the last and that befell which might have been expected after a while the pleasure of being near the woman he loved of being distinguished by her and greeted with pleasure however slight grew into a habit and a need achilles was a man of steel but he had a vulnerable part and iron natures like john meadows have often one spot in their souls where they are far tenderer than the universal dove eyed and weaker than the omnipotent he never spoke a word of love to susan he knew it would spoil all and she occupied with another's image and looking upon herself as confessedly belonging to another never suspected the deep passion that filled this man's heart but if an observer of nature had accompanied john meadows on market day he might have seen diagnostics all the morning his eye was cold and quick his mouth when silent close firm and unreadable his voice clear decided and occasionally loud but when he got to old merton's fireside he mellowed and softened like the sun toward evening there his forehead unknit itself his voice pitched in quite a different key from his key of business turned also low and gentle and soothed and secretly won the hearer by its deep rich and pleasant modulation and variety and his eye turned deeper in color and losing its keenness and restlessness dwelt calmly and pensively for minutes at a time upon some little household object close to susan seldom unless quite unobserved upon susan herself but the surrounding rustics suspected nothing so calm and deep ran meadows dear heart said susan to her father who would have thought mr meadows would come a mile out of his way twice a week to talk to me about geo about the country where my heart is and the folk say he thinks of nothing but money and won't move a step without making it the folk are envious of him girl that is all john meadows is too clever for fools and too industrious for the lazy ones he is a good friend of mine susan if i wanted to borrow a thousand pounds i have only to draw on meadows he has told me so half a dozen times we don't want his money father replied susan nor anybody's but i think a great deal of his kindness and george shall thank him when he comes home if ever he comes home to susan again these last words brought many tears with them which the old farmer pretended not to notice for he was getting tired of his daughter's tears they were always flowing now at the least word and she used to be so good humored and cheerful like poor susan she was very unhappy if any one had said to her to morrow you die she would have smiled on her own account and only sighed at the pain the news would cause poor george her george was gone her mother had been dead this two years her life which had been full of innocent pleasures was now utterly tasteless except in its hours of bitterness when sorrow overcame her like a flood she had a pretty flower garden in which she used to work when george was at home what pleasure it had been to plant them with her lover's help to watch them expand to water them in the summer evening to smell their gratitude for the artificial shower after a sultry day and then to have george in and set him admiring them with such threadbare enthusiasm simply because they were hers not in the least because they were nature's i will go back like the epic writers and sketch one of their little garden scenes one evening after watering them all she sat down on a seat at the bottom of the garden and casting her eyes over her whole domain said well now i do admire flowers don't you george that i do replied george taking another seat and coolly turning his back on the parterre and gazing mildly into susan's eyes why he is not even looking at them cried susan and she clapped her hands and laughed gleefully oh yes he is leastways he is looking at one of them and the brightest of the lot to my fancy susan colored with pleasure in the country compliments don't drip constantly on beauty even from the lips of love then suppressing her satisfaction she said you will look for a flower in return for that young man come and let us see whether there is one good enough for you so then they took hands and susan drew him demurely about the garden presently she stopped with a little start of hypocritical admiration at their feet shone a marigold susan culled the gaudy flower and placed it affectionately in george's buttonhole he received it proudly and shaking hands with her for it was time to part turned away slowly she let him take a step or two then called him back he was really going off with that nasty thing she took it out of his buttonhole rubbed it against his nose with well feigned anger and then threw it away you are all behind in flowers george said susan here this is good enough for you and she brought out from under her apron where she had carried the furtively culled treasure a lovely clove pink pretty soul she had nursed and watered and cherished this choice flower this three weeks past for george and this was her way of giving it him at last so a true woman gives her life if need be george took it and smelled it and lingered a moment at the garden gate and moralized on it well susan dear now i'm not so deep in flowers as you but i like this a deal better than the marigold and i'll tell you for why it is more like you susan ay why i see flowers that are pretty but have no smell and i see women that have good looks but no great wisdom nor goodness when you come nearer to them now the marigold is like those lasses but this pink is good as well as pretty so then it will stand for you when we are apart as we mostly are worse luck for me oh george said susan dropping her quizzing manner i am a long way behind the marigold or any flower in comeliness and innocence but at least i wish i was better i don't ay but i do ten times better for for for why susan susan closed the garden gate and took a step toward the house then turning her head over her shoulder with an ineffable look of tenderness tipped with one tint of lingering archness she let fall for your sake george in the direction of george's feet and glided across the garden into the house george stood watching her he did not at first take up all she had bestowed on him for her sex has peculiar mastery over language being diabolically angelically subtle in the art of saying something that expresses oz and implies cwt but when he did comprehend his heart exulted he strode home as if he trod on air and often kissed the little flower he had taken from the beloved hand and with it words of so sweet breath composed as made the thing more rich and as he marched past the house kissing the flower need i tell my reader that so innocent a girl as susan was too high minded to watch the effect of her proceedings from behind the curtains i hope not it would surely be superfluous to relate what none would be green enough to believe these were susan's happy days now all was changed she hated to water her flowers now she bade one of the farm servants look to the garden he accepted the charge and her flowers' drooping heads told how nobly he had fulfilled it susan was charitable every day it had been her custom to visit more than one poor person she carried meal to one soup to another linen to another meat and bread to another money to another to all words and looks of sympathy this practice she did not even now give up for it came under the head of her religious duties but she relaxed it she often sent to places where she used to go until george went she had never thought of herself and so the selfishness of those she relieved had not struck her now it made her bitter to see that none of those she pitied pitied her the moment she came into their houses it was my poor head miss merton my old bones do ache so i think a bit of your nice bacon would do me good i'm a poor sufferer miss merton my boy is 'listed i thought as how you'd forgotten me altogether but 'tis hard for poor folk to keep a friend you see miss my bedroom window is broken in one or two places john he stopped it up with paper the best way he could but la bless you paper baint like glass it is very dull for me you see miss i can't get about now as i used to could and i never was no great reader i often wish as some one would step in and knock me on the head for i be no use i baint neer a mossel no one of them looked up in her face and said lauks how pale you ha got to look miss i hopes as how nothing amiss haven't happened to you that have been so kind to us this many a day yet suffering of some sort was plainly stamped on the face and in the manner of this relieving angel when they poured out their vulgar woes susan made an effort to forget her own and to cheer as well as relieve them but she had to compress her own heart hard to do it and this suppression of feeling makes people more or less bitter she had better have out with it and scolded them well for talking as if they alone were unhappy but her woman's nature would not let her they kept asking her for pity and she still gulped down her own heart and gave it them till at last she began to take a spite against her pets so then she sent to most of them instead of going she sent rather larger slices of beef and bacon and rather more yards of flannel than when she used to carry the like to them herself susan had one or two young friends daughters of farmers in the neighborhood with whom she was a favorite though the gayer ones sometimes quizzed her for her religious tendencies and her lamentable indifference to flirtation but then she was so good and so good humored and so tolerant of other people's tastes the prattle of these young ladies became now intolerable to susan and when she saw them coming to call on her she used to snatch up her bonnet and fly and lock herself up in a closet at the top of the house and read some good book as quiet as a mouse till the servants had hunted for her and told them she must be out she was not in a frame of mind to sustain tarlatans barege the history of the last hop and the prophecies of the next the wounded deer shrunk from its gamboling associates and indeed from all strangers except john meadows he talks to me about something worth talking about said susan merton it happened one day while susan was in this sad and i may say dangerous state of mind that the servant came up to her and told her a gentleman was on his horse at the door and wanted to see mr merton father is at market jane yes miss but i told the gentleman you were at home me what have i to do with father's visitors miss replied jane mysteriously it is a parson and you are so fond of them i could not think to let him go away without getting a word with anybody and he has such a face la miss you never saw such a face silly girl what have i to do with handsome faces but he is not handsome miss not in the least only he is beautiful you go and see else i hate strangers' faces but i will go to him jane it is my duty since it is a clergyman i will just go upstairs la miss what for you are always neat you are nobody ever catches you in your dishables like the rest of 'em i'll just smooth my hair la miss what for it is smooth as marble it always is where is he jane in the front parlor i won't be a moment she went upstairs there was no necessity jane was right there but it was a strict custom in the country and is for that matter and will be till time and vanity shall be no more more majorum a girl must go up and look at herself in the glass if she did nothing more before coming in to receive company susan entered the parlor she came in so gently that she had a moment to observe her visitor before he saw her he had seated himself with his back to the light and was devouring a stupid book on husbandry that belonged to her father the moment she closed the door he saw her and rose from his seat miss merton yes sir the living of this place has been vacant more than a month yes sir it will not be filled up for three months perhaps so we hear sir meantime you have no church to go to nearer than barmstoke which is a chapel of ease to this place but two miles distant two miles and a half sir so then the people here have no divine service on the lord's day no sir not for the present said susan meekly lowering her lashes as if the clergyman had said this is a parish of heathens whereof you are one nor any servant of god to say a word of humility and charity to the rich of eternal hope to the poor and here his voice sunk into sudden tenderness of comfort to the sorrowful susan raised her eyes and looked him over with one dove like glance then instantly lowered them no sir we are all under a cloud here said susan sadly miss merton i have undertaken the duty here until the living shall be filled up but you shall understand that i live thirty miles off and have other duties and i can only ride over here on saturday afternoon and back monday at noon oh sir cried susan half a loaf is better than no bread the parish will bless you sir and no doubt added she timidly the lord will reward you for coming so far to us i am glad you think so said the clergyman thoughtfully well let us do the best we can tell me first miss merton do you think the absence of a clergyman is regretted here regretted sir dear heart what a question you might as well ask me do father's turnips long for rain after a month's drought and susan turned on her visitor a face into which the innocent venerating love her sex have for an ecclesiastic flashed without disguise her companion smiled but it was with benevolence not with gratified vanity let me explain my visit your father is one of the principal people in the village he can assist me or thwart me in my work i called to invite his co operation some clergymen are jealous of co operation i am not it is a good thing for all parties best of all for those who co operate with us for in giving alms wisely they receive grace and in teaching the ignorant they learn themselves am i right added he rather sharply turning suddenly upon susan oh sir said susan a little startled it is for me to receive your words not to judge them humph said the reverend gentleman rather dryly he hated intellectual subserviency he liked people to think for them selves and to end by thinking with him father will never thwart you sir and i i will co operate with you sir if you will accept of me said susan innocently thank you then let us begin at once he took out his watch i have an hour and a half to spare then i must gallop back to oxford miss merton i should like to make acquaintance with some of the people suppose we go to the school and see what the children are learning and then visit one or two families in the village so i shall catch a glimpse of the three generations i have to deal with my name is francis eden you are going to get your bonnet yes sir thank you they passed out through the garden mr eden stopped to look at the flowers susan colored it has been rather neglected of late said she apologetically it must have been very well taken care of before then said he for it looks charming now ah i love flowers dearly and he gave a little sigh they reached the school and mr eden sat down and examined the little boys and girls when he sat down susan winced how angry he will be at their ignorance thought susan but mr eden instead of putting on an awful look and impressing on the children that a being of another generation was about to attack them made himself young to meet their minds a pleasant smile disarmed their fears he spoke to them in very simple words and childish idioms and told them a pretty story which interested them mightily having set their minds really working he put questions arising fairly out of his story and so fathomed the moral sense and the intelligence of more than one in short he drew the brats out instead of crushing them in susan stood by at first startled at the line he took then observant then approving presently he turned to her and which is your class miss merton susan colored i take these little girls when i come sir miss merton has not been here this fortnight said a pert teacher susan could have beat her what will this good man think of me now thought poor susan to her grateful relief the good man took no notice of the observation he looked at his watch now miss merton if i am not giving you too much trouble and they left the school you wish to see some of the folk in the village sir yes where shall i take you first sir where i ought to go first susan looked puzzled mr eden stopped dead short come guess said he with a radiant smile and don't look so scared i'll forgive you if you guess wrong susan looked this way and that encouraged by his merry smile she let out scarce above a whisper and in a tone of interrogation as who should say this is not to be my last chance since i have only asked a question not risked an answer to the poorest mr eden brava she has guessed it cried the reverend frank triumphantly for he had been more anxious she should answer right than she had herself young lady i have friends with their heads full of latin and greek who could not have answered that so quickly as you one proof more how goodness brightens intelligence added he in soliloquy here's a cottage yes sir i was going to take you into this one if you please they found in the cottage a rheumatic old man one of those we alluded to as full of his own complaints mr eden heard these with patience and then after a few words of kind sympathy and acquiescence for he was none of those hard humbugs who tell a man that old age rheumatism and poverty are strokes with a feather he said quietly and now for the other side now tell me what you have to be grateful for the old man was taken aback and his fluency deserted him on the question being repeated he began to say that he had many mercies to be thankful for then he higgled and hammered and fumbled for the said mercies and tried to enumerate them but in phrases conventional and derived from tracts and sermons whereas his statement of grievances had been idiomatic there that will do said mr eden smiling say nothing you don't feel what is the use may i ask you a few questions added he courteously then without waiting for permission he dived skillfully into this man's life and fished up all the pearls the more remarkable passages many years ago this old man had been a soldier had fought in more than one great battle had retreated with sir john moore upon corunna and been one of the battered and weary but invincible band who wheeled round and stunned the pursuers on 'that bloody and glorious day mr eden went with the old man to spain discussed with great animation the retreat the battle the position of the forces and the old soldier's personal prowess old giles perked up and dilated and was another man he forgot his rheumatism and even his old age twice he suddenly stood upright as a dart on the floor and gave the word of command like a trumpet in some brave captain's name and his cheek flushed and his eye glittered with the light of battle susan looked at him with astonishment then when his heart was warm and his spirits attentive mr eden began to throw in a few words of exhortation but even then he did not bully the man into being a christian gently firmly and with a winning modesty he said i think you have much to be thankful for like all the rest of us is it not a mercy you were not cut off in your wild and dissolute youth you might have been slain in battle that i might sir three of us went from this parish and only one came home again you might have lost a leg or an arm as many a brave fellow did you might have been a cripple all your days that is true sir you survive here in a christian land in possession of your faculties the world it is true has but few pleasures to offer you all the better for you oh if i could but make that as plain to you as it is to me you have every encouragement to look for happiness there where alone it is to be found then courage corporal you stood firm at corunna do not give way in this your last and most glorious battle the stake is greater than it was at vittoria or salamanca or corunna or waterloo the eternal welfare of a single human soul weighs a thousand times more than all the crowns and empires in the globe you are in danger sir discontent is a great enemy of the soul you must pray against it you must fight against it and so i will sir you see if i don't you read mr giles susan had told mr eden his name at the threshold yes sir but i can't abide them nasty little prints they bring me of course you can't printed to sell not to read eh here is a book the type is large clear and sharp this is an order book corporal it comes from the great captain of our salvation every sentence in it is gold yet i think i may safely pick out a few for your especial use at present and mr eden sat down and producing from his side pockets which were very profound some long thin slips of paper he rapidly turned the leaves of the testament and inserted his markers but this occupation did not for a moment interrupt his other proceedings there is a pipe you don't smoke i hope no sir leastways not when i han't got any baccy and i've been out of that this three days worse luck give up smoking corporal it is a foul habit ah sir you don't ever have a half empty belly and a sorrowful heart or you wouldn't tell an old soldier to give up his pipe take my advice give up all such false consolation to oblige me now well sir to oblige you i'll try but you don't know what his pipe is to a poor old man full of nothing but aches and pains or you wouldn't have asked me and old giles sighed susan sighed too for she thought mr eden cruel for once miss merton said the latter sternly his eye twinkling all the time he is incorrigible and i see you agree with me that it is idle to torment the incurable so diving into the capacious pocket here is an ounce of his beloved poison and out came a paper of tobacco corporal's eyes brightened with surprise and satisfaction poison him miss merton poison him quick don't keep him waiting poison him sir fill his pipe for him if you please that i will sir with pleasure a white hand with quick and supple fingers filled the brown pipe that is as it should be let beauty pay honor to courage above all to courage in its decay the old man grinned with gratified pride the white hand lighted the pipe and gave it to the old soldier he smiled gratefully all round and sucked his homely consolation i compound with you corporal you must let me put you on the road to heaven and in return i must let you go there in a cloud of tobacco ugh i'm agreeable sir said giles dryly withdrawing his pipe for a moment there said mr eden closing the marked testament read often in this book read first the verses i have marked for these very verses have dropped comfort on the poor the aged and the distressed for more than eighteen hundred years and will till time shall be no more and now good by and god bless you god bless you sir wherever you go cried the old man with sudden energy for you have comforted my poor old heart i feel as i han't felt this many a day your words are like the bugles sounding a charge all down the line you must go i suppose but do ye come again and see me and miss merton you never come to see me now as you used miss merton has her occupations like the rest of us said mr eden quickly but she will come to see you won't she oh yes sir replied susan hastily so then they returned to the farm for mr eden's horse was in the stable at the door they found mr merton this is father sir father this is mr eden that is coming to take the duty here for a while after the ordinary civilities susan drew her father aside and exchanging a few words with him disappeared into the house as mr eden was mounting his horse mr merton came forward and invited him to stay at his house whenever he should come to the parish mr eden hesitated sir said the farmer you will find no lodgings comfortable within a mile of the church and we have a large house not half occupied you can make yourself quite at home i am much obliged to you mr merton but must not trespass too far upon your courtesy well sir replied the farmer we shall feel proud if you can put up with the like of us i will come i am much obliged to you sir and to your daughter he mounted his horse and bade the farmer good morning susan came out and stood on the steps and curtsied low rustic fashion but with a grace of her own he took off his hat to her as he rode out of the gate gave her a sweet bright smile of adieu and went down the lane fourteen miles an hour old giles was seated outside his own door with a pipe and a book at the sound of horses' feet he looked up and recognized his visitor whom he had seen pass in the morning he rose up erect and saluted him by bringing his thumb with a military wave to his forehead mr eden saluted him in the same manner but without stopping the old soldier sat down again and read and smoked the pipe ended that solace was not of an immortal kind but the book remained he read it calmly but earnestly in the warm air till day declined chapter vii the next saturday susan was busy preparing two rooms for mr eden a homely but bright bedroom looking eastward and a snug room where he could be quiet downstairs snowy sheets and curtains and toilet cover showed the good housewife the windows were open and a beautiful nosegay of susan's flowers on the table mr eden's eye brightened at the comfort and neatness and freshness of the whole thing and susan who watched him furtively felt pleased to see him pleased on sunday he preached in the parish church the sermon was opposite to what the good people here had been subject to instead of the vague and cold generalities of an english sermon he drove home truths home in business like english he used a good many illustrations and these were drawn from matters with which this particular congregation were conversant he was as full of similes here as he was sparing of them when he preached before the university of oxford any one who had read this sermon in a book of sermons would have divined what sort of congregation it was preached to a primrose of a sermon mr eden preached from notes and to the people not the air like every born orator he felt his way with his audience whereas the preacher who is not an orator throws out his fine things hit or miss and does not know and feel and care whether he is hitting or missing open your hand shut your eyes and fling out the good seed so much per foot that is enough no this man preached to the faces and hearts that happened to be round him he established between himself and them a pulse every throb of which he felt and followed if he could not get hold of them one way he tried another he would have them he was not there to fail his discourse was human it was man speaking to man on the most vital and interesting topic in the world or out of it it was more it was brother speaking to brother hence some singular phenomena first when he gave the blessing which is a great piece of eloquence commonly reduced to a very small one by monotonous or feeble delivery and uttered it like his discourse with solemnity warmth tenderness and all his soul the people lingered some moments in the church and seemed unwilling to go at all second nobody mistook their pew for their four poster during the sermon this was the more remarkable as many of the congregation had formed a steady habit of coming to this place once a week with the single view of snatching an hour's repose from earthly and heavenly cares the next morning mr eden visited some of the poorest people in the parish susan accompanied him all eyes and ears she observed that his line was not to begin by dictating his own topic but lie in wait for them let them first choose their favorite theme and so meet them on this ground and bring religion to bear on it oh how wise he is thought susan and how he knows the heart one sunday evening three weeks after his first official visit he had been by himself to see some of the poor people and on his return found susan alone he sat down and gave an account of his visits how many ounces of tea and tobacco did you give away sir asked susan with an arch smile four tea two tobacco replied the reverend gentleman i do notice sir you never carry gingerbread or the like for the children no the young don't want lollypops for they have youth old age wants everything so the old are my children and i tea and tobacco them after this there was a pause miss merton you have shown me many persons who need consolation but there is one you say nothing about have i sir who oh i think i know old dame clayton no it is a young demoiselle then i don't know who it can be guess no sir said susan looking down it is yourself miss merton me sir why what is the matter with me that you shall tell me if you think me worthy of your confidence oh thank you sir i have my little crosses no doubt like all the world but i have health and strength i have my father my child you are in trouble you were crying when i came in indeed i was not sir how did you know i was crying when i came in you turned your back to me instead of facing me which is more natural when any one enters a room and soon after you made an excuse for leaving the room and when you came back there was a drop of water in your right eyelash it need not have been a tear sir it was not it was water you had been removing the traces of tears girls are mostly always crying sir often they don't know for why but they don't care to have it noticed always nor would it be polite or generous but this of yours is a deep grief and alarms me for you shall i tell you how i know you often yawn and often sigh when these two things come together at your age they are signs of a heavy grief then it comes out that you have lost your relish for things that once pleased you the first day i came here you told me your garden had been neglected of late and you blushed in saying so old giles and others asked you before me why you had given up visiting them you colored and looked down i could almost have told them but that would have made you uncomfortable you are in grief and no common grief nothing worth speaking to you about sir nothing i will ever complain of to any one there i think you are wrong religion has consoled many griefs great griefs admit of no other consolation the sweetest exercise of my office is to comfort the heavy hearted your heart is heavy my poor lamb tell me what is it it is nothing sir that you would understand you are very skilled and notice taking as well as good but you are not a woman and you must excuse me sir if i beg you not to question me further on what would not interest you mr eden looked at her compassionately and merely said to her again what is it in a low tone of ineffable tenderness at this susan looked in a scared manner this way and that sir do not ask me pray do not ask me so then she suddenly lifted her hands my george is gone across the sea what shall i do what shall i do and she buried her face in her apron this burst of pure nature this simple cry of a suffering heart was very touching and mr eden spite of his many experiences was not a little moved he sat silent looking on her as an angel might be supposed to look upon human griefs and as he looked on her various expressions chased one another across that eloquent face sweet and tender memories and regrets were not wanting among them after a long pause he spoke in a tone soft and gentle as a woman's and at first in a voice so faltering that susan though her face was hidden felt there was no common sympathy there and silently put out her hand toward it he murmured consolation he said many gentle soothing things he told her that it was very sad the immense ocean should roll between two loving hearts but said he there are barriers more impassable than the sea better so than that he should be here and jealousy mistrust caprice or even temper come between you i hope he will come back i think he will come back she blessed him for saying so she was learning to believe everything this man uttered from consolation he passed to advice you must do the exact opposite of what you have been doing must i you must visit those poor people ay more than ever you did hear patiently their griefs do not expect much in return neither sympathy nor a great deal of gratitude vulgar sorrow is selfish do it for god's sake and your own single heartedly go to the school return to your flowers and never shun innocent society however dull milk and water is a poor thing but it is a diluent and all we can do just now is to dilute your grief he made her promise next time i come tell me all about you and george 'give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break' oh that is a true word sobbed susan that is very true why a little of the lead seems to have dropped off my heart now i have spoken to you sir all the next week susan bore up as bravely as she could and did what mr eden had bade her and profited by his example she learned to draw from others the full history of their woes and she found that many a grief bitter as her own had passed over the dwellers in those small cottages it did her some little good to discover kindred woes and much good to go out of herself a while and pity them this drooping flower recovered her head a little but still the sweetest hour in all the working days of the week was that which brought john meadows to talk to her of australia chapter viii susan merton had two unfavored lovers it is well to observe how differently these two behaved william fielding stayed at home threw his whole soul into his farm and seldom went near the woman he loved but had no right to love meadows dangled about the flame ashamed and afraid to own his love he fed it to a prodigious height by encouraging it and not expressing it william fielding was moody and cross and sad enough at times but at others a little spark ignited inside his heart and a warm glow diffused itself from that small point over all his being i think this spark igniting was an approving conscience commencing its uphill work of making a disappointed lover but honest man content meadows on his part began to feel content and a certain complacency take the place of his stormy feelings twice a week he passed two hours with susan she always greeted him with a smile and naturally showed an innocent satisfaction in these visits managed as they were with so much art and self restraint on sunday too he had always a word or two with her meadows though an observer of religious forms had the character of a very worldly man and susan thought it highly to his credit that he came six miles to hear mr eden but mr meadows your poor horse said she one day i doubt it is no sabbath to him now no more it is said meadows as if a new light came to him from susan the next sunday he appeared in dusty shoes instead of top boots susan looked down at them and saw and said nothing but she smiled her love of goodness and her vanity were both gratified a little meadows did not stop there wherever susan went he followed modestly in her steps nor was this mere cunning he loved her quite well enough to imitate her and try and feel with her and he began to be kinder to the poor and to feel good all over and comfortable he felt as if he had not an enemy in the world one day in farnborough he saw william fielding on the other side of the street susan merton did not love william therefore meadows had no cause to hate him he remembered william had asked a loan of him and he had declined he crossed over to him good day mr william good day mr meadows you were speaking to me one day about a trifling loan i could not manage it just then but now here meadows paused he had been on the point of offering the money but suddenly by one of those instincts of foresight these able men have he turned it off thus but i know who will you go to lawyer crawley he lends money to people of credit i know he does but he won't lend it me why not he does not like us he is a poor sneaking creature and my brother george he caught crawley selling up some poor fellow or other and they had words leastways it went beyond words i fancy i don't know the rights of it but george was a little rough with him by all accounts and what has that to do with this said the man of business coolly why i am george's brother and if you were george himself and he saw his way to make a shilling out of you he would do it wouldn't he there you go to crawley and ask him to lend you one hundred pounds and he will lend it you only he will make you pay heavy interest heavier than i should you know if i could manage it myself oh i don't care said simple william thank you kindly mr meadows and off he went to crawley he found that worthy in his office crawley who instantly guessed his errand and had no instructions from meadows promised himself the satisfaction of refusing the young man he asked with a cringing manner and a treacherous smile what security sir poor william higgled and hammered and offered first one thing which was blandly declined for this reason then another which was blandly declined for that crawley drinking deep draughts of mean vengeance all the while from the young man's shame and mortification when the door opened a man walked in and gave crawley a note and vanished crawley opened the note it contained a check drawn by meadows and these words lend w f the money at ten per cent on his acceptance of your draft at two months crawley put the note and check in his pocket well sir said he to william you stay here and i will see if i have got a loose hundred in the bank to spare he went over to the bank cashed the check drew a bill of exchange at two months' date deducted the interest and stamp and william accepted it and crawley bowed him out cringing smiling and secretly shooting poisoned arrows out of his venomous eye in the direction of william's heels william thanked him warmly this loan made him feel happy he had paid his brother's debt to the landlord by sacrificing a large portion of his grain at a time the price was low and now he was so cramped he had much ado to pay his labor when this loan came the very next day he bought several hogs hogs as george had sarcastically observed were william fielding's hobby he had i confidence in that animal potatoes and pigs versus sheep and turnips was the theory of william fielding now the good understanding between william and meadows was not to last long william though he was too wise to visit grassmere farm much was mindful of his promise to george and used to make occasional inquiries after susan he heard that meadows called at the farm twice a week and he thought it a little odd he pondered on it but did not quite go the length of suspecting anything still less of suspecting susan still he thought it odd but he thought it odder when one market day old isaac levi said to him do you remember the promise you made to the lion hearted young man your brother do you ask that to affront me you never visit her and others are not so neglectful who go this evening and you will see yes i will go and i will soon see if there is anything in it said william not stopping even to inquire why the old jew took all this interest in the affair that evening as meadows was in the middle of a description of the town of sydney susan started up why here is william fielding and she ran out and welcomed him in with much cordiality perhaps with some excess of cordiality william came in and saluted the farmer and meadows in his dogged way meadows was not best pleased but kept his temper admirably and leaving australia engaged both the farmers in a conversation on home topics susan looked disappointed meadows was content with that and the party separated half an hour sooner than usual the next market evening in strolls william meadows again plays the same game this time susan could hardly restrain her temper she did not want to hear about the grassmere acres and the grove and oxen and hogs but about something that mattered to george but when the next market evening william arrived before mr meadows she was downright provoked and gave him short answers which raised his suspicions and made him think he had done wisely in coming this evening susan excused herself and went to bed early she was in farnborough the next market day and william met her and said i'll take a cup of tea with you to night susan if you are agreeable william said susan sharply what makes you always come to us on market day i don't know what makes mr meadows come that day because he passes our house to go to his own i suppose but you live but two miles off you can come any day that you are minded should i be welcome susan what do you think will speak your mind i don't understand you seems to me i was not very welcome last time if i thought that i wouldn't come again replied susan as sharp as a needle then instantly repenting a little she explained you are welcome to me will and you know that as well as i do but i want you to come some other evening if it is all the same to you why why because i am dull other evenings and it would be nice to have a chat with you would it susan of course it would but that evening i have company and he talks to me of australia nothing else sneered the unlucky william susan gave him such a look and that interests me more than anything you can say to me if you won't be offended snapped susan william bit his lip well then i won't come this evening eh susan no don't that is a good soul les femmes sont impitoyables pour ceux qu'elles n'aiment pas this is a harsh saying and of course not pure truth but there is a deal of truth in it william was proud and the consciousness of his own love for her made him less able to persist for he knew she might be so ungenerous as to retort if he angered her too far so he altered the direction of his battery he planted himself at the gate of grassmere farm and as meadows got off his horse requested a few words with him meadows ran him over with one lightning glance and then the whole man was on the defensive william bluntly opened the affair you heard me promise to look on susan as my sister and keep her as she is for my brother that is far away i heard you mr william said meadows with a smile that provoked william as the artful one intended it should you come here too often sir too often for who too often for me too often for george too often for the girl herself i won't have george's sweetheart talked about you are the first to talk about her if there's scandal it is of your making i won't have it at a word meadows called out miss merton will you step here william was astonished at his audacity he did not know his man susan opened the parlor window what is it mr meadows will you step here if you please susan came here is a young man tells me i must not call on your father or you i say you must not do it often enough to make her talked of who dares to talk of me cried susan scarlet nobody miss merton nobody but the young man himself and so i told him is your father within then i'll step in and speak with him anyway and the sly meadows vanished to give susan an opportunity of quarreling with william while she was hot i don't know how you came to take such liberties with me began susan quite pale now with anger it is for george's sake said william doggedly did george bid you insult my friends and me i would not put up with it from george himself much less from you i shall write to george and ask him whether he wishes me to be your slave don't ye do so don't set my brother against me remonstrated william ruefully the best thing you can do is to go home and mind your farm and get a sweetheart for yourself and then you won't trouble your head about me more than you have any business to do this last cut wounded william to the quick good evening susan good evening won't you shake hands it would serve you right if i said no but i won't make you of so much importance as you want to be there and come again as soon as ever you can treat my friends with respect i shan't trouble you again for a while said william sadly good by god bless you susan dear when he was gone the tears came into susan's eyes but she was bitterly indignant with him for making a scene about her which a really modest girl hates on her reaching the parlor mr meadows was gone too and that incensed her still more against william mr meadows is affronted no doubt said she and of course he would not come here to be talked of he would not like that any more than i a man that comes here to us out of pure good nature and nothing else the next market day the deep meadows did not come susan missed him and his talk she had few pleasures and this was one of them but the next after he came as usual and susan did not conceal her satisfaction she was too shy and he too wise to allude to william's interference they both ignored the poor fellow and his honest clumsy attempt william discomfited but not convinced determined to keep his eye upon them both i swore it and i'll do it said this honest fellow but i can't face her tongue it goes through me like a pitchfork but as for him and he clinched his fist most significantly then he revolved one or two plans in his head and rejected them each in turn at last a thought struck him mr levi he 'twas that put me on my guard i'll tell him accordingly he recounted the whole affair and his failure to mr levi the old man smiled you are no match for either of these you have given the maiden offense just offense just offence mr levi now don't ye say so why how by your unskillfulness my son it is all very well for you to say that sir but i can tell you women are kittle folk manage them who can i don't know what to do i'm sure stay at home and till the land replied isaac somewhat dryly i will go to grassmere farm chapter ix you going to leave us mr eden and going to live in a jail oh mr eden i can't bear to think of it you to be cooped up there among thieves and rogues and perhaps murderers they have the more need of me and you who love the air of heaven so why sir i see you take off your very hat at times to enjoy it as you are walking along you would be choked in a prison besides sir it is only little parsons that go there what are little parsons those that are not clever enough or good enough to be bishops and vicars and so forth not such ones as you how odd this is exactly what the devil whispered in my ear when the question was first raised but i did not expect to find you on his side didn't you sir ah well if 'tis your duty i know i may as well hold my tongue and then such as you are not like other folk you come like sunshine to some dark place and when you have warmed it and lighted it a bit heaven that sent you will have you go and shine elsewhere you came here sir you waked up the impenitent folk in this village and comforted the distressed and relieved the poor and you have saved one poor broken hearted girl from despair from madness belike and now we are not to be selfish we must not hold you back but let you run the race that is set before you and remember your words and your deeds and your dear face and voice to the last hour of our lives and give me the benefit of your prayers little sister do not deny me them your prayers that i may persevere to the end ay it is too true susan in this world there is nothing but meeting and parting it is sad we have need to be stout hearted stouter hearted than you are but it will not always be so a few short years and we who have fought the good fight shall meet to part no more to part no more to part no more as he repeated these words half mechanically susan could see that he had suddenly become scarce conscious of her presence the light of other days was in his eye and his lips moved inarticulately delicate minded susan left him and with the aid of the servant brought out the tea things and set the little table on the grass square in her garden where you could see the western sun and then she came for mr eden come sir there is not a breath of wind this evening so the tea things are set in the air i know you like that the little party sat down in the open air the butter churned by susan was solidified cream the bread not very white but home made juicy and sweet as milk the tea seemed to diffuse a more flowery fragrance out of doors than it does in and to mix fraternally with the hundred odors of susan's flowers that now perfumed the air and the whole innocent meal unlike coarse dinner or supper mingled harmoniously with the scene with the balmy air the blue sky and the bright emerald grass sprinkled with gold by the descending sun farmer merton soon left them and then susan went in and brought out pen and ink and a large sheet of paper susan sat apart working with her needle mr eden sketched a sermon and sipped his tea and now and then purred three words to susan who purred as many in reply and yet over this pleasant scene there hung a gentle sadness felt most by susan as with head bent down she plied her needle in silence he will not sit in my garden many times more nor write many more notes of sermons under my eye nor preach to us all many more sermons and then he is going to a nasty jail where he won't have his health i'm doubtful and then i'm fearful he won't be comfortable in his house with nobody to take care of him that really cares for him servants soon find out where there is no woman to scold them as should be and he is not the man to take his own part against them and susan sighed at the domestic prospects of her friend and her needle went slower and slower these reflections were interrupted by the servant who announced a visitor susan laid down her work and went into the parlor and there found isaac levi she greeted him with open arms and heightened color and never for a moment suspected that he was come there full of suspicions of her after the first greeting a few things of little importance were said on either side isaac watching to see whether mr meadows had succeeded in supplanting george and too cunning to lead the conversation that way himself lay patiently in wait like a sly old fox however he soon found he was playing the politician superfluously for susan laid bare her whole heart to the simplest capacity instead of waiting for the skillful subtle almost invisible cross examination which the descendant of maimonides was preparing for her she answered all his questions before they were asked it came out that her thought by day and night was george that she had been very dull and very unhappy but i am better now mr levi thank god he has been very good to me he has sent me a friend a clergyman or an angel in the dress of one i sometimes think he knows all about me and george sir so that makes me feel quite at home with him and i can and now mr meadows stops an hour on market days and he is so kind as to tell me all about australia and you may guess i like to hear about mr levi come and see us some market evening mr meadows is capital company to hear him you would think he had passed half his life in australia were you ever in australia sir if you please never but i shall shall you sir yes the old jew is not to die till he has drifted to every part in the globe in my old days i shall go back toward the east and there methinks i shall lay these wandering bones oh sir inquire after george and show him some kindness and don't see him wronged he is very simple no no no you are too old you must not cross the seas at your age don't think of it stay quiet at home till you leave us for a better world at home said the old man sorrowfully i have no home i had a home but the man meadows has driven me out of it mr meadows la sir as how he bought the house i live in and next lady day as the woman worshiper calls it he turns me to the door but he won't if you ask him he is a very good natured man you go and ask him to be so good as let you stay he won't gainsay you you take my word susannah replied isaac you are good and innocent you cannot fathom the hearts of the wicked this meadows is a man of belial i did beseech him i bowed these gray hairs to him to let me stay in the house where i lived so happily with my leah twenty years where my children were born to me and died from me where my leah consoled me for their loss a while but took no comfort herself and left me too poor old man and what did he say he refused me with harsh words to make the refusal more bitter he insulted my religion and my much enduring tribe and at the day appointed he turns me at threescore years and ten adrift upon the earth eh dear how hard the world is cried susan i had a great respect for mr meadows but now if he comes here i know i shall shut the door in his face isaac reflected this would not have suited a certain subtle eastern plan of vengeance he had formed no said he that is folly take not another man's quarrel on your shoulders a jew knows how to revenge himself without your aid so then her inquisitor was satisfied australia really was the topic that made meadows welcome he departed revolving oriental vengeance smooth meadows at his next visit removed the impression excited against him and easily persuaded susan that levi was more in the wrong than he in which opinion she stood firm till levi's next visit at last she gave up all hope of dijudicating and determined to end the matter by bringing them together and making them friends and now approached the day of mr eden's departure the last sermon the last quiet tea in the garden on monday afternoon he was to go to oxford and the following week to his new sphere of duties which he had selected to the astonishment of some hundred persons who knew him superficially knew him by his face by his pretensions as a scholar a divine and a gentleman of descent and independent means but had not sounded his depths all sunday susan sought every opportunity of conversing with him even on indifferent matters she was garnering up his words his very syllables and twenty times in the day he saw her eyes fill with tears apropos of such observations as this we shall have a nice warm afternoon susan it is to be hoped so sir the blackbirds are giving a chirrup or two all monday forenoon susan was very busy there was bread to be baked and butter to be made mr eden must take some of each to oxford they would keep grassmere in his mind a day or two longer and besides they were wholesome and he was fond of them then there was his linen to be looked over and buttons sewed on for the last time then he must eat a good dinner before he went so then he would want nothing but his tea when he got to oxford and the bread would be fit to eat by tea time especially a small crusty cake she had made for that purpose so with all this susan was energetic almost lively and even when it was all done and they were at dinner her principal anxiety seemed to be that he should eat more than usual because he was going a journey but when all bustle of every kind was over and the actual hour of parting came she suddenly burst out crying before her father and the servant who bade her not take on and instantly burst out crying too from vague sympathy the old farmer ordered the girl out of the room directly and without the least emotion proceeded to make excuses to mr eden for susan a young maid's eyes soon flow over etc mr eden interrupted him such tears as these do not scald the heart i feel this separation from my dear kind friend as much as she feels it but i am more than twice her age and have passed through i should feel it bitterly if i thought our friendship and christian love were to end because our path of duty lies separate but no susan still look on me as your adviser your elder brother and in some measure your pastor i shall write to you and watch over you though it some distance and not so great a distance i am always well horsed and i know you will give me a bed at grassmere once a quarter that we will cried the farmer warmly and proud and happy to see you cross the threshold sir and mr merton my new house is large i shall be alone in it whenever you and miss merton have nothing better to do pray come and visit me i will make you as uncomfortable as you have made me comfortable but as welcome as you have made me welcome we will come sir we will come some one of these days and thank you for the honor so mr eden went from grassmere village and grassmere farmhouse but he left neither as he found them fifty years hence an old man and woman or two will speak to their grandchildren of the sower and susan merton if she is on earth then of the good physician she may well do so for it was no vulgar service he rendered her no vulgar malady he checked not every good man could have penetrated so quickly a coy woman's grief nor the wound found have soothed her fever and deadened her smart with a hand as firm as gentle as gentle as firm such men are human suns they brighten and warm wherever they pass fools count them mad till death wrenches open foolish eyes they are not often called my lord nor sung by poets when they die but the hearts they heal and their own are their rich reward on earth and their place is high in heaven sometimes thought chapter x mr meadows lived in a house that he had conquered three years ago by lending money on it at fair interest in his own name mr david hall the proprietor paid neither principal nor interest mr meadows expected this contingency and therefore lent his money he threatened to foreclose and sell the house under the hammer to avoid this mr hall said pay yourself the interest by living rent free in the house till such time as my old aunt dies drat her and then i'll pay your money i wish i had never borrowed it meadows acquiesced with feigned reluctance well if i must i must but let me have my money as soon as you can aside i will end my days in this house it had many conveniences among the rest a very long though narrow garden inclosed within high walls at the end of the garden was a door which anybody could open from the inside but from the outside only by a bramah key the access to this part of the premises was by a short narrow lane very dirty and very little used because whatever might have been in old times it led now from nowhere to nowhere meadows received by this entrance one or two persons whom he never allowed to desecrate his knocker at the head of these furtive visitors was peter crawley attorney at law a gentleman who every new year's eve used to say to himself with a look of gratified amazement another year gone and i not struck off the rolls peter had a bramah key intrusted to him his visits to mr meadows were conducted thus he opened the garden gate and looked up at the window in a certain passage this passage was not accessible to the servants and the window with its blinds was a signal book blinds up mr meadows out white blind down mr meadows in blue blind down mr meadows in but not alone the same key that opened the garden door opened a door at the back of the house which led direct to the passage above mentioned on the window seat lay a peculiar whistle constructed to imitate the whining of a dog then meadows would go to his book shelves which lined one side of the room and pressing a hidden spring open a door that nobody ever suspected for the books came along with it to provide for every contingency there was a small secret opening in another part of the shelves by which meadows could shoot unobserved a note or the like into the passage and so give crawley instructions without dismissing a visitor if he had one meadows provided against surprise and discovery his study had double doors neither of them could be opened from the outside his visitors or servants must rap with an iron knocker and while meadows went to open the secret visitor stepped into the passage and shut the books behind him it was a room that looked business one side was almost papered with ordnance maps of this and an adjoining county pigeon holes abounded too and there was a desk six feet long chock full of little drawers contents indicated outside in letters of which the proprietor knew the meaning not i between the door and the fireplace was a screen on which in place of idle pictures might be seen his plans and calculations as a land surveyor especially those that happened to be at present in operation or under consideration so he kept his business before his eye on the chance of a good idea striking him at a leisure moment will fielding's acceptance falls due to morrow crawley yes sir what shall i do present it he is not ready for it i know well sir what next serve him with a writ he will be preciously put about he will seem sorry say you are a little short but won't trouble him for a month if it is inconvenient but he must make you safe by signing a judgment ay ay sir may i make bold to ask what is the game with this young fielding you ought to know the game to get him in my power and a very good game it is sir nobody plays it better than you he won't be the only one that is in your power in these parts he he and crawley chuckled without merriment excuse my curiosity sir but when about is the blow to fall what is that to you nothing sir only the sooner the better i have a grudge against the family have you then don't act upon it i don't employ you to do your business but mine certainly mr meadows you don't think i'd be so ungrateful as to spoil your admirable plans by acting upon any little feeling of my own i don't think you would be so silly for if you did we should part don't mention such an event sir you have been drinking crawley not a drop sir this two days you are a liar the smell of it comes through your skin i won't have it do you hear what i say i won't have it no man that drinks can do business especially mine i'll never touch a drop again they called me into the public house they wouldn't take a denial hold your prate and listen to me the next time you look at a public house say to yourself peter crawley that is not a public house to you it is a hospital a workhouse for a dunghill for if you go in there john meadows that is your friend will be your enemy heaven forbid mr meadows drink this basinful of coffee yes sir thank you sir it is very bitter is your head clear now as a bell then go and do my work and don't do an atom more or an atom less than your task no sir oh mr meadows it is a pleasure to serve you you are as deep as the sea sir and as firm as the rock you never drink nor anything else that i can find a man out of a thousand no little weakness like the rest of us sir you are a great man sir you are a model of a man of bus good morning growled meadows roughly and turned his back good morning sir said peter mellifluously and opening the back door about ten inches he wriggled out like a weasel going through a chink in a wall william fielding fell like a child into the trap give me time and it will be all right is the debtor's delusion william thanked crawley for not pressing him and so compelling him to force a sale of all his hogs fat or lean crawley received his thanks with a leer returned in four days got the judgment signed and wriggled away with it to meadows' back door you take out an arrest meadows gave him a pocketbook put it in this and keep it ready in your pocket night and day i dare say it will come into use before the year is out sir i hope not george fielding gone to australia to make a thousand pounds by farming and cattle feeding that so he may claim old merton's promised consent to marry susan susan observing mr eden's precepts even more religiously than when he was with her active full of charitable deeds often pensive always anxious but not despondent now thanks to the good physician meadows falling deeper and deeper in love but keeping it more jealously secret than ever on his guard against isaac on his guard against william on his guard against john meadows hoping everything from time and accidents from the distance between the lovers from george's incapacity of which he had a great opinion he will never make a thousand pence but not trusting to the things he hoped on the contrary watching with keen eye and working with subtle threads to draw everybody into his power who could assist or thwart him in the object his deep heart and iron will were set on william fielding going down the hill meadows was mounting getting the better of his passion and substituting by degrees a brother in law's regard flowers and weeds have one thing in common while they live they grow natural growth is a slow process to describe it day by day a slower for the next four months matters glided so quietly on the slopes i have just indicated that an intelligent calculation by the reader may very well take the place of a tedious chronicle by the writer moreover the same monotony did not hang over every part of our story these very four months were eventful enough to one of our characters and through him by subtle and positive links to every man and every woman who fills any considerable position in this matter of fact romance therefore our story drags us from the meadows round grassmere to a massive castellated building glaring red brick with white stone corners these colors and their contrast relieve the stately mass of some of that grimness which characterizes the castles of antiquity but enough remains to strike some awe into the beholder two round towers flank the principal entrance on one side of the right hand tower is a small house constructed in the same style as the grand pile the castle is massive and grand this its satellite is massive and tiny like the frog doing his little bit of bull like signor hervio nano a tremendous thick dwarf now no more there is one dimple to all this gloomy grandeur a rich little flower garden whose frame of emerald turf goes smiling up to the very ankle of the frowning fortress as some few happy lakes in the world wash the very foot of the mountains that hem them from this green spot a few flowers look up with bright and wondering wide opened eyes at the great bullying masonry over their heads and to the spectator of both these sparks of color at the castle foot are dazzling and charming they are like rubies sapphires and pink topaz in some uncouth angular ancient setting between the central towers is a sharp arch filled by a huge oak door of the same shape and size which for further security or ornament is closely studded with large diamond headed nails a man with keys at his girdle like the ancient housewives opens the huge door to you with slight effort so well oiled is it you slip under a porch into an inclosed yard the great door shuts almost of itself and now it depends upon the housewifely man whether you ever see the vain idle and every way objectionable world again passing into the interior of the vast building you find yourself in an extensive aisle traversed at right angles by another of similar dimensions the whole in form of a cross in the center of each aisle is an iron staircase so narrow that two people cannot pass and so light and open that it merely ornaments not obstructs the view of the aisle these staircases make two springs the first takes them to the level of two corridors on the first floor here there is a horizontal space of about a yard whence the continuation staircase rises to the second and highest floor this gives three corridors all studded with doors opening on small separate apartments whereof anon nearly all the inmates of this grim palace wear a peculiar costume and disguise one feature of which is a cap of coarse materials with a vizor to it which conceals the features all but the chin and the eyes which last peep in a very droll way through two holes cut for that purpose they are distinguished by a courteous manner to strangers whom they never fail to salute in passing with great apparent cordiality indeed we fear we shall never meet in the busy world with such uniform urbanity as in this and similar retreats it arises from two causes one is that here strangers are welcome from their rarity another that politeness is a part of the education of the place which besides its other uses is an adult school of manners morals religion grammar writing and cobbling with the exception of its halls and corridors the building is almost entirely divided into an immense number of the small apartments noticed above these are homely inside but exquisitely clean the furniture movable and fixed none of which is superfluous can be briefly described a bedstead consisting of the side walls of the apartment polished steel staples are fixed in these walls two on each side the apartment at an elevation of about two feet and a half the occupant's mattress made of cocoa bark has two stout steel hooks at each end these are hooked into the staples and so he lies across his abode a deal table the size of a pocket handkerchief also a deal tripod a waterspout so ingeniously contrived that turned to the right it sends a small stream into a copper basin and to the left into a bottomless close stool at some distance a small gas pipe tipped with polished brass in one angle of the wall a sort of commode or open cupboard on whose shelves a bright pewter plate a knife and fork and a wooden spoon in a drawer of this commode yellow soap and a comb and brush a grating down low for hot air to come in if it likes and another up high for foul air to go out if it chooses on the wall a large placard containing rules for the tenant's direction and smaller placards containing texts from scripture the propriety of returning thanks after food etc a slate and a couple of leathern kneeguards used in polishing the room and that is all but the deal furniture is so clean you might eat off it the walls are snow the copper basin and the brass gaspipe glitter like red gold and pale gold and the bed hooks like silver hot from the furnace altogether it is inviting at first sight to one of these snowy snug retreats was now ushered an acquaintance of ours tom robinson a brief retrospect must dispose of his intermediate history when he left us he went to the county bridewell where he remained until the assizes an interval of about a month he was tried direct evidence was strong against him and he defended himself with so much ingenuity and sleight of intellect that the jury could not doubt his sleight of hand and morals too he was found guilty identified as a notorious thief and condemned to twelve months' imprisonment and ten years' transportation he returned to the county bridewell for a few days and then was shifted to the castellated building tom robinson had not been in jail this four years and since his last visit great changes had begun to take place in the internal economy of these skeleton palaces and in the treatment of their prisoners prisons might be said to be in a transition state in some as in the county bridewell robinson had just left the old system prevailed in full force the two systems vary in their aims under the old the jail was a finishing school of felony and petty larceny under the new it is intended to be a penal hospital for diseased and contagious souls the treatment of prisoners is not at present invariable within certain limits the law unwisely allows a discretionary power to the magistrates of the county where the jail is and the jailer or as he is now called the governor is their agent in these particulars hence in some new jails you may now see the non separate system in others the separate system without silence in others the separate and silent system in others a mixture of these i e the hardened offenders kept separate the improving ones allowed to mix and these varieties are at the discretion of the magistrates who settle within the legal limits each jail's system the magistrates in this part of their business are represented by certain of their own body who are called the visiting justices and these visiting justices can even order and authorize a jailer to flog a prisoner for offenses committed in jail now a year or two before our tale one captain o'connor was governor of this jail captain o'connor was a man of great public merit he had been one of the first dissatisfied with the old system and had written very intelligent books on crime and punishment which are supposed to have done their share in opening the nation's eyes to the necessity of regenerating its prisons but after a while the visiting justices of this particular county became dissatisfied with him he did not go far enough nor fast enough with the stone he had helped to roll books and reports came out which convinced the magistrates that severe punishment of mind and body was the essential object of a jail and that it was wrong and chimerical to attempt any cures by any other means captain o'connor had been very successful by other means and could not quite come to this opinion but he had a deputy governor who did system when it takes a hold of the mind takes a strong hold and the men of system became very impatient of opposition and grateful for thorough acquiescence hence it came to pass that in the course of a few months captain o'connor found himself in an uncomfortable position his deputy governor mr hawes enjoyed the confidence of the visiting justices he did not his suggestions were negatived hawes's accepted and to tell the truth he became at last useless as well as uncomfortable for these gentlemen were determined to carry out their system and had a willing agent in the prison o'connor was little more than a drag on the wheel he could not hinder from gliding down the hill at last it happened that he had overdrawn his account without clearly stating at the time that the sum which amounted nearly to one hundred pounds was taken by him as an accommodation or advance of salary this which though by no means unprecedented was an unbusiness like though innocent omission justified censure the magistrates went farther than censure they had long been looking for an excuse to get rid of him and avail themselves of the zeal and energy of hawes they therefore removed o'connor stating publicly as their reason that he was old and their interest put hawes into his place there was something melancholy in such a close to o'connor's public career fortune used him hardly he had been one of the first to improve prisons yet he was dismissed on this or that pretense but really because he could not keep pace with the soi disant improvements of three inexperienced persons honorable mention of his name his doings and his words is scattered about various respectable works by respectable men on this subject yet he ended in something very like discredit however the public gained this by the injustice done him that an important experiment was tried under an active and a willing agent with governor hawes the separate and silent system flourished in jail the justices and the new governor were of one mind they had been working together about two years when robinson came into the jail during this period three justices had periodically visited the jail perused the reports examined as in duty bound the surgeon the officers and prisoners and were proud of the system and its practical working here with respect to hawes the governor their opinion of him was best shown in the reports they had to make to the home office from time to time in these they invariably spoke of him as an active zealous and deserving officer robinson had heard much of the changes in jail treatment but they had not yet come home to him when therefore instead of being turned adrift among seventy other spirits as bad as himself and greeted with their boisterous acclamations and the friendly pressure of seven or eight felonious hands he was ushered into a cell white as driven snow and his housewifely duties explained to him under a heavy penalty if a speck of dirt should ever be discovered on his little wall his little floor his little table or if his cocoa bark mattress should not be neatly rolled up after use and the strap tight and the steel hook polished like glass and his little brass gas pipe glittering like gold etc thomas looked blank and had a misgiving i say guv'nor said he to the under turnkey how long am i to be here before i go into the yard talking not allowed out of hours was the only reply robinson whistled the turnkey whose name was evans looked at him with a doubtful air as much as to say shall i let that pass unpunished or not however he went out without any further observation leaving the door open but the next moment he returned and put his head in prisoners shut their own doors said he well drawled robinson looking coolly and insolently into the man's face i don't see what i shall gain by that and mr robinson seated himself and turning his back a little rudely immersed himself ostentatiously in his own thoughts you will gain as you won't be put in the black hole for refractory conduct no replied evans quietly and sternly robinson made a wry face and pushed the door peevishly it shut with a spring and no mortal power or ingenuity could now open it from the inside well i'm blest said the self immured every man his own turnkey now save the queen's pocket whatever you do times are so hard box at the opera costs no end what have we got here a bible my eye invisible print oh i see 'tisn't for us to read 'tis for the visitors to admire like the new sheet over the dirty blankets what's this hung up grace after meat oh with all my heart your reverence here turnkey fetch up the venison and the sweet sauce you may leave the water gruel till i ring for it if i am to say grace let me feel it first drat your eyes all round governor turnkeys chaplain and all the hypocritical crew the next morning at half past five the prison bell rang for the officers to rise and at six a turnkey unlocked robinson's door and delivered the following in an imperious key all in one note and without any rests prisoner to open and shake bedding wash face hands and neck on pain of punishment and roll up hammocks and clean cells and be ready to clean corridors if required so chanting slammed door vanished robinson set to work with alacrity upon the little arrangements he soon finished them and then he would not have been sorry to turn out and clean the corridor for a change but it was not his turn he sat dull and lonely till eight o'clock when suddenly a key was inserted into a small lock in the center of his door but outside the effect of this was to open a small trap in the door through this aperture a turnkey shoved in the man's breakfast without a word like one flinging guts to a bear scott and on the sociable tom attempting to say a civil word to him drew the trap sharply back and hermetically sealed the aperture with a snap the breakfast was in a round tin with two compartments one pint of gruel and six ounces of bread these two phases of farina were familiar to mr robinson he ate the bread and drank the gruel adding a good deal of salt at nine the chapel bell rang robinson was glad not that he admired the liturgy but he said to himself now i shall see a face or two perhaps some old pals to his dismay the warder who opened his cell bade him at the same time put on the prison cap with the peak down and when he and the other male prisoners were mustered in the corridor he found them all like himself vizor down eyes glittering like basilisks' or cats' through two holes features undistinguishable the word was given to march in perfect silence five paces apart to the chapel the sullen pageant started i've heard of this but who'd have thought they carried the game so far well i must wait till we are in chapel and pick up a pal by the voice while the parson is doing his patter on reaching the chapel he found to his dismay that the chapel was as cellular as any other part of the prison it was an agglomeration of one hundred sentry boxes open only on the side facing the clergyman and even there only from the prisoner's third button upward warders stood on raised platforms and pointed out his sentry box to each prisoner with very long slender wands the prisoner went into it and pulled the door it shut with a spring and next took his badge or number from his neck and hung it up on a nail above his head in the sentry box between the reading desk and the male prisoners was a small area where the debtors sat together the female prisoners were behind a thick veil of close lattice work service concluded the governor began to turn a wheel in his pew this wheel exhibited to the congregation a number the convict whose number corresponded instantly took down his badge the sight and position of which had determined the governor in working his wheel drew the peak of his cap over his face and went out and waited in the lobby when all the sentry boxes were thus emptied dead march of the whole party back to the main building here the warders separated them and sent them dead silent vizors down some to clean the prison some to their cells some to hard labor and some to an airing in the yard robinson was to be aired hurrah thought sociable tom alas he found the system in the yard as well as in the chapel the promenade was a number of passages radiating from a common center the sides of passage were thick walls entrance to passage an iron gate locked behind the promenader an officer remained on the watch the whole time to see that a word did not creep out or in through one of the gates and this they call out of doors grunted robinson after an hour's promenade he was taken into his cell where at twelve the trap in his door was opened and his dinner shoved in and the trap snapped to again all in three seconds a very good dinner better than paupers always get three ounces of meat no bone eight ounces of potatoes and eight ounces of bread after dinner three weary hours without an incident at about three o'clock one of the warders opened his cell door and put his head in and swiftly withdrew it three more monotonous hours and then supper one pint of gruel and eight ounces of bread he ate it as slowly as he could to eke out a few minutes in the heavy day quarter before eight a bell to go to bed at eight the warders came round and saw that all the prisoners were in bed the next day the same thing and the next ditto with this exception that one of the warders came into his cell and minutely examined it in dead silence the fourth day the chaplain visited him asked him a few questions repeated a few sentences on the moral responsibility of every human being and set him some texts of scripture to learn by heart this visit though merely one of routine broke the thief's dead silence and solitude and he would have been thankful to have a visit every day from the chaplain whose manner was formal but not surly and forbidding like the turnkeys or warders next day the governor of the jail came suddenly into the cell and put to robinson several questions which he answered with great affability then turning on his heel said bruskly have you anything to say to me yes sir if you please out with it then my man said the governor impatiently sir i was condemned to hard labor now i wanted to ask you when my hard labor is to begin because i have not been put upon anything yet we are kinder to you than the judges then it seems yes sir but i am not naturally lazy and a little hard work would amuse you just now indeed sir i think it would i am very much depressed in spirits you will be worse before you are better heaven forbid i think if you don't give me something to do i shall go out of my mind soon sir that is what they all say you will be put on hard labor i promise you but not when it suits you we'll choose the time and the governor went out with a knowing smile upon his face the thief sat himself down disconsolately and the heavy hours like leaden waves seemed to rise and rise and roll over his head and suffocate him and weigh him down down down to bottomless despair at length about the tenth day this human being's desire to exchange a friendly word with some other human creature became so strong that in the chapel during service he scratched the door of his sentry box and whispered mate whisper me a word for pity's sake he received no answer but even to have spoken himself relieved his swelling soul for a minute or two half an hour later four turnkeys came into his cell and took him down stairs and confined him in a pitch dark dungeon the prisoner whose attention he had tried to attract in chapel had told to curry favor and was reported favorably for the same the darkness in which robinson now lay was not like the darkness of our bedrooms at night in which the outlines of objects are more or less visible it was the frightful darkness that chilled and crushed the egyptians soul and body it was a darkness that might be felt this terrible and unnatural privation of all light is very trying to all god's creatures to none more so than to man and among men it is most dangerous and distressing to those who have imagination and excitability now robinson was a man of this class a man of rare capacity full of talent and the courage and energy that vent themselves in action but not rich in the tough fortitude which does little feels little and bears much when they took him out of the black hole after six hours' confinement he was observed to be white as a sheet and to tremble violently all over and in this state at the word of command he crept back all the way to his cell his hand to his eyes that were dazzled by what seemed to him bright daylight his body shaking while every now and then a loud convulsive sob burst from his bosom the governor happened to be on the corridor looking down over the rails as robinson passed him he said to him with a victorious sneer you won't be refractory in chapel again in a hurry no said the thief in a low gentle voice despairingly the day after robinson was put in the black hole the surgeon came his rounds he found him in a corner of his cell with his eyes fixed on the floor the man took no notice of his entrance the surgeon went up to him and shook him rather roughly robinson raised his heavy eyes and looked stupidly at him the surgeon laid hold of him and placing a thumb on each side of his eye inspected that organ fully he then felt his pulse this done he went out with the warder making his report to the governor he came in turn to robinson no is sinking oh is he fry turning to a warder what has 's treatment been been in his cell sir without labor since he came blackhole yesterday for communicating in chapel what is the matter with him doctor says he is sinking what the devil do you mean by his sinking well sir replied the surgeon with a sort of dry deference he is dying that is what i mean oh he is dying is he d n him we'll stop that here fry take no out into the garden and set him to work and put him on the corridors to morrow is he to be let talk to us sir humph yes robinson was taken out into the garden it was a small piece of ground that had once been a yard it was inclosed within walls of great height and to us would have seemed a cheerless place for horticulture but to robinson it appeared the garden of eden he gave a sigh of relief and pleasure but the next moment his countenance fell they won't let me stay here fry took him into the center of the garden and put a spade into his hand now you dig this piece said he in his dry unfriendly tone and if you have time cut the edges of this grass path square the words were scarcely out of his mouth before robinson drove the spade into the soil with all the energy of one of god's creatures escaping from system back to nature fry left him in the garden after making him pull down his vizor for there was one more prisoner working at some distance robinson set to with energy and dug for the bare life it was a sort of work he knew very little about and a gardener would have been disgusted at his ridges but he threw his whole soul into it and very soon had nearly completed his task having been confined so long without exercise his breath was short and he perspired profusely but he did not care for that oh how sweet this is after being buried alive cried he and in went the spade again presently he was seized with a strong desire to try the other part of his task the more so as it required more skill and presented a difficulty to overcome a part of the path had been shaved and the knippers lay where they had been last used robinson inspected the recent work with an intelligent eye and soon discovered traces of a white line on one side of the path that served as a guide to the knippers oh i must draw a straight line said robinson out loud indulging himself with the sound of a human voice but how can you tell me that he inquired of a gooseberry bush that grew near the words were hardly out of his mouth before peering about in every direction he discovered an iron spike with some cord wrapped round it and not far off a piece of chalk he pounced on them and fastening the spike at the edge of the path attempted to draw a line with the chalk using the string as a ruler not succeeding he reflected a little and the result was that he chalked several feet of the line all round until it was all white then with the help of a stake which he took for his other terminus he got the chalked string into a straight line just above the edge of the grass next pressing it tightly down with his foot he effected a white line on the grass he now removed the string took the knippers and following his white line trimmed the path secundum artem there said robinson to the gooseberry bush but not very loud for fear of being heard and punished i wonder whether that is how the gardeners do it i think it must be he viewed his work with satisfaction then went back to his digging and as he put the finishing stroke fry came to bring him back to his cell it was bedtime i never worked in a garden before began robinson so it is not so well done as it might be but if i was to come every day for a week i think i could master it i did not know there was a garden in this prison if ever i build a prison there shall be a garden in it as big as belgrave square you are precious fond of the sound of your own voice no said fry dryly we are not forbidden to speak to the warders are we not at proper times he threw open cell door and robinson entered before he could close the door robinson said good night and thank you g'night snarled fry sullenly as one shamed against his will into a civility robinson lay awake half the night and awoke the next morning rather feverish and stiff but not the leaden thing he was the day before a feather turns a balanced scale this man's life and reason had been engaged in a drawn battle with three mortal enemies solitude silence and privation of all employment that little bit of labor and wholesome thought whose paltry and childish details i half blush to have given you were yet due to my story for they took a man out of himself checked the self devouring process and helped elastic nature to recover herself this bout the next day robinson was employed washing the prison the next he got two hours in the garden again and the next the trades' master was sent into his cell to teach him how to make scrubbing brushes the man sat down and was commencing a discourse when robinson interrupted him politely sir let me see you work and watch me try to do the same and correct me with all my heart said the trades' master he remained about half an hour with his pupil and when he went out he said to one of the turnkeys there is a chap in there that can pick up a handicraft as a pigeon picks up peas the next day the surgeon happened to look in he found robinson as busy as a bee making brushes pulled his eye open again felt his pulse and wrote something down in his memorandum book he left directions with the turnkey that no should be kept employed with the governor's permission robinson's hands were now full he made brushes and every day put some of them to the test upon the floor and walls of the building it happened one day as he was doing housemaid in corridor b that he suddenly heard unwonted sounds issue from a part of the premises into which he had not yet been introduced the yard devoted to hard labor first he heard a single voice shouting that did not last long then a dead silence then several voices among which his quick ear recognized fry's and the governor's he could see nothing the sounds came from one of the hard labor cells robinson was surprised and puzzled what were these sounds that broke the silence of the living tomb an instinct told him it was no use asking a turnkey so he devoured his curiosity and surprise as best he might the very next day about the same hour both were again excited by noises from the same quarter equally unintelligible he heard a great noise of water slashed in bucketsful against a wall and this was followed by a sort of gurgling that seemed to him to come from a human throat this latter however was almost drowned in an exulting chuckle of several persons among whom he caught the tones of a turnkey called hodges and of the governor himself robinson puzzled and puzzled himself but could not understand these curious sounds and he could see nothing except a quantity of water running out of one of the labor cells and coursing along till it escaped by one of the two gutters that drained the yard often and often robinson meditated on this and exerted all his ingenuity to conceive what it meant his previous jail experience afforded him no clew and as he was one of those who hate to be in the dark about anything this new riddle tortured him however the prison was generally so dead dumb and gloomy that upon two such cheerful events as water splashing and creatures laughing he could not help crowing a little out of sympathy without knowing why the next day as robinson was working in the corridor the governor came in with a gentleman whom he treated with unusual and marked respect this gentleman was the chairman of the quarter sessions and one of those magistrates who had favored the adoption of the present system mr williams inspected the prison was justly pleased with its exquisite cleanness he questioned the governor as to the health of the prisoners and received for answer that most of them were well but that there were some exceptions this appeared to satisfy him he went into the labor yard looked at the cranks examined the numbers printed on each in order to learn their respective weights and see that the prisoners were not overburdened went with the governor into three or four cells and asked the prisoners if they had any complaint to make the unanimous answer was no he then complimented the governor and drove home to his own house ashtown park there after dinner he said to a brother magistrate i inspected the jail to day was all over it the next morning fry the morose came into robinson's cell with a more cheerful countenance than usual robinson noticed it you are put on the crank said fry oh am i of course you are your sentence was hard labor wasn't it i don't know why you weren't sent on a fortnight ago fry then took him out into the labor yard which he found perforated with cells about half the size of his hermitage in the corridor in each of these little quiet grottoes lurked a monster called a crank a crank is a machine of this sort there springs out of a vertical post an iron handle which the workman taking it by both hands works round and round as in some country places you may have seen the villagers draw a bucket up from a well the iron handle goes at the shoulder into a small iron box at the top of the post and inside that box the resistance to the turner is regulated by the manufacturer who states the value of the resistance outside in cast iron letters thus lb crank lb crank etc etc eighteen hundred revolutions per hour said mr fry in his voice of routine and you are to work two hours before dinner so saying he left him and robinson with the fear of punishment before him lost not a moment in getting to work he found the crank go easy enough at first but the longer he was at it the stiffer it seemed to turn and after about four hundred turns he was fain to breathe and rest himself he took three minutes' rest then at it again all this time there was no taskmaster as in egypt nor whipper up of declining sable energy as in old kentucky so that if i am so fortunate as to have a reader aged ten he is wondering why the fool did not confine his exertions to saying he had made the turns my dear it would not do though no mortal oversaw the thief at his task the eye of science was in that cell and watched every stroke and her inexorable finger marked it down in plain english on the face of the machine was a thing like a chronometer with numbers set all round and a hand which somehow or other always pointed to the exact number of turns the thief had made the crank was an autometer or self measurer and in that respect your superior and mine my little drake this was robinson's first acquaintance with the crank the tread wheel had been the mode in his time so by the time he had made three thousand turns he was rather exhausted he leaned upon the iron handle and sadly regretted his garden and his brushes but fear and dire necessity were upon him he set to his task and to work again i won't look at the meter again for it always tells me less than i expect i'll just plow on till that beggar comes i know he will come to the minute sadly and doggedly he turned the iron handle and turned and turned again and then he panted and rested a minute and then doggedly to his idle toil again he was now so fatigued that his head seemed to have come loose he could not hold it up and it went round and round and round with the crank handle hence it was that mr fry stood at the mouth of the den without the other seeing him halt said fry robinson looked up and there was the turnkey inspecting him with a discontented air i'm done thought robinson here he is as black as thunder the number not right no doubt what are ye at growled fry you are forty over and the said fry looked not only ill used but a little unhappy robinson's good behavior had disappointed the poor soul this fry was a grim oddity he experienced a feeble complacency when things went wrong but never else the thief exulted and was taken back to his cell dinner came almost immediately four ounces of meat instead of three two ounces less bread but a large access of potatoes which more than balanced the account the next day robinson was put on the crank again but not till the afternoon he had finished about half his task when he heard at some little distance from him a faint moaning his first impulse was to run out of his cell and see what was the matter but hodges and fry were both in the yard and he knew that they would report him for punishment upon the least breach of discipline so he turned and turned the crank with these moans ringing in his ears and perplexing his soul finding they did not cease he peeped cautiously into the yard and there he saw the governor himself as well as hodges and fry all three were standing close to the place whence these groans issued and with an air of complete unconcern but presently the groans ceased and then mysteriously enough the little group of disciplinarians threw off their apathy hodges and fry went hastily to the pump with buckets which they filled and then came back to the governor the next minute robinson heard water dashed repeatedly against the walls of the cell and then the governor laughed and hodges laughed and even the gloomy fry vented a brief grim chuckle and now robinson quivered with curiosity as he turned his crank but there was no means of gratifying it it so happened however that some ten minutes later the governor sent hodges and fry to another part of the prison and they had not been gone long before a message came to himself on which he went hastily out and the yard was left empty robinson's curiosity had reached such a pitch that notwithstanding the risk he ran for he knew the governor would send back to the yard the very first disengaged officer he met he could not stay quiet as the governor closed the gate he ran with all speed to the cell he darted in and then the thief saw what made the three honest men laugh so he saw it and started back with a cry of dismay for the sight chilled the felon to the bone a lad about fifteen years of age was pinned against the wall in agony by a leathern belt passed round his shoulders and drawn violently round two staples in the wall his arms were jammed against his sides by a straight waistcoat fastened with straps behind and those straps drawn with the utmost severity but this was not all a high leathern collar a quarter of an inch thick squeezed his throat in its iron grasp his hair and his clothes were drenched with water which had been thrown in bucketsful over him and now dripped from him on the floor his face was white his lips livid his eyes were nearly glazed and his teeth chattered with cold and pain a more unprincipled man than robinson did not exist but burglary and larceny do not extinguish humanity in a thinking rascal as resigning the soul to system can extinguish it in a dull dog oh what is this cried robinson what are the villains doing to you he received no answer but the boy's eyes opened wide and he turned those glazing eyes the only part of his body he could turn toward the speaker robinson ran up to him and began to try and loosen him at this the boy cried out almost screaming with terror let me alone let me alone they'll give it me worse if you do and they'll serve you out too but you will die boy look at his poor lips no no no i shan't die no such luck cried the boy impatiently and wildly thank you for speaking kind to me who are you tell me quick and go i am josephs no corridor a i am robinson no corridor b good bye robinson i shan't forget you hark the door go go go go go robinson was already gone he had fled at the first click of a key in the outward door and darted into his cell at the moment fry got into the yard an instinct of suspicion led this man straight to robinson's hermitage he found him hard at work fry scrutinized his countenance but robinson was too good an actor to betray himself only when fry passed on he drew a long breath what he had seen surprised as well as alarmed him for he had always been told the new system discouraged personal violence of all sorts and in all his experience of the old jails he had never seen a prisoner abused so savagely as the young martyr in the adjoining cell his own work done he left for his own dormitory he was uneasy and his heart was heavy for poor josephs but he dared not even cast a look toward his place of torture for the other executioners had returned and fry followed grim at his heels like a mastiff dogging a stranger out of the premises that evening robinson spent in gloomy reflections and forebodings i wish i was in the hulks or anywhere out of this place said he as for josephs the governor after inspecting his torture for a few minutes left the yard again with his subordinates and josephs was left alone with his great torture for two hours more then hodges came in and began to loose him swearing at him all the time for a little rebellious monkey that gave more trouble than enough the rebellious monkey made no answer but crawled slowly away to his dungeon shivering in his drenched clothes stiff and sore his bones full of pain his heart full of despondency robinson had now eight thousand turns of the crank per day and very hard work he found it but he preferred it to being buried alive all day in his cell and warned by josephs' fate he went at the crank with all his soul and never gave them an excuse for calling him refractory it happened however one day just after breakfast that he was taken with a headache and shivering and not getting better after chapel but rather worse he rang his bell and begged to see the surgeon the surgeon ought to have been in the jail at this hour he was not though and as he had been the day before and was accustomed to neglect the prisoners for any one who paid better he was not expected this day soon after fry came to the cell and ordered robinson out to the crank robinson told him he was too ill to work i must have the surgeon's authority for that before i listen to it replied fry amateur of routine but he is not in the jail or you would have it then he ought to be well is it my fault he's shirking his duty send for him and you'll see he will tell you i am not fit for the crank to day my head is splitting come no gammon no it is the crank or the jacket or else the black hole so take which you like best robinson rose with a groan of pain and despondency it is only eight thousand words you have got to say to it and they are not many for such a tongue as yours at the end of the time fry came to the mouth of the labor cell with a grim chuckle he will never have done his number this time he found robinson kneeling on the ground almost insensible the crank handle convulsively grasped in his hands fry's first glance was at this figure that a painter might have taken for a picture of labor overtasked but this was neither new nor interesting to fry he went eagerly to examine the meter of the crank there lay his heart such as it was and to his sorrow he found that no had done his work before he broke down what it cost the poor fever stricken wretch to do it can easier be imagined than described they assisted robinson to his cell and that night he was in a burning fever the next day the surgeon happened by some accident to be at his post and prescribed change of diet and medicines for him he would be better in the infirmary why said the governor more air nonsense there is plenty of air here there is a constant stream of air comes in through this and he pointed to a revolving cylinder in the window constructed for that purpose you give him the right stuff doctor said hawes jocosely and he won't slip his wind this time the surgeon acquiesced according to custom it was not for him to contradict hawes who allowed him to attend the jail or neglect it according to his convenience i e to come three or four times a week at different hours instead of twice every day at fixed hours it was two days after this that the governor saw hodges come out of a cell laughing what are ye grinning at said he in his amiable way no is light headed sir and i have been listening to him it would make a cat laugh said hodges apologetically he knew well enough the governor did not approve of laughing in the jail the governor said nothing but made a motion with his hand and hodges opened cell and they both went in no lay on his back flushed and restless with his eyes fixed on vacancy he was talking incessantly and without sequence i should fail signally were i to attempt to transfer his words to paper i feel my weakness and the strength of others who in my day have shown a singular power of fixing on paper the volatile particles of frenzy however in a word the poor thief was talking as our poetasters write and amid his gunpowder daffodils bosh and other constellations there mingled gleams of sense and feeling that would have made you and me very sad he often recurred to a girl he called mary and said a few gentle words to her then off again into the wildest flights while mr hawes and his myrmidons were laughing at him he suddenly fixed his eyes on some imaginary figure on the opposite wall and began to cry out loudly take him down don't you see you are killing him the collar is choking him see how white he is his eyes stare the boy will die murder murder murder i can't bear to see him die and with these words he buried his head in the bedclothes mr hawes looked at mr fry mr fry answered the look he must have seen josephs the other day ay he is mighty curious well when he gets well and shaking his fist at the sufferer mr hawes went out of the cell soon after chapter xi what is your report about no doctor the fever is gone he is well then he is well of the fever but a fever leaves the patient in a state of debility for some days i have ordered him meat twice a day that is meat once and soup once then you report him cured of his fever certainly hodges put no on the crank yes sir even the surgeon opened his eyes at this why he is as weak as a child said he will it kill him certainly not and for the best of all reasons he can't possibly do it you don't know what these fellows can do when they are forced the surgeon shrugged his shoulders and passed on to his other patients robinson was taken out into the yard what a blessing the fresh air is said he gulping in the atmosphere of the yard i should have got well long ago if i had not been stifled in my cell for want of room and air robinson went to the crank in good spirits he did not know how weak he was till he began to work but he soon found out he could not do the task in the time he thought therefore the wisest plan would be not to exhaust himself in vain efforts and he sat quietly down and did nothing in this posture he was found by hawes and his myrmidons what are you doing there not working sir i am only just getting well of a fever and i am as weak as water and that is why you are not trying to do anything eh i have tried sir and it is impossible i am not fit to turn this heavy crank well then i must try if i can't make you fetch the jacket oh for heaven's sake don't torture me sir there is nobody more willing to work than i am and if you will but give me a day or two to get my strength after the fever you shall see how i will work there there your palaver strap him up he was in no condition to resist and moreover knew resistance was useless they jammed him in the jacket pinned him tight to the wall and throttled him in the collar this collar by a refinement of cruelty was made with unbound edges so that when the victim exhausted with the cruel cramp that racked his aching bones in the fierce gripe of hawes's infernal machine sunk his heavy head and drooped his chin the jagged collar sawed him directly and lacerating the flesh drove him away from even this miserable approach to ease robinson had formed no idea of the torture the victims of the inquisition would have gained but little by becoming the victims of the separate and silent system in jail they left the poor fellow pinned to the wall jammed in the strait waistcoat and throttled in the round saw weakened by fever and unnatural exertion he succumbed sooner than the inquisitors had calculated upon the next time they came into the yard they found him black in the face his lips livid insensible throttled and dying another half minute and there would have hung a corpse in the hawes pillory when they saw how nearly he was gone they were all at him together one unclasped the saw collar one unbraced the waistcoat another sprinkled water over him not a bucketful this time because they would have wetted themselves released from the infernal machine the body of no fell like a lump of clay upon the men who had reduced him to this condition then these worthies were in some little trepidation for though they had caused the death of many men during the last two years they had not yet as it happened murdered a single one on the spot openly and honestly like this and they feared they might get into trouble adjoining the yard was a bath room to this they carried no they stripped him and let the water run upon him from the cock but he did not come to then they scrubbed him just as they would a brick floor with a hard brush upon the back till his flesh was as red as blood with this and the water together he began to gasp and sigh and faintly come back from insensibility to a new set of tortures but so long was the struggle between life and death that these men of business detained thus unconscionably about a single thief lost all patience with him one scrubbed him till the blood came under the bristles another seized him by the hair of his head and jerked his head violently back several times and this gave him such pain that he began to struggle instinctively and the blood now fairly set in motion he soon moved the last thing he remembered was a body full of aching bones the first he awoke to was the sensation of being flayed alive from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot the first word he heard was put his clothes on his shamming carcass shall we dry him sir dry him roared the governor with an oath no hasn't he given us trouble enough another oath they flung his clothes upon his red hot dripping skin and hodges gave him a brutal push go to your cell robinson crawled off often wincing and trying in vain to keep his clothes from rubbing those parts of his person where they had scrubbed the skin off him hawes eyed him with grim superiority suddenly he had an inspiration come back shouted he i never was beat by a prisoner yet and i never will strap him up at this command even the turnkeys looked amazed at one another and hesitated then the governor swore horribly at them and hodges without another word went for the jacket they took hold of him he made no resistance he never even looked at them he never took his eye off hawes on him his eye fastened like a basilisk they took him away and pinioned jammed and throttled him to the wall again hodges was set to watch him and a bucket of water near to throw over him should he show the least sign of shamming again in an hour another turnkey came and relieved hodges in another hour fry relieved him for this was tiresome work for a poor turnkey in another hour a new hand relieved fry but nobody relieved no five mortal hours had he been in the vice without shamming the pain his skin suffered from the late remedies and the deadly rage at his heart gave him unnatural powers of resistance but at last the infernal machine conquered and he began to turn dead faint then hodges his sentinel at the time caught up the bucket and dashed the whole contents over him the effect was magical the shock took away his breath for a moment but the next the blood seemed to glow with fire in his veins and he felt a general access of vigor to bear his torture when this man had been six hours in the vise the governor and his myrmidons came into the yard and unstrapped him you did not beat me you see after all said the governor to no the turnkeys heard and revered their chief no looked him full in the face with an eye glittering like a saber but said no word sulky brute cried the governor lock him up oath and that evening as a warder was rolling the prisoners' supper along the little natural railway made by the two railings of corridor b the governor stepped the carriage and asked for 's tin it was given him and he abstracted one half of the man's gruel refractory in the yard to day but i'll break him before i've done with him oath the next day brushes were wanted for the jail this saved robinson for that day it was little josephs' turn to suffer the governor put him on a favorite crank of his and gave him eight thousand turns to do in four hours and a half he knew the boy could not do it and this was only a formula he went through previous to pillorying the lad josephs had been in the pillory about an hour when it so happened that the reverend john jones the chaplain of the jail came into the yard seeing a group of warders at the mouth of the labor cell he walked up to them and there was josephs in peine forte et dure what is this lad's offense inquired mr jones refractory at the crank was the reply why josephs said the reverend gentleman you told me you would always do your best so i do your reverence gasped josephs but this crank is too heavy for a lad like me and that is why i am put on it to get punished hold your tongue said hodges roughly why is he to hold his tongue mr hodges said the chaplain quietly how is he to answer my question if he holds his tongue you forget yourself ugh beg your pardon sir but this one has always got some excuse or other what is the matter roared a rough voice behind the speakers this was hawes who had approached them unobserved he is gammoning his reverence sir that is all what has he been saying that the crank is too heavy for him sir and the waistcoat is strapped too tight it seems who says so i think so mr hawes will you take a bit of advice sir if you wish a prisoner well don't you come between him and me it will always be the worse for him for i am master here and master i will be mr hawes replied the chaplain i have never done or said anything in the prison to lessen your authority but privately i must remonstrate against the uncommon severities practiced upon prisoners in this jail if you will listen to me i shall be much obliged to you if not i am afraid i must as a matter of conscience call the attention of the visiting justices to the question well parson the justices will be in the jail to day you tell them your story and i will tell them mine said hawes with a cool air of defiance sure enough at five o'clock in the afternoon two of the visiting justices arrived accompanied by mr wright a young magistrate they were met at the door by hawes who wore a look of delight at their appearance they went round the prison with him while he detained them in the center of the building till he had sent hodges secretly to undo josephs and set him on the crank and here the party found him at work you have been a long time on the crank my lad said hawes you may go to your cell josephs touched his cap to the governor and the gentlemen and went off that is a nice quiet looking boy said one of the justices what is he in for he is in this time for stealing a piece of beef out of a butcher's shop this time what is he a hardened offender he does not look it he has been three times in prison once for throwing stones once for orchard robbing and this time for the beef what a young villain at his age don't say that williams said mr wright dryly you and i were just as great villains at his age didn't we throw stones rather hawes laughed in an adulatory manner but observing that mr williams who was a grave pompous personage did not smile at all he added but not to do mischief like this one i'll be bound no said mr williams with an air of ruffled dignity no cried the other where is your memory why we threw stones at everything and everybody and i suppose we did not always miss eh i remember your throwing a stone through the window of a place of worship this was a school fellow of mine and led me into all sorts of wickedness i say was it a wesleyan shop williams or a baptist for i forget never mind you had a fit of orthodoxy what was the young villain's second offense robbing an orchard sir the scoundrel robbing an orchard oh what sweet reminiscences those words recall i say williams do you remember us two robbing farmer harris's orchard i remember your robbing it and my character suffering for it i don't remember that but i remember my climbing the pear tree and flinging the pears down and finding them all grabbed on my descent what is the young villain's next oh snapping a piece off a counter ah we never did that because we could always get it without stealing it with this mr wright strolled away from the others having had what the jocose wretch used to call a slap at humbug his absence was a relief to the others these did not come there to utter sense in fun but to jest in sober earnest mr williams hinted as much and hawes whose cue it was to assent in everything to the justices brightened his face up at the remark will you visit the cells gentlemen said he with an accent of cordial invitation or inspect the book first they gave precedence to the latter by the book was meant the log book of the jail in it the governor was required to report for the justices and the home office all jail events a little out of the usual routine for instance all punishments of prisoners all considerable sicknesses deaths and their supposed causes etc etc this josephs seems by the book to be an ill conditioned fellow he is often down for punishment yes he hates work about gillies sir ringing his bell and pretending it was an accident yes how old is he thirteen is this his first offense not by a good many i think gentlemen if you were to order him a flogging it would be better for him in the end well give him twenty lashes eh palmer mr palmer assented by a nod i beg your pardon sir said hawes but will you allow me to make a remark certainly mr hawes certainly i find twenty lashes all at once rather too much for a lad of that age now if you would allow me to divide the punishment into two so that his health might not be endangered by it then we could give him ten or even twelve and after a day or two as many more that speaks well for your humanity mr hawes your zeal we have long known augh sir sir i will sign the order and we authorize you here to divide the punishment according to your own suggestion order signed the justices then went round the cells accompanied by hawes they went into the cells with an expression of a little curiosity but more repugnance on their faces and asked several prisoners if they were well and contented the men looked with the shrewdness of their class into their visitors' faces and measured them saw there first a feeble understanding secondly an adamantine prejudice saw that in those eyes they were wild beasts and hawes an angel and answered to please hawes whose eye was fixed on them all this time and in whose power they felt they were all expressed their content some in tones so languid and empty of heart that none but justice shallow could have helped seeing through the humbug others did it better and not a few overdid it so that any but justice shallow would have seen through them these last told messrs shallow and slender that the best thing that ever happened to them was coming to jail they thanked heaven they had been pulled up short in an evil career that must have ended in their ruin body and soul as for their present situation they were never happier in their lives and some of them doubted much whether when they should reach the penal settlements the access of liberty would repay them for the increased temptations and the loss of quiet meditation and self communion and the good advice of mr hawes and of his reverence the chaplain the jail birds who piped this tune were without a single exception the desperate cases of this moral hospital they were old offenders hardened scoundrels who meant to rob and kill and deceive to their dying day while in prison their game was to be as comfortable as they could hawes could make them uncomfortable he was always there under these circumstances to lie came on the instant as natural to them as to rob would have come had some power transported them outside the prison doors with these words of penitence on their lips they asked where that josephs' cell was hawes took them to him they inspected him with a profound zoological look to see whether it was more wolf or badger strange to say it looked neither but a simple quiet youth of the human genus species snob he is very small to be a ruffian said mr palmer i am sorry josephs said mr williams pompously to find your name so often down for punishment josephs looked up hoping to see the light of sympathy in this speaker's eyes he saw two owls' faces attempting eagle but not reaching up to sparrow hawk and he was silent he had no hope of being believed moreover the grim eye of hawes rested on him and no feebleness in it messrs shallow and slender receiving no answer from josephs who was afraid to tell the truth were nettled and left the cell shrugging their shoulders in the corridor they met the train just coming along the banisters with supper pompous mr williams tasted the prison diet on the spot it is excellent cried he why the gruel is like glue and he fell into a meditation so far everything is as we could wish mr hawes and it speaks well for the discipline and for yourself hawes bowed with a gratified air i will complete the inspection to morrow hawes accompanied the gentlemen to the outside gate here mr williams turned for the last minute or two he had been in the throes of an idea and now he delivered himself of it it would be well if josephs' gruel were not made so strong for him mr williams was not one of those who often say a great thing but this deserves immortality and could i confer immortality this of williams' should never die unlike most of the things we say it does not deserve ever to die it would be well if josephs' gruel were not made so strong for him chapter xii will you eat your mutton with me to day palmer said mr williams at the gate of the jail i should be very happy but i am engaged to dine with the lord lieutenant so mr williams drove home to ashtown park and had to sit down to dinner with his own small family party mr williams' mutton consisted of first a little strong gravy soup lubricated and gelatinized with a little tapioca vis a vis the soup a little piece of salmon cut out of the fish's center lobster patties rissoles and two things with french names stinking of garlic on the flank enter a boiled turkey poult with delicate white sauce a nice tongue not too green nor too salt and a small saddle of six tooth mutton home bred home fed after this a stewed pigeon faced by greengage tart and some yellow cream twenty four hours old item an iced pudding a little stilton cheese brought up the rear with a nice salad this made way for a foolish trifling dessert of muscatel grapes guava jelly and divers kickshaws diluted with agreeable wines varied by a little glass of marasquino co at junctures so far so nice but alas nothing is complete in this world not even the dinner of a fair round justice with fat capon lined there is always some drawback or deficiency here below confound it the wretch of a cook had forgotten to send up the gruel a la josephs next day after mr williams had visited the female prisoners and complimented hawes on having initiated them into the art of silence he asked where the chaplain was hawes instantly dispatched a messenger to inquire and remembering that gentleman's threatened remonstrance parried him by anticipation thus by the by sir i have a little complaint to make of him indeed said mr williams what is that he took a prisoner's part against the discipline but he doesn't know them and they humbug him but sir ought he to preach against me in the chapel of the jail certainly not surely he has not been guilty of such a breach of discipline and good taste oh but wait sir said hawes hear the whole truth and then perhaps you will blame me you must know sir that i sometimes let out an oath i was in the army and we used all to swear there and now a little of it sticks to me in spite of my teeth and if his reverence had done me the honor to take me to task privately about it i would have taken off my hat to him but it is another thing to go and preach at me for it before all the jail of course it is do you mean to say he did that he did sir of course he did not mention my name but he preached five and thirty minutes all about swearing and they all knew who he was hitting i could see the warders grinning from ear to ear as much as to say 'there's another rap for you governor' i'll speak to him thank you sir don't be hard on him for he is a deserving officer but if you would give him a quiet hint not to interfere with me we have all of us plenty to do of our own in a jail if he could but see it ah here comes the chaplain sir i will leave you together if you please and mr hawes made off with a business air the chaplain came up and bowed to mr williams who saluted him in turn somewhat coldly there was a short silence mr williams was concocting a dignified rebuke before he could get it out the chaplain began i wished to speak with you yesterday sir i am at your service mr jones what is it i want you to look into our punishments they are far more numerous and severe than they used to be on the contrary i find them less numerous why there is one punished every day i have been carefully over the books and i assure you there is a marked decrease in the number of punishments then they cannot be all put down nonsense mr jones nonsense and then the severity of these punishments sir is it your wish that a prisoner should be strapped in the jacket so tight that we cannot get a finger between the leather and his flesh not unless he is refractory but prisoners are very seldom refractory indeed that is news to me i assure you sir there are no quieter set of men than prisoners generally they know there is nothing to be gained by resistance they are on their good behavior before you you don't see through them my good sir they are like madmen you would take them for lambs till they break out do you know a prisoner here called josephs yes sir perfectly well well now what is his character may i ask he is a mild quiet docile lad ha ha ha i thought so prisoners are the refuse of the earth the governor knows them and how to manage them a discretion must be allowed him and i see no reason to interfere between him and refractory prisoners except when he invites us you are aware that several attempts at suicide have been made within the last few months sham attempts yes one was not sham sir said mr jones gravely oh jackson you mean no but he was a lunatic and would have made away with himself anywhere hawes is convinced of that well sir i have told you the fact i have remonstrated against the uncommon seventies practiced in this jail seventies unknown in captain o'connor's day and i have received and answered your remonstrance sir and there that matter ought to end this and the haughty tone with which it was said discouraged and nettled the chaplain he turned red and said in that case sir i have no more to say i have discharged my conscience with these words he was about to withdraw but mr williams stopped him mr jones do you consider a clergyman justified in preaching at people certainly not the pulpit surely ought not to be made a handle for personality it is not the way to make the pulpit itself respected i don't understand you sir mr hawes is much hurt at a sermon you preached against him a sermon against him never i beg your pardon you preached a whole sermon against swearing and he swears oh yes i remember the sunday before last i certainly did reprobate in my discourse the habit of swearing but no personality to hawes was intended no personality intended when you know he swears yes but the warders swear too why should mr hawes take it all to himself oh if the turnkeys swear then it was not so strictly personal to be sure put in mr jones inadvertently i believe they learned it of the governor there you see well and even if they did not why preach against the turnkeys why preach at any individuals or upon passing events at all i can remember the time no clergyman throughout the length and breadth of the land noticed passing events from the pulpit i am as far from approving the practice as you are sir in those days the clergy and the laity respected one another and there was peace in the church i can only repeat sir that i agree with you the pulpit should be consecrated to eternal truths not passing events good very good well then what mr hawes complains of was a mere accident an accident mr jones oh mr jones an accident which i undertake to explain to mr hawes himself by all means that will be the best way of making friends again i need not tell you that a jail could not go on in which the governor and the chaplain did not pull together the fact is mr jones the clergy of late have been assuming a little too much and that has made the laity a little jealous now although you are a clergyman you are her majesty's servant so long as you are here and must co operate with the general system of the jail come sir you are younger than i am let me give you a piece of advice 'don't overstep your duty' etc in this strain mr williams buz buz buzzed longer than i can afford him paper it is so dear he pumped a stream of time honored phrases on his hearer and dissolved away with him as the overflow of a pump carries away a straw on its shallow stream down a stable yard when the pump was pumped dry he stopped then the chaplain who had listened with singular politeness got in a word you forget sir i have resigned the chaplaincy of the jail oh ah yes well then i need say no more good day mr jones good morning sir soon after this up came hawes with a cheerful countenance well parson are you to manage the prisoners and i to preach to them or are we to go on as we are things are to go on as they are mr hawes but that is nothing to me i have discharged my conscience i have remonstrated against the seventies practiced on our prisoners cold water has been thrown on my remonstrances and i shall therefore interfere no more that is the wise way to look at it you may depend we shall see which was in the right i have discharged my conscience but mr hawes i am hurt you should say i preached a sermon against you i dare say you are sir but who began it if you had not talked of complaining to the justices of me i should never have said a word against you that is all settled but it is due to my character to show you that i had no intention of pointing at you or any living creature from the pulpit well make me believe that if you will do me the favor to come to my room i can prove it to you the chaplain took the governor to his room and opened two drawers in a massive table mr hawes said he do you see this pile of sermons in this right hand drawer i see them said hawes with a doleful air and i suppose i shall hear some of them before long these said mr jones smiling with perfect good humor at the innocuous sneer are sermons i composed when i was curate of little stoke of late i have been going regularly through my little stoke discourses as you may see i take one from the pile in this drawer and after first preaching it in the jail i place it in the left drawer on that smaller pile that you mayn't preach it again by accident well that is business if you look into the left pile near the top you will find the one i preached against profane discourse with the date at which it was first composed here it is sir little stoke may well mr hawes now was that written against you come no i confess it could not but look here if a man sends a bullet into me it doesn't matter to me whether he made the gun on purpose or shot me out of an old one that he had got by him but i tell you that i took the sermon out in its turn and knew no more what it was about until i opened it in the pulpit than i knew what this one is about which i am going to preach next sunday morning it was all chance it was my bad luck i suppose said hawes a little sulkily and mine too could i anticipate that a discourse composed for and preached to a rural congregation would be deemed to have a personal application here well no i have now only to add that i extremely regret the circumstance say no more sir when a gentleman expresses his regret to another gentleman there is an end of the grievance i will take care the sort of thing never happens again enough said sir it never can however for i shall preach but one more sunday here and i'm very sorry for it mr jones and after this occurrence i am determined to write both sermons for the occasion so there is sure to be nothing personal in them yes that is the surest way well sir you and i never had but this one little misunderstanding and now that is explained we shall part friends a glass of ale mr hawes i don't care if i do sir the glasses were filled and emptied i must go and look after my chickens the justices have ordered gillies to be flogged you will be there i suppose in half an hour well if my attendance is not absolutely necessary we will excuse you sir if not convenient thank you good morning and the reconciled officials parted little gillies was hoisted to receive twenty lashes at the twelfth the governor ordered him down he broke off the tale as our magazines do with a promise to be continued little gillies like their readers cried out no sir oh sir please flog me to an end and ha' done with it i don't feel the cuts near so much now my back seems dead like little gillies was arguing against himself hawes had not divided his punishment with the view of lessening his pain it was droll but more sad than droll to hear the poor little fellow begging hawes to flog him to an end to flog him out with similar idioms hold your oath noise hawes shrunk with disgust from noise in his prison and could not comprehend why the prisoners could not take their punishments without infringing upon the great and glorious silence of which the jail was the temple and he the high priest the beggars get no good by kicking up a row argued he hold your noise take him to his cell whether it was because he had desecrated the temple with noise or from the accident of having attracted the governor's attention the weight of the system fell on this small object now gillies was ordered to make a fabulous number of crank revolutions fabulous at least in connection with his tender age he was put on the lightest crank but the lightest was heavy to thirteen years not being the infant hercules he could not perform this labor so hawes put him in jacket and collar almost the whole day his young and supple frame was in his favor but once or twice he could hardly help shamming and then they threw half a bucket over him the next day he was put on the crank and not being able to complete the task that was set him before dinner he was strapped up until the evening the next day the governor tried another tack he took away his meat soup and gruel and gave him nothing but bread and water strange to say this change of diet did not supply the deficiency he could not do the infant hercules his work even on bread and water then the governor deprived the obstinate little dog of his chapel if you won't work i'm participle if you shall pray the boy missed the recreation of hearing mr jones hum the liturgy missed it in a way you cannot conceive your soporific was his excitement think of that little gillies became sadly dispirited and weaker at the crank than before ergo the governor sentenced him to be fourteen days without bed or gas but when they took away his bed and did not light his gas little gillies began to lose his temper he made a great row about this last stroke of discipline i won't live such a life as this said little gillies in a pet why don't the governor hang me at once what is that noise roared the governor who was in the corridor and had long ears it is no kicking up a row at having his bed and gas taken replied a turnkey with a note of admiration in his voice the governor bounced into the cell are you grumbling at that you rebellious young rascal you forget there are a dozen lashes owing you yet now the boy had not forgotten but he hoped the governor had well you shall have the rest to morrow with these words ringing in his ears little gillies was locked up for the night at six o'clock his companions darkness and unrest for a prisoner's bed is the most comfortable thing he has and the change from it to a stone floor is as great to him as it would be to us darkness and unrest and the cat waiting to spring on him at peep of day quae cum ita erant as the warder put the key into his cell the next morning he heard a strange gurgling he opened the door quickly and there was little gillies hanging a chair was near him on which he had got to suspend himself by his handkerchief from the window he was black in the face but struggling violently and had one hand above his head convulsively clutching the handkerchief fry lifted him up by the knees and with some difficulty loosed the handkerchief little gillies as soon as his throat could vent a sound roared with fright at the recent peril and then cried a bit finally expressed a hope his breakfast would not be taken from him for this act of insubordination this infraction of discipline was immediately reported to the governor little brute cried hawes viciously i'll work him oh he knew i was at hand sir said fry or he would not have tried it of course he would not i remember last night he was grumbling at his bed being taken away i'll serve him out soon after this the governor met the chaplain and told him the case he shall make you an apology imperative mood him me an apology of course you are the officer that has the care of his soul and he shall apologize to you for making away with it or trying it on this resolution was conveyed to gillies with fearful threats so when the chaplain visited him he had got his lesson pat i beg your reverence's pardon for hanging myself began he at sight rather loud and as bold as brass beg the almighty's pardon not mine no the governor said it was yours i was to beg demurred gillies very well but you should beg god's pardon more than mine for why sir for attempting your life which was his gift oh i needn't beg his pardon he doesn't care what becomes of me if he did he wouldn't let them bully me as they do day after day drat 'em i am sorry to see one so young as you so hardened i dare say the discipline of the jail is bitter to you it is to all idle boys but you might be in a much worse place and will if you do not mend a worse place than this your reverence oh my eye and you ought to be thankful to heaven for sending the turnkey at that moment here i'm sorry to say little gillies grinned satirically or you would be in a worse place would you rather be here or in hell half asked half explained the reverend gentleman in the superior tone of one closing a discussion forever in hell replied gillies opening his eyes with astonishment at the doubt mr jones was dumfounded of all the mischances that befall us in argument this coup perplexes us most he looked down at the little ignorant wretch and decided it would be useless to waste theology on him he fell instead into familiar conversation with him and then gillies with the natural communicativeness of youth confessed to him that he had heard the warder at the next cell before he ventured to step off the chair and suspend himself well but you ran a great risk too suppose he had not come into your cell suppose he had been called away for a minute i should have been scragged and no mistake said the boy with a shiver throttling had proved no joke but i took my chance of that added gillies i was determined to give them a fright besides if he hadn't come it would all be over by now sir and all the better for me i know further communication was closed by the crank which demanded young hopeful by its mouthpiece fry after dinner to his infinite disgust he received the other moiety of his flogging but by a sort of sulky compensation his bed was kicked into his cell again at night by fry acting under the governor's orders that was not a bad move hanging myself a little a very little said the young prig he hooked up his recovered treasure and though smarting all over coiled himself up in it and in three minutes forgot present pain past dangers and troubles to come the plan pursued with robinson was to keep him at low water mark by lowering his diet without this so great was his natural energy and disposition to work that no crank excuse could have been got for punishing him and at this period he was too wise and self restrained to give any other but after a few days of unjust torture he began to lose hope and with hope patience oozed away too and his enemy saw with grim satisfaction wild flashes of mad rage come every now and then to his eye harder and harder to suppress he will break out before long said hawes to himself and then robinson saw the game and a deep dark hatred of his enemy fought on the side of his prudence this bitter raging struggle of contending passions in the thief's heart harmed his soul more than had years of burglary and petty larceny all the vices of the old jail system are nothing compared with the diabolical effect of solitude on a heart smarting with daily wrongs brooding on self is always corrupting but to brood on self and wrongs is to ripen for madness murder and all crime between robinson and these there lay one little bit of hope only one but it was a reasonable one there was an official in the jail possessed of a large independent authority and paid robinson argued to take the side of humanity in the place this man was the representative of the national religion in the jail as hawes was of the law robinson was too sharp at picking up everything in his way and had been too often in prisons and their chapels not to know that cruelty and injustice are contrary to the gospel and to the national religion which is in a great measure founded thereon he therefore hoped and believed the chaplain of the jail would come between him and his persecutor if he could be made to understand the case now it happened just after the justices had thrown cold water on mr jones's little expostulation that robinson was pinned to the wall jammed in the waistcoat and throttled in the collar he had been thus some time when casting his despairing eyes around they alighted upon the comely respectable face of mr jones mr jones was looking gravely at the victim robinson devoured him with his eyes and his ears he heard him say in an undertone what is this for hasn't done his work at the crank was the answer then mr jones after taking another look at the sufferer gave a sigh and walked away robinson's hopes from this gentleman rose moreover part of his sermon next sunday inveighed against inhumanity and robinson who had no conception the sermon was several years old looked on it as aimed at hawes and his myrmidons and as the precursor of other and effective remonstrances not long after this to his delight the chaplain visited him alone he seized this opportunity of securing the good man's interference in his favor he told him in glowing words the whole story of his sufferings and with a plain and manly eloquence appealed to him to make his chapel words good and come between the bloodhounds and their prey sir there are twenty or thirty poor fellows besides me that will bless your four bones night and day if you will but put out your hand and save us from being abused like dogs and nailed to the wall like kites and weasels we are not vermin sir we are men many a worse man is abroad than we that are caged here like wild beasts our bodies are men's bodies sir and our hearts are men's hearts you can't soften their hearts for they haven't such a thing about them but only just you open your mouth and speak your mind in right down earnest and you will shame them into treating us openly like human beings let them hate us and scorn us at bottom as they will we have no friend here sir but you not one have pity on us have pity on us and the thief stretched out his hands and fixed his ardent glistening eyes upon the successor of the apostles the successor of the apostles hung his head and showed plainly that he was not unmoved a moment of suspense followed robinson hung upon his answer at length mr jones raised his head and said with icy coldness mr hawes is the governor of this jail i have no power to interfere with his acts supported as they are by the visiting justices and i have but one advice to give you submit to the discipline and to mr hawes in everything it will be the worse for you if you don't so saying he went out abruptly leaving his petitioner with his eyes fixed ruefully upon the door by which his last hope had left him the moment the reverend official had got outside the door his countenance which had fallen took a complacent air he prided himself that he had conquered an impulse an idle impulse the poor fellow is in the right said he to himself as he left the cell but if i had let him see i thought so he might have been encouraged to resist and then he would have only suffered all the more and so having done what he calculated was the expedient thing to do he went his way satisfied and at peace with mr hawes and all mankind when he glided away and took hope with him disdain despair and frenzy gushed from the thief's boiling bosom in one wild moan and with that moan he dashed himself on his face on the floor though it was as hard as hawes and cold as jones thus he lay crushed in blank despair a moment the next he rose fiercely to his knees he looked up through the hole they called his window and saw a little piece of blue sky no bigger than a bible he held his hand up to that blue sky he fixed his dilating eye on that blue sky and with one long raging yell of horrible words hurled from a heart set on fire by wrongs and despair and tempting fiends he cursed the successor of the apostles before the majesty of heaven chapter xiii solitude is no barrier whatever to sin such prayers as robinson's are a disgrace to those who provoke them but a calamity to him who utters them robinson was now a far worse man than ever he had been out of prison the fiend had fixed a claw in his heart and we may be sure he felt the recoil of his ill prayers he hated the human race which produced such creatures as hawes and nothing to keep them in check from this hour i speak no more to any of those beasts such was his resolve made with clinched teeth and nails and he curled himself up like a snake and turned his back upon mankind and his face to the wall robinson had begun his career in this place full of hopes he hoped by good conduct to alleviate his condition as he had done in other jails conscious of various talents he hoped by skill as well as by good conduct to better his condition even in a jail such hopes are a part of our nature and were not in his case unreasonable these hopes were soon extinguished he came down to a confident hope that by docility and good conduct he should escape all evils except those inseparable from a prisoner's lot when he discovered that hawes loved to punish his prisoners and indeed could hardly get through the day without it and that his crank was an unavoidable trap to catch the prisoners and betray them to punishment he sunk lower and lower in despondency till at last there was but one bit of blue hope in all his horizon he still hoped something against tyranny and cruelty from the representative of the gospel of mercy in the place but when his reverence told him nothing was to be expected from that quarter his last hope went out and he was in utter darkness yet mr jones was not a hypocrite nor a monster he was only a commonplace man a thing molded by circumstances instead of molding them in him the official outweighed the apostle for a very good reason he was commonplace this was his defect his crime was misplacing his commonplace self a man has a right to be commonplace in the middle of the new forest or in the great desert or at fudley cum pipes in the fens of lincolnshire but at the helm of a struggling nation or in the command of an army in time of war or at the head of the religious department of a jail fighting against human wolves tigers and foxes to be commonplace is an iniquity and leads to crime the man was a humane man it was not in his nature to be cruel to a prisoner and his humanity was like himself negative not positive passive not active of course it was commonplace humanity after looking on in silence for a twelvemonth or two he remonstrated against hawes's barbarity he would have done more he would have stopped it if it could have been stopped without any trouble cold water was thrown on his remonstrance he cooled directly now cold water and hot fire have been thrown on men battling for causes no higher nor holier than this yet neither has fire been able to wither nor water to quench their honest zeal but this good soul on being sprinkled laid down his arms he was commonplace moreover he was guilty of something beside cowardice he let a small egotistical pique sully as well as betray a great cause the justices have thrown cold water on my remonstrance very well gentlemen torture your prisoners ad libitum i shall interfere no more we shall see which was in the right you or i this was a narrow little view of wide and terrible consequences it was infinitesimal egotism the spirit and essence of commonplace his inclinations were good but feeble he was commonplace his heart was good but tepid he was commonplace had he loved the new testament and the saviour of mankind he would have fought hawes tooth and nail he could not have helped it but he did not love either he only liked them he was commonplace when the thief cursed this man he was guilty of an extravagance as well as a crime the man was not worth cursing he was commonplace the new chaplain arrived soon after these events the new chaplain was accompanied by his friend the rev james lepel chaplain of a jail in the north of england after five years' unremitting duty he was now enjoying a week's leave of absence the three clergymen visited the cells mr lepel cross examined several prisoners the new chaplain spoke little but seemed observant and once or twice made a note now it so happened that almost the last cell they entered was tom robinson's they found him sitting all of a heap in a corner moody and sullen at sight of three black coats and white ties the thief opened his eyes and with a sort of repugnance turned his back on the intruders come my lad said the turnkey sternly no tricks if you please turn round cried he savagely and make your bow to the gentlemen robinson wheeled round with flashing eyes and checking an evident desire to dash at them instantly made a bow so very low so very obsequious and by a furtive expression so contemptuous that mr lepel colored with indignation and moved toward the door in silence the turnkey muttered he has been very strange this few days past mr fry thinks he is hardly safe then turning to the new chaplain the man whose name was evans said better not go into his cell sir without one of us with you what is the matter with him inquired the reverend gentleman oh i don't know as there is anything the matter with him only he has been disciplined once or twice and it goes down the wrong way with some of them at first starting governor says he will have to be put in the dark cell if he does not get better the dark cell hum pray what is the effect of the dark cell on a prisoner well sir it cows them more than anything where are your dark cells they are down below sir you can look at them after the kitchen i must go into the town said mr lepel looking at his watch i promised to dine with my relations at three o'clock come and see the oubliettes first we have seen everything else with all my heart they descended below the ground floor and then evans unlocked a massive tight fitting door opening upon what appeared to be a black substance this was however no substance but vacancy without any degree of light the light crossing the threshold from the open door seemed to cut a slice out of it the newcomers looked into it mr lepel with grim satisfaction the other with awe and curiosity when shall you be back lepel inquired he thoughtfully oh before nine o'clock then perhaps you will both do me the honor to drink a cup of tea with me said mr jones courteously with pleasure good by then for the present said the new chaplain why where are you going in here what into the dark cell yes well ejaculated evans you won't stay there long until you return lepel what a fancy mr jones looked not a little surprised the turnkey grinned the reverend gentleman stepped at once into the cell and was lost to sight do not let me out before eight o'clock said his voice and you lepel inquire for me as soon as you return for i feel a little nervous now shut the door the door was closed on the reverend gentleman and the little group outside after looking at one another with a humorous expression separated and each went after his own affairs evans lingered behind and took a look at the massy door behind which for the first time a man had gone voluntarily and after grave deliberation delivered himself at long intervals of the two following profound reflections well i'm blest well i'm blowed chapter xiv mr lepel returned somewhat earlier than he had intended on entering the jail it so happened that he met the governor and seized this opportunity of conversing with him he expressed at once so warm an admiration of the jail and the system pursued in it that hawes began to take a fancy to him they compared notes and agreed that no system but the separate and silent had a leg to stand on and as they returned together from visiting the ground floor cells mr lepel had the honor of giving a new light to hawes himself if i could have my way the debtors should be in separate cells i would have but one system in a jail hawes laughed incredulously there would be a fine outcry if we treated the debtors the same as we do the rogues mr hawes said the other firmly an honest man very seldom finds his way into any part of a jail extravagant people and tradesmen who have abused the principle of credit deserve punishment and above all require discipline and compulsory self communion to bring them to amend their ways that is right sir cried hawes a sudden light breaking on him and it certainly is a mistake letting them enjoy themselves and corrupt each other hawes a prison should be confinement lepel and seclusion from all but profitable company hawes it is not a place of amusement lepel there should be no idle conversation and no noise put in hawes hastily however this prison is a model for all the prisons in the land and i shall feel quite sad when i go back to my duty in cumberland cumberland why you are our new chaplain aren't ye no i am not so fortunate i am a friend of his my name is lepel oh you are mr lepel and where is our one i heard he had been all over the jail what have you not seen him no he has never been near me not very polite i think oh oh hallo what is wrong i think i know where he is he is not far off i will go and find him if you will excuse me no we won't trouble you here hodges come here have you seen the new chaplain where is he well sir evans tells me he is click confound you don't stand grinning where is he in the black hole sir what d'ye mean by the black hole the dust hole no sir i mean the dark cells then why don't you say the dark cells has he been there long mr lepel answered the question ever since three o'clock and it is nearly nine and we are both of us to drink tea with mr jones mr hawes showed no hurry what did he want to go in them for i have no idea unless it was to see what it is like well but i like that said hawes that is entering into the system let us see how he comes on mr hawes mr lepel and hodges went to the dark cells on their way they were joined by evans the governor took out his own keys and evans having indicated the cell for there were three he unlocked it and threw the door wide open they all looked in but there was nothing to be seen i hope nothing is the matter said mr lepel in considerable agitation and he groped his way into the cave as he put out his hand it was taken almost violently by the self immured who cried oh lepel and held him in a strong but tremulous grasp then after a pause he said more calmly the light dazzles me the place seems on fire now perhaps you will be kind enough to lend me your arm lepel mr lepel led him out he had one hand before his eyes which he gradually withdrew while speaking he found himself in the middle of a group with a sly sneer on their faces mixed with some curiosity how long have i been there asked he quietly six hours it is nine o'clock only six hours incredible well sir i suppose you are not sorry to be out this is mr hawes the governor put in mr lepel hawes continued jocosely what does it feel like sir i shall have the honor of telling you that in private mr hawes i think lepel we have an engagement with mr jones at nine o'clock so saying the new chaplain with a bow to the governor took his friend's arm and went to tea with mr jones there now said hawes to the turnkeys that is a gentleman he doesn't blurt everything out before you fellows he reserves it for his superior officer next morning the new chaplain requested mr lepel to visit the prisoner's cells in a certain order and make notes of their characters as far as he could guess them he himself visited them in another order and made his notes in the evening they compared these we must be content with an extract or two mr lepel's the new chaplain's rock no a very promising rock professes penitence subject penitent and resigned asked him suddenly what sins says if the door of the prison weighed most on his conscience was left open he would not go no answer prepared with an out has learned texts and abstract penitence but no is learning fifteen a day particulars reason obvious mem with this man speak on any topic rather than religion at present pray for this self deceiver as i would for a murderer josephs no an interesting josephs an amiable boy seems boy ignorant but apparently out of health and spirits well disposed in ill health says he has been overworked the surgeon should be consulted and punished for inability shall about him intercede with the governor for him mem pale and hollow eyed pulse feeble strutt no sullen impenitent strutt this poor man is in and brutal says it is no use his a state of deep depression i learning texts they won't stay much fear the want of light in his head discontented wants and air and society is crushing to go out in the yard the best him he is fifty years old one can hope for here is that the punishment which he finds so mem inquire whether separate severe will deter him in future confinement tries men harder says he will never come here after a certain age talked again but doubts whether he to him told him stories with shall get out alive gave him all the animation i could some tracts stayed half an hour with him he brightened up a little and asked me to come again nothing to be done here at present but amuse the poor soul mem watch him jealously jessup the prisoner whose jessup like rock professes term owing to his excellent extravagant penitence indifference conduct is reduced from twelve to personal liberty and love of months to nine months so that scripture he overdoes it greatly he goes out next week having however it appears he has gained discovered that the news had his point by it he has induced not been conveyed to him i asked mr jones to plead for him in mr hawes to let me be the bearer mitigation of punishment and when i told him his only remark next week he leaves prison for was with an air of regret a little while then i shall not finish my gospels i begged for an he asked me to hear some texts explanation when he told i said no my poor fellow they me that for eight months he will do you as much good whether i had been committing the gospels hear you them or not by a light to heart and that he was just that flashed into his eye i saw beginning st john which now he he comprehended the equivoque should never finish i said he but he suppressed his intelligence must finish it at home in the and answered piously intervals of honest labor his that they will your reverence countenance brightened and he said he would a most cheering case and one of the best proofs of the efficacy of the separate and silent system i have met with for some time i fear i almost grudge you the possession of such an example robinson a bad subject robinson this man wears a rebellious and savage refuses to singular look of scorn as well speak time and the discipline as hatred which coupled with will probably break him of this his repeated refusals to speak but i do not think he will ever to me provoked me so that i make a good prisoner felt strongly tempted to knock him down how unworthy to be provoked at anything a great sufferer can say or do every solitary prisoner must surely be a great sufferer my judgment is quite at fault here i know no more than a child what is this man's character and the cause of his strange conduct mem inquire his antecedents of the turnkeys oh lord enlighten me and give me wisdom for the great and deep and difficult task i have so boldly undertaken the next day the new chaplain met the surgeon in the jail and took him into josephs' cell he only wants a little rest and nourishing food he would be the better for a little amusement but and the man of science shrugged his shoulders can you read said mr lepel very little sir let the schoolmaster come to him every day suggested that experienced individual he knew what separate confinement was what bores a boy out of prison amuses him in it hawes gave a cold consent so poor little josephs had a richer diet and rest from crank and pillory and the schoolmaster spent half an hour every day teaching him and above all the new chaplain sat in his cell and told him stories that interested him told him how very wicked some boys had been what a many clever wicked things they had done and not been happy then how they had repented and learned to pray to be good and how by divine help they had become good and how some had gone to heaven soon after and were now happy and pure as the angels and others had stayed on earth and were good and honest and just men not so happy as those others who were dead but content and that the wicked never are and waiting god's pleasure to go away and be happy forever josephs listened to the good chaplain's tales and conversation with wonderful interest and his face always brightened when that gentleman came into his cell the schoolmaster reported him not quick but docile these were his halcyon days but robinson remained a silent basilisk the chaplain visited him every day said one or two kind words to him and retired without receiving a word or a look of acknowledgment one day surprised and hurt by this continued obduracy the chaplain retired with an audible sigh robinson heard it and ground his teeth with satisfaction solitary tortured and degraded he had still found one whom he could annoy a little bit the governor and the new chaplain agreed charmingly constant civilities passed between them the chaplain assisted mr hawes to turn the phrases of his yearly report and mr hawes more than repaid him by consenting to his introducing various handicrafts into the prison at his own expense not the county's parson must have got a longer purse than most of us thought hawes and it increased his respect hawes shrugged his shoulders as much as to say you are just flinging your money into the dirt but the other interpreting his look said i hope more good from this than from all the sermons i shall preach in your chapel probably mr hawes would not have been so indifferent had he known that this introduction of rational labor was intended as the first step toward undermining and expelling the sacred crank this clergyman had a secret horror and hatred of the crank he called it a monster got by folly upon science to degrade labor below theft for theft is immoral but crank labor is immoral and idiotic too said he the crank is a diabolical engine to keep thieves from ever being anything but thieves he arrived at this conclusion by a chain of reasoning for which there is no room in a narrative already smothered in words this antipathy to the crank quite overpowered him he had been now three weeks in the jail and all that time only thrice in the labor yard it cut his understanding like a knife to see a man turn a handle for hours and nothing come of it however one day from a sense of duty he forced himself into the labor yard and walked wincing down the row these are our schoolmen said he as the schoolmen labored most intellectually and scientifically practical result nil so these labor harder than other men result nil this is literally 'beating the air' the ancients imagined tortures particularly trying to nature that of sisyphus to wit everlasting labor embittered by everlasting nihilification we have made sisyphism vulgar here are fifteen sisyphi only the wise or ancients called this thing infernal torture our old women call it salutary discipline he was running on in this style heaping satire and sorrow upon the crank when suddenly at the mouth of one of the farthest cells he stopped and threw up his hands with an ejaculation of astonishment and dismay there was a man jammed in a strait waistcoat pinned against the wall by a strap and throttling in a huge collar his face was white his lips livid and his eyes rolling despairingly it was thomas robinson this sight took away the chaplain's breath when he recovered himself what is this said he to the turnkeys sternly prisoner refractory at the crank answered hodges doggedly the clergyman walked up to robinson and examined the collar the waistcoat and the strap have you the governor's authority for this act said he firmly rule is if they won't do their work the jacket have you the governor's authority for this particular act in a general way we have in a word you are not acting under his authority and you know it take the man down this moment the men hesitated if you don't i shall the turnkeys a little staggered by his firmness began to confer in whispers the chaplain who was one of your decided men could not wait the consultation he sprang to robinson's head and began to undo the collar the others seeing this decided move came and helped him the collar and the strap being loosed the thief's body ensacked as it was fell helplessly forward he had fainted during the discussion in fact his senses were shut when the chaplain first came to the cell the chaplain caught him and being a very strong man saved him from a dangerous fall and seated him gently with his back to the wall water was sprinkled in his face the chaplain went hastily to find the governor he came to him pale and out of breath i found the turnkeys outraging a prisoner indeed said the governor it was a new idea to him that anything could be an outrage on a prisoner they confessed they had not your authority so i took upon me to undo their act humph i now leave the matter in your hands sir i will see into it sir the chaplain left mr hawes abruptly for he was seized with a sudden languor and nausea he went to his own house and there he was violently sick shaking off as quickly as he could this weakness he went at once to robinson's cell he found him coiled up like a snake he came hastily into the cell with the natural effusion of a man who had taken another man's part i want to ask you one question what had you done that they should use you like that no answer it is not from idle curiosity i ask you but that i may be able to advise you or intercede for you if the punishment should appear too severe for the offense no answer come i would wait here ever so long upon the chance of your speaking to me if you were the only prisoner but there are others in their solitude longing for me time is precious will you speak to one who desires to be your friend no answer a flush of impatience and anger crossed the chaplain's brow in most men it would have found vent in words this man but turned away to hide it from its object he gulped his brief ire down and said only so then i am never to be any use to you and went sorrowfully away robinson coiled himself up a little tighter and hugged his hatred of all mankind closer like a treasure that some one had just tried to do him out of as the chaplain came out of his cell he was met by hawes whose countenance wore a gloomy expression that soon found its way into words the chaplain is not allowed to interfere between me and the prisoners in this jail explain mr hawes you have been and ordered my turnkeys to relax punishment you forget mr hawes i explained to you that they were acting without the requisite authority from you that is all right and i have called them to account but then you are not to order them either you should have applied to me i see i see forgive me this little breach of routine where a human being's sufferings would have been prolonged by etiquette ugh well it must not occur again i trust the occasion will not for that matter you will often see refractory prisoners punished in this jail you had better mind your own business in the jail it will find you work enough i will mr hawes to dissuade men from cruelty is a part of it if you come between me and the prisoners sir you won't be long here the new chaplain smiled what does it matter whether i'm here or in patagonia so that i do my duty wherever i am said he with a fine mixture of good humor and spirit hawes turned his back rudely and went and reduced robinson's supper fifty per cent evans is that sort of punishment often inflicted here well sir yes it is a common punishment of this jail it must be very painful no sir it's a little oncomfortable that is all and then we've got such a lot here we are obliged to be down on 'em like a sledge hammer or they'd eat us up alive have you got the things the jacket collar etc i know where to find them said evans with a sly look bring them to me directly to this empty cell well sir higgled evans in course i don't like to refuse your reverence then don't refuse me retorted the other sharp as a needle evans went off directly and soon returned with the materials the chaplain examined them a while he then took off his coat operate on me evans operate on you sir yes there don't stand staring my good man hold up the waistcoat now strap it tight tighter no nonsense robinson was strapped tighter than that yesterday i want to know what we are doing to our fellow creatures in this place the collar now but sir the collar will nip you i tell you that beforehand not more than it nips my prisoners now strap me to the wall why do you hesitate i don't know whether i am doing right sir you being a parson perhaps i shall have no luck after this don't be silly evans volenti non fit injuria that means you may torture a bishop if he bids you there you are sir yes here i am now go away and come in half an hour i think i had better stay sir you will soon be sick of it go and come in half an hour was the firm reply our chaplain felt that if the man did not go he should not be five minutes before he asked to be released and he was determined to know what we are doing evans had not been gone ten minutes before he bitterly repented letting him go and when that worthy returned he found him muttering faintly it is in a good cause it is in a good cause evans wore a grin you shall pay for that grin said the chaplain to himself well sir have you had enough of it yes evans you may loose me said the other with affected nonchalance what is it like sir haw haw it is as you described it oncomfortable but the knowledge i have gained in it is invaluable you shall share it with all my heart sir you can tell me what it is like oh no such knowledge can never be imparted by description you shall take your turn in the jacket not if i know it what not for the sake of knowledge oh i can guess what it is like but you will oblige me some other way sir if you please besides i will give you a guinea oh that alters the case sir but only for half an hour only for half an hour evans was triced up and pinned to the wall the chaplain took out a guinea and placed it in his sight and walked out in about ten minutes he returned and there was evans his face drawn down by pain well how do you like it oh pretty well sir it isn't worth making an outcry about only a little oncomfortable that is all if it wasn't for the confounded cramp let us compare notes said the chaplain sitting down opposite i found it worse than uncomfortable first there was a terrible sense of utter impotence then came on racking cramps for which there was no relief because i could not move oh what nothing sir mum mum dear guinea the jagged collar gave me much pain too it rasped my poor throat like a file why the dickens didn't you tell me all this before sir said evans ruefully it is no use now i've been and gone into the same oven like a fool i had my reasons for not telling you before good by for the present don't stay over the half hour for goodness' sake sir no adieu for the present he did not go far he listened and heard the plucky evans groan he came hastily in courage my fine fellow only eight minutes more and the guinea is yours how many more minutes sir eight then oh undo me sir if you please what forfeit the guinea for eight minutes seven it is only seven now hang the guinea let me down sir if there's pity in you with all my heart said the reverend gentleman pocketing the guinea and he loosed evans with all speed the man stretched his limbs with ejaculations of pain between every stretch and put his handkerchief on very gingerly he looked sulky and said nothing the other watched him keenly for there was something about him that showed his mind was working there is your guinea oh no i didn't earn it oh if you think that putting it to the lips of his pocket let me make you a present of it handing it out again evans smiled it is a good servant that little coin has got me one friend more for these poor prisoners you don't understand me evans well you will now look at me from this moment sir you and i stand on a different footing from others in this jail we know what we are doing when we put a prisoner in that thing the others don't the greater the knowledge the greater the guilt may we both be kept from the crime of cruelty good night good night your reverence said the man gently awed by his sudden solemnity the chaplain retired evans looked after him and then down into his own hand well i'm blowed well i'm blest got a guinea though chapter xv governor hawes had qualities good in themselves but ill directed and therefore not good in their results determination for one he was not a man to yield a step to opposition he was a much greater man than jones he was like a torrent to whose progress if you oppose a great stone it brawls and struggles past it and round it and over it with more vigor than before i will be master in this jail was the creed of hawes he docked robinson's supper one half ditto his breakfast next day and set him a tremendous task of crank now in jail a day's food and a day's crank are too nicely balanced to admit of the weights being tampered with so robinson's demi starvation paved the way for further punishment at one o'clock he was five hundred revolutions short and instead of going to his dinner he was tied up in the infernal machine now the new chaplain came three times into the yard that day and the third time about four o'clock he found robinson pinned to the wall jammed in the waistcoat and griped in the collar his blood ran cold at sight of him for the man had been hours in the pillory and nature was giving way what has he done refractory at crank i saw him working at the crank when i came here last hasn't made his number good though humph you have the governor's own orders yes sir how long is he to be so till fresh orders i will see the effect of this punishment on the prisoner and note it down for my report and he took out his note book and leaned his back against the wall the simple action of taking out a notebook gave the operators a certain qualm of doubt fry whispered hodges to go and tell the governor on his return hodges found the parties as he had left them except robinson he was paler and his lips turning bluer your victim is fainting said the chaplain sternly only shamming sir said fry bucket hodges the bucket was brought and the contents were flung over robinson the chaplain gave a cry of dismay the turnkeys both laughed at this you see he was only shamming sir said hodges he is come to the moment the water touched him a plain proof he was not shamming a bucket of water thrown over any one about to faint would always bring them to but if a man had made up his mind to sham he could do it in spite of water of course you will take him down now not till fresh orders on your peril be it if any harm befalls this prisoner you are warned at this juncture hawes came into the yard his cheek was flushed and his eye glittered he expected and rather hoped a collision with his reverence well what is the matter nothing sir only his reverence is threatening us what is he threatening you for mr hawes i told these men that i should hold them responsible if any harm came to the prisoner for their cruelty i now tell you that he has just fainted from bodily distress caused by this infernal engine and i hold you mr hawes responsible for this man's life and well being which are here attacked contrary to the custom of all her majesty's prisons and contrary to the intention of all punishment which is for the culprit's good not for his injury either in soul or body and what will you do said hawes glaring contemptuously at the turnkeys who wore rather a blank look mr hawes replied the other gravely i have spoken to warn you not to threaten you what i do is done with the consent of the visiting justices they are my masters and no one else they have not seen a prisoner crucified crucified what d'ye mean by crucified don't you see that the torture before our eyes is crucifixion no i don't no nails nails were not always used in crucifixion sometimes cords don't deceive yourself with a name nothing misleads like a false name this punishment is falsely called the jacket it is jacket collar straps applied with cruelty it is crucifixion minus nails but plus a collar whatever it is the justices have seen and approved it haven't they fry that they have sir scores of times then may heaven forgive them and direct me and the chaplain entered the cell despondently and bent his pitying eye steadily on the thief who seemed to him at the moment a better companion than the three honest but cruel men he waited there very very sorrowful and thoughtful for more than half an hour then hawes who left the yard as soon as he had conquered his opponent sent in evans with an order to take robinson to his dormitory the chaplain saw the man taken down from the wall and that done went hastily to his own house there the contest being over he was seized with a violent sickness and trembling to see a fellow creature suffer and not be able to relieve him was death to this man he was game to the last drop of his blood so long as there was any good to be done but action ended a reaction came in which he was all pity and sorrow and distress because of a fellow creature's distress no one that saw his firmness in the torture cell would have guessed how weak he was within and how stoutly his great heart had to battle against a sensitive nature and nerves tuned too high he gave half an hour to the weakness of nature and then he was all duty once more he went first into robinson's cell he found him worse than ever despair as well as hatred gleamed in his eye my poor fellow is there no way for you to avoid these dreadful punishments no answer it is to be observed though that robinson had no idea how far the chaplain had carried his remonstrance against his torture that remonstrance had been uttered privately to the turnkeys and the governor besides the man was half stupefied when the chaplain first came there and now he was in such pain and despair he was like the genii confined in the chest and thrown into the water by soliman had this good friend come to him at first starting he would have thrown himself into his arms but it came too late now he hated all mankind he had lost all belief in genuine kindness like orlando he thought that all things had been savage here the chaplain on the other hand began to think that robinson was a downright brute and one on whom kindness was and would be wasted still true to his nature he admitted no small pique he reasoned gently and kindly with him very kindly my poor soul said he have you so many friends in this hard place that you can afford to repulse one who desires to be your friend and to do you good no answer well then if you will not let me comfort you at least you cannot prevent my praying for you for you are on the road to despair and will take no help so then this good creature did actually kneel upon the hard stones of the cell and offer a prayer a very short but earnest one oh god to whom all hearts are open enlighten me that i may understand this my afflicted brother's heart and learn how to do him good and comfort him out of thy word thy grace assisting me robinson looked down at him with wild staring but lack luster eyes and open mouth he rose from the floor and casting a look of great benignity on the sullen brute he was about to go when he observed that robinson was trembling in a very peculiar way you are ill said he hastily and took a step toward him at this robinson with a wild and furious gesture waved him to the door and turned his face to the wall then this refined gentleman bowed his head as much as to say you shall be master of this apartment and dismiss any one you do not like and went gently away with a little sigh and the last that he saw was robinson trembling with averted face and eyes bent down outside he met evans who said to him half bluntly half respectfully i don't like to see you going into that cell sir the man is not to be trusted he is very strange what do you mean do you fear for his reason why not sir we have sent a pretty many to the lunatic asylum since i was a warder here ah and some have broke prison a shorter way than that said the man very gloomily the chaplain groaned and looked at the speaker with an expression of terror evans noticed it and said gravely you should not have come to such place as this sir you are not fit for it why am i not fit for it too good for it sir you talk foolishly mr evans in the first place 'too good' is a ludicrous combination of language in the next the worse a place is the more need of somebody being good in it to make it better but i suppose you are one of those who think that evil is naturally stronger than good delusion springs from this that the wicked are in earnest and the good are lukewarm good is stronger than evil a single really good man in an ill place is like a little yeast in a gallon of dough it can leaven the mass if st paul or even george whitfield had been in lot's place all those years there would have been more than fifty good men in sodom but this is out of place i want you to give me the benefit of your experience evans when i went to robinson and spoke kindly to him he trembled all over what on earth does that mean trembled did he and never spoke yes well i'm thinking sir i'm thinking you didn't touch him touch him no what should i touch him for well don't do it sir and don't go near him you have had an escape you have he was in two minds about pitching into you you think it was rage humph it did not give me that impression sir did you ever go to pat a strange dog i have done myself that honor well if he wags his tail you know it is all right but say he puts his tail between his legs what will he do if you pat him bite me experto crede no if you are ever so expert he will bite you or try now putting of his tail between his legs that passes for a sign of fear in a dog all one as trembling does in a man do you see what i am driving at yes then you had better leave the spiteful brute to himself no that would be to condemn him to the worst companion he can have but if he should pitch into you sir then he will pitch into a man twice as strong as himself and a pupil of bendigo don't be silly evans sunday hodges pity you wasn't in chapel mr fry fry why hodges the new chaplain fry well what did he do hodges he waked 'em all up i can tell you governor couldn't get a wink all the sermon fry what did he tell you hodges told us he loved us fry loved who hodges all of us governor turnkeys and especially the prisoners because they were in trouble my master loves you though he hates your sins says he and i love every mother's son of you what d'ye think of that he loves the whole biling told 'em so however fry loves 'em does he well that's a new lay after all there's no accounting for tastes you know haw haw hodges haw haw ho this same sunday afternoon soon after service the chaplain came to robinson's cell evans unlocked it looking rather uneasy and would have come in with the reverend gentleman but he forbade him and walked quickly into the cell as van amburgh goes among his leopards and panthers he had in his hand a little box i have brought you some ointment some nice cooling ointment said he to rub on your neck i saw it was frayed by that collar pause no answer will you let me see you use it no answer come no answer the chaplain took the box off the table opened it and went up to robinson and began quietly to apply some of the grateful soothing ointment to his frayed throat the man trembled all over the chaplain kept his eye calm but firm upon him as on a dog of doubtful temper robinson put up his hand in a feeble sort of way to prevent the other from doing him good his reverence took the said hand in a quiet but powerful grasp and applied the ointment all the same robinson said nothing but he was seized with this extraordinary trembling good by said his reverence kindly i leave you the box and see here are some tracts i have selected for you they are not dull there are stories in them and the dialogue is pretty good it is nearer nature than you will find it in works of greater pretension here a carpenter talks something like a carpenter and a footman something like a footman and a factory girl something like a girl employed in a factory they don't all talk book you will be able to read them begin with this one 'the wages of sin are death' good by and with these words and a kind smile he left the cell from the chaplain sir said evans to the governor touching his hat dear sir will you be good enough to send me by the bearer a copy of the prison rules especially those that treat of the punishments to be inflicted on prisoners i am yours etc hawes had no sooner read this innocent looking missive than he burst out into a tide of execrations he concluded by saying tell him i have not got a spare copy mr jones will give him his this answer disappointed the chaplain sadly for mr jones had left the town and was not expected to return for some days the hostile spirit of the governor was evident in this reply the chaplain felt he was at war and his was an energetic but peace loving nature he paced the corridor looking both thoughtful and sad the rough evans eyed him with interest and he also fell into meditation and scratched his head invariable concomitant of thought with evans it was toward evening and his reverence still paced the corridor downhearted at opposition and wickedness but not without hope and full of lovely and charitable wishes for all his flock when the melancholy fry suddenly came out of a prisoner's cell radiant with joy what is amiss asked the chaplain this is the matter said fry and he showed him a deuce of clubs a five of hearts and an ace of diamonds and so on two or three cards of each suit a prisoner has been making these out of his tracts how could he do that look here sir he has kept a little of his gruel till it turned to paste and then he has pasted three or four leaves of the tracts together and dried them and then cut them into cards but the colors how could he get them that is what beats me altogether but some of these prisoners know more than the bench of bishops more evil i conclude you mean more of all sorts sir however i am taking them to the governor and he will fathom it if any one can leave one red card and one black with me while fry was gong the chaplain examined the cards with curiosity and that admiration of inventive resource which a superior mind cannot help feeling there they were a fine red deuce of hearts and a fine black four of spades cards made without pasteboard and painted without paint but how that was the question the chaplain entered upon this question with his usual zeal but happening to reverse one of the cards it was his fate to see on the back of it the wages of sin are death a tract he reddened at the sight here was an affront the sulky brute could amuse himself cutting up my tracts presently the governor came up with his satellites take no out of his cell for punishment at this word the chaplain's short lived anger began to cool they brought robinson out so you have been at it again cried the governor in threatening terms now you will tell me where you got the paint to make these beauties with no answer do you hear ye sulky brute no answer but a glittering eye bent on hawes put him in the jacket cried hawes with an oath hodges and fry laid each a hand upon the man's shoulder and walked him off stop cried hawes suddenly his reverence is here and he is not partial to the jacket the chaplain was innocent enough to make a graceful grateful bow to hawes give him the dark cell for twenty four hours continued hawes with a malicious grin the thief gave a cry of dismay and shook himself clear of the turnkeys anything but that cried he with trembling voice oh you have found your tongue have you any punishment but that almost shrieked the despairing man leave me my reason you have robbed me of everything else for pity's sake leave me my reason the governor made a signal to the turnkeys they stepped toward the thief the thief sprung out of their way his eye rolling wildly as if in search of escape seeing this the two turnkeys darted at him like bulldogs one on each side this time instead of flying the thief was observed to move his body in a springy way to meet them with two motions rapid as light and almost contemporaneous he caught hodges between the eyes with his fist and drove his head like a battering ram into fry's belly smack ooff and the two powerful men went down like ninepins in a moment all the warders within sight or hearing came buzzing round and hodges and fry got up the latter bleeding both staring confusedly seeing himself hemmed in robinson offered no further resistance he plumped himself down on the ground and there sat and they had to take him up and carry him to the dark cells but as they were dragging him along by the shoulders he caught sight of the governor and chaplain looking down at him over the rails of corridor b at sight of the latter the thief wrenched himself free from his attendants and screamed to him do you see this you in the black coat you that told us the other day you loved us and now stand coolly there and see me taken to the black hole to be got ready for the mad house d'ye hear i hear you replied the chaplain gravely and gently you called us your brothers you i did and do well then here is one of your brothers being taken to hell before your eyes i go there a man but i shall come out a beast and that cowardly murderer by your side knows it and you have not a word to say that is all a poor fellow gets by being your brother my curse on you all butchers and hypocrites give him twelve hours more for that roared hawes his eyes i'll break him him ah yelled the thief you curse me do you d'ye hear that the son of a appeals to heaven against me what does this lump of dirt believe there is a god then there must be one then suddenly flinging himself on his knees he cried if there is a god who pities them that suffer i cry to him on my knees to torture you as you torture us may your name be shame may your life be pain and your death loathsome may your skin rot from your flesh your flesh from your bones your bones from your body and your soul split forever on the rock of damnation take him away yelled hawes white as a sheet they tore him away by force still threatening his persecutor with outstretched hand and raging voice and blazing eyes and flung him into the dark dungeon cool yourself there ye varmint said fry spitefully even his flesh crept at the man's blasphemies meantime the chaplain had buried his face in his hands and trembled like a woman at the frightful blasphemies and passions of these two sinners i'll make this place hell to him he shan't need to go elsewhere muttered hawes aloud between his clinched teeth the chaplain groaned the governor heard him and turned on him well parson you see he doesn't thank you for interfering between him and me he would rather have had an hour or two of the jacket and have done with it the chaplain sighed he felt weighed down in spirit by the wickedness both of hawes and of robinson he saw it was in vain at that moment to try to soften the former in favor of the latter he moved slowly away hawes eyed him sneeringly he is down upon his luck thought hawes his own fault for interfering with me i liked the man well enough and showed it if he hadn't been a fool and put his nose into my business half an hour had scarce elapsed when the chaplain came back mr hawes i come to you as a petitioner indeed said hawes with a supercilious sneer very hard to bear the other would not notice it pray do not think i side with a refractory prisoner if i beg you not to countermand but to modify robinson's punishment what for because he cannot bear so many hours of the dark cell nonsense sir is it too much to ask that you will give him six hours a day for four days instead of twenty four at a stretch i don't know whether it is too much for you to ask i should say by what i see of you that nothing is but it is too much for me to grant the man has earned punishment he has got it and you have nothing to do with it at all yes i have the care of his soul and how can i do his soul good if he loses his reason stuff his reason's safe enough what little he has do not say stuff do not be rash where the stake is so great or confident where you have no knowledge you have never been in the dark cell mr hawes i have and i assure you it tried my nerves to the uttermost i had many advantages over this poor man i went in of my own accord animated by a desire of knowledge supported by the consciousness of right my memory enriched by the reading of five and twenty years on which i could draw in the absence of external objects yet so dreadful was the place that had i not been fortified by communion with my omnipresent god i do think my reason would have suffered in that thick darkness and solitude i repeated thousands of lines of homer virgil and the greek dramatists then i came to shakespeare corneille racine and victor hugo then i tried to think of a text and compose a sermon but the minutes seemed hours leaden hours and they weighed my head down and my heart down and so did the egyptian darkness till i sought refuge in prayer and there i found it you pulled through it and so will he and now i think of it it is too slight a punishment to give a refractory blaspheming villain no worse than a pious gentleman took on him for sport sneered hawes you heard his language to me the blaspheming dog i did i did and therefore pray you to pity his sinful soul exasperated by the severities he has already undergone oh sir the wicked are more to be pitied than the good and the good can endure trials that wreck the wicked i would rather see a righteous man thrown into that dismal dungeon than this poor blaspheming sinner the deuce you would for the righteous man has a strong tower that the sinner lacks he is fit to battle with solitude and fearful darkness an unseen light shines upon his soul an unseen hand sustains him the darkness is no darkness to him for the sun of righteousness is nigh in the deep solitude he is not alone for good angels whisper by his side 'yea though he walk through the valley of the shadow of death yet shall he fear no evil for god is with him his rod and his staff they comfort him' the wicked have not this comfort to them darkness and solitude must be too horrible satan not god is their companion the ghosts of their past crimes rise and swell the present horror remorse and despair are added to the double gloom of solitude and darkness you don't know what you are doing when you shut up a poor lost sinner of excitable temperament in that dreadful hole it is a wild experiment on a human frame pray be advised pray be warned pray let your heart be softened and punish the man as he deserves but do not destroy him oh do not do not destroy him up to this moment hawes had worn a quiet malicious grin at last his rage broke through this veil he turned round black as night upon the chaplain who was bending toward him in earnest gasping yet sweet and gentle supplication the vagabond insulted me before all my servants and that is why you take his part he would send me to hell if he had the upper hand i've got the upper hand and so he shall taste it instead of me till he goes down on his marrowbones to me with my foot on his viper's tongue him oh do not curse him above all now that he is in trouble and defenseless let me alone sir and i'll let you retorted hawes savagely if i curse him you can pray for him i don't hinder you good night and mr hawes turned his back very rudely i will pray for him and for you ugh so then the chaplain retired sorrowfully to his private room and here sustained no longer by action his high tuned nature gave way a cold languor came over him he locked the door that no one might see his weakness and then succumbing to nature he fell first into a sickness and then into a trembling and more than once hysterical tears gushed from his eyes in the temporary prostration of his spirit and his powers such are the great men know their feats but not their struggles meantime robinson lay in the dark cell with a morsel of bread and water and no bed or chair that hunger and unrest might co operate with darkness and solitude to his hurt to this horrid abode it is now our fate to follow a thief and a blasphemer we must pass his gloomy portal over which might have been inscribed what dante has written over the gates of hell all ye who enter here abandon hope at six o'clock robinson was thrust in and his pittance of bread and water with him the door which fitted like mosaic was closed the steps retreated carrying away hope and human kind there was silence and the man shivered in the thick black air that seemed a fluid not an atmosphere when the door closed his heart was yet beating with rage and wild desire of vengeance he nursed this rage as long as he could but the thick darkness soon cooled him and cowed him he sat down upon the floor he ate his pittance very slowly two mouthfuls a minute i will be an hour eating it said he and then an hour will have passed he thought he was an hour eating it but in reality he was scarce twenty minutes the blackness seemed to smother him i will shut it out said he he took out his handkerchief and wrapped his head in it what a weak fool i am cried he when we are asleep it does not matter to us light or dark i will go to sleep he lay down his head still wrapped up and tried to sleep so passed the first hour second hour he rose from the stone floor after a vain attempt to sleep oh no cried he sleep is for those who are well and happy and who could enjoy themselves as well awake it won't come to me to save a poor wretch from despair i must tire myself and i am too cold to sleep here goes for a warm he groped to the wall and keeping his hand on it went round and round like a caged tiger hawes hopes to drive me to bedlam i'll do the best i can for myself to spite him may he lie in a place narrower than this and almost as dark with his jaw down and his toes up before the year is out curse him but the poor wretch's curses quavered away into sobs and tears oh what have i done to be used so as i am here they drive me to despair then drive me to hell for despairing patience or i shall go mad patience patience this hour was passed cursing and weeping and groping for warmth and fatigue in vain third hour the man sat rocking himself to and fro trying not to think of anything for now the past too was coming with all its weight upon him every minute he started up as if an adder had stung him crawled about his cell seeking refuge in motion and finding none then he threw himself on the floor and struggled for sleep sleep would not come so sought and now his spirits were quite cowed he would cringe to hawes he would lick the dust at his feet to get out of this horrible place who could he get to go and tell the governor he was penitent he listened at the door he rapped no one came he put his ear to the ground and listened no sound blackness silence solitude they have left me here to die shrieked the despairing man and he flung himself on the floor and writhed upon the hard stone it must be morning and no one comes near me this is my tomb fear came upon him and trembling and a cold sweat bedewed his limbs and once more the past rushed over him with tenfold force days of happiness and comparative innocence now forfeited forever his whole life whirled round before his eyes in a panorama scene dissolving into scene with inconceivable rapidity thus passed more than two hours and now remorse and memory concentrated themselves on one dark spot in this man's history she is in the tomb cried he and all through me and that is why i am here this is my grave do you see me mary she is here the spirits of the dead can go anywhere then he trembled and cried for help oh for a human voice or a human footstep none his nerves and senses were now shaken he cried aloud most piteously for help mr fry mr hodges help help help the cell is full of the dead and devils are buzzing round me waiting to carry me away they won't wait much longer he fancied something supernatural passed him like a wind he struck wildly at it he flung himself madly against the door to escape it he fell back bruised and bleeding and lay a while in stupor sixth hour robinson was going mad the blackness and solitude and silence and remorse and despair were more than his excitable nature could bear any longer he prayed hawes to come and abuse him he prayed fry to bring the jacket to him let me but see a man or hear a man he screamed and cursed and prayed and dashed himself on the ground and ran round the cell wounding his hands and his face suddenly he turned deadly calm he saw he was going mad better die than so i shall be a beast soon i will die a man he tore down his collar he had on cotton stockings he took one off he tied it in a loose knot round his naked throat he took a firm hold with each hand and now he was quiet and sorrowed calmly a man to die in the prime of life for want of a little light and a word from a human creature to keep him from madness then as the thought returned clinching his teeth he gathered the ends of the stocking and prepared with one fierce pull to save his shaken reason and end his miserable days now at this awful moment while his hands griped convulsively the means of death a quiet tap on the outside of the cell door suddenly rang through the dead stillness and a moment after a human word forced its way into the cave of madness and death brother when this strange word pierced the thick door and came into the hell cave feeble as though wafted over water from a distance yet distinct as a bell and bright as a sunbeam robinson started and quaked with fear and doubt did it come from the grave that unearthly tone and word still holding the ends of the stocking he cried out wildly in a loud but quavering voice who o o calls thomas sinclair brother the distant voice rang back francis eden ah where are you francis eden here within a hand's breadth of you and mr eden struck the door here there are you there and robinson struck the door on his side yes here ha don't go away pray don't go away i don't mean to take courage calm your fears a brother is close by you a brother again now i know who it must be but there is no telling voices here what were you doing what was i doing oh don't ask me i was going mad where are you here rap and i am here close opposite you won't go away yet a while not till you bid me compose yourself do you hear me calm yourself compose yourself i will try sir thank you sir i will try what o'clock is it half past twelve night or day night friday night or saturday thursday how came you to be in the prison at this hour i was anxious about you you were what fearful about you what did you give up your sleep only to see after me are you not glad i came is a shipwrecked sailor glad when a rope is flung him i hold on to life and reason by you is not this better than sleeping did you speak no i am thinking i am trying to make you out were you ever a p hum was i ever what the door is so thick oh nothing sir you seem to know what a poor fellow suffers in the dark cell i have been in it whee ugh whee what a shame what did they put you in for they didn't put me in i went in the devil you did muttered the immured what speak out nothing your reverence bawled robinson why did you go into such a cur into such a hole it was my duty to know what a fellow creature suffers there lest through inexperience i might be cruel ignorance is the mother of cruelty i hear you sir and cruelty is a fearful crime in his eyes whose servant i am i am thinking sir i am putting two or three things together i see speak more slowly and articulately i will i see what you are now you are a christian i hope so i might have guessed as much and i did suspect it but i couldn't know i had nothing to go by i never fell in with a christian before where did you go to look for them asked mr eden his mouth twitching i have been in many countries and my eyes open and i've heard and read of christians and i've met hypocrites but never met a living christian till to night then after a pause sir i want to apologize to you what for for my ignorant and ungrateful conduct to you in my cell let bygones be bygones could you forgive me sir you punished yourself not me i forgive you thank you robinson was silent after a pause mr eden tapped what are you doing i am thinking over your goodness to me are you better now that i am the place was a tomb since you came it is only a closet i can't see your face i feel it though and your voice is music to me have you nothing to say to me sir i have many things to say to you but this is not the time i want you to sleep why sir sleep is the balm of mind and body you need sleep and you sir i shall sit here you will take your death of cold no i have my greatcoat there was a long pause robinson tapped sir grant me a favor what is it go home to your bed what leave you yes shall you not miss me yes sir but you must go the words you have spoken will stay with me while you are gone i shall stay no sir no i can't bear it it isn't fair what do you mean it isn't fair that a gentleman like you should be kept shivering at an unfortunate man's door like me i am not quite good for nothing sir and this will disgrace me in my own eyes i am on the best side of the door don't trouble your head about me i shouldn't sir if you had not about me but kindness begets kindness go to your comfortable bed mr eden hesitated you will make me more unhappy than i am if you stay here in the cold now at the beginning of this argument mr eden was determined not to go but on reflection he made up his mind to for this reason this said he to himself is an act of uncommon virtue and self denial in this poor fellow i must not balk it for it will be good for his soul it is a step on the right road this good and i might say noble act is a foundation stone on which i ought to try and build an honest man and a christian well then as you are so considerate i will go thank you can i do nothing for you before i go no sir you have done all a man can yes you can do something you spoke a word to me when you came it is a word i am not worthy of but still if you could leave me that word it would be a companion for me brother thank you when he heard mr eden's steps grow fainter and fainter and at last inaudible robinson groaned the darkness turned blacker and the solitude more desolate than ever mr eden paced the corridors in meditation it is never too late to mend he said this man seemed an unredeemable brute yet his heart was to be touched by persevering kindness and once touched how much of goodness left in his fallen nature genuine gratitude and even the embers of self respect 'i hate myself for my conduct in the cell it would disgrace me in my own eyes if i let you shiver at my door' poor fellow my heart yearns toward him for that 'go or you will make me more unhappy' why that was real delicacy i must not let him suffer for it in an hour i will go back to him if he is asleep well and good if not there i stay till morning he went to his room and worked the hour soon glided by to him not so to the poor prisoner at two in the morning mr eden came softly back to the dark cell to see whether robinson was asleep he scratched the door with a key a loud unsteady voice cried out what is that it is i brother why are you not in your bed i couldn't sleep for anxiety come chat with me till you feel sleepy how did you color those cards i found a coal and a bit of brick in the yard i pounded them and mixed them with water and laid them on with a brush i had made and hid very ingenious are you cold no because your voice trembles does it what is the matter can't you guess no but i remember you used to tremble when i spoke to you in the cell why was that have your nerves been shaken by ill usage my poor fellow oh no it is not that tell me then oh sir you know all a poor fellow feels you can guess what made me tremble and makes me tremble now like an aspen i do no indeed pray tell me are we not friends the best ever i had or ever shall then tell me i'll try but it is a long story and the door is so thick ah but i hear you better now i have got used to your voice well sir but i've no words to speak to you as i ought why did i use to tremble when you used to speak kind to me sir when i first came here i hadn't a bad heart i was a felon but i was a man they turned me to a brute by cruelty and wrong you came too late sir it wasn't tom robinson you found in that cell i had got to think all men were devils they poisoned my soul i hated god and man the very chaplain before you said good kind words in church but out of it he was hawes' tool then you came and spoke good kind words my heart ran to meet them then it drew back all shivering and said this is a hypocrite too i was a fool and a villain to think so for a moment and perhaps i didn't at bottom but i was turned to gall oh sir you don't know what it is to lose hope to find out that do what you will you can't be right can't escape abuse and hatred and torture treat a man like a dog and you make him one but you came your voice your face your eye were all pity and kindness i hoped but i was afraid to hope i had seen but two things butchers and hypocrites then i had sworn in my despair never to speak again and i wouldn't speak to you fool how kind and patient you were sir once when you left me you sighed as you closed the cell door i came after you to beg your pardon when it was too late indeed i did upon my honor and when you would rub the ointment on my throat in spite of my ingratitude i could have worshipped you but my pride held me back like an iron hand why did i tremble that was the devil and my better part fighting inside me for the upper hand and another thing i did not dare speak to you i felt that if i did i should give way altogether like a woman or a child i feel so now for oh can't you guess what it must be to a poor fellow when all the rest are savage as wolves and one is kind as a woman oh you have been a friend to me you don't know all you have done you have saved my life when you came here a stocking was knotted round my throat a minute later the man you call your brother god bless you would have been no more there i never meant you should know that and now it has slipped out my benefactor my kind friend my angel for you are an angel and not a man what can i do to show you what i feel what can i say there i tremble all over now as i did then i'm choking for words and the cruel thick door keeps me from you i want to put my neck under your foot for i can't speak all i say isn't worth a button words words words give me words that mean something they shan't keep me from you they shan't they shan't my stubborn heart was between us once now there is only a door give me your hand give me your hand before my heart bursts there there hold it there yes yes my lips are here close opposite it i am kissing your dear hand there there there i bless you i love you i adore you i am kissing your hand and i am on my knees blessing you and kissing oh my heart my heart my heart there was a long silence disturbed only by sobs that broke upon the night from the black cell mr eden leaned against the door with his hand in the same place the prisoner kissed the spot from time to time your reverence is crying too was the first word spoken very gently how do you know you don't speak and my heart tells me you are shedding a tear for me there was only that left to do for me then there was another silence and true it was that the good man and the bad man mingled some tears through the massy door these two hearts pierced it and went to and fro through it and melted in spite of it and defied and utterly defeated it did you speak dear sir no not for the world weep on my poor sinning suffering brother heaven sends you this blessed rain let it drop quietly on your parched soul refresh you and shed peace on your troubled heart drop gentle dew from heaven upon his spirit prepare the dry soul for the good seed and so the bad man wept abundantly to him old long dried sources of tender feeling were now unlocked by christian love and pity the good man shed a gentle tear or two of sympathy of sorrow too to find so much goodness had been shut up driven in and wellnigh quenched forever in the poor thief to both these holy drops were as the dew of hermon on their souls o lacryrnarum fons tenero sacros ducentium ortus ex animo quater felix in imo qui scatentem pectore te pia nynmpha sensit robinson was the first to break silence go home sir now you have done your work you have saved me i feel at peace i could sleep you need not fear to leave me now i shall sit here until you are asleep and then i will go do you hear this and he scratched the door with his key yes sir well when i do so and you do not tap in reply i shall know you are asleep robinson whose heart was now so calmed felt his eyes get heavier and heavier after a while he spoke to mr eden but received no reply perhaps he is dozing thought robinson i won't disturb him then he composed himself lying close to the door to be near his friend after a while mr eden scratched the door with his key there was no answer then he rose softly and went to his own room robinson slept slept like an infant after this feverish day his body lay still in a hole dark and almost as narrow as the grave but his spirit had broken prison tired nature's sweet restorer descended like a dove upon his wet eyelids and fanned him with her downy wings and bedewed the hot heart and smarting limbs with her soothing vivifying balm at six o'clock evans went and opened robinson's cell door he was on the ground sleeping with a placid smile on his face evans looked down at him with a puzzled air while contemplating him he was joined by fry ugh grunted that worthy seems to agree with him and he went off and told hawes directly after chapel which he was not allowed to attend came an order to take robinson out of the dark cell and put him on the crank the disciplinarian defeated in his attempt on robinson was compensated by a rare stroke of good fortune a case of real refractoriness even this was not perfect but it answered every purpose in one of the labor cells they found a prisoner seated with the utmost coolness across the handle of his crank he welcomed his visitants with a smile and volunteered a piece of information it is all right now it couldn't be all right for it was impossible he could have done his work in the time hawes looked at the face of the crank to see how much had been done and lo the face was broken and the index had disappeared as mr hawes examined the face of the crank the prisoner leered at him with a mighty silly cunning this personage's name was carter it may be as well to explain him go into any large english jail on any day in any year you like you shall find there two or three prisoners who have no business to be in such a place at all half witted half responsible creatures missent to jail by shallow judges contentedly executing those shallow laws they ought to modify and stigmatize until civilization shall come and correct them these imbeciles if the nation itself was not both half witted and a thoughtless ignorant dunce in all matters relating to such a trifle heaven forgive us as its prisons would be taken to the light not plunged into darkness would not be shut up alone with their no minds to accumulate the stupidity that has undone them but forced into collision with better understandings would not be closeted in a jail but in a mild asylum with a school attached the offenses of these creatures is seldom theft hardly ever violence this idiot was sentenced to two years' separate confinement for being the handle with which two knaves had passed base coin the same day the same tribunal sentenced a scoundrel who was not an idiot and had beaten and kicked his wife to the edge of the grave to fourteen years' imprisonment no to four months mr carter had observed that fry looked at a long iron needle on the face of the crank and that when he had been lazy somehow this needle pointed out the fact to fry he could not understand it but then the world was brimful of things he could not understand one bit it was no use standing idle till he could comprehend rerum naturam bother it in short mr carter did what is a dangerous thing for people in his condition to do he cogitated and the result of this unfamiliar process was that he broke the glass of the crank face took out the index shied the pieces of glass carefully over the wall secreted the needle took about ten turns of the crank and then left off and sat down exulting secretly when they came as usual and went to consult the accusing needle he chuckled and leered with foolish cunning but his chuckle died away into a most doleful quaver when he found himself surrounded jacketed strapped and collared he struggled furiously at first like some wild animal in a net and when resistance was hopeless the poor half witted creature lifted up his voice and uttered loud wild beast cries of pain and terror that rang through the vast prison these horrible cries brought all the warders to the spot and mr eden there he found carter howling and hawes in front of him cursing and threatening him with destruction if he did not hold his noise he might as well have suspended a dog from a branch by the hind leg and told him he mustn't howl this sight drove a knife through mr eden's heart he stood among them white as a sheet he could not speak but his pale face was a silent protest against this enormity his look of horror and righteous indignation chilled and made uneasy the inquisitors all but hawes hold your noise ye howling brute or i'll and he clapped his hand before carter's mouth carter seized his thumb with his teeth and bit it to the bone hawes yelled with pain and strove furiously to get his hand away but carter held it like a tiger hawes capered with agony and yelled again the first to come to his relief was mr eden he was at the biped's side in a moment and pinched his nose now as his lungs were puffing like a blacksmith's bellows his mouth flew open the moment the other breathing hole was stopped and hawes got his bleeding hand away he held it with the other and shook it and moaned dismally like a great girl but suddenly looking up he saw a half grin upon the faces of his myrmidons for the contrast of a man telling another who was in pain not to make a row and the next moment making an abominable row himself for no better reason was funny for all this occurred ten times quicker in action than in relation mr hawes's conversion to noise came rapidly in a single sentence after this fashion you hold your infernal noise oh augh ah e e e e aah oh oh e ee e o oo o o o o o o oo o so fry and hodges and evans and davis grinned for all these men had learned from hawes to laugh at pain another's one man alone did not even smile he was an observer and did not expect any one to be great at bearing pain who was rash in inflicting it moreover he suffered with all who suffer he was sorry for the pilloried biped and sorry for the bitten brute he then gave them another lesson all you want the poor thing to do is to suffer in silence withdraw twenty yards from him he set the example by retreating the others hawes included being off their guard obeyed mechanically the superior spirit carter's cries died away into a whimpering moan the turnkeys looked at one another and with a sort of commencement of respect at mr eden parson knows more than we do hawes interrupted this savagely ye fools couldn't you see it was the sight of your ugly faces made him roar not the jacket keep him there till further orders and he went off to plaster his wounded hand mr eden sat down and covered his face he was as miserable as this vile world can make a man who lives for a better the good work he was upon was so difficult in itself and those who ought to have helped fought against him when with intelligence pain and labor he had built up a little good hawes was sure to come and knock it down again and this was the way to break his heart he had been taking such pains with this poor biped he had played round his feeble understanding to find by what door a little wisdom and goodness could be made to enter him at last he had found that pictures pleased him and excited him and awakened all the intelligence he had mr eden had a vast collection of engravings and photographs his plan with carter was to show him some engraving presenting a fact or anecdote first he would put under his eyes a cruel or unjust action he would point out the signs of suffering in one of the figures carter would understand this because he saw it then mr eden would excite his sympathy poor so and so would mr eden say in a pitying voice poor so and so would biped carter echo after several easy lessons he would find him a picture of some more moderate injustice and so raise the shadow of a difficulty and draw a little upon carter's understanding as well as sympathy then would come pictures of charity of benevolence and other good actions these and their effects upon the several figures carter was invited to admire and so on to a score of topics the first thing was to make carter think and talk which he did in the happy go lucky way of his class uttering nine mighty simple remarks and then a bit of superlative wisdom or something that sounded like it and when he had shot his random bolts mr eden would begin and treat each picture as a text and utter much wisdom on it in simple words he found carter's mind in a state of actual lethargy he got it out of that he created an excitement and kept it up he got at his little bit of mind through his senses honor to all the great arts the limit to their beauty and their usefulness has never yet been found and never will painting was the golden key this thinker held to the bramah lock of an imbecile's understanding the ponderous wards were beginning to revolve when a blockhead came and did his best to hamper the lock in english eden was gradually making the biped a man comes hawes and turns him a brute the whimpering moans of carter were thoroughly animal and the poor biped's degradation as well as his suffering made mr eden wretched to day for the first time the chaplain saw a prisoner crucified without suffering that peculiar physical weakness which i have more than once noticed poor soul he was so pleased at this that he thanked heaven for curing him of that contemptible infirmity so he called it but he had to pay for this victory he never felt so sick at heart as now he turned for relief to the duties he had in his zeal added to a chaplain's acknowledged routine he visited his rooms and all his rational work people the sight of all the good he was doing by teaching the sweets of anti theft was always a cordial to him almost the last cell he visited was thomas robinson's the man had been fretting and worrying himself to know why he did not come before as soon as the door was opened he took an eager step to meet him then stopped irresolutely and blushed and beamed with pleasure mixed with a certain confusion he looked volumes but waited out of respect for his reverence to address him mr eden held out his hand to him with a frank manner and kind smile at this robinson tried to speak but could only stammer something seemed to rise in his throat and block up the exit of words come said mr eden no more of that be composed and i will sit down for i am tired robinson brought him his stool and mr eden sat down they conversed and after some kind inquiries mr eden came to the grand purport of this visit which to the surprise and annoyance of robinson was to reprobate severely the curses and blasphemies he had uttered as they were dragging him to the dark cell and so threatening and severe was mr eden that at last poor robinson whined out sir you will make me wish i was in the dark cell again for then you took my part now you are against me there is a time for everything under the sun when you were in the dark cell consolation and indulgence were the best things for your soul and i gave them you as well as i could you are not in the dark cell now and out of the same love for you i tell you that if god took you this night the curses you uttered yesterday would destroy you to all eternity i hope not your reverence away with delusive hopes they war against the soul i tell you those curses that came from a tongue set on fire of hell have placed you under the ban of heaven are you not this hawes's brother his brother every way two unforgiven sinners yes sir said robinson truckling of course i know i am a great sinner a desperate sinner not worthy to be in your reverence's company but i hope he added with sudden sincerity and spirit you don't think i am such an out and out scoundrel as that hawes mr hawes would tell me you are the scoundrel and he a zealous servant of morality and order but these comparisons are out of place i am now deferring not to the world's judgment but to a higher in whose eye mr hawes and you stand on a level two unforgiven sinners if not forgiven you will both perish everlastingly and to be forgiven you must forgive god is very forgiving he forgives the best of us a thousand vile offenses but he never forgives unconditionally his terms are our repentance and our forgiveness of those who offend us one millionth part as deeply as we offend him therefore in praying against hawes you have prayed against yourself give me your slate no take it yourself write robinson took his pencil with alacrity he wrote a beautiful hand and wanted to show off this accomplishment to his reverence forgive us our sins as we forgive them that trespass against us' it is down sir now particularize particularize your reverence write under 'us' 'our' and 'we' 'me'' my' and 'i' respectively all right sir now under 'them' write 'mr hawes' ugh yes your reverence 'mr hawes' and under the last four words write 'his cruelty to me' this was wormwood to mr robinson 'his cruelty to me' now read your work out 'forgive me my sins as i forgive mr hawes his cruelty to me' now ponder over those words keep them before your eye here and try at least and bow your stubborn heart to them fall on them and be broken or they will fall on you and grind you to powder he concluded in a terrible tone then seeing robinson abashed more from a notion he was in a rage with him than from any deeper sentiment he bade him farewell kindly as ever i know said he i have given you a hard task we can all gabble the lord's prayer but how few have ever prayed it but at least try my poor soul and i will set you an example i will pray for my brother robinson and my brother hawes and i shall pray for them all the more warmly that at present one is a blaspheming thief and the other a pitiless blockhead the next day being sunday mr eden preached two sermons that many will remember all their lives the first was against theft and all the shades of dishonesty i give a few of his topics the dry bones he covered with flesh and blood and beauty the tendency of theft was to destroy all moral and social good for were it once to prevail so far as to make property insecure industry would lose heart enterprise and frugality be crushed and at last the honest turn thieves in self defense nearly every act of theft had a baneful influence on the person robbed here he quoted by name instances of industrious frugal persons whose savings having been stolen they had lost courage and good habits of years' standing and had ended ill then he gave them a simile these great crimes are like great trunk railways they create many smaller ones some flow into them some out of them drunkenness generally precedes an act of theft drunkenness always follows it lies flow from it in streams and perjury rushes to its defense it breeds too other vices that punish it but never cure it prodigality and general loose living the thief is never the richer by this vile act which impoverishes his victim for the money obtained by this crime is wasted in others the folly of theft its ill economy what high qualities are laid out to their greatest disadvantage by the thief acuteness watchfulness sagacity determination tact these virtues coupled with integrity enrich thousands every year how many thieves do they enrich how many thieves are a shilling a year the better for the hundreds of pounds that come dishonestly into their hands in jail mr lepel's there is now a family that have stolen first and last property worth eighteen thousand pounds the entire possessions of this family are now two pair of shoes the clothes they stand in belong to government their own had to be burned so foul were they eighteen thousand pounds had they stolen to be beggars and this is the rule not the exception as you all know why is this your fate and your end because a mightier power than man's has determined that thieving shall not thrive the curse of god is upon theft then came life like pictures of the honest man and the thief the one with an eye that faced you with a conscious dignity and often a cheerful countenance the other with a shrinking eye a conscious meanness and never with a smile from the heart sordid sly and unhappy for theft is misery no wonder this crime degrades a man when it degrades the very animals look at a dog who has stolen before this when he met his master or any human friend he used to run up to greet them with wagging tail and sparkling eye now see him at sight of any man he crawls meanly away with cowering figure and eye askant the living image of the filthy sin he has committed he feels he has no longer a right to greet a man for he is a thief and here the preacher gathered images facts and satire and hurled a crushing hailstorm of scorn upon the sordid sin then he attacked the present situation his invariable custom not all the inmates of a jail were equally guilty on their arrival there a large proportion of felons were orphans or illegitimate children others still more unfortunate were the children of criminals who had taught them crime from their cradles great excuses were to be made for the general mass of criminals excuses that the ignorant shallow world could not be expected to make but the balance of the sanctuary is not like the world's clumsy balance it weighs all men to a hair excuses will be made for many of you in heaven up to a certain point and what is that point the day of your entrance into prison but now plead no more the ill example of parents and friends for here you are cut off from it plead no more that you cannot read for here you have been taught to read plead no more the dreadful power of vicious habits that began when you were unguarded for those habits have now been cut away from you by force and better habits substituted plead no more ignorance of god's word for here day by day it is poured into your ears your situation has other less obvious advantages here you are little exposed to the soul's most dangerous enemy self deception the world destroys thousands of sinners by flattery half the great sinners upon earth are what is called respectable the world tells them they are good they believe it and so die as they have lived and are lost eternally the world intending to be more unkind to you is far more kind it tells you the truth that you are desperate sinners here then where everything opens your eyes oh fight not against yourselves repent or fearful will be the fresh guilt heaped upon your heads even these words of mine must do you good or do you harm i tremble when i tell you so it is an awful thing to think the preacher paused you know that i love you that i would give my life to save one soul of all those i see before me now have pity on me and on yourselves let me not be so unfortunate as to add to your guilt i whose heart yearns to do you good oh my poor brothers and sisters do not pity yourselves so much less than i pity you do not love yourselves so much less than i love you why will ye die repent and be forgiven some of you profess attachment to me some talk of gratitude there are some of my poor brothers and sisters in this jail that say to me 'oh i wish i could do something for you sir' perhaps you have noticed that i have never answered these professions well i will answer them now once for all while the preacher paused there was a movement observed among the prisoners would you make me very very sad remain impenitent would you make me happy repent and turn to god not to morrow or next day but on your knees in your own cells the moment you go hence you don't know you can't dream what happiness you will confer on me if you do this then suddenly opening his arms with wonderful grace and warmth and energy he cried my poor wandering sheep come come to the heavenly fold let me gather you as a hen gathers her chickens under her wing you are my anxiety my terror be my joy my consolation here and hereafter the brightest jewels in my heavenly crown in this strain he soared higher than my poor earth clogged wings can follow him he had lashed sin severely so he had earned a right to show his love for the sinner gracious words of entreaty and encouragement gushed from him in a crystal stream with looks and tones of more than mortal charity men might well doubt was this a man or was it christianity speaking christianity born in a stable was she there illuminating a jail for now for a moment or two the sacred orator was more than mortal so high above earth was his theme so great his swelling words he rose he dilated to heroic size he flamed with sacred fire his face shone like an angel's and no silver trumpet or deep toned organ could compare with his thundering pealing melting voice that poured the soul of love and charity and heaven upon friend and foe then seemed it as though a sudden blaze of music and light broke into that dark abode each sinful form stretched wildly forth to meet them each ear hung aching on them each glistening eye lived on them and every heart panted and quivered as this great christian swept his immortal harp among thieves and homicides and oppressors in that sad house of god what did you think of the sermon fry fry liked the first part sir where he walked into thieving don't like his telling 'em he loves 'em 'tisn't to be supposed a gentleman could really love such rubbish as that sounds like palaver hawes now i liked it all though it spoiled my nap fry well sir it is very good of you to like it for i don't think you like the man hawes the man is all very well in his place he ought to be bottled up in one of the dark cells all the week and then brought up and uncorked in chapel o' sundays it is as good as a romance is a sermon of his fry that it is sir comes next after the newgate calendar don't it now but there's one thing about all his sermons i can't get over hawes and what is that fry preaches at 'em so hawes why ye fool that is the beauty of him how is he to hit 'em if he doesn't hit at 'em fry mr jones usen't hawes oh jones he shot his arrow up in the air and let it fall wherever the wind chose to blow it and then if it came down on the wrong man's head he'd say never mind my boy accident pure accident no give me a chap that hits out straight from the shoulder can't you see this is worth a hundred joneses beating about the bush and droning us all asleep fry so he is sir so he is but then i think he didn't ought to be quite so personal fancy his requesting such a lot as ours to repent their sins and go to heaven just to oblige him there's a inducement i call that himper dig from the pulpit what d'ye call it growled hawes snappishly himper dig replied fry stoutly in the afternoon mr eden preached against cruelty no crime is so thoroughly without excuse as this other crimes have sometimes an adequate temptation this never the path to other crimes is down hill to cruelty is up hill in the very act nature who is on the side of some crimes cries out within us against this monstrous sin the blood of our victim flowing from our blows its groans and sighs and pallor stay the uplifted arm and appeal to the furious heart wonderful they should ever appeal in vain cruelty is not one of our pleasant vices and the opposite virtues are a garden of delights 'mercy is twice blessed it blesseth him that gives and him that takes' god has written his abhorrence of this monstrous sin in letters of fire and blood on every page of history here he ransacked history and gave them some thirty remarkable instances of human cruelty and of its being punished in kind so strangely and with such an exactness of retribution that the finger of god seemed visible writing on the world god hates cruelty at the end of his examples he instanced two that happened under his own eye a favorite custom of this preacher a man was tried in london for cruelty to animals he was acquitted by a legal flaw though the evidence was clear against him this man returned homeward triumphant the train in which he sat was drawn up by the side of a station an express train passed on the up line at full speed at the moment of passing the fly wheel of the engine broke a large fragment was driven into the air and fell upon the stationary train it burst through one of the carriages and killed a man upon the spot that man was seated between two other men neither of whom received the slightest injury the man so singled out was the cruel man who had evaded man's justice but could not escape his hand who created the beasts as well as man and who abhors all men who are cruel to any creature he has formed a man and his wife conspired to rob and murder their friend and constant guest determined to escape detection they coldly prepared for the deed of blood long before the murder they dug a hole in the passage leading from their parlor to their dining room and this hole was to receive the corpse of the man with whom meantime these heartless wretches eat bread day after day and drank his health at their own board several times the unfortunate man walked with his host and hostess over this concealed hole his destined tomb before the time came to sacrifice him at last they murdered him and buried him in the grave they had prepared for him the deed done spite of all their precaution fear fell on them and hatred and they fled from the house where the corpse was and from each other one to the north one to the south fled they ever so fast or so far apart justice followed to the north justice followed to the south and dragged the miscreants together again and flung them into one prison they were convicted and condemned to death there came a fatal morning to this guilty pair when the sun rose upon them and found them full of health and strength yet in one short hour they must be dead they were taken into the prison chapel according to custom and from the chapel they must pass at once to the gallows now it so happened that the direct path from the chapel to the gallows was blocked up by some repairs that were going on in the prison so the condemned were obliged to make a long circuit it was one of the largest of our old prisons a huge irregular building constructed with no simplicity of design and one set of officers did not always know at once what was going on in a distant department hence it befell that in a certain passage of the jail the condemned and their attendants came suddenly upon a new made grave stones had been taken up and a grave dug in this passage the workmen had but just completed it the grave filled up the passage which was narrow and but little used the men who accompanied the murderers paused abashed and chilled the murderers paused and looked at one another no words can describe that look planks were put down and they walked over their own grave to their death is there a skeptic who tells me this was chance then i tell him he is a credulous fool to believe that chance can imitate omniscience omnipotence and holiness so inimitably in this astounding fact of exact retribution i see nothing that resembles chance i see the arm of god and the finger of god his arm dragged the murderers to the gallows his finger thrust the heartless cruel miscreants across the grave that was yawning for their doomed bodies tremble ye cruel god hates ye men speak of a murder and sometimes by way of distinction they say 'a cruel murder' see now what a crime cruelty must be since it can aggravate murder the crime before which all other sins dwindle into nothing of minor cruelties that do not attack life itself the most horrible he thought was cruelty to women here the man must trample on every manly feeling on the instinct and the traditions of sex on the opinion of mankind on the generosity that goes with superior strength and courage a man who is cruel to a woman is called a brute but if the brutes could speak they would appeal against this phrase as unjust to them what animal but man did you ever see maltreat a female of his species the brutes are not such beasts as bad cruel men are or if you ever saw such a monstrosity the animal that did it was some notorious coward such as the deer which i believe is now and then guilty in a trifling degree of this dirty sin being a rank coward but who ever saw a lion or a dog or any courageous animal let himself down to the level of a cowardly man so far as this here sprang from his lips a true and tender picture of a wife the narrow and virtuous circle of her joys her many sufferings great and little no need of being cruel to her she must suffer so much without that the claims to pity and uncommon consideration every woman builds up during a few years of marriage her inestimable value in the house how true to the hearth she is unless her husband corrupts her or drives her to despair how often she is good in spite of his example how rarely she is evil but by his example god made her weaker that man might have the honest satisfaction and superior joy of protecting and supporting her to torture her with the strength so intrusted him for her good is to rebel against heaven's design it is to be a monster a coward and a fool there was one more kind of cruelty it was his duty to touch upon harsh treatment of those unhappy persons to whom it has not pleased god to give a full measure of reason this is a sacred calamity to which the intelligent and the good in all ages and places have been tender and pitiful in some countries these unfortunates are venerated and being little able to guard themselves are held to be under heaven's especial protection this is a beautiful belief and honors our fallen nature yet in christian england i grieve and blush to say cruelty often falls on their unprotected heads who has not seen the village boys follow and mock these afflicted persons youth is cruel because the great parent of cruelty is general ignorance and inexperience of the class of suffering we inflict men who have come to their full reason have not this excuse what persecute those whom god hath smitten but whom he still loves and will take vengeance on all who maltreat them on such and on all of you who are cruel shame and contempt will fall sooner or later even in this world and at that solemn day when the cruel and their victims shall meet the judge of the quick and the dead he on whose mercy hangs your eternal fate will say to you 'have ye shown mercy' oh these words will crush your souls madmen know ye not that the most righteous man on earth can only be saved by god's mercy not by his justice would you forfeit all hope all chance all possibility of that mercy by merciless cruelty to your brothers and sisters of the race of adam does the day of judgment seem to you uncertain or so distant that you dare be cruel here during the few brief days you have to prepare yourself for eternity if you are under this delusion here i tear it from your souls that day is at hand at the door then in a moment by the magic of eloquence the great day of retribution was no longer faint and distant but upon them in all its terrors and they who in the morning had leaned forward eagerly to catch the message of mercy now shrank and cowered from the thunder that pealed over their heads and the lightning of awful words that showed them by flashes the earth quaking and casting forth her dead the sea trembling and casting forth her dead the terrible trumpet pealing from pole to pole the books opened the dread judge seated and hell yawning for the guilty well sir how did you like this sermon said fry respectfully he won't preach many more such imperative mood him i'll teach him to preach at people from the pulpit well that is what i say sir but you said you liked to hear him preach at folk so i do replied hawes angrily but not at me ye fool this afternoon two of the prisoners rang their bells and on the warder coming to them begged in much agitation to see the chaplain mr eden was always at the prisoners' orders and came to both of these one was a man about thirty the other a mere boy the same evening mr hawes sat down his features working wrathfully and dispatched a note to mr locock one of the visiting justices and a particular admirer of his meeting mr eden in the prison he did not return that gentleman's salute this was his way of implying war events were thickening a storm was brewing this same evening there was a tap at mr eden's private door and evans entered the room the man's manner was peculiar he wore outside a dogged look as if fighting against some inward feeling he entered looking down most perniciously at the floor well evans evans approached his eyes still glued upon the floor he shoved a printed paper roughly into mr eden's hand and said in a tone of sulky reproach saw ye fret because ye could not get it and couldn't bear to see ye fret thank you evans thank you you are very welcome sir said evans with momentary deference and kindness then turning suddenly at the door in great wrath with a tendency to whimper he roared out ye'll get me turned out of my place that's what ye'll do and went off apparently in tremendous dudgeon the printed paper contained the rules of the prison a copy of which mr eden had asked from hawes and been refused evans had watched his opportunity got them from another warder in return for two glasses of grog outside the jail mr eden fell to and studied the paper carefully till bed time as he read it his eye more than once flashed with satisfaction in spite of a great despondency that had now for a day or two been creeping upon him this depression dated from biped carter's crucifixion or soon after he struggled gallantly against it it appeared in none of his public acts but when alone his heart seemed to have turned to lead a cold languid hopelessness most foreign to his high sanguine nature weighed him to the earth and the dead sea rolled over his spirit earnest mr hawes hated good mr eden one comfort by means of his influence with the justices he could get him turned out of the prison meantime what could he do to spite him begin by punishing a prisoner that is the only thing that stings him with these good intentions earnest hawes turned out and looked about for a prisoner to punish unfortunately for poor josephs the governor's eye fell upon him as he came out of the chapel the next minute he was put on a stiff crank which led in due course to the pillory when he had been in about an hour and a half hawes winked to fry and said to him under his breath let the parson know fry strolled into the prison he met mr eden at a cell door josephs refractory again sir said he with mock civility mr eden looked him in the face but said nothing he went to his own room took a paper off the table and came into the yard josephs was beginning to sham and a bucket had just been thrown over him amid the coarse laughter of messrs fry hodges and hawes evans who happened to be in attendance stood aloof with his eyes fixed on the ground as soon as he saw mr eden coming hawes gave a vindictive chuckle another bucket cried he and taking it himself he contrived to sprinkle mr eden as well as to sluice his immediate victim mr eden took no notice of this impertinence but to the surprise of all there he strode between the victim and his tormentors and said sternly do you know that you are committing an illegal assault upon this prisoner' no i don't said hawes with a cold sneer then i shall show you here are the printed rules of the prison you have no authority over a prisoner but what these rules give you now show me where they permit you to pillory a prisoner they don't forbid it that is enough no it is not they don't forbid you to hang him or to sear him with a hot iron but they tell you in this paragraph what punishments you may inflict and that excludes all punishments of your own invention you may neither hang him nor burn him nor famish him nor crucify him all these acts are equally illegal so take warning all of you here you are all servants of the law don't let me catch you assaulting a prisoner contrary to the law or you shall smart to the uttermost evans i command you in the name of the law release that prisoner evans thus appealed to fidgeted and turned color and his hands worked by his side your reverence cried he in an imploring tone and stayed where he was on this mr eden made no more ado but darted to josephs' side and began to unfasten him with nimble fingers hawes stood dumfounded for a minute or two then recovering himself he roared out officers do your duty fry and hodges advanced upon mr eden but before they could get at him the huge body of evans interposed itself the man was pale but doggedly resolved mustn't lay a finger on his reverence said he almost in a whisper but between his clinched teeth and with the look of a bulldog over a bone what do you rebel against me evans no sir answered evans softening his tone but nobody must affront his reverence look here sir his reverence knows a great deal more than i do and he says this is against the law he showed you the act and you couldn't answer him except by violence which ain't no answer at all now i am the servant of the law and i know better than go against the law there i want no more of your chat loose the prisoner seems to me he is loosed said fry go to the lb crank josephs and let me see how much you can do in half an hour that i will your reverence and off he ran now sir said hawes sternly i put up with this now because it must end next week i have written to the visiting justices and they will settle whether you are to be master in the jail or i neither mr hawes the law shall be your master and mine very good but there's a hole in your coat for as clever as you are every jail has its customs as well as its rules which customs if illegal are abuses and shall be swept out of it i'll promise you one thing the justices shall sweep you out of the jail how can you promise that because they only see with my eyes and hear with my ears they would do a great deal more for me than kick out a refractory chaplain mr eden's eye flashed he took out his note book present fry hodges evans mr hawes asserts that the visiting justices see only with his eyes and hear with his ears hawes laughed insolently but a little uneasily in spite of your statement that the magistrates are unworthy of their office i venture to hope for the credit of the county there will not be found three magistrates to countenance your illegal cruelties but should there be ay what then i shall go higher and appeal to the home secretary ha ha he won't take any notice of you then i shall appeal to the sovereign and if she takes you for a madman i shall appeal to the people oh mr hawes i give you my honor this great question whether or not the law can penetrate a prison shall be sifted to the bottom pending my appeals to the home office the sovereign and the people i have placed a thousand pounds in my solicitor's hands a thousand pounds have you sir what for if i am not too curious for this sir each prisoner whom you have pilloried and starved and assaulted contrary to law shall bring an action of assault against you the moment he leaves prison he shall have counsel and the turnkeys and myself shall be subpoenaed as evidence when once we get you into court you will find that a prison is the stronghold of law not a den of lawlessness he then turned sharp on the warders i warn you against all your illegal practices mr hawes's orders shall neither excuse nor protect you you owe your first obedience to the crown and the law here are your powers and your duties you can all read here it is ruled that a prisoner shall receive four visits a day from the governor chaplain and two turnkeys these four visits are to keep the man from breaking down under the separate and silent system you have all been breaking this rule but you shall not i shall report you evans you fry and you hodges and you mr hawes to the authorities if after this warning you leave a single prisoner unvisited and unspoken with have you done preaching parson not quite jailer he tapped the printed paper here is a distinct order that sick prisoners shall be taken out of their cells into the infirmary a vast room where they have a much better chance of recovering than in those stinking cells ventilated scientifically ie not ventilated at all now there are seven prisoners dangerously ill at this moment yet you smother these unfortunates in their solitary cells instead of giving them the infirmary and nurses according to the law let these seven persons be in the infirmary before post time this evening or to morrow i report you to the secretary of state with these words he went off leaving them all looking at one another he is coming back again said fry he did come back again with heightened color and flashing eyes here is the prisoners' diet cried he tapping the printed rules it is settled to an ounce by law and i see no authority given to the jailer to tamper with it under any circumstances yet i find you perpetually robbing prisoners of their food don't let me catch either jailer or turnkeys at this again jailers and turnkeys have no more right to steal a prisoner's food than to rob the till of the bank of england he receives it defined in bulk and quality from the law's own hand and the wretch who will rob him of an ounce of it is a felon without a felon's excuse and as a felon i will proceed against him by the dog whip of the criminal law by the gibbet of the public press and by every weapon that wit and honesty have ever found to scourge cruelty and theft since civilization dawned upon the earth he was gone and left them all turned to statues a righteous man's wrath is far more terrible than the short lived passion of the unprincipled it is rarer and springs from a deeper source than temper even hawes staggered under this mortal defiance so fierce and unexpected for a moment he regretted having pushed matters so far this scene let daylight in upon shallow earnest hawes and showed him a certain shallow error he had fallen into because insolence had no earthly effect on the great man's temper he had concluded that nothing could make him boil over a shade of fear was now added to rage hatred and a desire for vengeance fry come to my house evans had a wife and children and these hostages to fortune weighed down his manly spirit he came to hawes as he was going out and said submissively though not graciously very sorry sir to think i should disobey you but when his reverence said it was against the law that is enough my man replied hawes quietly he has bewitched you it seems when he is kicked out you will be my servant again i dare say the words and the tone were not ill humored it was not hawes's cue to quarrel with a turnkey evans looked suddenly up for his mind was relieved by mr hawes's moderation he looked up and saw a cold stern eye dwelling on him with a meaning that had nothing to do with the words spoken small natures read one another evans saw his fate inscribed in hawes's eye chapter xvi hawes and fry sat in council a copy of the prison rules was before them and the more they looked at them after mr eden's interpretation the less they liked them they were severe and simple stringent against the prisoners on certain points stringent in their favor on others the sick list must go to the infirmary i believe said hawes thoughtfully he'd beat us there the justices will support me on every other point because they must contradict themselves else i'll have that fellow out of the jail fry before a month is out and meantime what can i do to be revenged on him punish 'em all the more suggested the simple minded fry no that won't do better keep a little quiet now till he is out of the jail fine it would look if he was really to bribe these vermin to bring actions against me and subpoena himself and that sneaking dog evans well sir but if you turn him out he will do it all the more you fool can't you see the difference if he comes into court a servant of the crown every lie he tells will go for gospel but if he comes a disgraced servant cashiered for refractory conduct why then we could tell the jury it is all his spite at being turned off you know a thing or two sir whined the doleful fry hawes passed him a fresh tumbler of grog and pondered deeply and anxiously but suddenly an idea flashed on him that extinguished his other meditations give me the rules he ran his eye rapidly over them why no of course not what a fool i was not to see that half an hour ago what is it sir finish your grog first and then i have a job for you he sat down and wrote two lines on a slip of paper have you done yes sir then take this order yes sir and the printed rules in your hand here take 'em yes sir and take hodges and evans with you and tell me every word that sneaking dog evans says and everything he does yes sir but what are we all three to do execute this order an ebullition of wrath was as rare with mr eden as an eruption of vesuvius his deep rooted indignation against cruelty remained it was a part of his nature but his ruffled feathers smoothed themselves the moment little hawes co were out of his eye he even said to himself what is the matter with me one moment so despondent the next irascible i hardly know myself i must take a little of my antidote so saying he proceeded to visit some of those cells into which he had introduced rational labor anti theft he called it here he found cheerful looks as well as busy hands here industry was relished with a gusto inconceivable to those who have never stagnated body and soul in enforced solitude and silence here for the time at least were honest converts to anti theft he had seen them dull and stupid brutalized drifting like inanimate bodies on the heavy waters of the dead sea he had drawn them ashore and put life into them he had taught their glazed eyes to sparkle with the stimulus of rational and interesting work and those same eyes rewarded him by beaming on him with pleasure and gratitude whenever he came this soothed and cheered his weary spirit vexed by the wickedness and stupidity that surrounded him and obstructed the good work his female artisans gave him a keen pleasure for here he benefited a sex as well as a prisoner he had long been saying that women are as capable as men of a multitude of handicrafts from which they are excluded by man's jealousy and grandmamma's imbecility and this wise man hoped to raise a few englishwomen to the industrial level of frenchwomen and englishmen not by writing and prattling that the sex are at present men's equals in intelligence and energy which is a stupid falsehood calculated to keep them forever our inferiors by persuading them they need climb no higher than they have climbed his line was very different at present you are infinitely man's inferior in various energy said he dependents are inferiors throughout the world if they were not so at first starting such a relation would make them so in two months try and be more than mere dependents on men was his axiom don't talk that you are his equal and then open that eloquent mouth to be fed by his hand do something it is by doing fifty useful and therefore lucrative things to your one that man becomes your creditor and a creditor will be a superior to the world's end out of these fifty things you might have done twenty as well as he can do them and ten much better and those thirty added to the domestic duties in which you do so much more than your share would go far to balance the account and equalize the sexes thus he would sometimes talk to the more intelligent of his hussies but he did a great deal more than talk he supplied from himself that deficiency of inventive power and enterprise which is woman's weak point and he tilled those wide powers of masterly execution which they possess unknown to grandpapa cant and grandmamma precedent as this clear head had foreseen his women came out artisans the eye that could thread a needle proved accurate enough for anything their supple taper fingers soon learned to pick up type and place it quite as quick as even the stiff digits of the male all one size from knuckle to nail the same with watch making and other trades reputed masculine they beat the men's heads off at learning many kinds of fingerwork new to both their singular patience stood them in good stead here they undermined difficulties that the males tried to jump over and fell prostrate a great treat was in store one of the fruit trees he had planted in the huge fallow of jail was to be shaken this afternoon two or three well disposed prisoners had been set to review their past lives candidly and to relate them simply with reflections of these mr eden cut out every one which had been put in to please him retaining such as were sober and seemed genuine to his lynx eye mr eden knew that some men and women listen more to their fellows than their superiors to the experiences and sentiments of those who are in their own situation than to those who stand higher but farther away he had found out that a bad man's life honestly told is a beacon so he set roguery teaching by examples there were three male narratives in the press and two female for a day or two past the printers all women had been setting up the type and now the sheets were to be struck off there was no little expectation among the prisoners they were curious to see their compeers in print and to learn their stories and see how they would tell them and as for the writers their bodies were immured but their minds fluttered about on tip toe round the great engine of publicity as the author of the novum organon fluttered when he first went into print and as the future authoress of lives and careers of infants in arms will flutter the press stood in the female governor's room one she artisan duly taught before inked the type and put in a blank sheet no pulled the bar of the press toward her and at the moment of contact threw herself back with sudden vigor and gave the telling knip the types were again covered with ink the sheet reversed and no one of the writers drew out a printed sheet two copies of two stories complete oh oh oh cried no flushing with surprise and admiration how beautiful see your reverence here is mine 'life of an unfortunate girl' yes i see it and pray what do you mean by an unfortunate girl oh sir you know unfortunate means one whom we are bound to respect as well as pity has that been your character no was the mournful reply then why print a falsehood falsehoods lurk in adjectives as well as substantives misapplied terms are strongholds of self deception nobody says 'i am unfortunate therefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes' such words are fortifications to keep self knowledge and its brother repentance from the soul oh sir what am i to call myself she hid her face in her hands my dear you told me a week ago you were a penitent so i am indeed i am sir may i change it to 'a penitent girl' you would make me very happy if you could do it with truth then i can indeed i can and she took out an unfortunate and put in a penitent there said she glowing with exultation and satisfaction 'life of a penitent girl' oh it was a pretty sight their little hearts were all in it their little spirits rose visibly as the work went on such beaming eyes such glowing cheeks and innocent looks of sparkling triumph to their friend and father who smiled back like jupiter and quizzings of each other to stimulate to greater speed in went the sheets on went the press out came the tales up grew the pile amid quips and cranks and rays of silver toned laughter social labor's natural music they were all so innocent and so happy when the door was unceremoniously opened and in burst fry and hodges followed by evans crawling with his eyes on the ground the work women looked astonished but did not interrupt their work fry came up to mr eden and gave him a slip of paper on which hawes had written an order that all work not expressly authorized by the law should be expelled from the jail on the instant mr eden perused the order and the color rose to the roots of his hair by way of comment fry put the prison rules under his eye anything about printing or weaving or watchmaking in these rules sir mr eden was silent perhaps you will cast your eye over 'em and see sir continued fry slyly shouldn't like to offend the law again mr eden took the paper but not to read it he knew it by heart it was to hide his anguish from the enemy hawes had felled him with his own weapon he put down the paper and showed his face which was now stern and composed what we are doing is against the letter of the law as your pillory and your starvation of prisoners are against both letter and spirit mr hawes shall find no excuse for his illegal practices in any act of mine he then turned to the artisans girls you must leave off leave off sir cried no faintly yes no words obey the prison rules they do not allow it come my birds shouted hodges roughly to the women stand clear we want this gear what do you want of it mr hodges only to put it outside the prison gate sir that is the order the printing press representative of knowledge enemy of darkness stupidity cruelty organ of civilization was ignominiously thrust to the door this feat performed they went to attack anti theft will you come along with us sir to see it is all legal sneered fry i will come to see that insolence is not added to cruelty at the door of mary baker's cell mr eden hung back as hodges and fry passed in at last after a struggle he entered the cell the turnkeys had gathered up the girl's work and tools and were coming out with them while the artisan stood desolate in the middle of the cell oh sir cried she to mr eden i am glad you are here these blackguards have broke into my cell and they are robbing it hush mary what they are doing is the law and we were acting against the law were we sir yes it is a bad law and will be changed but till it is changed we must obey it you are only one victim among many be patient and pray for help to bear it yes your reverence are they all to be robbed of their tools all poor things said mary baker evans it is beyond my strength i am but a man i can bear even this but i can't bear to see it done i can't bear it i can't bear it and his reverence turned his back on the moral butchers and crept away to his own room there he sank into a chair and laid his brow upon the table with his hands stretched out before him and his whole frame trembling most piteously eden and hawes are not level antagonists one takes things to heart the other to temper in this bitter hour it seemed to him impossible that he could ever counteract the pernicious hawes there is but one chance left for these poor souls i shall try it and it will fail well let it fail were there a thousand more chances against me than there are i must battle to the last let me mature my plan and he fell into a sad but stern reverie he lay thus crushed though not defeated more than two hours in silence had hawes seen him he would have exulted at his appearance a man from the jail to speak to you sir a heavy rap at the parlor door and evans came in sheepishly smoothing down his hair mr eden turned his head as he lay on the sofa and motioned him to a seat i couldn't sleep till i had spoken to you i obeyed your orders sir we have undone your work how did the poor souls bear it some cried some abused us one or two showed they were better than we are how they prayed heaven to forgive us and hoped we might never come to know what they felt i wish i'd never seen the inside of a jail fry got a scratched face in one cell sir i am sorry to hear that i shall have to scold her who was it you won't scold her you won't have the heart i will scold her whether i have the heart or not who was it no a gal that had some caterpillars silkworms yes sir silkworms and it seems she has got to be uncommon fond of them calls 'em her children poor soul when we came in and went to take them away she stood up for 'em and said we had no right his reverence gave them her well well sir of course they made short work and took them away by force then i saw the girl turn white and her eye getting wildish however i don't know as it would have come to anything but with them snatching away the leaves and the grubs one of them fell on the ground the poor girl she goes to lift it up and fry he sees her and put his foot on it before she could get to it ah i dare say he didn't stop to think you know but i don't envy him having done it well sir he paid for it the girl just gave one sort of a yell you could not call it anything else and she went right at his head both claws going and as quick one after another as a cat the blood squirted like a fountain i never saw anything like it she'd have killed him if it hadn't been for hodges and me killed him nonsense a great strong fellow no nonsense at all sir she was stronger than he was for a moment or two and that moment would have done his business she meant killing sir said evans lowering his voice her teeth were making for his jugular when i wrenched her away and it was like tearing soul from body to get her off him and she snarling and her teeth gnashing for him all the time mr eden winced the wretched creature i was putting her on the way to heaven and in one moment they made a fiend of her evans you are not the same man you were a month ago no sir that i am not when i think of what a brute i used to be to them poor creatures i don't seem to know myself what has changed you oh you know very well do i no i have a guess but why your sermons to be sure my sermons yes sir why how could i hear them and my heart be as hard as it used they would soften a stone a faint streak of surprise and simple satisfaction crossed mr eden's sallow face but it isn't your sermons only it is your life as the saying is i was no better than hawes and fry and the rest i used to look on a prisoner as so much dirt but when i saw a gentleman like you respect them and say openly you loved them i began to take a thought and says i hallo if his reverence respects them so an ignorant brute like jack evans isn't to look down on them ah confess too that half hour in the jacket opened your eyes and so your heart it did sir it did i was like a good many more that misuse prisoners i didn't know how cruel i was you are on my side then yes i am on your side and i am come here mainly to speak my mind to you sir it goes to my heart to see you lost and wasted in such a place as this you think i do no good here no no sir why i am a proof the other way but you would do more good anywhere else everybody says you are a bright and a shining light sir then why stay where there is dirty water thrown over you every day besides it is killing you i don't want to frighten you sir but if you could only see how you are changed since you came here i do feel very ill of course you do you are ill and you will be worse if you don't get out of this dreadful place if you are so fond of prisons sir you can go from here to another prison there is more than one easy going chaplain as would be glad to change with you do you think so said mr eden faintly lying on his back on the sofa not a doubt of it if it warn't for hawes you would convert half this prison but you see the governor is against you and he is stronger than you so it is no good to go wasting yourself now what will be the upshot why you'll break your heart to begin and lose your health and when all is done at a word from hawes the justices will turn you out of the jail and send me after you for taking your part what do you advise why cut it cut it turn your back on the whole ignorant lot and save yourself for better things why you will win many a battle yet your reverence if you don't fling yourself away this time said evans in tones of homely cheerfulness and encouragement there was a deal of good sense in the rough fellow's words and a homely sympathy not intruded but rather as it were forcing its way against the speaker's intention all this co operated powerfully with mr eden's present inclination and feeling as he lay sick and despondent upon the couch so that is really your advice inquired mr eden feebly and regretfully yes your reverence that is my advice mr eden rose in a moment like an elastic spring and whirled round in front of evans and this is my answer retro satanas shouted he with two eyes flashing like a pair of sabers in the sun mercy on us roared evans recoiling so hastily that he rolled over a chair what is that and he sat upon the floor a long way off with eyes like saucers and repeated in a whisper what is that a quotation replied the other grimly a quotation now only think of that said evans much relieved sounded like cussing and swearing in latin come here my good friend and sit beside me evans came gingerly well but ye mustn't thunder at me in latin any more well i won't it isn't fair how can i stand up against latin well come here and i'll have at you in the vulgar tongue aha so you come in robust health and spirits and tempt a poor broken sick creature to mount the white feather to show his soldierly qualities by running from the foe to some cool spot where there are no enemies and there fighting the good fight in peace evans you are a good creature but you are a poor creature yes hawes is strong yet i will resist him and i am weak yet i will resist he will get the justices on his side yet i will resist i am sick and dispirited yet i will resist the representative of humanity and christianity in a stronghold of darkness and cruelty and wrong must never sag with doubt nor shake with fear i will fight with pen and hand and tongue against these outlaws so long as there is a puff of wind in my body and a drop of indomitable blood in my veins no doubt you are game enough mourned evans i wish you wern't and as for you you came here to seduce a sick broken creature from his master's service you shall remain to be enlisted in it yourself instead evans shuffled uneasily on his chair at these words i think i am on your side said he half but it is no use being half anything your hour is come to choose between all right and all wrong i wouldn't be long choosing if it warn't for one thing and what is that one thing which can outweigh the one thing needful my wife and my four children if i get myself turned out of this jail how am i to find bread for that small lot and do you think shilly shallying between two stools will secure your seat you have gone too far with me to retract don't you see that the jailer means to get you dismissed the next time the justices visit the jail for business can't you read your fate in the man's eye evans groaned i read it i read it but i didn't want to believe it he set a trap for you half an hour after you had defended me he did i told my wife i was a gone coon but she overpersuaded me 'keep quiet' said she 'and 'twill blow over' but you see it in the same light as i did don't you sir mr eden smiled grimly in assent you are a doomed man said he coolly half measures can't save you but whole measures may perhaps what is to be done sir asked evans helplessly your only chance is to go heart and hand with me in the project which occupies me now i will sir cried fluctuans with a sudden burst of resolution for i'm druv in a corner so please tell me what is your project to get mr hawes dismissed from this jail as he uttered these words the reverend gentleman had a severe spasm which forced him to lie back and draw his breath hard evans uttered something between a cry of dismay and a groan of despair and stared down upon this audacious invalid with wonder and ire at his supernatural but absurd cool courage turn our governor out of this jail now hark to that you might as well try to move a mountain and look at you lying there scarce able to move yourself and talking like that pour me out a cup of tea mr faintheart i am in great pain thank you he took the cup and as he stirred it he said coolly did you ever read of marshal saxe mr faintheart he fought the battle of fontenoy as he lay a dying he had himself carried on his bed of death from one part of the field to another at first the fight went against him but he spurned craven counsels with his expiring heart he saw the enemy's blunder with his dying eye and waved his troops on to victory with his dying hand this is one of the great feats of earth but the soldiers of christ are as stout hearted as any man that ever carried a marshal's baton or a sergeant's pike yes i am ill and i feel as if i were dying evans but living or dying i am the lord's i will fight for him to the last gasp and i will thrust this malefactor from his high office with the last action of my hand will you help me or will you not i will sir i will what on earth can i do you can turn the balanced scale and win the day can i sir cried evans greatly puzzled you will find some wine in that cupboard my man fill yourself a tumbler i will sip my tea and explain myself you think this hawes is a mountain no he is a large pumpkin hollow at the core you think him strong no he but seems so because some of the many at whose mercy he is are so weak there is a flaw in hawes which must break him sooner or later he is a felon the law hangs over his head by a single hair he has forfeited his office and will be turned out of it the moment we can find among his many superiors one man with one grain either of honesty or intelligence but how shall we find that sir by looking for it everywhere till we find it somewhere mr hawes tells me in other words that the visiting justices do not possess the one grain we require i profit by the intelligence the enemy was weak enough to give me and i go not to the visiting justices to morrow if my case is ready i send a memorial to the home office accuse hawes of felonious practices and demand an inquiry evans's eye sparkled he began to gather strength from the broken man but now comes the difficulty a man should never strike a feeble blow my appeal will be read by half educated clerks if i don't advance something that the small official mind can take in i shall never reach the heads of the office it would be madness to begin by attacking national prejudices by combating a notion so stupid and therefore so deep rooted as that prisoners have no legal rights no the pivot of my assault must be something that a boy can afford to be able to comprehend for eighty pounds a year and a clerk's desk in a government office now mr hawes has for many months past furnished false reports to the justices and to the home office here is the true stepping stone to an inquiry here is the fact to tell on the official mind for the man's cruelty and felonious practices are only offenses against god and the law but a false report is an offense against the office and here i need your help you shall have it sir i want to be able to prove this man's reports to be lies i think such a proof exists said mr eden very thoughtfully now if it does you alone can get hold of it for me one of the turnkeys notes down every punishment of a prisoner in a small pocket book for i have seen him yes sir fry does never misses what becomes of those notes i don't know what if he keeps a book and enters everything in it but if he had shouldn't we have caught a glimpse of it humph a man does not take notes constantly and destroy them fry too is an enthusiast in his way i am sure he keeps a record and if he does it is a true one for he has no object in tampering with his own facts bring me such a book or any record kept by fry let me have it for twelve hours and hawes shall be turned out of the jail and you stay in it sir cried evans in great excitement if there is such a thing you shall see it to morrow morning no to night come you have an hour before you do you want the sinews of war here take this five pounds with you you may have to buy a sight of it but if you ask him whether i am right in telling you it is not the custom of jails to crucify prisoners in the present century perhaps the barbarian will produce his record of abuses to prove to you that it is work how you please but be wary be intelligent and bring me fry's ledger or never look me in the face again he waved his hand and evans strode out of the room animated with a spirit not his own he who had animated him lay back on the sofa prostrated half an hour elapsed no evans a quarter of an hour more still no evans but just before the hour struck in he burst out of breath but red with triumph your reverence is a witch you can see in the dark look here sir and he flung a dirty ledger on the table here's all the money sir he did not get a farthing of it i flattered the creature's pride and he dropped the cheese into my hand like the old carrion crow when they asked him for one of his charming songs but he had no notion it was going out of the jail so you'll bring it in and give it me back the first thing to morrow sir i must run back time's up good night your reverence am i on your side or whose good night my fine fellow you shan't be turned out of the jail now good night he wanted him gone he went to a drawer and took out his own book a copy of hawes's public log book which he had made as soon as he came into the jail with the simple view of guiding himself by the respectable precedents he innocently expected to find there he lighted candles placed his sheets by the side of fry's well thumbed ledger and plunged into a comparison it was as he expected on one side lay the bare simple brutal truth in fry's hand on the other the same set of facts colored molded and cooked in every imaginable way to bear inspection with occasional suppressions where the deed and consequences were too frightful to bear coloring molding extenuating or cooking the book was a thick quarto containing a strict record of the prison for four years two years of captain o'connor and two of hawes the worthy who had supplanted him mr eden was a rapid penman he set to and by half past eleven o'clock he had copied the first part for under o'connor there were comparatively few punishments then he attacked hawes's reign sheet after sheet was filled and numbered he threw them on another table as each was filled three o'clock still he wrote with all his might four o'clock black spots danced before his eyes and his fingers ached and his brow burned and his feet were ice still the light indefatigable pen galloped along the paper meantime the writer's feelings were of the most mixed and extraordinary character often his eye flashed with triumph as fry exposed the dishonesty and utter mendacity of hawes oftener still it dilated with horror at the frightful nature of the very revelations at six o'clock fry's record was all copied out mr eden shaved and took his bath and ran into the town he knocked up a solicitor with whom he was acquainted i want you to make my will while your son attests this copy of this ledger but my son is in bed well he can read in bed which is his room that one rap come in here mr edward compare these two and correct or attest this as a true copy twenty minutes' work two guineas here they are on your drawers and he chucked the documents on the bed opened the shutters and drew the bed curtains and passing his arm under the father's he drew him into his own office opened the shutters put paper before him and dictated a will three bequests one to evans and his mother residuary legatee the will written he ran upstairs made father and son execute it and then darted out caught a fly that was going to the railway engaged it upstairs again the work was done copy attested half a crown if you are at the jail in five minutes galloped off with his two documents entered the jail went to his own room sent for evans gave him fry's book and ordered himself the same breakfast the prisoners had i am bilious and no wonder i have been living too luxuriously if i had been content with the diet my poor brothers live on i should be in better health it serves me just right then he sat down and wrote a short memorial to the secretary for the home department claiming an inquiry into the jailer's conduct i have evidence on the spot to show that for two years he has been guilty of illegal practices that he has introduced into the prison an unlawful instrument of torture that during his whole period of office he has fabricated partial colored and false reports of his actions in the prison and also of their consequences that he has suppressed all mention of no less than seven attempts at suicide and has given a false color both with respect to the place of death the manner of death and the cause of death of some twenty prisoners besides that his day book kept in the prison for the inspection and guide of the magistrates is a tissue of frauds equivocations exaggerations diminutions and direct falsehoods that his periodical reports to the home office are a tissue of the same frauds suppressions inventions and direct falsehoods the truth therefore is inaccessible to you except by a severe inquiry conducted on the spot that inquiry i pray for on public grounds and if need be demand in my own person as her majesty's servant driven to this strait i am responsible to her majesty for the lives and well being of the prisoners and yet unable without your intervention to protect them against illegal violence covered by organized fraud mr eden copied this and sent the copy at once to mr hawes with two lines to this effect that the duplicate should not leave the town till seven in the evening so mr hawes had plenty of time to write to the home secretary by same post and parry or meet this blow if he thought it worth his while it now remained only to post the duplicate for the home office mr eden directed it and waxed it but even as he leaned over it sealing it the room suddenly became dark to him and his head seemed to weigh a ton with an instinct of self preservation he made for the sofa which was close behind him but before he could reach it his senses had left him and he fell with his head and shoulders upon the couch but his feet on the floor the memorial tight in his hand he paid the penalty of being a blood horse he ran till he dropped chapter xvii two ladies to see you grunted the red haired servant throwing open the door without ceremony and she actually bounced out again without seeing anything more than that her master was lying on the sofa susan merton and her aunt came rapidly and cheerfully into the room here we are mr eden aunt davies and i oh the table being between the sofa and the door the poor gentleman's actual condition was not self evident from the latter but susan was now in the middle of the room and her gayety gave way in a moment to terror why the man has fainted cried mrs davies hurriedly susan clasped her hands together and turned very pale but for all that she was the first at mr eden's head he is choking he is choking help me aunt help me but even while crying for help her nimble fingers had untied and flung away mr eden's white neck tie which being high and stiff was doing him a very ill turn as the air forcing itself violently through his nostrils plainly showed take his legs aunt oh oh oh don't be a fool girl it is only a faint susan flew to the window and threw it open then flew back and seized one end of the couch her aunt comprehended at a glance and the two carried it with its burden to the window open the door aunt cried susan as she whipped out her scent bottle and with her finger wetted the inside of his nostrils with the spirit as the patient lay in the thorough draught susan sobbed with sorrow and fear but her emotion was far from disabling her she poured some of her scent into a water glass and diluted it largely she made her aunt take a hand screen from the mantel piece she plunged her hand into the liquid and flung the drops sharply into mr eden's face and mrs davies fanned him rapidly at the same time these remedies had a speedy effect first the film cleared from the patient's bright eye then a little color diffused itself gradually over his cheek and last his lips lost their livid tint as soon as she saw him coming to susan composed herself and mr eden on his return to consciousness looked up and saw a beautiful young woman looking down on him with a cheerful encouraging smile and wet cheeks ah sighed he and put out his hand faintly to welcome susan but what how do i come here you have been a little faint said susan smiling but you are better now you know yes thank you how good of you to come who is this lady my aunt sir a very notable woman see she is setting your things to rights already aunt i wonder at you she then dipped the corner of her handkerchief in scent and slightly coloring now that her patient was conscious she made the spirit enter his nostrils he gave a sigh of languid pleasure that is so invigorating then he looked upward see how good god is to me in my sore need he has sent me help oh how pleasant is the face of a friend by the way i took you for an angel at first added he naively but you have come to your senses now sir ha ha ha cried busy merry mrs davies hard at work for as soon as the patient began visibly to return to life she had turned her back on him and fallen on the furniture i hope you are come to stay with me as susan was about to answer in the negative mrs davies made signals for a private conference and after some whispering susan replied that her aunt wanted to put the house in apple pie order and that she susan felt too anxious about him to go until he should be quite recovered in that case ladies said he i consecrate to you my entire second floor three rooms and he rang the bell and said to the servant take your orders from these ladies and show them the second floor while his visitors were examining their apartments mr eden sought a little rest and had no sooner dropped upon his bed than sleep came to his relief he slept for nearly four hours at first soundly then dozing and dreaming while he slept a prisoner sent for him but susan would not have him awakened for that by and by susan went into the town leaving her aunt sole guardian now aunt said she don't let him be disturbed whoever comes for him it is as much as his life is worth well then i won't there susan had not been long gone when a turnkey called and was shown into the parlor where mrs davies was very busy he looked about him and told her he had called for a book mr eden promised him mr eden is asleep asleep at this time of day said the man incredulously yes asleep answered mrs davies sharply is he never to have any sleep well perhaps you will tell him mr fry has come for the book as requested couldn't think of disturbing him for that mr fry replied mrs davies not intermitting her work for a single moment very well ma'am said mr fry in dudgeon i never was here before and i shan't ever come again that is all and off he went mrs davies showed her dismay at this threat by dusting on without once taking her eye or her mind off her job it was eight o'clock mr eden woke and found it almost dark he rose immediately why i have slept the day away thought he in dismay and my memorial to the home office it is past post time and i have not sent it he came hastily downstairs and entered the parlor he found it in a frightful state all the chairs were in the middle of the room every part of which was choked up except a pathway three feet broad that ran by the side of the wall all round it from this path all access into the interior was blocked by the furniture which now stood upon an area frightfully diminished by this loss of three feet taken from each wall mrs davies was a character a notable woman mr eden's heart sank at the sight to find himself put to rights gives a bachelor an innocent pleasure but the preliminary process of being put entirely to wrongs crushes his soul another fanatic let loose on me thought he and my room is like a road that is just mended as they call it he peered about here and there through a grove of chairs whose legs were kicking in the air as they sat bosom downward upon their brethren but he could see no memorial he rang the bell and inquired of the servant whether she had seen it while he was describing it to her mrs davies broke in i saw it i picked it up off the floor it was lying between the sofa and the table and what did you do with it why dusted it to be sure but where did you put it on the table i suppose another search and no memorial somebody has taken it but who has anybody been in this room since plenty you don't get much peace here i should say but susan gave the order you were not to be disturbed this won't do thought mr eden who has been here said he to the servant mr fry is the only one that came into this room mr fry said mr eden with some surprise ay ay cried mrs davies i remember now there was an ill looking fellow of that name here talking to me pretending you had promised him a book but i did promise him a book oh you did did you well he looked like a thief perhaps he has goodness gracious me i hope there was no money in it and mrs davies lost her ruddy color in a moment no no it was only a letter but of great importance another violent search at the risk of shins and hands that fry has taken it i never saw such a hang dog looking fellow mr eden was much vexed but he had a trick of blaming himself heaven only knows where he caught it my own forgetfulness even if the paper had not been lost i had allowed post time to go by and mr hawes will anticipate me with the home secretary he sighed in so severe a struggle he was almost as reluctant to give an unfair advantage as to take one he ordered a fire in his little back parlor and with a sigh sat down to rewrite his memorial and to try and recover if he could the exact words and save the next post that left in the morning as mr eden sat trying to recover the words of his memorial hawes was seated in mr williams' study at ashtown park concerting with that worthy magistrate the best way of turning the new chaplain out of jail he found no difficulty mr williams had two very strong prejudices one in favor of hawes personally the other in favor of the system pursued this two years in that jail egotism was here too and rendered these prejudices almost impregnable williams had turned out o'connor and his milder system and put in hawes and his more rigorous one hawes was my man his system mine he told his story and williams burned to avenge his injured friend whose patron and director he called himself and whose tool he was nothing can be done until the twenty fifth when palmer returns we must be all there for an act of this importance do your duty as you always have carry out the discipline and send for me if he gives you any great annoyance in the meantime that zealous servant of her majesty earnest mr hawes had never taken a day's holiday before no man could accuse him of indolence carelessness or faint discharge of the task he had appointed himself he perverted his duties too much to neglect them he had been reluctant to leave the prison on a personal affair the drive however was pleasant and he returned freshened and animated by assurances of support from the magistrate as he strode across the prison yard to inspect everything before going to his house he felt invulnerable and sneered at himself for the momentary uneasiness he had let a crack brained parson give him he went home there was a nice fire a clean swept hearth a glittering brass kettle on the hob for making toddy and three different kinds of spirits in huge cruets for system reigned in the house as well as the jail with this difference that the house system was devoted to making self comfortable the jail system to making others wretched he rang the bell in came the servant with slippers and candles unlighted for he was wont to sip his grog by fire light he put on his slippers then he mixed his grog then he noticed a paper on the table and putting it to the fire he found it was sealed so he lighted the candles and placed them a little behind him then he stirred his grog and sipped it and placing it close beside him leaned back with a grunt of satisfaction opened the paper read it first slowly then all in a flutter started up as if he was going to act upon some impulse but the next moment sat down again and stared wildly a picture of stupid consternation meantime as mr eden with a heavy heart was writing himself out nauseous task susan stood before him with a color like a rose she was in a brown cloak from under which she took out a basket brimful of little packages some in blue some in white paper these are grits said she and these are arrowroot i know one of the phases of the potato oh for shame mr eden well i never and i posted your letter sir what letter what letter the long one i found it on the table you don't mean you posted that letter why it was to go wasn't it yes it was to go but it was wonderfully intelligent of you la mr eden don't talk so you make me ashamed why there was 'immediate' written on it in your own hand was i to wake you up to ask whether that meant it was to stay here immediate or go to london immediate then she pondered a moment he thinks i am a fool said she in quiet explanation without a shade of surprise or anger well susan my dear friend you don't know what a service you have done me susan glittered with pleasure there cried he you have spared me this most unpleasant task and he flung his unfinished papers into a basket mr eden congratulated himself in his way ie thanked heaven susan had come there the next thing was he had a twinge of conscience i half suspected fry of taking it in the interest of hawes his friend poor fry who is a brute but as honest a man as myself every bit he shall have his book at all events i'll put his name on it that i mayn't forget it again mr eden took the book from its shelf wrapped it in paper and wrote on the cover for mr fry from f eden as the incidents of the day are ended i may as well relate what this book was and how fry came to ask for it the book was uncle tom a story which discusses the largest human topic that ever can arise for the human race is bisected into black and white nowadays a huge subject greatly treated receives justice from the public and uncle tom is written in many places with art in all with red ink and with the biceps muscle great by theme and great by skill and greater by a writer's soul honestly flung into its pages uncle tom to the surprise of many that twaddle traditional phrases in reviews and magazines about the art of fiction and to the surprise of no man who knows anything about the art of fiction was all the rage not to have read it was like not to have read the times for a week once or twice during the crucifixion of a prisoner mr eden had said bitterly to fry have you read 'uncle tom' no would fry grunt but one day that the question was put to him he asked with some appearance of interest who is uncle tom then mr eden began to reflect who knows the cases are in a great measure parallel prisoners are a tabooed class in england as are blacks in some few of the united states the lady writes better than i can talk if she once seizes his sympathies by the wonderful power of fiction she will touch his conscience through his heart this disciple of legree is fortified against me mrs stowe may take him off his guard he said slyly to fry 'not know uncle tom why it is a most interesting story a charming story there are things in it too that meet your case' indeed sir it is a book you will like shall i lend it you if you please sir nights are drawing in now i will then and he would but that frightful malady jaundice among its other feats impairs the patient's memory and he forgot all about it so fry whose curiosity was at last excited came for the book the rest we know chapter xviii mr hawes went about the prison next day morose and melancholy he spoke to no one and snapped those who spoke to him he punished no prisoner all day but he looked at them as a wolf at fortified sheep he did not know what to do to avert the blow he had drawn so perseveringly on his own head at one time he thought of writing to the home office and aspersing his accuser then he regretted his visit to ashtown park what an unlucky dog i am i go to see a man that i was sure of before i went and while i am gone the parson steals a march on me he will beat me if i hadn't been a fool i should have seen what a dangerous devil he is no putting him out of temper and no putting him out of heart he will beat me the zealous services of so many years won't save me with an ungrateful government i shall lose my stipend for a while even stout hearted earnest mr hawes was depressed with gloom and bitter foreboding but he had a resource in trouble good mr eden in similar case had not in the despondency of his soul he turned to grog under the inspiration of that deity he prepared for a dogged defense he would punish no more prisoners let them do what they might and then if an inquiry should take place he would be in case to show that by his past severities he had at last brought his patients to such perfection that weeks had elapsed without a single punishment with this and the justices' good word he would weather the storm yet thus passed three days without one of those assaults on prisoners he called punishment but this enforced forbearance made him hate his victims he swore at them he threatened them all round and with deep malice he gave open orders to punish which he secretly countermanded so that in fact he did punish for blows suspended over the head fall upon the soul thus he made his prisoners share his gloom he was unhappy he was dull robbed of an excitement which had become butter to his daily bread all prison life is dull chaplain turnkeys jailers all who live in prisons are prisoners barren of mental resources too stupid to see far less read the vast romance that lay all round him every cell a volume too mindless to comprehend his own grand situation on a salient of the state and of human nature and to discern the sacred and endless pleasures to be gathered there this unhappy dolt flung into a lofty situation by shallow blockheads who like himself saw in a jail nothing greater nor more than a place of punishment must still like his prisoners and the rest of us have some excitement to keep him from going dead what more natural than that such a nature should find its excitement in tormenting and that by degrees this excitement should become first a habit then a need growth is the nature of habit not of one sort or another but of all even of an unnatural habit gin grows on a man charity grows on a man tobacco grows on a man blood grows on a man at a period of the reign of terror the parisians got to find a day weary without the guillotine if by some immense fortuity there came a day when they were not sprinkled with innocent blood the poor souls s'ennuyaient this was not so much thirst for any particular liquid as the habit of excitement some months before dancing theaters boulevard etc would have made shift to amuse these same hearts as they did some months after when the red habit was worn out torture had grown upon stupid earnest hawes it seasoned that white of egg a mindless existence oh how dull he felt these three deplorable days barren of groans and white faces and livid lips and fellow creatures shamming and the bucket a generic term for swooning or sickening or going mad in a prison mr hawes had given a sulky order that the infirmary should be prepared for the sick and now on the afternoon of the third day the surgeon had met him there by appointment will they get well any quicker here asked hawes ironically why certainly replied the other hawes gave a dissatisfied grunt i hate moving prisoners out of the cells but i suppose i shall get you into trouble if i don't indeed said the other with an inquiring air how parson threatens you very hard for letting the sick ones lie in their cells said hawes slyly but never mind old boy i shall stand your friend and the justices mine we shall beat him yet said hawes assuming a firmness he did not feel lest this man should fall away from him and perhaps bear witness against him i think you have beat him already replied the other calmly what do you mean i have just come from mr eden he sent for me what isn't he well i wish he'd die but there is no chance of that well there is always a chance of a man dying who has got a bilious fever why you don't mean he is seriously ill cried hawes in excitement i don't say that but he has got a sharp attack mr hawes examined the speaker's face it was as legible as a book from the outside he went from the subject to one or two indifferent matters but he could not keep long from what was uppermost sawyer said he you and i have always been good friends yes mr hawes i have never been hard upon you you ought to be here every day but the pay is small and i have never insisted on it because i said he can't afford to leave patients that pay no mr hawes and i am much obliged to you are you then tell me between ourselves now how ill is he he has got bilious fever consequent upon jaundice hawes lowered his voice is he in danger in danger why no not at present oh then it is only an indisposition after all it is a great deal more than that it is fever and bile can't you tell me in two words how ill he is not till i see how the case turns when will you be able to say then when the disorder declares itself more fully hawes exploded in an oath you humbugs of doctors couldn't speak plain to save yourselves from hanging there was some truth in this ill natured excuse after fifteen years given to the science of obscurity mr sawyer literally could not speak plain all in one moment the next morning there was no service in the chapel the chaplain was in bed this spoke for itself and hawes wore a look of grim satisfaction at the announcement but this was not all in the afternoon came a letter from mr williams with a large inclosure signed by her majesty's secretary's secretary and written by her secretary's secretary's secretary its precise contents will be related elsewhere its tendency may be gathered from this hawes had no sooner read it than exultation painted itself on his countenance close the infirmary and bring me the key and you fry put these numbers on the cranks to morrow he scribbled with his pencil and gave him a long list of the proscribed no mr eden shone now upon mr robinson's solitude he waited and waited and hoped till the day ended but no the next day the same thing he longed for mr eden's hour to come it came but not with it came his one bit of sunshine his excitement his amusement his consolation his friend his brother his all and so one heavy day succeeded another and robinson became fretful and very very sad one day as he sat disconsolate and foreboding in his cell he heard a stranger's voice talking to fry outside and what was more strange fry appeared to be inviting this person to inspect the cells the next moment his door was opened and a figure peeped timidly into the cell from behind fry whose arm she clutched in some anxiety robinson looked up it was susan merton she did not instantly know him in his prison dress and his curly hair cut short he hung his head and this action and the recognition it implied made her recognize him oh cried she it is mr robinson the thief turned his face to the wall even he was ashamed before one who had known him as mr robinson but the next moment he got up and said earnestly pray miss merton do me a favor you had always a kind heart ask that man what has become of mr eden he will answer you mr robinson cried susan i have no need to ask mr fry i am staying at mr eden's house he is very ill mr robinson ah i feared as much he never would have deserted me else what is the trouble you may well say trouble it is the prison that has fretted him to death cried susan half bitterly half sorrowfully but he will get well it is not serious inquired robinson anxiously fry pricked his ears he is very ill mr robinson and susan sighed heavily i'll pray for him he has taught me to pray all the poor fellows will pray for him that know how miss merton good for nothing as i am i would die for mr eden this minute if i could save his life by it susan thought of this speech afterward now she but said i will tell him what you say and won't you bring me one word back from his dear mouth yes i will good by mr robinson robinson tried to say good by but it stuck in his throat susan retired and his cell seemed darker than ever mr eden lay stricken with fever he had been what most of us would have called ill long before this the day of carter's crucifixion was a fatal day to him on that day for the first time he saw a crucifixion without being sick after it the poor soul congratulated himself so on this but there is reason to think that same sickness acted as a safety valve to his nature when it ceased the bile overflowed and mixed with his blood producing that horrible complaint jaundice even then if the causes of grief and wrong had ceased he might perhaps have had no dangerous attack but everything was against him constant grief constant worry and constant preternatural exertions to sustain others while drooping himself even those violent efforts of will by which he thrust back for a time the approaches of his malady told heavily upon him at last the thorough bred horse ran much longer than a cocktail would but he could not run forever he lay unshaven hollow eyed and sallow mrs davies and susan watched him by turns except when he compelled them to go and take a little rest or amusement the poor thing's thoughts were never on himself even when he was light headed and this was often though not for long together it was generally his poor prisoners and what he was going to do for them this is how susan merton came to visit robinson one day seeing his great interest in all that concerned the prison and remembering there was a book addressed to one of the officers susan who longed to do something however small to please him determined to take this book to its destination leaving mrs davies with a strict injunction not to stir from mr eden's room till she came back she went to the prison and knocked timidly at the great door it was opened instantly and as susan fancied fiercely by a burly figure susan suppressing an inclination to run away asked tremulously does mr fry live here yes can i speak to him yes come in miss susan stepped in the man slammed the door susan wished herself on its other side my name is fry what is your pleasure with me mr fry i am so glad i have found you i am come here from a friend of yours from a friend of mine said fry with a mystified air yes from mr eden here is the book mr fry poor mr eden could not bring it you himself but you see he has written your name on the cover with his own hand fry took the book from susan's hand and in so doing observed that she was lovely so to make her a return for bringing him uncle tom and for being so pretty fry for once in his life felt generous and repaid her by volunteering to show her the prison indulgent fry to his surprise susan did not jump at this remuneration on the contrary she said hastily oh no no no then seeing by his face that her new acquaintance thought her a madwoman she added that is yes i think i should like to see it a little a very little but if i do you must keep close by me mr fry why of course i shall keep with you replied fry somewhat contemptuously no strangers admitted except in company of an officer susan still hung fire but you mustn't go to show me the very wicked ones why they are all pretty much of a muchness for that i mean the murderers i couldn't bear such a sight got none said fry sorrowfully parted with the last of that sort four months ago up at eight down at nine you understand miss happily susan did not understand this brutal allusion and not to show her ignorance she said nothing but passed to a second stipulation and mr fry i know the men that set fire to farmer dean's ricks are in this jail i won't see them they would give me such a turn for that seems to me the next crime after murder to destroy the crops after the very weather has spared them fry smiled superior then he said sarcastically don't you be frightened some of our lot are beauties your friend the parson is as fond of some of 'em as a cow is of her calf oh then show me those ones fry took her to one or two cells whenever he opened a cell door she always clutched him on both ribs and this tickled fry so did her simplicity at last he came to robinson's cell in here there is a sulky chap oh then let us go on to the next but this is one his reverence is uncommon fond of said fry with a sneer and a chuckle so he flung open the door and if the man had not hung his head susan would hardly have recognized in his uniform corduroy and close cropped hair the vulgar adonis who had sat glittering opposite her at table the last time they met after the interview which i have described susan gratified fry by praising the beautiful cleanliness of the prison and returned leaving a pleasant impression even on this rough hide and uncle tom behind her when she got home she found her patient calm but languid while she was relating her encounter with robinson and her previous acquaintance with him the knock of a born fool at a sick man's door made them all start it was rutila with a long letter bearing an ample seal mr eden took it with brightening eye read it and ground it almost convulsively in his hand asses cried he but the next moment he groaned and bowed his head her majesty's secretary's secretary's secretary had written to tell him that his appeal for an inquiry had traveled out of the regular course it ought to have been made in the first instance to the visiting justices whose business it was to conduct such inquiries and that it lay with these visiting justices to apply to the home office for an extraordinary inquiry if they found they could not deal with the facts in the usual way the office therefore had sent copies of his memorial to each of the visiting justices who at their next inspection of the jail would examine into the alleged facts and had been requested to insert the results in their periodical report mr eden sat up in bed his eye glittering bring me my writing desk it was put on the bed before him but with many kind injunctions not to worry himself he promised faithfully he wrote to the home office in this style a question of life and death cannot be played with as you have inconsiderately proposed nor can a higher jurisdiction transfer an appeal to a lower one without the appellant's consent such a course is still more out of order when the higher judge is a salaried servant of the state and the lower ones are amateurs this was so self evident that i did not step out of the direct line to cast reflections upon unpaid servants you have not seen what is self evident you drive me therefore to explanations i offered you evidence that this jailer is a felon who has hoodwinked the visiting justices and has deceived you but between you and the justices is this essential difference they have been hoodwinked in spite of their own eyes their own ears and contact with that mass of living and dying evidence the prisoners you have been deceived without a single opportunity of learning the truth therefore i appealed and do appeal not to convicted incompetency but to those whose incompetency remains to be proved perhaps you will understand me better if i put it thus i still accuse the jailer of more than a hundred felonious assaults upon prisoners of attacks upon their lives by physical torture by hunger thirst preposterous confinement in dark dungeons and other illegal practices and i now advance another step and accuse the visiting justices of gross dereliction of their duty of neglecting to ascertain the real practice of the jailer in some points and in others of encouraging aiding and abetting him in open violations of the prison rules printed and issued by act of parliament of these rules which are the jail code i send you a copy i note the practices of the jail by the side of the rules of the jail by comparing the two you may calculate the amount of lawless cruelty perpetrated here in each single day then ask yourself whether an honest man who is on the spot can wait four or five months till justice crippled by routine comes hobbling instead of sweeping to their relief for heaven's sake bring to bear upon a matter vital to the state one half the intelligence zeal and sense of responsibility you will throw this evening into some ambiguous question of fleeting policy of speculative finance here are one hundred and eighty souls to whose correction cure and protection the state is pledged no one of all these lives is safe a single day in six weeks i have saved two lives that were gone but for me i am now sick and enfeebled by the exertions i have had to make to save lives and am in no condition to arrest the progress of destruction i tell you that more lives will fall if you do not come to my aid at once and for every head that falls from this hour i hold you responsible to god and the state if i fail to prove my several accusations as a matter of course i shall be dismissed from my office deservedly and this personal risk entitles me not only to petition for but to demand an inquiry into the practice of jail and in the queen's name whose salaried servant i am i do demand it on the instant and on the spot thus did flesh and blood address gutta percha the excitement of writing this letter did the patient no good a reaction came and that night his kind nurses were seriously alarmed about him they sent for the surgeon who felt his pulse and his skin and looked grave however he told them there was no immediate danger and wrote a fresh prescription the patient would eat nothing but bread and water and gruel but he took all the doctor's medicines which were raking ones only at each visit and prescription he cross examined him as to what effect he hoped to produce by his prescription and compared the man's expectations with the result this process soon brought him to the suspicion that in his case aesculapius's science was guess work but we go on hoping and hoping something from traditional remedies even when they fail and fail and fail before our eyes he was often light headed and vented schemes of charity and benevolence ludicrous by their unearthly grandeur one day he was more than light headed he was delirious and frightened his kind nurses and to this delirium succeeded great feebleness and this day for the first time susan made up her mind that it was heaven's will earth should lose this man of whom in truth earth was scarce worthy she came to his side and said tenderly let me do something for you shall i read to you or sing you a hymn her voice had often soothed and done him good tell me what i can do for you the man smiled gratefully then looked imploringly in her eyes and said dear susan go for me into the prison and pay strutt and robinson each a visit strutt the longest he is the oldest poor things they miss me sadly susan made no foolish objection she did what she was asked and came back and told him all they had said and all she had said and how kind everybody was to her in the prison and how they had all asked how he was to day they are very good said he feebly soon after he dosed and susan who always wore a cheerful look to his face could now yield to her real feelings she sat at some little distance from the bed and tried to work and every now and then looked up to watch him and again and again her eyes were blinded and she laid down her work for her heart said to her a few short days and you will see him no more mrs davies too was grave and sad she had made the house neat and clean from cellar to garret and now he who should have enjoyed it lay there sick unto death susan said she i doubt i have been sent here to set his house in order against his oh don't tell me that cried susan and she burst into a fit of sobbing for mrs davies had harped her own fear take care he is waking susan he must not see us oh no and the next moment she was by her patient's side with a cheerful look and voice and manner well calculated to keep any male heart from sinking sick or well heavy heart and hopeful face such a nurse was susan merton this kind deception became more difficult every day her patient wasted and wasted and the anxious look that is often seen on a death stricken man's face showed itself mrs davies saw it and susan saw it but the sick man himself as yet had never spoken of his decease and both mrs davies and susan often wondered that he did not seem to see his real state but one day it so happened that he was light headed and greatly excited holding a conversation his eye was flashing and he spoke in bursts and then stopped a while and seemed to be listening in irritation to some arguments with which he did not agree the enthusiast was building a prison in the air a prison with a farm a school and a manufactory attached here were to be combined the good points of every system and others of his own yes said he in answer to his imaginary companion there shall be both separation and silence for those whose moral case it suits for all perhaps at first but not for all always away with your morrison's pill system your childish monotony of moral treatment in cases varying and sometimes opposed yes but i would i would allow a degree of intercourse between such as were disposed to confirm each other in good watch them why of course and closely too intelligent labor for every creature in the place no tickets of leave to let the hypocritical or self deceiving ones loose upon the world no i test their repentance first with a little liberty how why fly them with a string before i let them fly free occupation provided outside the prison gates instead of ticket of leave let the candidate work there on parole and come into the prison at night some will break parole and run away all the better then you know their real character telegraph them you began by photographing them send their likenesses to every town catch them cell them indeed and pray what would these same men have done had you given them the ticket of leave instead by the present plan your pseudo convert commits a dozen crimes before his hypocrisy is suspected by ours a single offense warns you and arms you against him systems avail less than is supposed for good or ill all depends on your men not your machinery we have got rid of the old patch that rotted our new garment when i first was chaplain of a jail his mind had gone forward some years then we were mad thought a new system could be worked by men of the past by jailers and turnkeys belonging to the dark and brutal age that came before ours those dark days are passed now we have really a governor and warders instead of jailers and turnkeys the nation has discovered these are high offices not mean ones yes lepel yes our officers are men picked out of all england for intelligence and humanity they co operate with me our jail is one of the nation's eyes it is a school thank heaven it is not a dungeon i am in bed with these last words he had come to himself and oh the sad contrast butcherly blockheads in these high places and himself lying sick and powerless unable to lift a hand for the cause he loved the sigh that burst from him seemed to tear his very heart but the very next moment he put his hands humbly together and said god's will be done yet one big tear gathered in his lion eye and spite of all trickled down his cheek while he said god's will be done susan saw it and turned quickly away and hid her face but he called her and though his lip quivered his voice was pretty firm dear friend god can always find instruments the good work will be done though not by me so then susan judged by these few words and the tear that trickled from his closed eyes that he saw what others saw and did not look to live now she left the room in haste not to agitate him by the sorrow she could no longer restrain or conceal the patient lay quiet languidly dozing now about four o'clock in the afternoon the surgeon came to the door but what surprised susan was that a man accompanied him whom she only just knew by sight and who had never been there before the turnkey hodges the pair spoke together in a low tone and susan who was looking down from an upper window could not hear what they said but the discussion lasted a minute or two before they rang the bell susan came down herself and admitted them but as she was leading the way upstairs her aunt suddenly bounced out of the parlor looking unaccountably red and said i will go up with them susan susan said if you like aunt but felt some little surprise at mrs davies's brisk manner at the sick man's door mrs davies paused and said dryly with a look at hodges who shall i say is come with you mr hodges one of the warders is come to inquire after his reverence's health replied the surgeon smoothly i must ask him first whether he will receive a stranger admit him was mr eden's answer the men entered the room and were welcomed with a kind but feeble smile from the sick man sit down hodges the surgeon felt his pulse and wrote a prescription for it is a tradition of the elders that at each visit the doctor must do some overt act of medicine after this he asked the patient how he felt mr eden turned an eloquent look upon him in reply i must speak to hodges said he come near me hodges said he in a kind voice perhaps i may not have any more opportunities of giving you a word of friendly exhortation here a short dissatisfied contemptuous grunt was heard at the window seat did you speak mrs davies no i didn't was the somewhat sharp reply we should improve every occasion mrs davies and i want this poor man to know that a dying man may feel happy and hope everything from god's love and mercy if he has loved and pitied his brothers and sisters of adam's race when he called himself a dying man hodges who was looking uncomfortable and at the floor raised his head and the surgeon and he interchanged a rapid look it was observed though not by mr eden that gentleman seeing hodges wear an abashed look which he misunderstood and aiming to improve him for the future not punish him for the past said but first let me thank you for coming to see me and with these words he put his hand out of the bed with a kind smile to hodges his gentle intention was roughly interrupted mrs davies flung down her work and came like a flaming turkey cock across the floor in a moment and seized his arm and flung it back into the bed no ye don't ye shan't give your hand to any such rubbish mrs davies yes mrs davies you don't know what they've come here for i overheard ye at the door you have got an enemy in that filthy jail haven't you sir well this man comes from him to see how bad you are they were colloguing together backward and forward ever so long and i heard 'em it is not out of any kindness or good will in the world now suppose you march out the way you came in screamed mrs davies mrs davies be quiet and let me speak of course i will sir said the woman with a ludicrously sudden calm and coaxing tone there was a silence mr eden eyed the men small guilt peeped from them by its usual little signs mr eden's lip curled magnificently so you did not come to see me you were sent by that man mrs davies be quiet curiosity is not a crime like torturing the defenseless mr hawes sent you that you might tell him how soon his victims are like to lose their only earthly defender the men colored and stammered mrs davies covered her face with her apron and rocked herself on her chair mr eden flowed gently on tell your master that i have settled all my worldly affairs and caused all my trifling debts to be paid tell him that i have made my will i have provided in it for the turnkey evans he will know why tell him you found my cheeks fallen away my eye hollow and my face squalid tell him my bible was by my side and even the prison was mingling with other memories as i drifted from earth and all its thorns and tears all was blunted but the christian's faith and trust in his redeemer tell him that there is a cold dew upon my forehead tell him that you found me by the side of the river jordan looking across the cold river to the heavenly land where they who have been washed in the blood of the lamb walk in white garments and seem even as i gaze to welcome and beckon me to join them and then tell him cried he in a new voice like a flash of lightning that he has brought me back to earth you have come and reminded me that if i die a wolf is waiting to tear my sheep i thank you and i tell you roared he as the lord liveth and as my soul liveth i will not die but live and do the lord's work and put my foot yet on that caitiff's neck who sent you to inspect my decaying body you poor tools the door he was up in the bed by magic towering above them all and he pointed to the door with a tremendous gesture and an eye that flamed mrs davies caught the electric spark in a moment she tore the door open and the pair bundled down the stairs before that terrible eye and finger susan susan susan heard his elevated voice and came running in in great anxiety they say there is no such thing as friendship between a man and a woman prove to me this is a falsehood it is sir do me a service ah what is it go a journey for me i will go all round england for you mr eden cried the girl panting and flushing my writing desk it is to a village sixty miles from this but you will be there in four hours in that village lives the man who can cure me if any one can what will you take with you asked mrs davies all in a bustle a comb and brush and a chemise i'll have them down in a twinkling the note was written take this to his house see him tell him the truth and bring him with you to morrow it will be fifty pounds out of his pocket to leave his patients but i think he will come oh yes he will come for auld lang syne good by mr eden god bless you aunt i want to be gone i shall bring him if i have to carry him in my arms and with these words susan was gone now good mrs davies give me the bible often has that book soothed the torn nerves as well as the bleeding heart and let no one come here to grieve or vex me for twenty four hours and fling that man's draught away i want to live mrs davies had heard hodges and fry aright mr eden by her clew had interpreted the visit aright with this exception that he overrated his own importance in mr hawes's eyes for hawes mocked at the chaplain's appeal to the home office ever since the office had made his tools the virtual referees still a shade of uneasiness remained during the progress of this long duel eden had let fall two disagreeable hints one was that he would spend a thousand pounds in setting such prisoners as survived hawes's discipline to indict him and the other that he would appeal to the public press this last threat had touched our man of brass for if there is one thing upon earth that another thing does not like your moral malefactor who happens to be out of the law's reach hates and shivers at the new bailey in printing house yard so upon the whole mr hawes thought that the best thing mr eden could do would be to go to heaven without any more fuss yes that will be the best for all parties he often questioned the doctor in his blunt way how soon the desired event might be expected to come off if at all the doctor still answered per ambages ut mos oraculis i see i must go myself no i won't i'll send fry ah here is hodges go and see the parson and come back and tell me whether he is like to live or like to die mr sawyer here can't speak english about a patient he would do it to oblige me if he could but him he can't don't much like the job demurred hodges sulkily what matters what you like you must all do things you don't like in a prison or get into trouble more accustomed to obey than to reflect hodges yielded but at mr eden's very door his commander being now out of sight his reluctance revived and this led to an amicable discussion in which the surgeon made him observe how very ferocious and impatient of opposition the governor had lately become he can get either of us dismissed if we offend him so the pair of cowards did what they were bid and got themselves trod upon a bit it only remains to be said that as they trudged back together a little venom worked in their little hearts they hated both duelists one for treating them like dogs the other for sending them where they had got treated like dogs and they disliked each other for seeing them treated like dogs one bitterness they escaped it did not occur to them to hate themselves for being dogs if you force a strong willed stick out of its bent with what fury it flies back ad statum quo or a little farther when the coercion is removed so hard grained hawes his fears of the higher powers removed returned with a spring to his intermitted habits there was no incarnate obstacle now to discipline there was a provisional chaplain but that chaplain was worthy mr jones who having visited the town for a month had consented for a week or two to supply the sick man's place and did supply it so far as a good clock can replace a man viewing himself now as something between an officer and a guest he was less likely to show fight than ever earnest hawes pilloried flung into black dungeons stole beds and gas light crushed souls with mysterious threats and bodies with a horrible mixture of those tortures that madden and those other tortures that exhaust no spanish inquisitor was ever a greater adept at this double move than earnest hawes the means by which he could make any prisoner appear refractory have already been described but in the case of one stout fellow whom he wanted to discipline he now went a step farther he slipped into the yard and slyly clogged one of the cranks with a weight which he inserted inside the box and attached to the machinery this contrivance would have beaten hercules and made him seem idle to any one not in the secret in short this little blockhead bade fair to become one of mr carlyle's great men he combined the earnest sneak with the earnest butcher barbarous times are not wholly expunged as book makers affect to fear legislators moralists and writers i don't include book makers under that title try to clap their extinguishers on them with god's help but they still contrive to shoot some lurid specimens of themselves into civilized epochs such a black ray of the narrow self deceiving stupid bloody past was earnest hawes not a tithe of his exploits can be recorded here for though he played upon many souls and bodies he repeated the same notes hunger thirst the blackness of darkness crucifixion solitude loss of sleep so that a description of all his feats would be a catalogue of names subjected to the above tortures and be dry as well as revolting i shall describe therefore only the grand result of all and a case or two that varied by a shade the monotony of discipline he kept one poor lad without any food at all from saturday morning till sunday at twelve o'clock and made him work and for his sunday dinner gave the famished wretch six ounces of bread and a can of water he strapped one prisoner up in the pillory for twenty four hours and directed him to be fed in it this prisoner had a short neck and the cruel collar would not let him eat so that the tortures of tantalus were added to crucifixion the earnest beast put a child of eleven years old into a strait waistcoat for three days then kept him three days on bread and water and robbed him of his bed and his gas for fourteen days we none of us know the meaning of these little punishments so vast beyond our experience but in order to catch a glimmer of the meaning of the last item we must remember first that the cells admit but little light and that the gas is the prisoner's sunlight for the hour or two of rest from hard toil that he is allowed before he is ordered to bed and next that a prisoner has but two sets of clothes those he stands upright in and his bed clothes these are rolled up inside the bed every morning when therefore a prisoner was robbed of his bed he was robbed of the means of keeping himself warm as well as of that rest without which life soon comes to a full stop having victimized this child's tender body as aforesaid mr hawes made a cut at his soul he stopped his chapel one ought not to laugh at a worm coming between another worm and his god and saying no you shall not hear of god to day you have displeased a functionary whose discipline takes precedence of his and it is to be observed that though this blockhead did not in one sense comprehend the nature of his own impious act any more than a hottentot would yet as broad as he saw he saw keenly the one ideaed man wanted to punish and deprivation of chapel is a bitter punishment to a prisoner under the separate and silent system and lay this down as a rule whenever in this tale a punishment is recorded as having been inflicted by hawes however light it may appear to you who never felt it bring your intelligence to bear on it weigh the other conditions of a prisoner's miserable existence it was added to and in every case you will find it was a blow with a sledge hammer in short to comprehend hawes and his fraternity it is necessary to make a mental effort and comprehend the meaning of the word accumulation the first execution of biped carter took place about a week after mr eden was laid prostrate it is not generally very difficult to outwit an imbecile and the governor enmeshed carter made him out refractory and crucified him the poor soul did not hallo at first for he remembered they had not cut his throat the last time as he thought they were going to do he had seen a pig first made fast then stuck but when the bitter cramps came on he began to howl and cry most frightfully so that hawes who was talking to the surgeon in the center of the building started and came at once to the place mr sawyer came with him they tried different ways of quieting him in vain they went to a distance as mr eden had suggested but it was no use he was howling now from pain not fear gag him roared hawes it is scandalous i hate a noise better loose him suggested the surgeon hawes blighted him with a look what and let him beat me there is no gag in the prison said fry a pretty prison without a gag in it said hawes the only reflection he was ever heard to cast on his model jail then with sudden ferocity he turned on sawyer what is the use of you don't you know anything for your money can't all your science stop this brute's windpipe you science thus blandly invoked came to the aid of inhumanity humph have you got any salt salt roared hawes what is the use of salt oh ay i see run and get a pound and look sharp with it they brought the salt now will you hold your noise then give it him the scientific operator watched his opportunity and when the poor biped's mouth was open howling crammed a handful of salt into it he spat it out as well as he could but some of it dissolved by the saliva found its way down his throat the look of amazement and distress that followed was most amusing to the operators that was a good idea doctor cried hawes the triumph was premature carter's cries were choked for a moment by his astonishment but the next finding a fresh torture added to the first he howled louder than ever then the governor seized the salt powdered a good handful and avoiding his teeth crammed it suddenly into the poor creature's mouth he spat it furiously out and the brine fell like sea spray upon all the operators especially on hawes who swore at the biped and called him a beast and promised him a long spell of the cross for his nastiness after hawes fry must take his turn and so now these three creatures to whom heaven had given reason combined their strength and their sacred reason to torture and degrade one of those whom the french call betes du bon dieu a heaven afflicted heaven pitied brother they respected neither the hapless wight nor his owner whenever he opened his mouth with the instinct that makes animals proclaim their hurts and appeal for pity on the chance of a heart being within hearing then did these show their sense of his appeal thus one of the party crammed the stinging salt down his throat the others watched him and kept clear of the brine that he spat vehemently out and a loud report of laughter followed instantly each wild grimace and convulsion of fear and torture thus they employed their reason and flouted as well as tortured him who had less haw haw haw haw haw no lightning came down from heaven upon these merry souls the idiot's spittle did not burn them when it fell on them all the worse for them they left carter for hours in the pillory and soon a violent thirst was added to his sufferings prolonged pain brings on cruel thirst and many a poor fellow suffered horribly from it during the last hours of his pillory but in this case the salt he had swallowed made it more vehement most men go through life and never know thirst it is a frightful torture as any novice would have learned who had seen carter at six in the evening of this cruel day the poor wretch's throat was so parched he could hardly breathe his eyes were all bloodshot and his livid tongue lolled stringless and powerless out of his gasping mouth he would have given diamonds for drops of water the earnest man going his rounds of duty saw his pitiable state and forbade relief till the number of hours he had appointed for his punishment should be completed discipline before all there was one man in the jail just one who could no longer view this barbarity unmoved his heart had been touched and his understanding wakened and he saw these prodigies of cruelty in their true light but he was afraid of hawes and unfortunately the others by an instinct felt their comrade was no longer one of them and watched him closely but his intelligence was awakened with his humanity after much thought he hit upon this he took the works out of his watch an old hunting watch and stolling into the yard dipped the case into the bucket then closed it and soon after getting close to carter and between him and fry he affected to examine the prisoner's collar and then hastily gave him a watchful of cold water carter sucked it with frightful avidity and small as the draught was no mortal can say what consequences were averted by it evans was dreadfully out of spirits his ally lay dying and his enemy triumphed he looked to be turned out of the jail at the next meeting of magistrates but when he had given the idiot his watch to drink out of an unwonted warmth and courage seemed to come into his heart this touch of humanity coming suddenly among the most hellish of all fiends men of system was like the little candle in a window that throws its beams so far when we are bewildered in a murky night for the place was now a moral coal hole the dungeons at rome that lie under the wing of roderick borgia's successors are not a more awful remnant of antiquity or a fouler blot on the age on the law on the land and on human nature a thick dark pall of silence and woe hung over its huge walls if a voice was heard above a whisper it was sure to be either a cry of anguish or a fierce command to inflict anguish two or three were crucified every day the rest expected crucifixion from morning till night no man felt safe an hour no man had the means of averting punishment all were at the mercy of a tyrant threats frightful fierce and mysterious hung like weights over every soul and body whenever a prisoner met an officer he cowered and hurried crouching by like a dog passing a man with a whip in his hand and as he passed he trembled at the thunder of his own footsteps and wished to heaven they would not draw so much attention to him by ringing so clear through that huge silent tomb when an officer met the governor he tried to slip by with a hurried salute lest he should be stopped abused and sworn at the earnest man fell hardest upon the young boys and children were favorite victims but his favorites of all were poor robinson and little josephs these were at the head of the long list he crucified he parched he famished he robbed of prayer of light of rest and hope he disciplined the sick he closed the infirmary again that large room furnished with comforts nurses and air was an inconsistency a new prison is a collection of cells said hawes the infirmary was a spot in the sun the exercise yard in this prison was a twelve box stable for creatures concluded to be wild beasts the labor yard was a fifteen stall stable for ditto the house of god an eighty stalled stable into which the wild beasts were dispersed for public worship made private here in early days before hawes was ripe they assembled apart and repeated prayers and sang hymns on sunday but hawes found out that though the men were stabled apart their voices were refractory and mingled in the air and with their voices their hearts might who knows he pointed this out to the justices who shook their skulls and stopped the men's responses and hymns these animals cut the choruses out of the english liturgy with as little ceremony and as good effect as they would have cut the choruses out of handel's messiah if the theory they were working had been a musical instead of a moral one so far so good but the infirmary had escaped justice shallow and justice woodcock hawes abolished that discipline before all not because a fellow is sick is he to break discipline so the sick lay in their narrow cells gasping in vain for fresh air gasping in vain for some cooling drink or some little simple delicacy to incite their enfeebled appetite the dying were locked up at the fixed hour for locking up and found dead at the fixed hour for opening how they had died no one knew at what hour they had died no one knew whether in some choking struggle a human hand might have saved them by changing a suffocating position or the like no one knew but this all knew that these our sinful brethren had died not like men but like vultures in the great desert they were separated from their kith and kin who however brutal would have said a kind word and done a tender thing or two for them at that awful hour and nothing allowed them in exchange not even the routine attentions of a prison nurse they were in darkness and alone when the king of terrors came to them and wrestled with them all men had turned their backs on them no creature near to wipe the dews of death to put a cool hand to the brow or soften the intensity of the last sad sigh that carried their souls from earth thus they passed away punished lawlessly by the law till they succumbed and then since they were no longer food for torture ignored by the law and abandoned by the human race they locked up one dying man at eight o'clock at midnight the thirst of death came on him he prayed for a drop of water but there was none to hear him parched and gasping the miserable man got out of bed and groped for his tin mug but before he could drink the death agony seized him when they unlocked him in the morning they found him a corpse on the floor with the mug in his hand and the water spilled on the floor they wrenched the prison property out of its dead hand and flung the carcass itself upon the bed as if it had been the clay cast of a dog not the remains of a man all was of a piece the living tortured the dying abandoned the dead kicked out of the way of these three the living were the most unfortunate and among the living robinson and josephs never since the days of cain was existence made more bitter to two hapless creatures than to these above all to josephs his day began thus between breakfast and dinner he was set five thousand revolutions of a heavy crank when he could not do it his dinner was taken away and a few crumbs of bread and a can of water given him instead between his bread and water time and six o'clock if the famished worn out lad could not do five thousand more revolutions and make up the previous deficiency he was punished ad libitum as the whole thing from first to last was beyond his powers he never succeeded in performing these preposterous tasks he was threatened vilified and tortured every day and every hour of it human beings can bear great sufferings if you give them periods of ease between and beneficent nature allows for this and when she means us to suffer short of death she lashes us at intervals were it otherwise we should succumb under a tithe of what we suffer intermittently but hawes besides his cruelty was a noodle he belonged to a knot of theorists into whose hands the english jails are fast falling a set of shallow dreamers who being greater dunces and greater asses than four men out of every six that pass you in fleet street or broadway at any hour think themselves wiser than nature and her author josephs suffered body and spirit without intermission the result was that his flesh withered on his bones his eyes were dim and seemed to lie at the bottom of two caverns he crawled stiffly and slowly instead of walking he was not sixteen years of age yet hawes had extinguished his youth and blotted out all its signs but one had you met this figure in the street you would have said what an old man and no beard one day as robinson happened to be washing the corridor with his beaver up what he took for a small but aged man passed him shambling stiffly with joints stiffened by perpetual crucifixion and rheumatism that had ensued from perpetually being wetted through this figure had his beaver down at sight of robinson he started and instantly went down on his knee and untied both shoe strings then while tying them again slowly he whispered robinson i am josephs don't look toward me robinson scrubbing the wall with more vigor than before whispered how are they using you now boy hush don't speak so loud robinson they are killing me the ruffians they are trying all they know to kill me too fry coming hist said robinson as josephs crept away and having scraped off a grain of whitewash with his nail he made a little white mark on his trouser just above his calf for josephs to know him by should they meet next time with visors both down josephs gave a slight and rapid signal of intelligence as he disappeared two days after this they met on the staircase the boy who now looked at every prisoner's trowsers for the white mark recognized robinson at some distance and began to speak before they met i can't go on much longer like this no more can i i shall go to father why where is he he is dead i don't care how soon i go there either but not till i have sent hawes on before not for all the world pass me and then come back they met again keep up your heart boy till his reverence gets well or goes to heaven if he lives he will save us somehow if he dies i'll tell you a secret i know where there is a brick i think i can loosen i mean to smash that beast's skull with it and then you will be all right and my heart will feel like a prince oh don't do that said josephs piteously better far us he should murder us than we him murder cried robinson contemptuously and there was no time to say any more after this many days passed before these two could get a syllable together but one day after chapel as the men were being told off to their several tasks robinson recognized the boy by his figure and jogging his elbow withdrew a little apart josephs followed him and this time robinson was the first speaker we shall never see mr eden alive again boy said he in a faltering voice then in a low gloomy tone he muttered i have loosened the brick the day i lose all hope that day i send hawes home and the thief pointed toward the cellar the day you have no more hope robinson that day has come to me this fortnight and more he tells me every day he will make my life hell to me and i am sure it has been nothing else ever since i came here keep up your heart boy he hasn't long to live he will live too long for me i can't stay here any longer you and i shan't often chat together again perhaps never don't talk so laddie keep up your heart for my sake one bitter tearing sob was all the reply and so these two parted this was just after breakfast at dinner time josephs not having performed an impossible task was robbed of his dinner a little bread and water was served out to him in the yard and he was set on the crank again with fearful menaces in particular mr hawes repeated his favorite threat i'll make your life hell to you josephs groaned but what could a boy of fifteen do overtasked and famished for a month past and fitter now for a hospital than for hard labor of any sort at three o'clock his progress on the crank was so slow that mr hawes ordered him to be crucified on the spot his obedient myrmidons for the fiftieth time seized the lad and crushed him in the jacket throttled him in the collar and pinned him to the wall and this time the first time for a long while the prisoner remonstrated loudly why not kill me at once and put me out of my misery hold your tongue you know i can't do the task you set me you know it as well as i do hold your tongue you insolent young villain strap him tighter fry oh no no no don't go to strap me tighter or you will cut me in half don't mr fry i will hold my tongue sir then he turned his hollow mournful eyes on hawes and said gently it can't last much longer you know it shall last till i break you you obstinate whining dog you are hardly used are you wait till to morrow i'll show you that i have only been playing with you as yet but i have got a punishment in store for you that will make you wish you were in hell hawes stood over the martyr fiercely threatening him the martyr shut his eyes it seemed as though the enraged hawes would end by striking him he winced with his eyes he could not wince with any other part of his body so tight was it jammed together and jammed against the wall hawes however did but repeat his threat of some new torture on the morrow that should far eclipse all he had yet endured and shaking his fist at his helpless body left him with his torture one hour of bitter racking unremitting anguish had hardly rolled over this young head ere his frame weakened by famine and perpetual violence began to give the usual signs that he would soon sham swoon we call it when it occurs to any but a prisoner as my readers have never been in mr hawes's man press and as attempts have been made to impose on the inexperience of the public and represent the man press as restriction not torture i will shortly explain why sooner or later all the men that were crucified in it ended by shamming were you ever seized at night with a violent cramp then you have instantly with a sort of wild and alarmed rapidity changed the posture which had cramped you ay though the night was ever so cold you have sprung out of bed sooner than lie cramped if the cramp would not go in less than half a minute that half minute was long and bitter as for existing cramped half an hour that you never thought possible imagine now the severest cramp you ever felt artificially prolonged for hours and hours imagine yourself cramped in a vise no part of you movable a hair's breadth except your hair and your eyelids imagine the fierce cramp growing and growing and rising like a tide of agony higher and higher above nature's endurance and you will cease to wonder that a man always sunk under hawes's man press now then add to the cramp a high circular saw raking the throat jacket straps cutting and burning the flesh of the back add to this the freezing of the blood in the body deprived so long of all motion whatever for motion of some sort or degree is a condition of vitality and a new and far more rational wonder arises that any man could be half an hour cut sawed crushed cramped mazeppa'd thus without shamming still less be four six eight hours in it and come out a living man the young martyr's lips were turning blue his face was twitching convulsively when a word was unexpectedly put in for him by a bystander the turnkey evans had been half sullenly half sorrowfully watching him for some minutes past a month or two ago the lips of a prisoner turning blue and his skin twitching told evans nothing he saw these things without seeing them he was cruel from stupidity from blockhead to butcher there is but a step like the english public he realized nothing where prisoners were concerned but mr eden had awakened his intelligence and his heart waked with it naturally now when he saw lips turning blue and eyes rolling in sad despair and skin twitching convulsively it occurred to him this creature must be suffering very badly and the next step was let me see what is hurting him so evans now stood over josephs and examined him mr fry said he doggedly is not this overdoing it what d'ye mean we are to obey orders i suppose of course but there was no need to draw the jacket straps so tight as all this boy's bellows can't hardly work for 'em he now passed his hand round the hollow of the lad's back i thought so cried he i can't get my finger between the straps and the poor fellow's flesh and good heavens i can feel the skin rising like a ridge on each side of the straps it is a black burning shame to use any christian like this these words were hardly out of the turnkey's mouth when a startling cry came suddenly from poor josephs a sudden wild piercing scream of misery in that bitter despairing cry burst out the pent up anguish of weeks and the sense of injustice and cruelty more than human the poor thing gave this one terrible cry heaven forbid that you should hear such a one in life as i hear his in my heart and then he fell to sobbing as if his whole frame would burst they were not much these rough words of sympathy but they were the first the first words too of humanity and reason a turnkey had spoken in his favor since he came into this hell above all the first in which it had ever been hinted or implied that his flesh was human flesh the next moment he began to cry but that was not so easy he soon lost his breath and couldn't cry though his very life depended on it tears gave relief dame nature said cry my suffering son cry now and relieve that heart swelling with cruelty and wrong but hawes's infernal machine said no you shall not cry i give you no room to cry in the cruel straps jammed him so close his swelling heart could but half heave the jagged collar bit his throat so hard he could but give three or four sobs and then the next choked him the struggle between nature panting and writhing for relief and the infernal man press was so bitter strong that the boy choked and blackened and gasped as one in the last agony undo him cried evans hastily or we shall kill him among us bucket said the experienced fry quite coolly the bucket was at hand its contents were instantly discharged over josephs' head a cry like a dying hare two or three violent gasps and he was quiet all but a strong shiver that passed from head to foot only with the water that now trickled from his hair down his face scalding tears from his young eyes fell to the ground undistinguished from the water by any eye but god's at six o'clock hawes came into the yard and ordered fry to take him down fry took this opportunity of informing against evans for his mild interference he will pay for that along with the rest said hawes with an oath then he turned on josephs who halted stiffly by him on his way to his cell i'll make your life hell to you you young vagabond you are hardly used are you all you have ever known isn't a stroke with a feather to what i'll make you know by and by wait till to morrow comes you shall see what i can do when i am put to it josephs sobbed but answered nothing and crawled sore stiff dripping shivering to his cell in that miserable hole he would at least be at peace he found the gas lighted he was glad for he was drenched through and bitterly cold he crept up to the little gaslight and put his dead white hands over it and got a little warmth into them he blessed this spark of light and warmth he looked lovingly down on it it was his only friend in the jail his companion in the desolate cell he wished he could gather it into his bosom then it would warm his heart and his blighted flesh and aching shivering bones while he hung shivering over his spark of light and warmth and comfort a key was put into his door ah here's supper thought he and i am so hungry it was not supper it was fry who came in empty handed leaving the door open fry went to his gaslight and put his finger and thumb on the screw oh it burns all right mr fry said josephs it won't go any higher thank you no it won't said fry dryly and turned it out leaving the cell in utter darkness there i told you so said josephs pettishly now you have been and turned it out yes i have been and turned it out replied fry with a brutal laugh and it won't be turned on again for fourteen days so the governor says however and i suppose he knows and fry went out chuckling josephs burst out sobbing and almost screaming at this last stroke it seemed to hurt him more than his fiercer tortures he sobbed so wildly and so loud that mr jones passing on the opposite corridor heard him and beckoned to evans to open the cell they found the boy standing in the middle of his dungeon shaking with cold in his drenched clothes and sobbing with his whole body it was frightful to see and hear the agony and despair of one so young in years so old in misery mr jones gave him words of commonplace consolation mr jones tried to persuade him that patience was the best cure be patient and do not irritate the governor any more the storm will pass he seemed to josephs as one that mocketh jones's were such little words to fling in the face of a great despair to chatter unreasonable consolation was to mock his unutterable misery of soul and body mr jones was one of those who sprinkle a burning mountain with a teaspoonful of milk and water and then go away and make sure they have put it out when he was gone with this impression evans took down the boy's bed and said don't ye cry now like that it makes me ill to hear any christian cry like that oh mr evans oh oh oh oh what have i done oh my mother my mother my mother evans winced what had he a mother too if she could see him now and perhaps he was her darling though he was a prisoner he shook the bed clothes out and took hold of the shivering boy and with kind force made him lie down then he twisted the clothes tight round him you will get warm if you will but lie quiet and not think about it josephs did what he was bid he could not still his sobs but he turned his mournful eyes on evans with a look of wonder at meeting with kindness from a human being and half doubtingly put out his hand so then evans to comfort him took his hand and shook it several times in his hard palm and said good night you'll soon get warm and don't think of it that is the best way and evans ran away in the middle of a sentence for the look of astonishment the boy wore at his humanity went through the man's penitent heart like an arrow josephs lay quiet and his sobs began gradually to go down and as evans had predicted some little warmth began to steal over his frame but he could not comply with all evans's instructions he could not help thinking of it for all that as soon as he got a little warm nature who knew how much her tortured son needed repose began to weigh down his eyelids and he dozed he often started he often murmured a prayer for pity as his mind acted over again the scenes of his miserable existence but still he dozed and sleep was stealing over him sleep life's nurse sent from heaven to create us anew day by day sleep that has blunted and gradually cured a hundred thousand sorrows for one that has yielded to any moral remedy sleep that has blunted and so cured by degrees a million fleshly ills for one that drugs or draughts have ever reached sleep had her arm round this poor child and was drawing him gently gently slowly slowly to her bosom when suddenly his cell seemed to him to be all in a blaze and a rough hand shook him and a harsh voice sounded in his ear come get up out of that youngster it said and the hand almost jerked him off the floor what is the matter inquired josephs yawning matter is i want your bed josephs rose half stupid and hodges rolled up his bed and blanket are you really going to rob me of my bed inquired josephs slowly and firmly rob you you young dog here is the governor's order no bed and gas for fourteen days no bed nor gas for fourteen days ha ha ha ha ha oh you laugh at that do you i laugh at mr hawes thinking to keep me out of bed for fourteen days a poor wornout boy like me you tell hawes i'll find a bed in spite of him long before fourteen days hodges looked about the cell for this other bed come said he you must not chaff the officers the governor will serve you out enough without your giving us any of your sauce hodges was going with the bed josephs stopped him the boy took this last blow quite differently from the gas no impatience or burst of sorrow now won't you bid me good by mr hodges asked he why not good night that isn't what i mean mr evans gave me his hand did he what for and so must you oh you may as well mr hodges i never came to you and took away your little bit of light and your little bit of sleep so you can take my hand if i can give it you you will be sorry afterward if you say no there it is what the better are you for that you young fool i'll tell you what it is you are turning soft i don't know what to make of you i shall come to your cell the first thing in the morning ay do mr hodges said josephs and then you won't be sorry you shook hands at night at this moment the boy's supper was thrust through the trap door it was not the supper by law appointed but six ounces of bread and a can of water hodges now that he had touched the prisoner's hand felt his first spark of something bordering on sympathy he looked at the grub half ashamed and made a wry face josephs caught his look and answered it it is as much as i shall want said he very calmly and he smiled at hodges as he spoke a sweet and tender but dogged smile a smile to live in a man's memory for years the door was closed with a loud snap and josephs was left to face the long night it was now seven o'clock in his wet clothes which smoked with the warmth his late bed had begun to cherish but they soon ceased to smoke as the boy froze night advanced josephs walked about his little cell his teeth chattering then flung himself like a dead log on the floor and finding hawes's spirit in the cold hard stone rose and crawled shivering to and fro again meantime we were all in our nice soft beds such as found three blankets too little added a dressing gown of flannel or print lined with wadding or fleecy hosiery and so made shift in particular all those who had the care of josephs took care to lie warm and soft hawes jones hodges fry justices shallow and woodcock all took the care of their own carcasses they did not take of josephs' youthful frame be cold at night not if we know it why you can't sleep if you are not thoroughly warm chapter xix midnight josephs was crouched shivering under the door of his cell listening all right now i think they are all asleep now is the time hawes hodges jones fry were snoring without a thought of him they had left to pass the live long night clothed in a sponge cradled on a stone dormez messieurs tout est tranquille dormez chapter xx past one o'clock the moon was up but often obscured clouds drifted swiftly across her face it was a cold morning past one o'clock josephs was at his window standing tiptoe on his stool thoughts coursed one another across his broken heart as fast as the clouds flew past the moon's face but whatever their nature the sting was now out of them the bitter sense of wrong and cruelty was there but blunted fear was nearly extinct for hope was dead there was no tumult in his mind now he had gone through all that and had got a step beyond grief or pain thus ran his thoughts i wonder what hawes was going to do with me to morrow something worse than all i have gone through he said that seems hard to believe but i don't know best not give him the chance he does know how to torture one well he must keep it for some other poor fellow i hope it won't be robinson i'll have a look at out a doors first ah there is the moon i wonder does she see what is done here and there is the sky it is a beautiful place who would stay here under hawes if they could get up there god lives up there i am almost afraid he won't let a poor wicked boy like me come where he is and they say this is a sin too he will be angry with me but i couldn't help it i shall tell him what i went through first and perhaps he will forgive me his reverence told me he takes the part of those that are ill used it will be a good job for me if 'tis so perhaps he will serve hawes out for this instead of me i think i should if i was him i know he can't be so cruel as hawes that is my only chance and i'm going to take it some folk live to eighty i am only fifteen that is a long odds i dare say it is five times as long as fifteen it is hard but i can't help it hawes wouldn't let me live to be a man he is stronger than i am will it be a long job i wonder some say it hurts a good deal some think not i shall soon know but i shall never tell that doesn't trouble me it is only throttling when all is done and ain't i throttled every day of my life shouldn't i be throttled to morrow if i was such a spoon as to see to morrow i mustn't waste much more time or my hands will be crippled with cold and then i shan't be able to mr evans will be sorry i can't help it bless him for being so good to me and bless mr eden i hope he will get better i do my handkerchief is old i hope it won't break oh no there is no fear of that i don't weigh half what i did when i came here my mother will fret but i can't help it oh dear oh dear oh dear i hope some one will tell her what i went through first and then she will say 'better so than for my body to be abused worse than a dog every day of my life' i can't help it and i should be dead any way before the fourteen days were out now is as good a time as any other no one is stirring no please forgive me mother i couldn't help it please forgive me god almighty if you care what a poor boy like me does or is done to i couldn't help it il est deux heures tout est tranquille dormez maitres dormez chapter xxi it was a bright morning the world awoke the working englishman dead drunk at the public house overnight had got rid of two thirds of his burning poison by the help of man's chief nurse sleep and now he must work off the rest grumbling at this the kind severity of his lot warm men respectable men among whom justices of the peace and other voluptuous disciplinarians were tempted out of delicious beds by the fragrant berry the balmy leaf snowy damask fire glowing behind polished bars in short by multifarious comfort set in a frame of gold they came down how did you sleep dear sir pretty well said one with a doubtful air scarce closed my eyes all night snarled another another had been awakened by the barking of a dog and it was full half an hour before he could lose the sense of luxurious ease in unconsciousness again he made an incident of this and looked round the table for sympathy and obtained it especially from such as were toadies now all these had slept as much as nature required no ar hyd y nos like a top no eight hours out of the nine the ninth his sufferings had been moderate they had been confined to this a bitter sense of two things first that he was lying floating in a sea of comforts secondly that the moment he should really need sleep sleep was at his service in jail governor turnkeys chaplain having had something to do the day before slept among class and now turned out of their warm beds as they had turned into them without a shade of anxiety or even recollection of him whom they had left last evening at eight to pass the livelong night in a sponge upon a stone up rose refreshed with sleep that zealous officer hawes he was in the prison at daybreak and circulated with inspecting eye all through it went into the kitchen saw the gruel making docked josephs and three more of half their allowance then into the corridors where on one of the snowy walls he found a speck swore had it instantly removed thence into the labor yard and prepared a crank for an athletic prisoner by secretly introducing a weight and so making the poor crank a story teller and the prologue to punishment returning to the body of the prison he called out prisoners on the list for hard labor to be taken to the yard he was not answered with the usual alacrity and looked up to repeat his summons when he observed a cell open and two turnkeys standing in earnest conversation at the door he mounted the stairs in great heat what are you all humbugging there for and why does not that young rascal turn out to work i'll physic him him the turnkeys looked in their chief's face with a strange expression of stupid wonder hawes caught this his wrath rose higher what d'ye stand staring at me like stuck pigs for come out no you all why don't you bring him out to the crank hodges answered gloomily from the cell come and bring him yourself if you can at such an address from a turnkey hawes who had now mounted the last stair gave a snort of surprise and wrath then darted into the cell threatening the most horrible vengeance on the bones and body of poor josephs threats which he confirmed with a tremendous oath but to that oath succeeded a sudden dead stupid staring silence for running fiercely into the cell with rage in his face threats and curses on his tongue he had almost stumbled over a corpse it lay in the middle of the cell stark and cold but peaceful hawes stood over it if he had not stopped short his foot would have been upon it his mouth opened but no sound came he stood paralyzed a greater than he was in that cell and he was dumb he looked up hodges and fry were standing silent looking down on the body fry was grave hodges trembled part of a handkerchief fluttered from the bar of the window a knife had severed it the other fragment lay on the floor near the body where hodges had dropped it hawes took this in at a glance and comprehended it all this was not the first or second prisoner that had escaped him by a similar road for a moment his blood froze in him he wished to heaven he had not been so severe upon the poor boy it was but for a moment the next he steeled himself in the tremendous egotism that belongs to and makes the deliberate manslayer the young viper has done this to spite me said he and he actually cast a look of petulant anger down at this precise point the minds that had borne his company so long began to part from it fry looked in his face with an expression bordering on open contempt and hodges shoved rudely by him and left the cell hodges leaned over the corridor in silence one of the inferior turnkeys asked him a question dictated by curiosity about the situation in which he had found the body don't speak to me was the fierce wild answer and he looked with a stupid wild stare over the railings so wild and white and stricken was this man's face that evans who was exchanging some words with a gentleman on the basement floor happening to catch sight of it interrupted himself and hallooed from below what is there anything the matter hodges hodges made no reply the man seemed to have lost his speech for some time past let us go and see said the gentleman and he ascended the steps somewhat feebly accompanied by evans what is it hodges what is it answered the man impatiently go in there and you'll see what it is i don't like this sir said evans oh i am fearful there is something unfortunate has happened you mustn't come in sir you stay here and i'll go in and see he entered the cell meantime a short conference had passed between hawes and fry this is a bad business fry and no mistake had you any idea of this no can't say i had if the parson ever gets well he will make this a handle to ruin you and me me sir i only obey orders that won't save you if they get the better of me you will suffer along with me i shouldn't wonder i told you you were carrying it too far but you wouldn't listen to me i was wrong fry i ought to have listened to you for you are the only one that is faithful to me in the jail i know my duty sir and i try to do it what are we to do with him fry well i don't think he ought to lie on the floor i'd let him have his bed now i think you are right i'll send for it ah here is evans go for no 's bed evans standing at the door had caught but a glimpse of the object that lay on the floor but that glimpse was enough he went out and said to hodges wasn't it you that took josephs' bed away last night the man cowered under the question well you are to go and fetch it back the governor says hodges went away for it without a word evans returned to the cell he came and kneeled down by josephs and laid his hand upon him i feared it i feared it said he why he has been dead a long time ah your reverence why did you come in when i told you not poor josephs is no more sir mr eden who had already saluted mr hawes with grave politeness though without any affectation of good will came slowly up and sinking his voice to a whisper in presence of death said in pitiful accents poor child he was always sickly six weeks ago i feared we should lose him but he seemed to get better he was now kneeling beside him was he long ill sir asked he of hawes probably he was for he is much wasted i can feel all his bones hardened as they were hawes and fry looked at one another in some confusion presently mr eden started back why what is this he is wet he is wet from head to foot what is the cause of this can you tell me mr hawes mr hawes did not answer but evans did i am afraid it is the bucket your reverence they soused him in the yard late last night did they said mr eden looking the men full in the face then they have the more to repent of this morning but stay why then he was not under the doctor's hands evans la bless you no he was harder worked and worse fed than any man in the jail at work last night then at what hour did he die he is stiff and cold this is a very sudden death did any one see this boy die the men gave no answer but the last words did any one see this boy die seemed to give evans a new light no he cried no one saw him die look here sir see what is dangling from the window his handkerchief and this mark round his throat evans he has destroyed himself and mr eden recoiled from the corpse oh you may forgive him sir said evans we should all have done the same no human creature could live the life they led him who could live upon bread and water and punishment it is a sorrowful sight but it is a happy release for him eh poor lad said evans laying his hand upon the body i liked thee well but i am glad thou art gone thou hast escaped away from worse trouble come it is no use sniveling evans put in hawes i am as sorry for this job as you are but who would have thought he was so determined he gave us no warning don't you believe that sir cried evans to mr eden he gave them plenty of warning i heard him with my own ears tell you you were killing him not a day for the last fortnight he did not tell you so mr hawes well i didn't believe him you see you mean you didn't care hold your tongue evans you are disrespectful how dare you speak to me you insolent dog hold your tongue no sir i won't hold my tongue over this dead body be silent evans said mr eden this is no place for disputes evans my heart is broken while there is life there is hope but here what hope is there many in this place live in crime but this one has died in crime he of whom i had such good hopes has died in crime died by his own hand he has murdered his own soul my heart is broken my heart is broken the good man's anguish was terrible evans consoled him don't go on so sir pray don't josephs is where none of us but you shall ever get to he is in heaven as sure as we are upon earth he was the best lad in the place there wasn't a drop of gall in him who ever heard a bad word from him and he did not kill himself till he found he was to die whether or no so then he shortened his own death struggle and he was right i don't understand you i dare say not sir but those two understand me oh it is no use to look black at me now mr hawes i shall speak my mind though my head was to be cut off i have been a coward i thought too much of my wife and children but i am a man now eh poor lad thou shan't be maligned now thou art dead as well as tormented alive sir he that lies here so pale and calm was not guilty of self destruction he was driven to death don't speak to me sir but look at me and hear the truth as it will come out the day all of us in this cell are damned except you and him the man fell suddenly on his knees took the dead boy's hand in his left hand and held his right up and in this strange attitude which held all his hearers breathless he poured out a terrible tale his boiling heart and the touch of him whom now too late he defended like a man gave him simple but real eloquence and in few words that scalded as they fell he told as powerfully as i have feebly by what road josephs had been goaded to death he brought the dark tale down to where he left the sufferer rolled up in the one comfort left him on earth his bed and then turning suddenly and leaving josephs he said sternly and now sir ask the governor where is the bed i wrapped the wet boy up in for it isn't here you know as much as i do was hawes's sulky reply but at this moment hodges came into the cell with the bed in question in his arms there is his bed cried he and what is the use of it now if you had left it him last night it would be better for him and for me too and he flung the bed on the floor oh it was you took it from him was it said evans well i am here to obey orders jack evans do you do nothing but what you like in this place let there be no disputing in presence of death no sir one thing only is worth knowing or thinking of now whether there is hope for this our brother in that world to which he has passed all unprepared hodges you saw him last alive hodges groaned i saw him last at night and first in the morning i entreat you to remember all that passed at night between you then cover up his face it draws my eyes to it mr eden covered the dead face gently with his handkerchief mr hawes met me in the corridor and sent me to take away his bed i found him dozing and i took i did what i was ordered mr eden sighed tell me what he said and did well sir when i showed him the order 'fourteen days without bed and gas' he bursts out a laughing good heavens and says he 'i don't say for gas but you tell mr hawes i shan't be without bed nothing nigh so long as that' mr eden and evans exchanged a meaning glance so did fry and hawes then i said 'no i shan't tell mr hawes anything to make him punish you any more because you are punished too much as it is' says i i am glad you said that but tell me what he said did he complain did he use angry or bitter words you make me drag it out of you no he didn't he wasn't one of that sort the next thing was he asked me to give him my hand well i was surprised like at his asking for my hand and i doing him such an ill turn so then he said 'mr hodges' says he 'why not i never took away your bed from under you so you can give me your hand if i can give you mine' oh what a beautiful nature ah these are golden words i hope for the credit of human nature you gave him your hand why of course i did sir i had no malice it was ignorance and owing to being so used to obey the governor here mr hawes who had remained quiet all this time now absorbed in his own reflections now listening sullenly to these strange scenes in which the dead boy seemed for a time to have eclipsed his importance burst angrily in i have listened patiently to you mr eden to see how far you would go but i see if i wait till you leave off undermining me with my servants i may wait a long while mr eden turned round impatiently you who thinks of you or such as you in presence of such a question as lies here i am trying to learn the fate of this immortal soul and i did not see you or think of you or notice you were here that is polite well sir the governor is somebody in most jails but it seems he is to be nobody here so long as you are in it and that won't be long come fry we have other duties to attend to so saying he and his lieutenant went out of the cell hodges went too but not with them the moment they were gone well sir burst out evans don't you see that the real murderer is not that stupid ignorant owl hodges hush evans this is no time or place for unkindly thoughts thank heaven that you are free from their guilt and leave me alone with him he was left alone with the dead evans looked through the peep hole of the cell an hour later he was still on his knees fearing hoping vowing and above all praying beside the dead chapter xxii mr eden when he reappeared in the prison was sallow and his limbs feeble but his fatal disease was baffled and a few words are due to explain how this happened the malvern doctor came back with susan within twenty hours of her departure she ushered him into mr eden's room with blushing joy and pride the friends shook hands mr eden thanked him for coming and the doctor cut him short by demanding an accurate history of his disorder and the remedies that had been applied mr eden related the rise and progress of his complaint and meantime the doctor solved the other query by smelling a battalion of empty phials the old story said he with a cheerful grin you were weak therefore they gave you things to weaken you you could not put so much nourishment as usual into your body therefore they have been taking strength out lastly the coats of your stomach were irritated by your disorder so they have raked it like blazes this is the mill round of the old medicine from irritation to inflammation from inflammation to mortification and decease of the patient now instead of irritating the irritated spot suppose we try a little counter irritation with all my heart the doctor then wetted a towel with cold water wrung it half dry and applied it to mr eden's stomach this experiment he repeated four times with a fresh towel at intervals of twenty minutes he had his bed made in mr eden's room tell me if you feel feverish toward morning mr eden tossed and turned and the doctor rising found him dry and hot and feverish then he wetted two towels took the sheets off his own bed and placed one wet towel on a blanket then he made his patient strip naked and lie down on this towel which reached from the nape of his neck to his loins ah cried mr eden horrible then he put the other towel over him in front ugh that is worse you are a bold man with your remedies i shiver to the bone you won't shiver long he laid hold of one edge of the blanket and pulled it over him with a strong quick pull and tucked it under him the same with the other side and now mr eden was in a blanket prison a regular strait waistcoat his arms pinned to his sides two more blankets were placed loosely over him mighty fine doctor but suppose a fly or a gnat should settle on my face call me and i'll take him off in about three quarters of an hour dr gulson came to his bedside again how are you now in elysium are you shivering nothing of the kind are you hot nothing of the sort i am elysian please retreat let no mere mortals approach come not near our fairy king murmured the sick man i am oberon slumbering on tepid roses in the garden whence i take my name purred our divine mixing a creed or two well you must come out of this paradise for the present you wouldn't be such a monster as to propose it spite of his remonstances he was unpacked rubbed dry and returned to his own bed where he slept placidly till nine o'clock the next day fresh applications of wet cloths to the stomach and in the evening one of the doctor's myrmidons arrived from malvern the doctor gave him full and particular instructions the next morning mr eden was packed again he delighted in the operation but remonstrated against the term packed said he to them is that the way to speak of a paradisiacal process under which fever and sorrow fly and calm complacency steals over mind and body a slight diminution of all the unfavorable symptoms and a great increase of appetite relieved the doctor's anxiety so far that he left him under white's charge so was the myrmidon called do not alter your diet it is simple and mucilaginous but increase the quantity by degrees he postponed his departure till midnight up to the present time he had made rather light of the case and as for danger he had pooh poohed it with good humored contempt just before he went he said well frank i don't mind telling you now that i am very glad you sent for me and i'll tell you why forty eight hours more of irritating medicines and no human skill could have saved your life ah my dear friend you are my good angel you can have no conception how valuable my life is oh yes i can and you have saved that life yes i am weak still but i feel i shall live you have cured me in popular language i have but between ourselves nobody ever cures anybody nature cures all that are cured but i patted nature on the back the others hit her over the head with bludgeons and brick bats and now you are going i must not keep you or i shall compromise other lives well go and fulfill your mission but first think is there anything i can do in part return for such a thing as this old friend only one that i can think of outlive me old friend a warm and tender grasp of the hand on this and the malvern doctor jumped into a fly and the railway soon whirled him into worcestershire his myrmidon remained behind and carried out his chief's orders with inflexible severity unsoftened by blandishments unshaken by threats in concert with susan he closed the door upon all harassing communications one day evans came to tell the invalid how the prisoners were maltreated susan received him wormed from him his errand and told him mr eden was too ill to see him which was what my french brethren call une sainte mensonge i a fib a slow but steady cure was effected by these means applications of water in various ways to the skin simple diet and quiet a great appetite soon came he ate twice as much as he had before the new treatment and would have eaten twice as much as he did but the myrmidon would not let him whenever he was feverish the myrmidon packed him and in half an hour the fever was gone his cheeks began to fill his eyes to clear and brighten only his limbs could not immediately recover their strength as he recovered his anxiety to be back among his prisoners increased daily but neither susan nor the myrmidon would hear of it they acted in concert and stuck at nothing to cure their patient they assured him all was going on well in the prison they meant well but for all that every lie great or small is the brink of a precipice the depth of which nothing but omniscience can fathom he believed them yet he was uneasy and this uneasiness increased with his returning strength at last one morning happening to awake earlier than usual he stole a march on his nurses and taking his stick walked out and tottered into the jail he found josephs dead under the fangs of hawes and the whole prison groaning now the very day his symptoms became more favorable it so happened that he had received a few lines from the home office that had perhaps aided his recovery by the hopes they inspired the matter of your last communication is forwarded to the 'inspector of prisons' he is instructed to inquire strictly into your statements and report to this office the short note concluded with an intimation that the tone in which mr eden had conveyed his remonstrances was intemperate out of place and without precedent mr eden was rejoiced the inspector of prisons was a salaried officer of the crown enlightened by a large comparison of many prisons and residing at a distance was not open to the corrupting influences of association and personal sympathy with the governor as were the county magistrates day after day mr eden rose in hope that day would not pass without the promised visit from the inspector of prisons day after day no inspector at last mr eden wrote to him to inquire when he was coming the letter traveled about after him and after a considerable delay came his answer it was to this effect that he was instructed to examine into charges made against the governor of jail but that he had no instructions to make an irregular visit for that purpose his progress would bring him this year to jail in six weeks' time when he should act on his instructions but these did not justify him in varying from the routine of his circuit six weeks is not long to wait for help in a matter of life and death thought the eighty pounders the clerks who execute england three days of this six weeks had scarce elapsed when two prisoners were driven a step each farther than their wretched fellow sufferers who were to follow them in a week or two of these one a mild quiet docile boy was driven to self slaughter and another one of the best natured rogues in the place was driven to manslaughter this latter incident mr eden prevented i will presently relate how it was not by postponing his interference for six weeks when mr eden rose from his knees beside the slaughtered boy he went home at once and wrote to the home secretary on the envelope he wrote private and inside to this effect two months ago i informed you officially that prisoners are daily assaulted starved and maltreated to the danger of their lives by the governor of jail i demanded of you an inquiry on the spot in reply you evaded my demand and proposed to refer me to the visiting justices in answer i declined these men for referees on two grounds viz that i had lodged an appeal with a higher jurisdiction than theirs and that they were confederates of the criminal and to enforce the latter objection i included your proposed referees in my charges and once more demanded of you in the queen's name an examination of her unworthy servants on the instant and on the spot on this occasion i warned you in these words 'here are souls to whose correction care and protection the state is pledged no one of these lives is safe a single day and for every head that falls from this hour i hold you responsible to god and the state' surely these were no light words yet they fell light on you in answer you promised us the 'inspector of prisons' but you gave him no instructions to come to us you fooled away time when time was human life read once more my words of warning and then read these this morning a boy of fifteen was done to death by mr hawes of his death you are not guiltless you were implored to prevent it you could have prevented it and you did not prevent it the victim of jail cruelty and of the maladministration in government offices lies dead in his cell in three days i shall commit his body to the dust but his memory never until he is avenged and those who are in process of being murdered like him receive the protection of the state if in the three days between this boy's murder and his burial your direct representative and agent does not come here and examine this jail and sift the acts of those who govern it on the fourth day i lay the whole case before her majesty the queen and the british nation by publishing it in all the journals then i shall tell her majesty that having thrice appealed in vain to her representatives i am driven to appeal to herself with this i shall print the evidence i have thrice offered you of this jailer's felonies and their sanguinary results that lady has a character one of its strong unmistakable features is a real tender active humanity i read characters it is a part of my business and believe me this lady once informed of the crimes done in her name will repudiate and abhor alike her hireling's cruelty and her clerks' and secretaries' indifference to suffering and slaughter nor will the public hear unmoved the awful tale shame will be showered on all connected with these black deeds even on those who can but be charged with conniving at them to be exposed to national horror on the same column with the greatest felon in england would be a cruel position a severe punishment for a man of honor whose only fault perhaps is that he has mistaken an itch for eminence for a capacity for business and so serves the state without comprehending it but what else can i do i too serve the state and i comprehend what i owe it and the dignity with which it intrusts me and the deep responsibility it lays on me i therefore cannot assent to future felonies any more than i have to past and present but must stop them and will stop them how i can so sir i offer you the post of honor or a place of shame choose for three whole days you have the choice choose and may god enlighten you and forgive me for waiting these three days i have the honor to be etc etc to this letter whose tone was more eccentric more flesh and blood and without precedent than the last came an answer in a different hand from the others acknowledged receipt of the chaplain's letter since a human life has succumbed under the discipline of jail an inquiry follows immediately as a matter of course the other inducements you have held out are comparatively weak and something more than superfluous how far they are in good taste will be left to your own cooler consideration a person connected with the home department will visit your jail with large powers soon after you receive this he is instructed to avail himself of your zeal and knowledge be pleased to follow this course select for him the plainer facts of your case if on the face of the business he sees ground for deeper inquiry a commission will sit upon the jail and meanwhile all suspected officers will be suspended you will consider yourself still in direct correspondence with this office but it is requested on account of the mass of matter daily submitted to us that your communications may be confined to facts and those stated as concisely as possible on reading this mr eden colored with shame as well as pleasure how gentleman like all this is thought he how calm and superior to me who since i had the jaundice am always lowering my office by getting into a heat and i to threaten this noble dignified creature with the times i am thoroughly ashamed of myself yet what could i do i had tried everything short of bullying and failed but i now suspect never saw my two first letters doubtless the rotten system of our public offices is more to blame than this noble fellow thus accusing himself mr eden returned with somewhat feeble steps to the jail one of the first prisoners he visited was thomas robinson he found that prisoner in the attitude of which he thought he had cured him coiled up like a snake moody and wretched the man turned round with a very bad expression on his face which soon gave way to a look of joy he uttered a loud exclamation and springing unguardedly up dropped a brickbat which rolled toward mr eden and nearly hit him robinson looked confused and his eyes rose and fell from mr eden's face to the brickbat how do you do not so well as before you fell ill sir it has been hard times with us poor fellows since we lost you i fear it has you have just come back in time to save a life or two there is a boy called josephs i hope the day won't go over without your visiting him for they are killing him by inches how do you know that i heard him say so mr eden groaned you look pale my poor fellow i shall be better now replied the thief looking at him affectionately what is this this sir what sir this brick well why it is a brick sir where did you get it i found it in the yard what were you going to do with it oh i wasn't going to do any ill with it then why that guilty look when you dropped it come now i am in no humor to be hard upon you were you going to make some more cards now sir didn't i promise you i never would do that again and robinson wore an aggrieved look would i break a promise i made to you what was it for then am i bound to criminate myself your reverence certainly not to your enemy but to your friend and to him who has the care of your soul yes let me ask you a question first sir which is worth most one life or twenty twenty then if by taking one life you can save twenty it is a good action to put that one out of the way that does not follow oh doesn't it i thought it did there's a man in this prison that murders men wholesale i thought if i could any way put it out of his power to kill any more what a good action it would be a good action so then this brick was for hawes's skull your reverence this then is the fruit of all my teaching you will break my heart among you don't say so sir pray don't say so i won't touch a hair of his head now you are alive but i thought you were dead or dying so what did it matter then what i did besides i was driven into a corner i could only kill that scoundrel or let him kill me but you are alive and you will find some way of saving my life as well as his i will try but first abandon all thoughts of lawless revenge 'vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord' come promise me now sir is it likely i would offend you for the pleasure of dirtying my fingers with that rascal's blood don't let such a lump of dirt as him make mischief between you and me sir i understand with you any unchristian sentiment is easily driven out by another hatred is to give way to contempt no sir but you are alive and i don't think of hawes now one way or other with such scum as that out of sight is out of mind when did you begin to get better sir and are you better and shall i see your blessed face in my cell every day as i used and the water stood in the thief's eyes mr eden smiled and sighed your mind is like an eel heaven help the man that tries to get hold of it to do it any lasting good you and i must have a good pray together some day ah your reverence that would do me good soul and body said mr supple let me now feel your pulse it is very low what is the matter starvation overwork and solitude i feel myself sinking if i could amuse your mind even you could hardly do that sir hum i have brought you a quire of paper and one of mr gillott's swan quill pens and a penny ink bottle what for you are to write a story but i never wrote one in my life then this will be the first oh i'll try sir i've tried a hundred things in my life and they none of them proved so hard as they looked what kind of story the only kind of story that is worth a button a true story the story of thomas robinson alias scott alias lyon alias etc then you should have brought a ream instead of a quire no i want to read it when it is written now write the truth do not dress or cook your facts i shall devour them raw with twice the relish and they will do you ten times the good and intersperse no humbug no sham penitence when your own life lies thus spread out before you like a map you will find you regret many things you have done and view others with calmer and wiser eyes for self review is a healthy process write down these honest reflections but don't overdo it don't write a word you don't feel it will amuse you while you are at it that it will it will interest me more than the romance of a carpet writer who never saw life and it may do good to other prisoners i want to begin i know you do creature of impulse let me feel your pulse again ah it has gained about ten ten your reverence fifty you mean it is you for putting life into a poor fellow and keeping him from despair it is not the first time you have saved me the devil hates you more than all the other parsons for you are as ingenious in good as he is in mischief in the midst of this original eulogy mr eden left the cell suddenly with an aching heart for the man's words reminded him that for all his skill and zeal a boy of fifteen years lay dead of despair hard by he went but he left two good things behind him occupation and hope chapter xxiii the inexperienced in jails would take for granted that the death of josephs gave mr hawes's system a fatal check no such thing he was staggered so was pharaoh staggered several times yet he always recovered himself in twenty four hours hawes did not take so long as that a suicide was no novelty under his system six hours after he found his victim dead he had a man and a boy crucified in the yard swore horribly at fry who for the first time in his life was behind time and tore out of his hands uncle tom which was the topic that had absorbed fry and made him two minutes behind him went home and wrote a note to his friend williams informing him of the suicide that had taken place and reflecting severely upon josephs for his whole conduct with which this last offense against discipline was in strict accordance then he had his grog and having nothing to do he thought he would see what was that story which had prevailed so far over the stern realities of system as to derange that piece of clock work that went by the name of fry he yawned over the first pages but as the master hand unrolled the great chromatic theory he became absorbed and devoured this great human story till his candles burned down in their sockets and sent him to bed four hours later than usual the next morning soon after chapel a gentleman's servant rode up to the jail and delivered a letter for mr hawes it was from justice williams that worthy expressed in polysyllables his sorrow at the death of josephs after this fashion a circumstance of this kind is always to be deplored since it gives occasion to the enemies of the system to cast reflections which however unphilosophical and malignant prejudice superficial judgments against our salutary discipline he then went on to say that the visiting justices would be at the jail the next day at one o'clock to make their usual report in which mr hawes might be sure his zeal and fidelity would not pass unnoticed he concluded by saying that mr hawes must on that occasion present his charges against the chaplain in a definite form and proceedings would be taken on the spot aha aha so i shall get rid of him confound him he makes me harder upon the beggars than i should be fry put these numbers on the cranks and bring me your report after dinner with these words mr hawes vanished and to the infinite surprise of the turnkeys was not seen in the jail for many hours at two o'clock as he was still not in the prison fry went to his house he found mr hawes deep in a book brought the report sir give it to me humph no and refractory at the crank no caught getting up to his window says he wanted to feel the light that is one of the boys isn't it yes sir how old is the young varmint eleven sir no heard to speak to a prisoner that was leaving the jail his term being out what did he say to him said 'good by god bless you' i'll shut his mouth confound the beggars how fond they are of talking i think they would rather go without their food than without their jaw no caught writing a story it is that fellow robinson one of the parson's men i'll write something on his skin how did he get the things to write with chaplain gave them him ah i am glad of that you brought them away of course yes sir here they are he made a terrible fuss about parting with them what did he say he said heaven was to judge between me and him blaspheming dog him i'll break him what else 'get out of my sight' said he 'for fear i do you a mischief' so then down he pops on his knees in a corner and turns his back on me like an ignorant brute that he is never mind fry i'll break him i suppose we shall see you in the prison soon shan't we sir the place looks strange to me without you by and by by and by this confounded book sticks to me like a leech how far had you got when you lent it me got just to the most interesting part said fry dolefully where he comes under a chap called legree and then you took it away well you'll have it again as soon as i have done with it i say what do you think of this book is it true do you think oh it is true i'd take my oath of that why how do you know because it reads like true that is no rule ye fool well sir what do you think this question staggered hawes for a moment however he assumed an oracular look and replied i think some of it is true and some isn't do you think it is true about their knocking down blackee in one lot and his wife in another and sending 'em a thousand miles apart oh that is true enough i daresay and running them down with bloodhounds why not they look upon the poor devils as beasts if you tell a yankee a nigger is a man he thinks you are poking fun at him it is a cursed shame of course it is but i'll tell you what i can't swallow in this book hem did you ever fall in with any yankees one or two sir were they green at all that they weren't they were rather foxy i should say rather why one of them would weather upon any three englishmen that ever were born now here is a book that as good as tells me it is a yankee custom to disable their beasts of burden gammon they can't afford to do it i believe continued this candid personage who had never been in any of the states they are the cruelest set on the face of the earth but then they are the 'cutest that is their own word and they are a precious sight too 'cute to disable the beast that carries the grist to the mill doesn't seem likely now you put it to me have a glass of grog fry thank you sir and there is the paper run your eye over it and don't speak to me for ten minutes for i must see how tom gets on under this bloody minded heathen fry read the paper but although he moistened it with a glass of grog he could not help casting envious glances from his folio at mr hawes's duodecimo fibs mixed with truth charm us more than truth mixed with fibs presently an oath escaped from mr hawes sir nothing it is only this infernal humph presently another expletive i'll tell you what it is fry if somebody doesn't knock this thundering legree on the head i'll put the book on the fire well but if it isn't true sir but it is true every word of it while you are reading it ye fool what heathens there are in the world first they sell a child out of his mother's arms she cuts sooner than be parted they hunt her and come up with her but she knows what they are and trusts her life and the child to one of their great thundering frozen rivers as broad as the british channel sooner than fall into their hands that is like a woman fry a fig for me being drowned if the kid is drowned with me and i don't even care so much for the kid being drowned if i go down with him and the cowardly vermin dogs and men stood barking on the bank and dursn't follow a woman but your cruel ones are always cowards and now the rips have got hold of this tom a chap with no great harm in him that i see except that he is a sniveler and psalm singer and makes you sick at times but he isn't lazy and now they are mauling him because he couldn't do the work of two a man can but do his best black or white and it is infernal stupidity as well as cruelty to torment a fellow because he can't do more than he can do and all this because over the same flesh and blood there is the sixteenth of an inch of skin a different color wonder whether a white bear takes a black one for a hog or a red fox takes a blue one for a badger well fry thank your stars that you were born in britain there are no slaves here and no buying and selling of human flesh and one law for high and low rich and poor and justice for the weak as well as the strong yes sir said fry deferentially are you coming into the jail sir no replied hawes sturdily i won't move till i see what becomes of the negro and what is done to this eternal ruffian but about the prisoners in my report sir remonstrated fry oh you can see to that without my coming replied hawes with nonchalance put and in the jacket four hours apiece mind there's somebody by with the bucket against they sham yes sir put the boy on bread and water and to morrow i'll ask the justices to let me flog him no humph stop his supper and his bed and gas and robinson oh give him no supper at all and no breakfast not even bread and water d'ye hear and at noon i'll put him with his empty belly in the black hole that will cow him down to the ground there be off next morning mr hawes sat down to breakfast in high spirits this very day he was sure to humiliate his adversary most likely get rid of him altogether mr eden on the contrary wore a somber air hawes noticed it mistook it and pointed it out to fry he is down upon his luck he knows he is coming to an end after breakfast mr eden went into robinson's cell he found him haggard oh i am glad you are come sir they are starving me no supper last night no breakfast this morning and all for hum for what well sir then having paper in my cell and for writing doing what you bade me writing my life mr eden colored and winced the cruelty and the personal insult combined almost took away his breath for a moment heaven grant me patience a little longer said he aloud then he ran out of the cell and returned in less than a minute with a great hunch of bread and a slice of ham eat this said he all fluttering with pity the famished man ate like a wolf but in the middle he did stop to say did one man ever save another so often as you have me now my belly is full i shall have strength to stand the jacket or whatever is to come next but you are not to be tormented further than this i hope ah sir replied robinson you don't know the scoundrel yet he is not starving me for nothing this is to weaken me till he puts the weight on that is to crush me i hope you exaggerate his personal dislike to you and your own importance we all do that well sighed robinson i hope i do any way now my belly is full i have got a chance with him the visiting justices met in the jail the first to arrive was mr woodcock in fact he came at eleven o'clock an hour before the others had mr hawes expected him so soon he would have taken carter down who was the pilloried one this morning but he was equal to the emergency he met mr woodcock with a depressed manner as of a tender but wise father who in punishing his offspring had punished himself and said in a low regretful voice i am sorry to say i have been compelled to punish a prisoner very severely what is his offense being refractory and breaking his crank you will find him in the labor yard he was so violent we were obliged to put him in the jacket i shall see him the labor yard is the first place i go to mr hawes knew that mr woodcock the justice found carter in that state of pitiable torture the sight of which made mr eden very ill he went up to him and said my poor fellow i am very sorry for you but discipline must be maintained and you are now suffering for fighting against it make your submission to the governor and then i dare say he will shorten your punishment as far as he thinks consistent with his duty carter it may well be imagined made no answer it is doubtful whether the worthy magistrate expected or required one an occasion for misjudging a self evident case of cruelty had arrived this worthy seized the opportunity received an ex parte statement for gospel and misjudged spite of his senses item an occasion for twaddling had come and this good soul seized it and twaddled into a man's ear who was fainting on the rack at this moment the more observant hawes saw the signs of shamming coming on so he said hastily oh he will come to soon and then he will be taken down and moved away mr woodcock followed him without one grain of suspicion or misgiving the english state has had many opportunities of gauging the average intellects of its unpaid jurists by these it has profited so well that it intrusts blindly to this gentleman and his brethren the following commission they are to come into a place of darkness and mystery a place locked up a place which by the folly of the nation and the shallow egotists who are its placemen and are called its statesmen is not subject to the only safeguard of law and morals daily inspection by the great unprejudiced public they are to come into this the one pitch dark hole that is now left in the land they are to come here once in two months and at this visit to see all that has been done there in the dark since their last visit their eagle eye is not to be hoodwinked by appearances got up to meet their visit they are to come and comprehend with one piercing glance the past months as well as the present hour good only for this task is required not the gullibility that characterizes the many but the sagacity that distinguishes the few mr woodcock undertook not to be deceived as to what had been done in the jail while he was forty miles distant and hawes gulled him under his own eyes what different men there are in the world and how differently are the same things seen by them the first crucifixion eden saw he turned as sick as a dog the first crucifixion woodcock saw he twaddled in the crucified's ear left him on the cross and went on his way well pleased hawes finding what sort of a man he had to deal with thought within himself why should i compromise discipline in any point he said to mr woodcock there is another prisoner whom i am afraid i must give an hour in the dark cell what has he been doing scribbling a lot of lies upon some paper he got from the chaplain mr hawes's brief and unkind definition of autobiography did robinson's business mr woodcock simply observed that the proposed punishment was by no means a severe one for the offense they visited several cells woodcock addressed the prisoners in certain words accompanied with certain tones and looks that were at least as significant as his words and struck the prisoners as more sincere the words if you have anything to complain of here now is the time to say so and your complaint shall be sifted the tones and looks i know you are better off here than such scum as you deserve but you have a right to contradict me if you like only mind if you don't prove it to my satisfaction who am not the man to believe anything you say you had better have held your tongue meantime mr hawes said nothing but fixed his eye on the rogue and that eye said one word of discontent and the moment he is gone i massacre you then followed in every case the old theatrical business according to each rogue's measure of ability they were in the elysian fields one thing alone saddened them some day or other they must return to the world fathers sent by your apprehensive wives to see whether dicky is well used at that school or not don't draw dicky into a corner of the playground and with tender kisses and promises of inviolable secrecy coax him to open his little heart to you and tell you whether he is really happy leave such folly to women it is a weakness to wriggle into the truth as they do no you go like a man into the parlor with the schoolmaster then have dicky in let him see the two authorities together on good terms then ask him whether he is happy and comfortable and well used he will tell you he is go home rejoicing but before you go into the drawing room do pray spend twenty minutes by the kitchen fire and then go upstairs to the boy's mother and let her eat you for you belong to the family of the woodcocks we are passing one cell oh that one is empty replied hawes not quite empty there was a beech coffin standing in that cell and the corpse of a murdered thief lay waiting for it at twelve o'clock the justices were all assembled in their room we will send you a message in half an hour mr hawes mr hawes bowed and retired and bade fry to take robinson to the dark cell the poor fellow knew resistance was useless he came out at the word of command despair written on his face of all the horrors of this hell the dark cell was the one he most dreaded he looked up to hawes to see if anything he could say would soften him no that hardened face showed neither pity nor intelligence as well appeal to a stone statue of a mule at this moment mr eden came into the jail robinson met him on the ground floor and cried out to him sir they are sending me to the black hole for it i am a doomed man the black hole for six hours no roared hawes from above for twelve hours the odd six is for speaking in prison robinson groaned i will take you out in three said mr eden calmly hawes heard and laughed aloud give me your hand on that sir for pity's sake cried robinson mr eden gave him his hand and said firmly i will take you out in two hours please god hawes chuckled parson is putting his foot in it more and more the justices shall know this this momentary contact with his good angel gave robinson one little ray of hope for a companion in the cave of darkness madness and death chapter xxiv the justices went through their business in the usual routine they had mr hawes's book up examined the entries received them with implicit confidence looked for no other source of information to compare them with examined one witness and did not cross examine him this done one of them proposed to concoct their report at once another suggested that the materials were not complete that there was a charge against the chaplain this should be looked into and should it prove grave embodied in their report mr williams overruled this we can reprimand or if need be the bench can dismiss a chaplain without troubling the secretaries of state let us make our report and then look into the chaplain's conduct who is after all a newcomer and they say a little cracked he is a man of learning so they wrote their report and in it expressed their conviction that the system on the whole worked admirably they noticed the incident of josephs' suicide but attached no significance and little importance to it out of a hundred and eighty prisoners there would be a few succumb in one way or another under the system but on the whole the system worked well jugger system's wheels were well greased and so long as they were well greased it did not matter their crushing one or two besides the crushed were only prisoners the refuse of society they reported the governor mr hawes as a painstaking active zealous officer and now mr hawes was called in the report was read to him and he bowed laid his hand upon his aorta and presented a histrionic picture of modest merit surprised by unexpected praise from a high quarter next mr hawes was requested to see the report sent off to the post i will gentlemen and in five minutes he was at the post office in person and his praises on the way to his sovereign or her representative how long will the parson take us oh not ten minutes i hope not for i want to look at a horse we had better send for him at once then the bell was rung and the chaplain sent for the chaplain was praying the prayers for the sick by the side of a dying prisoner he sent back word how he was employed and that he would come as soon as he had done this message was not well received keep a living justice waiting for a dying dog these puppies want taking down said mr woodcock oh leave him to me replied mr williams soon after this the following puppy came into the room a gentleman of commanding figure erect but easy with a head of remarkable symmetry and an eye like a stag's he entered the room quietly but rather quickly and with an air of business bowed rapidly to the three gentlemen in turn and waited in silence their commands then mr williams drew himself up in his chair and wore the solemn and dignified appearance that becomes a judge trying a prisoner with this difference that his manner was not harsh or intentionally offensive but just such as to reveal his vast superiority and irresistible weight in a solemn tone with a touch of pity he began thus i am sorry to say mr eden that grave charges are laid against you in the prison give yourself no uneasiness on my account sir replied mr eden politely they are perhaps false yet they come from one who has means of knowing from the governor mr hawes ah then they are sure to be false we shall see four sundays ago you preached a sermon two ay but one was against cruelty it was the other handled theft mr hawes conceives himself to have been singled out and exposed by that sermon why so there are more than thirty cruel men in this jail besides him then this sermon was not aimed at him put mr williams with a pinning air it was and it was not it was aimed at that class of my parishioners to which he belongs a large class including all the turnkeys but one between twenty and thirty of the greater criminals among the prisoners and mr hawes mr williams bit his lip gentlemen this classification shows the animus then turning to mr eden he said with a half incredulous sneer how comes it that mr hawes took this sermon all to himself mr eden smiled how does it happen that two prisoners and took it all to themselves these two men sent for me after the sermon they were wife beaters i found them both in great agitation one terrified the other softened to tears of penitence these did not apply my words to mr hawes the truth is when a searching sermon is preached each sinner takes it to himself i am glad mr hawes fitted the cap on i am glad the prisoners fitted the cap on i am sorry mr hawes was irritated instead of reformed i am glad those two less hardened sinners were reformed instead of irritated and i must tell you sir that we disapprove of your style of preaching altogether and we shall do more we shall make a change in this respect the condition of your remaining in office and the bishop of the diocese asked mr eden what about him do you think he will allow you an ignorant inexperienced layman to usurp the episcopal function in his diocese the episcopal function mr eden mr eden smiled he does not even see that he has been trying to usurp sacred functions and of the highest order but it is all of a piece a profound ignorance of all law civil or ecclesiastical characterizes all your acts in this jail my good soul just ask yourself for what purpose does a bishop exist why is one priest raised above other priests and consecrated bishop but to enable the church to govern its servants i laugh but i ought rather to rebuke you what you have attempted is something worse than childish arrogance be warned and touch not the sacred vessels so rashly it is profanation the flashing eye and the deepening voice and the old awful ecclesiastical superiority suddenly thundering upon them quite cowed the two smaller magistrates williams whose pomposity the priest had so rudely shaken gasped for breath with rage magisterial arrogance was not prepared for ecclesiastical arrogance and the blow was stunning gentlemen i wish to consult you be pleased to retire for a minute sir a discussion took place in the chaplain's absence williams was for dismissing him on the spot but the others who were cooler would not hear of it we have made a false move said they and he saw our mistake and made the most of it never mind we shall catch him on other ground during this discussion mr eden had not been idle he went into robinson's empty cell and coolly placed there another inkstand pen and quire in the place of those hawes had removed then glancing at his watch he ran hastily out of the jail opposite the gate he found four men waiting they were there by appointment giles said he to one i think a gentleman will come down by the next train go to the station and hire jenkyns's fly with the gray horse let no one have it who is not coming on to the jail you two stay by the printing press and loom till further orders jackson you keep in the way too my servant will bring you your dinner at two o'clock he then ran back to the justices they were waiting for him mr williams began with a cutting coldness we did not wish to go to the length of laying a complaint against you before the bishop but if you really prefer this to a friendly remonstrance i prefer the right thing to the wrong thing was the prompt and calm rejoinder the complaint shall be made mr eden bowed and his eyes twinkled he pictured to himself this pompous personage writing to the bishop of to tell him that he objected to mr eden's preaching not that he had ever heard it but that in attacking a great human vice it had hit a jailer the next i think we can deal with mr hawes complains that you constantly interfere between him and the prisoners and undermine his authority i support him in all his legal acts but i do oppose his illegal ones your whole aim is to subvert the discipline of the jail on the contrary i assure you i am the only officer of the jail who maintains the discipline as by law established am i to understand that you give mr hawes the lie you shall phrase my contradiction according to your own taste sir and which do you think is likeliest to be believed mr hawes by you gentlemen mr eden by the rest of the nation here mr palmer put in his word i don't think we ought to pay less respect to one man's bare assertion than to another's it is a case for proof well but palmer replied woodcock how can the jail go on with these two at daggers drawn it cannot said mr eden ah you can see that a house divided against itself suggested mr eden well then said mr woodcock let us try and give a more friendly tone to this discussion why not our weapons would bear polishing yes you have a high reputation mr eden both for learning and christian feeling in fact the general consideration in which you are held has made us more lenient in this case than we should have been with another man in your office there you are all wrong you can't mean that make us some return for this feeling you know and feel the value of peace and unity i do then be the man to restore them to this place i will try the governor and you cannot pull together one must go clearly well then no stigma shall rest on you you will be allowed to offer us your voluntary resignation excuse me i propose to arrive at peace and unity by another route but i see no other if i turn mr hawes out it will come to the same thing will it not mr hawes mr hawes but you can't turn him out sir sneered williams i think i can he has our confidence and our respect and shall have our protection still i will turn him out with god's help this is a defiance mr eden you cannot really think me capable of defying three justices of the peace said mr eden in a solemn tone his eyes twinkling defiance no said mr palmer innocently well but palmer his opposition to mr hawes is opposition to us and is so bitter that it leaves us no alternative we must propose to the bench to remove you from your office mr eden bowed and meantime put in mr williams we shall probably suspend you this very day by our authority mr eden bowed we will not detain you any longer sir said williams rather insolently i will but stay to say one word to this gentleman who has conducted himself with courtesy toward me sir for your own sake do not enter on this contest with me it is an unequal one a boy has just been murdered in this prison i am about to drag his murderer into the light why hang upon his skirts and compel me to expose you to public horror as his abettor there is yet time to disown the fell practices of hell he looked at his watch there is half an hour do not waste it in acts which our superiors will undo see here are the prison rules a child could understand them a child could see that what you call 'the discipline' is a pure invention of the present jailer and contradicts the discipline as by law established and consequently that josephs and others have been murdered by this lawless man these are the prison rules are they not and here are the jailer's proceedings in the month of january compare the two and separate your honorable name from the contact of this caitiff whose crimes will gibbet him in the nation's eyes and you with him unless you seize this chance and withdraw your countenance from him the three injustices rose by one impulse make your preparations to leave the jail said mr woodcock half an hour is quite enough under the circumstances said williams palmer stood aghast his mind was not fast enough to keep up mr eden bowed and retired he was scarcely out of the room when the justices drew up an order for his suspension from his office mr hawes was next sent for we have found the chaplain all you described him discipline is impossible with such a man here is an order for his suspension hawes's eyes sparkled we will enter it into the book meantime you are to see it executed hawes went out but presently returned he won't go gentlemen what do you mean by he won't go said williams i told him your orders and he said 'tell their worships they are exceeding their authority and i won't go' then i said 'they give you half an hour to pack up and then you must pack off' he he he and what did he say 'oh they give me half an hour do they' says he 'you take them this' and he wrote this on a slip of paper here it is the slip contained these words greek letters while the justices were puzzling over this hawes added gentlemen he said in his polite way 'if it is like the prison rules and beats their comprehension you may tell them it means 'there is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip' well mr hawes what next 'i am victualed for a siege' says he and he goes into his own room and i heard him shoot the bolt what does that mean inquired mr palmer it means sir that you won't get him out except by kicking him out hawes had been irritating their wounded vanity in order to get them up to this mark then turn him out by force said williams but the other two were wiser no we must not do that we can keep him out if once he crosses the door i will manage it for you gentlemen said mr hawes do mr hawes went out and primed fry with a message to mr eden that a gentleman had ridden over from oxford to see him and was at his house mr eden was in his room busy collecting and arranging several papers he had just tied them up in a little portfolio when he heard fry's voice at the door when that worthy delivered his message his lip curled with scorn but he said very well i will disappoint the sly boobies thought he but the next moment looking out of his window he saw a fly with a gray horse coming along the road at last he cried and instantly unbolted his door and issued forth with his little portfolio under his arm he had scarce taken ten steps when a turnkey popped out from a corner and stood sentinel over his room door barring all return mr eden smiled and passed on along the corridor he descended from the first floor to the basement here he found hawes affecting business but not skillfully enough to hide that he was watching mr eden out in the yard leading to the great door he found the injustices aha thought he waiting to see me out he raised his hat politely williams took no notice the others slight there is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip said he to them looking them calmly over then sauntered toward the gate mr hawes came creeping after and joined the injustices every eye furtively watched the parson whom they had outwitted fry himself had gone to the lodge to let him out and keep him out he was but a few steps from the door hawes chuckled his heart beat with exultation a nether moment and that huge barrier would be interposed forever between him and his enemy the prisoners' friend open the door mr fry said the chaplain fry pulled it quickly open and let that gentleman in a middle aged gentleman was paying off his fly the door being thus thrown open he walked quickly into the jail as if it belonged to him who is this inquired mr williams sharply the newcomer inquired as sharply the governor of this jail mr hawes stepped forward i am the governor the newcomer handed him his card and a note mr lacy from the home office said mr hawes to the injustices these sir are the visiting justices mr lacy bowed but addressed himself to mr hawes only grave charges have been made against you sir i am here to see whether matters are such as to call for a closer investigation may i ask sir who makes the charges against me the chaplain of your own jail but he is my enemy sir my personal enemy don't distress yourself no public man is safe from detraction we hear an excellent account of you from every quarter but this one my visit will probably turn to your advantage hawes brightened is there any room in which i could conduct this inquiry will you be pleased to come to the justices' room yes let us go there at once gentlemen you shall be present if you choose it is right you should know the chaplain is cracked said mr williams i should not wonder pray inquired mr lacy who was that bilious looking character near the gate when i came in why that was the chaplain i thought so i dare say we shall find he has taken a jaundiced view of things send for him if you please and let us get through the business as quickly as we can when mr eden came he found mr lacy chatting pleasantly with his four adversaries on his entrance the gentleman's countenance fell a little and mr eden had the pleasure of seeing that this man too was prejudiced against him mr mr eden mr eden be seated if you please you appear to be ill sir i am recovering from a mortal sickness the jaundice eh something of that nature a horrible complaint mr eden bowed i have had some experience of it are you aware of its effect on the mind i feel its effect on the temper and the nerves deeper than that sir it colors the judgment makes us look at everything on the dark side mr eden sighed i see what you are driving at but you confound effect with cause mr lacy shrugged his shoulders opened his portfolio and examined a paper or two mr hawes you served her majesty in another way before you came here five and twenty years sir man and boy and i think with credit my will has been good to do my duty whatever my abilities may be i believe you distinguished yourself at sea in a storm in the west indies mr williams put in warmly he went out to a vessel in distress in a hurricane at jamaica it was off the mauritius observed mr eden with a gleam of satisfaction well said mr lacy he saved other lives at the risk of his own no matter where pray mr eden does your reading and experience lead you to believe that a brave man is ever a cruel one yes there is a proverb that the cruel are always cowards cant seven out of twelve are cowards and five brave i don't agree with you the presumption is all on mr hawes's side and only the facts on mine mr lacy smiled superciliously to the facts let us go then you received a note from the home office this morning in compliance with that note have you prepared your case yes will you begin by giving me an idea what the nature of your evidence will be a page or two of print twenty of manuscript three or four living witnesses and one dead body hum he seems in earnest gentlemen how long do you require to state your case can it be done to day mr lacy looked at his watch half peevishly half an hour was the reply only half an hour ay but half an hour neat what do you mean by neat the minutes not to be counted that are wasted in idle interruptions or in arguments drawn from vague probabilities where direct evidence lies under our senses for instance that because i have been twenty five years a servant of christ with good repute therefore it is not to be credited i could bring a false accusation or that because mr hawes was brave twenty years ago in one set of circumstances therefore he cannot be cruel now in another set of circumstances mr lacy colored a little but he took a pinch of snuff and then coolly drew out of his pocket a long paper sealed have you any idea what this is mr eden caught sight of the direction it was to himself probably my dismissal from my post it is hawes quivered with exultation and i have authority to present you with it if you do not justify the charges you have made against a brother officer good said mr eden this is intelligent and it is just the first gleam of either that has come into this dark hole since i have known it i augur well from this this is a character gentlemen to business sir inquired mr eden undoing his portfolio sir put in mr hawes i object to an ex parte statement from a personal enemy you are here to conduct a candid inquiry not to see the chaplain conduct a hostile one i feel that justice is safe in your hands but not in his stop a bit said mr eden i am to be dismissed unless i prove certain facts see the secretary of state has put me on my defense i will intrust that defense to no man but myself you are keen sir but you are in the right and you mr hawes will be here to correct his errors and to make your own statement after he has done in half an hour ah well thought hawes he can't do me much harm in half an hour begin sir and he looked at his watch mr hawes i want your book the log book of the prison get it mr hawes if you please mr hawes went out mr williams are these the prison rules by act of parliament and he showed him the paper they are sir examine them closely mr lacy they contain the whole discipline of this prison as by law established keep them before you it is with these you will have to compare the jailer's acts and now how many times is the jailer empowered to punish any given prisoner once on a second offense the prisoner i see is referred for punishment to the visiting justices if therefore this jailer has taken upon himself to punish the same prisoner twice he has broken the law at all events he has gone beyond the letter of this particular set of rules but these rules were drawn up by lawyers and are based on the law of the land a jailer in the eye of the law is merely a head turnkey set to guard the prisoners for hundreds of years he had no lawful right to punish a prisoner at all that right was first bestowed on him with clear limitations by an act passed in george the fourth's reign which i must show you because that act is a jailer's sole authority for punishing a prisoner at all here is the passage sir will you be kind enough to read it out hum 'the keeper of every prison shall have power to hear all complaints touching any of the following offenses disobedience of the prison rules assaults by one prisoner on another where no dangerous wound is given profane cursing or swearing any indecent behavior at chapel idleness or negligence in work the said keeper may punish all such offenses by ordering any offender to close confinement in the refractory or solitary cells and by keeping such offenders upon bread and water only for any term not exceeding three days' observe put in mr eden he can only punish once and then not select the punishment according to his own fancy he is restricted to separate confinement and bread and water and three days mr lacy continued 'in case any criminal prisoner shall be guilty of any repeated offense against the rules of the prison or of any greater offense than the jailer is by this act empowered to punish the said jailer shall forthwith report the same to the visiting justices who can punish for one month or felons or those sentenced to hard labor by personal correction' such sir said mr eden is the law of england and the men who laid down our prison rules were not so ignorant or unscrupulous as to run their head against the statute law of the land nowhere in our prison rules will you find any power given to our jailer to punish any but minor offenses or to punish any prisoner more than once or to inflict any variety of punishments such are this jailer's powers now for his acts and their consequences follow me evans open this cell jenkyns what are you in prison for for running away from sarvice your reverence how often have you been punished since you came a good many times your reverence by the visiting justices no sir i was never punished by them only by the governor what have been your offenses i don't know sir i never meant to offend at all but i am not very strong and the governor he puts me on a heavy crank and then i can't always do the work and i suppose he thinks it is for want of the will and so he gives it me how has he punished you oh sometimes it is clamming nothing but a twopenny roll all day and kept to hard work all the same sometimes my bed taken away you know sir but mostly the punishment jacket mr lacy the punishment jacket what is that mr eden look in the prison rules and see if you can find a punishment jacket meantime come with me two gross violations of the law repetition of punishment and variety of punishments evans open this cell what are you in for prisoner taking off his cap politely burglary gentlemen have you been often refractory since you came here once or twice sir but but what these gentlemen are the visiting justices yes they would be offended if i told the truth mr lacy i am here from the secretary of state and i bid you tell the truth prisoner oh are you sir well then the truth is i never was refractory but once mr lacy oh you were refractory once prisoner yes sir mr lacy how came that prisoner well sir it was the first week i had never been in a separate cell before and it drove me mad no one came near me or spoke a word to me and i turned savage i didn't know myself and i broke everything in the cell mr eden and the other times prisoner the other times sir i was called refractory but i was not mr eden what punishments have been inflicted on you by the governor prisoner well sir the black cell bread and water and none of that took away my gas once or twice but generally it was the punishment jacket mr lacy hum the punishment jacket mr eden how long since you had the punishment jacket prisoner no longer than yesterday mr eden strip my man and let us look at your back the prisoner stripped and showed his back striped livid and red by the cutting straps mr lacy gave a start but the next moment he resumed his official composure and at this juncture mr hawes bustled into the cell and fixed his eye on the prisoner what are you doing said he eying the man the gentleman made me strip sir said the prisoner with an ill used air have you any complaint to make against me no sir then what have you been humbugging us for all this time cried mr williams contemptuously for instance cried mr eden in the same tone glancing slyly at mr lacy how dare you show us frightful wales upon your back when you know they only exist in your imagination and mine mr lacy laughed that is true he can't retract his wales and i shall be glad to know how they came there here he made a note i will show you by and by said mr eden the next two cells they went to the prisoners assured mr lacy that they were treated like mr hawes's children well sir said lacy with evident satisfaction what do you say to that i say use your eyes and he wheeled the last prisoner to the light look at this hollow eye and faded cheek look at this trembling frame and feel this halting pulse here is a poor wretch crushed and quelled by cruelty till scarce a vestige of man is left look at him here is an object to pretend to you that he has been kindly used poor wretch his face gives the lie to his tongue and my life on it his body confirms his face strip my lad mr hawes interposed and said it was cruel to make a prisoner strip to gratify curiosity mr eden laughed come strip said he the gentleman is waiting the prisoner reluctantly took off his coat waistcoat and shirt and displayed an emaciated person and several large livid stripes on his back mr lacy looked grave now mr lacy you see the real reason why this humane gentleman did not like the prisoner to strip come to another before we go in to this one let me ask you one question do you think they will ever tell you the truth while mr hawes's eye is on them hum they certainly seem to stand in awe of mr hawes hawes but sir you see how bitter the chaplain is against me where he is i ought to be if i am to have fair play certainly mr hawes certainly that is but fair mr eden what are you in for prisoner taking a gentleman's wipe gentlemen mr eden have you been often punished prisoner yes your reverence why you know i have now didn't you save my life when they were starving me to death two months ago mr lacy how did he save your life prisoner made 'em put me on the sick list and put something into my poor belly mr lacy what state was the man in mr eden mr eden he was like a skeleton and so weak that he could only speak two or three words at a time and then had to stop a long while and recover strength to say two or three more i did not think a human creature could be so near death and not die mr lacy and did you know the cause mr eden frankly i did not i had not at that time fathomed all the horrors of this place mr lacy did you tell the chaplain at the time you were starving prisoner no mr eden and why not mr hawes simply because he never was starving prisoner well i'll tell you gentlemen his reverence said to me 'my poor fellow you are very ill i must have you on the sick list directly' and then he went for the doctor now i knew if i got on the sick list they would fill my belly so i said to myself best let well alone if i had told him it was only starvation he would not interfere i thought mr lacy opened his eyes mr eden sighed mr lacy you seem to have a poor opinion of her majesty's officers prisoner didn't know him you see didn't know his character the humbug that was here before him would have let a poor fellow be kicked into his grave before his eyes and not hold out a hand to save him mr lacy let me understand you were you kept without food prisoner i was a day and a half without any food at all mr lacy by whose orders prisoner by the governor's there and i was a week on a twopenny loaf once a day and kept at hard work on that till i dropped ah your reverence i shall never forget your face i should be under the sod now if it was not for you williams you rascal the last time i was here you told me you never were so happy and comfortable prisoner ha ha ha ha he he haw haw ho i ask your pardon for laughing sir but you are so precious green why if i had told you the truth then i shouldn't be alive to talk to you now what i should have murdered you should i said mr hawes with a lofty sneer why you know you would sir replied the prisoner firmly and respectfully looking him full in the face before them all mr lacy you don't think so or you would not take these liberties with him now the prisoner cast a look of pity on mr lacy well you are green what can't you see that i am going out to day do you think i'd be such a cully as to tell a pack of greenhorns like you the truth before a sharp hand like our governor if i was in his power no my term of imprisonment expired at twelve o'clock to day then why are you here i'll tell you sir our governor always detains a prisoner for hours after the law sets him free so then the poor fellow has not time to get back to his friends so then he sleeps in the town ten to one at a public house gets a glass gets into bad company and in a month or two comes back here that is the move sir bless you they are so fond of us they don't like to part with us for good and all mr lacy i do not for a moment believe mr hawes that you have foreseen these consequences but the detention of this man after twelve o'clock is clearly illegal and you must liberate him on the instant mr hawes that i will and i wish this had been pointed out to me before but it was a custom of the prison before my time mr eden evans come this way come in how long have you been a turnkey here evans four years sir mr eden do you happen to remember the practice of the late governor with respect to prisoners whose sentence had expired evans yes sir they were kept in their cells all the morning then at eleven their own clothes were brought in clean and dry and they had half an hour given them to take off the prison dress and put on their own then a little before twelve they were taken into the governor's own room for a word of friendly advice on leaving or a good book or a tract or what not then at sharp twelve the gate was opened for them and prisoner good by till we see you again evans sternly come my man it is not for you to speak till you are spoken to mr eden you must not take that tone with the gentleman evans this is not a queen's prisoner it is a private guest of mr hawes but time flies if after what we have heard and seen you still doubt whether this jailer has broken the law by punishing the same prisoner more than once and in more ways than one fresh evidence will meet you at every step but i would now direct your principal attention to other points look at rule by this rule each prisoner must be visited and conversed with by four officers every day and they are to stay with him upon the aggregate half an hour in the day now the object of this rule is to save the prisoners from dying under the natural and inevitable operation of solitude and enforced silence two things that are fatal to life and reason but solitary confinement is legal mr eden sighed heavily no it is not separate confinement ie separation of prisoner from prisoner is legal but separation of a prisoner from the human race is as illegal as any other mode of homicide it never was legal in england it was legal for a short time in the united states and do you know why it has been made illegal there no i do not because they found that life and reason went out under it like the snuff of a candle men went mad and died as men have gone mad and died here through the habitual breach of rule a rule the aim of which is to guard separate confinement from being shuffled into solitary confinement or homicide take twenty cells at random and ask the prisoners how many officers come and say good words to them as bound by law ask them whether they get their half hour per diem of improving conversation there is a row of shambles go into them by yourself take neither the head butcher nor me mr lacy bit his lip bowed stiffly and beckoned evans to accompany him into the cells mr hawes went in search of fry to concert what was best to be done mr eden paced the corridor as for mr lacy he took the cells at random skipping here and there at last he returned and sent for mr hawes i am sorry to say that the th rule has been habitually violated the prisoners are unanimous they tell me that so far from half an hour's conversation they never have three minutes except with the chaplain and during his late illness they were often in perfect solitude they tell me too that when you do look in it is only to terrify them with angry words and threats solitude broken only by harsh language is a very sad condition for a human creature to lie in the law it seems does not sanction it and our own imperfections should plead against such terrible severity applied indiscriminately to great and small offenders oh that is well said that is nobly said cried mr eden with enthusiasm sir i was put in here to carry out the discipline which had been relaxed by the late governor and i have but obeyed orders as it was my duty nonsense retorted mr eden the discipline of this jail is comprised in these rules of which eight out of ten are habitually broken by you he is right there so far mr hawes you are here to maintain not an imaginary discipline but an existing discipline strictly defined by printed rules and it seems clear you have committed through ignorance serious breaches of these rules but let us hope mr eden that no irreparable consequences have followed this unlucky breach of rule irreparable no replied mr eden bitterly the home office can call men back from the grave can't it here is a list of five men all extinguished in this prison by breach of rule you start understand me this is but a small portion of those who have been done to death here in various ways but these five dropped silently like autumn leaves by breach of rule rule is one of the safety valves which the law more humane than the blockheads who execute it has attached to that terrible engine separate confinement i cannot accept this without evidence i have a book here that contains ample evidence you shall see it meantime i will just ask that turnkey about hatchett the first name on your list of victims evans what did you find in hatchett's cell when he was first discovered to be dying eighteen loaves of bread sir on the floor in one corner eighteen loaves i really don't understand don't you how could eighteen loaves have accumulated but by the man rejecting his food for several days how could they have accumulated unobserved if rule had not been habitually broken alas sir hatchett's story which i see is still dark to you is as plain as my hand to all of us who know the fatal effects of solitary or homicidal confinement thus sir it was unsustained by rational employment uncheered by the sound of a human voice torn out by the roots from all healthy contact with the human race the prisoner hatchett's heart and brain gave way together being now melancholy mad he shunned the food that was jerked blindly into his cell like a bone to a wolf by this scientific contrivance to make brute fling food to brute instead of man handing it with a smile to grateful man and so his body sunk his spirits and reason had succumbed before and he died his offense was refusing to share his wages with a woman from whom he would have been divorced but that he was too poor to buy justice at so dear a shop as the house of lords the law condemned him to a short imprisonment the jailer on his own authority substituted capital punishment is it your pleasure sir that i should be vilified and insulted thus to my very face and by my inferior officer asked hawes changing color you have nothing to apprehend except from facts was the somewhat cold reply you are aware i do not share this gentleman's prejudices would you like to see a man in the act of perishing through the habitual breach of rule in jail can you show me such a case come with me they entered strutt's cell they found the old man in a state bordering on stupor when the door was opened he gave a start but speedily relapsed into stupor now mr lacy here is a lesson for you would to god i could show this sight to all the pedants of science who spend their useless lives in studying the limbs of the crustaceonidunculae and are content to know so little about man's glorious body and to all the state dunces who give sordid blockheads the power to wreck the brains and bodies of wicked men in these the clandestine shambles of the nation would i could show these and all other numskulls in the land this dying man that they might write this one great truth in blood on their cold hearts and muddy understandings alas all great truths have to be written in blood ere man will receive them but what is your great truth asked mr lacy impatiently this sir replied mr eden putting his finger on the stupefied prisoner's shoulder and keeping it there that the human body besides its grosser wants of food and covering has its more delicate needs robbed of which it perishes more slowly and subtly but as surely as when frozen or starved one of these subtle but absolute conditions of health is light without light the body of a blind man pines as pines a tree without light tell that to the impostor physical science deep in the crustaceonidunculae and ignorant of the a b c of man without light man's body perishes with insufficient light it droops and here in all these separate shambles is insufficient light a defect in our system which co operates with this individual jailer's abuse of it another of the body's absolute needs is work another is conversation with human beings if by isolating a vulgar mind that has collected no healthy food to feed on in time of dearth you starve it to a stand still the body runs down like a watch that has not been wound up against this law of nature it is not only impious but idiotic to struggle almighty god has made man so and so he will remain while the world lasts a little destructive blockhead like this can knock god's work to pieces ecce signum but he can no more alter it while it stands than he can mend it when he has let it down and smashed it feel this man's pulse and look at his eye life is ebbing from him by a law of nature as uniform as that which governs the tides his pulse is certainly very low and when i first felt it he was trembling all over oh that was the agitation of his nerves we opened the door suddenly and did that make a man tremble certainly that is a well known symptom of solitary confinement it is by shattering a man's nerves all to pieces that it prepares the way for his death which death comes sometimes in raging lunacy of which eight men have died under mr hawes's reign here is the list of deaths by lunacy from breach of rule eight you will have the particulars by and by i really don't see my way through this said mr lacy let us come to something tangible what is this punishment jacket that leaves marks of personal violence on so many prisoners now hawes had been looking for this machine to hide it but to his surprise neither he nor fry could find it evans fetch the infernal machine yes your reverence evans brought the jacket straps and collar from a cell where he had hidden them by mr eden's orders you play the game pretty close parson said mr hawes with an attempt at a sneer i play to win i am playing for human lives this sir is the torture marks of which you have seen on the prisoners but your inexperience will not detect at a glance all the diabolical ingenuity and cruelty that lurks in this piece of linen and these straps of leather however it works thus the man being in the jacket its back straps are drawn so tight that the sufferer's breath is impeded and his heart lungs and liver are forced into unnatural contact you stare i must inform you that nature is a wonderfully close packer did you ever unpack a human trunk of its stomach liver lungs and heart and then try to replace them i have and believe me as no gentleman can pack like a shopman so no shopman can pack like nature the victim's body and organs being crushed these two long straps fasten him so tight to the wall that he cannot move to ease the frightful cramps that soon attack him then steps in by way of climax this collar three inches and a half high see it is as stiff as iron and the miscreants have left the edges unbound that it may do the work of a man saw as well as a garotte in this iron three handed gripe the victim writhes and sobs and moans with anguish and worse than all loses his belief in god this is a stern picture said mr lacy hanging his head until what with the freezing of the blood in a body jammed together and flattened against a wall what with the crushed respiration and the cowed heart a deadly faintness creeps over the victim and he swoons away oh it is a lie a base malignant lie shouted hawes i am glad to hear it mr hawes here the justices with great beat joined in and told mr lacy he would be much to blame if he accepted any statement made against so respectable a man as mr hawes then they all turned indignantly on mr eden that gentleman's eyes sparkled with triumph i have been trying a long time to make him speak but he was too cunning it is a lie is it yes it is a lie what is a lie the whole thing give me your book mr hawes what do you mean by 'the punishment jacket' an entry that appears so constantly here in your handwriting i never denied the jacket then what is the lie of which you have accused me show me that i may ask your pardon and his i serve for so great a sin as a lie it is a lie to say that the jacket tortures the prisoners and makes them faint away it only confines them you want to make me out a villain but it is your own bad heart that makes you think so or say so without thinking it now mr lacy i think we have caught our eel this then is the ground you take if it were true that this engine instead of merely confining men tortured them to fainting then you say you would be a villain you hesitate sir can't you afford to admit that after all yes i can but on the other hand you say it is untrue that this engine tortures i do prove that by going into it for one hour i have seen you put a man in it for six now do you really think i am going to make myself a laughing stock to the whole prison well but consider what a triumph you are denying yourself to prove me a liar and yourself a true man it would be the greatest feat of dialects the world ever saw and you need not stand on your dignity better men than you have been in it and there goes one of them here evans come this way we want you to go into the punishment jacket the man recoiled with a ludicrous face of disgust and dismay mr lacy smiled now your reverence don't think of it i don't want to earn no more guineas that way what does he mean asked mr lacy i gave him a guinea to go into it for half an hour and he calls it a hard bargain oh you have been in it then tell me is it torture or is it only confinement con finement con found such confinement i say yes it is torture and the worst of torture ask his reverence he has been in the oven as well as me mr lacy opened his eyes wide what said he with a half grin have you been in it that he has sir said evans grinning out in return bless you his reverence is not the one to ask a poor man to stand any pain he daren't face himself there there we don't want to hear about his reverence said his reverence very sharply mr hawes says it is not torture and therefore he won't face it 'it is too laughable and painless for me' says slippery mr hawes 'it is torture and therefore i won't face it' says the more logical mr evans but we can cut this knot for you mr lacy there are in this dungeon a large body of men so steeped in misery so used to torture for their daily food that they will not be so nice as messrs hawes and evans 'fiat experimentum in corpore vili' follow me sir and as we go pray cast your eyes over the prison rules and see whether you can find 'a punishment jacket' no sir you will not find even a spanish collar or a pillory or a cross far less a punishment jacket which combines those several horrors mr hawes hung back and begged a word with the justices gentlemen you have always been good friends to me give me a word of advice or at least let me know your pleasure shall i resign shall i fling my commission in this man's face who comes here to usurp your office and authority resign nonsense said mr williams stand firm we will stand by you and who can hurt you then you are very good sirs without you i couldn't put up with any more of this to be baited and badgered in my own prison after serving my queen so many years by sea and land poor fellow said mr woodcock and how can i make head against such a man as eden a lawyer in a parson's skin an orator too that has a hundred words to say to my one let him talk till he is hoarse we will not let him hurt you thank you gentlemen thank you your wishes have always been my law you bid me endure all this insolence honored by your good opinion and supported by your promise to stand by me i will endure it and mr hawes was seen to throw off the uneasiness he had put on to bind the magistrates to his defense they are coming back again who is this with them mr hawes muttered an oath it is a refractory prisoner i had sent to the dark cell i suppose they will examine him next and take his word against mine chorus of visiting justices shame chapter xxv mr eden had taken mr lacy to the dark cells evans who had no key of them was sent to fetch fry to open them we will kill two birds with one stone disinter a patient for our leathern gallows and a fresh incident of the inquisition open this door mr fry the door was opened a feeble voice uttered a quavering cry of joy that sounded like wailing and a figure emerged so suddenly and distinctly from the blackness that mr lacy started it was thomas robinson who crept out white and shaking with a wild haggard look he ran to mr eden like a great girl don't let me go back don't let me go back sir and the cowed one could hardly help whimpering come courage my lad rang out mr eden your troubles are nearly over feel this man's hand sir how he trembles why he must be chicken hearted no only he is one of your men of action not of passive fortitude he is imaginative too and suffers remorse for his crimes without the soothing comfort of penitence twenty four hours of that black hole would deprive him or any such nature of the light of reason is this a mere opinion or do you propose to offer me proof six men driven by this means alone to the lunatic asylum of whom two died there soon after hum of what nature is your proof i cannot receive assertion entries made at the time by a man of unimpeachable honesty indeed who hates me and adores mr hawes very well mr eden replied the other keenly whatever you support by such evidence as that i will accept as fact and act upon it done done and mr lacy smiled good humoredly but it must be owned incredulously is that proof at hand he added it is but one thing at a time the leathern gallows is the iniquity we are unearthing at present ah here are mr hawes and his subordinates subordinates you will see why i call them so mr williams i trust you will not accept the evidence of a refractory prisoner against an honest well tried officer whose conduct for two years past we have watched and approved mr lacy replied with dignity your good opinion of mr hawes shall weigh in his favor at every part of the evidence but you must not dictate to me the means by which i am to arrive at the truth mr williams bit his lip and was red and silent but your reverence cried robinson don't let me be called a refractory prisoner when you know i am not then what were you in the black hole for for obeying orders nonsense hum explain his reverence said to me 'you are a good writer write your own life down see how you like it when you look at it with reason's eye instead of passion's all spread out before you in its true colors tell the real facts no false coin nor don't put any sentiments down you don't feel to please me i shall only despise you' said his reverence well sir i am not a fool and so of course i could see how wise his reverence was and how much good might come to my poor sinful soul by doing his bidding and i said a little prayer he had taught me against a self deceiving heart his reverence is always letting fly at self deception and then i sat down and i said 'now i won't tell a single lie or make myself a pin better or worse than i really am well gentlemen i hadn't written two pages when mr fry found me out and told the governor and the governor had me shoved into the black hole where you found me this is mr fry i think my name is fry was this prisoner sent to the black hole merely for writing his life by the chaplain's orders you must ask the governor sir my business is to report offenses and to execute orders i don't give 'em mr hawes was he sent to the black hole for doing what the chaplain had set him to do by way of a moral lesson he was sent for scribbling a pack of lies without my leave what when he had the permission of your superior officer of my superior officer your superior in the department of instruction i mean can you doubt that he is so with these rules before you let me read you one of them 'rule all prisoners including those sentenced to hard labor are to have such time allowed them for instruction as the chaplain may think proper whether such instruction withdraw them from their labor for a time or not' and again by 'rule each prisoner is to have every means of moral and religious instruction the chaplain shall select for each as suitable' so that you have passed out of your own department into a higher department which was a breach of discipline and you have affronted the head of that department and strained your authority to undermine his and this in the face of rule which establishes this principle that should the severities of the prison claim a prisoner by your mouth and religious or moral instruction claim him by the chaplain's your department must give way to the higher department this is very new to me sir but if it is the law why you see it is the law printed for your guidance i undo your act mr hawes the prisoner robinson will obey the chaplain in all things that relate to religious or moral instruction and he will write his life as ordered and he is not to be put to hard labor for twenty four hours by this means he will recover his spirits and the time and moral improvement you have made him lose you hear sir added he very sharply i hear said hawes sulkily go on with your evidence mr eden robinson my man you see that machine ugh yes i see it for two months i have been trying to convince mr hawes that engine is illegal i failed but i have been more fortunate with this gentleman who comes from the home office he has not taken as many minutes to see it is unlawful stop a bit mr eden it is clearly illegal but the torture is not proved nor ever will be put in mr hawes so then robinson no man on earth has the right to put you into that machine hurrah it is therefore as a favor that i ask you to go into it to show its operation a favor your reverence to you i am ready in a minute robinson was jammed throttled and nailed in the man press mr lacy stood in front of him and eyed him keenly and gravely they seem very fond of you these fellows can you give your eyes to that sight and your ears to me asked mr eden i can then i introduce to you a new character mr fry mr fry is a real character unlike those of romance and melodrama which are apt to be either a streak of black paint or else a streak of white paint mr fry is variegated he is a moral magpie he is if possible as devoid of humanity as his chief but to balance this defect he possesses all to himself a quality a very high quality called honesty well that is a high quality and none too common he is one of those men to whom veracity is natural he would hardly know how to tell a falsehood they fly about him in this place like hailstones but i never saw one come from him stay does he side with you or with mr hawes in this unfortunate difference with me cried mr hawes eagerly mr eden bowed assent hum this honest nero is zealous according to his light he has kept a strict record of the acts and events of the jail for four years past ie rather more than two years of captain o'connor's jailership and somewhat less than two years of the present jailer such a journal rigorously kept out of pure love of truth by such a man is invaluable there no facts are likely to be suppressed or colored since the record was never intended for any eye but his own i am sure mr fry will gratify you with a sight of this journal oblige me mr fry certainly sir certainly replied fry swelling with importance and gratified surprise bring it me at once if you please fry went with alacrity for his journal mr lacy said mr eden with a slight touch of reproach you can read not faces only but complexions you read in my yellow face and sunken eye prejudice what do you read here and he wheeled like lightning and pointed to mr hawes whose face and very lips were then seen to be the color of ashes the poor wretch tried to recover composure and retort defiance but the effort came too late his face had been seen and once seen that look of terror anguish and hatred was never to be forgotten what is the matter mr hawes w w when i think of my long services and the satisfaction i have given to my superiors and now my turnkey's journal to be taken and believed against mine chorus of justices it is a shame mr eden very sharply against yours what makes him think it will be against his the man is his admirer and an honest man what injustice has he to dread from such a source mr lacy i really cannot understand your objection to a man's evidence whose bias lies your way and i must say it speaks well for mr eden that he has proposed this man in evidence at this juncture the magistrates after a short consultation informed mr lacy that they had business of more importance to transact and could give no more time to what appeared to them an idle and useless inquiry at all events gentlemen replied mr lacy i trust you will not leave the jail i am not here to judge mr hawes but to see whether mr eden's demand for a formal inquiry into his acts ought to be granted or refused now unless the evidence takes some new turn i incline to think i must favor the inquiry that is to say should the chaplain persist in demanding it which i shall should a royal commission be appointed to sit here i should naturally wish to consult you as to the component members of the commission and it is my wish to pay you the compliment usual in such cases of selecting one of the three commissioners from your body but one question gentlemen before you go have you complied with no of these your rules have you visited every prisoner in his or her cell once a month certainly not i am sorry to hear it of course at each visit you have closely examined this the jailer's book a record of his acts and the events of the jail portions of it are read to us this is a form which i believe is never omitted is it mr hawes never gentlemen 'portions' and 'a form' what then are your acts of supervision do you examine the turnkeys and compare their opinions with the jailer's we would not be guilty of such ungentlemanly behavior replied mr williams who had been longing for some time to give mr lacy a slap do you examine the prisoners apart so that there can be no intimidation of them we always take mr hawes into the cells with us why do you do that pray we conceive that nothing would be gained by encouraging the refuse of mankind to make frivolous complaints against their best friend here the speaker and his mates wore a marked air of self satisfaction well sir has the present examination in no degree shaken your confidence in mr hawes's discretion not in the least nor in your own mode of scrutinizing his acts not in the least that is enough gentlemen i need detain you no longer from the business you have described as more important than this mr lacy shrugged his shoulders mr eden smiled to him and said quietly as they were in the days of shakespeare so they were in the days of fielding as they were in the days of fielding so they are in the days of light and as they are now so will they remain until they are swept away from the face of the soil keep your eye on mr hawes edging away there so adroitly it is not their fault it is their nature their constitution is rotten in building them the state ignored nature as hawes ignores her in his self invented discipline what do you mean sir that no body of men ever gave for nothing anything worth anything nor ever will now knowledge of law is worth something zeal independent judgment honesty humanity diligence are worth something are you watching mr hawes sir yet the state greedy goose hopes to get them out of a body of men for nothing hum why has mr hawes retired you know as well as i do oh do i yes sir the man's terror when fry's journal was proposed in evidence and his manner of edging away obliquely to the direction fry took were not lost on a man of your intelligence if you think that why did you not stop him till fry came back with the book i had my reasons meantime we are not at a stand still here is an attested copy of the journal in question and here is mr hawes's log book fry's book intended for no mortal eye but his own hawes's concocted for inspection i see a number of projecting marks pasted into fry's journal yes sir on some of these marks are written the names of remarkable victims recurring at intervals on others are inscribed the heads of villainy 'the black hole' 'starvation' 'thirst' 'privation of exercise' 'of bed' 'of gas' 'of chapel' 'of human converse' 'inhuman threats' and the infernal torture called the 'punishment jacket' somewhat on the plan of 'watt's bibliotheca britannica' so that you can at will trace any one of mr hawes's illegal punishments and see it running like a river of blood through many hapless names or you can if you like it better track a fellow creature dripping blood from punishment to punishment from one dark page to another till release lunacy or death closes the list of his recorded sufferings aided by mr eden who whirled over the leaves of mr hawes's log book for him mr lacy compared several pages of the two books the following is merely a selected specimen of the entries that met his eye mr fry mr hawes joramwriting on his can bread and joramrefractory bread and water water jorambread and water jorambread and water joramrefractory crank bread and water joramcrank not performed bread and water jorampunishment jacket joramrefractory crank bread and joram refractory bread and water water joramattempted suicide joram feigned

to feel the light jacket and bread and water three days tanner for repining chapel tanner refractory language and gas stopped until content forbidden chapel until reformation can i see such a thing as a prisoner who has attempted suicide inquired he with lingering incredulity yes there are three on this landing come first to joram of whom mr hawes writes that he made a sham attempt on his life in a fit of religious despondency mr fry that having been jacketed and put on bread and water for several days he became depressed in spirits and made a real attempt on his life ah here is mr fry he is coming this way to tell you his first falsehood hawes has been all this while persuading him to it where is your journal mr fry well sir replied fry hanging his head i can't show it you i lent it to a friend now i remember and he has taken it out of the jail but added he with a sense of relief you can ask me any questions you like and i'll answer them all one as my book well then was joram's attempt at suicide a real or a feigned one well i should say it was a real one i found him insensible and he did not come to for best part of a quarter of an hour open his cell joram i am here from the secretary of state to ask you some questions answer them truly and without fear some months ago you made an attempt on your life the prisoner shuddered and hung his head don't be discouraged joram put in mr eden kindly this gentleman is not a harsh judge he will make allowances thank you gentlemen what made you attempt your life persisted mr lacy was it from religious despondency that it was not what did i know about religion before his reverence here came to the jail no sir i was clammed to death clammed yes sir clammed and no mistake north country word for starved explained mr eden no sir i was starved as well it was very cold weather and they gave me nothing but a roll of bread no bigger than my fist once a day for the best part of a week so being starved with cold and clammed with hunger i knew i couldn't live many hours more and then the pain in my vitals was so dreadful sir i was obliged to cut it short ay ay your reverence i know it was very wicked but what was i to do if i hadn't attempted my life i shouldn't be alive now a poor fellow doesn't know what to do in such a place as this well said mr lacy i promise you your food shall never be tampered with again thank you sir oh i have nothing to complain of now sir they have never clammed me since i attempted my life mr eden suicide is at a premium here what was your first offense asked mr lacy writing on my can what did you write on the can i wrote 'i want to speak to the governor' couldn't you ring and ask to see him ring and ask i had rung half a dozen times and asked to see him and could not get to see him my hand was blistered and i wanted to ask him to put me on a different sort of work till such time as it could get leave to heal now sir said mr eden observe the sequence of iniquity a refractory jailer defies the discipline of the prison he breaks rule and other rules by which he is ordered to be always accessible to a prisoner the prisoner being in a strait through which the jailer alone can guide him begs for an interview unable to obtain this in his despair he writes one innocent line on his can imploring the jailer to see him none of the beasts say 'what has he written' they say only 'here be scratches' and they put him on bread and water for an illegal period and mr hawes's new and illegal interpretation of 'bread and water' is aimed at his life i mean that instead of receiving three times per diem a weight of bread equal to the weight of his ordinary diets which is clearly the intention of the bread and water statute he has once a day four ounces of bread so because a refractory jailer breaks the discipline a prisoner with whom no breach of the discipline originated is feloniously put to death unless he cuts it short by that which in every spot of the earth but jail is a deadly crime in heaven's eyes self murder what an eye your reverence ha' got for things well now it doesn't sound quite fair does it but stealing is a dog's trick and if a man behaves like a dog he must look to be treated like one and he will be too that is right joram you look at it from that point of view and we will look at it from another open naylor's cell naylor what drove you to attempt suicide oh you know sir but this gentleman does not well gents they had been at me a pretty while one way and another they put me in the jacket till i fainted away stop a minute is the jacket very painful there is nothing in the world like it sir what is its effect what sort of pain why all sorts it crushes your very heart then it makes you ache from your hair to your heel till you would thank and bless any man to knock you on the head then it takes you by the throat and pinches you and rasps you all at one time however i don't think but what i could have stood up against that if i had had food enough but how can a chap face trouble and pain and hard labor on a crumb a day however what finally screwed up my stocking altogether gents was their taking away my gas it was the dark winter nights and there was me set with an empty belly and the cell like a grave so then i turned a little queer in the head by all accounts and i saw things that hem didn't suit my complaint at all you know what things well gents it is all over now but it makes me shiver still so i don't care to be reminded let us drop it if it is all the same to you but naylor for the sake of other poor fellows and to oblige me oh your reverence if i can oblige you that alters the case entirely well then sir if you must know i saw 'child of hell' wrote in great letters of fire all over that side of the cell always every evening this was all my society as the saying is 'child of hell' wrote ten times brighter than gas couldn't you shut your eyes and go to sleep said mr lacy how could i sleep and i did shut my eyes and then the letters they came through my eyelids so when this fell on the head of all my troubles i turned wild and i said to myself one afternoon 'now here is my belly empty and nothing coming to it and there is the sun a setting and by and by my cell will be brimful of hell fire let me end my troubles and get one night's rest if i never see another' so i hung myself up to the bar by my hammock strap and that is all i remember except finding myself on my back with mr fry and a lot round me some coaxing and some cursing and when i saw where i was i fell a crying and blubbering to think that i had so nearly broke prison and there they had got me still i dare say mr fry remembers how i took on ay my man i remember we got no thanks for bringing you to i was a poor unconverted sinner then replied mr naylor demurely and didn't know my fault and the consequences but i thank you now with all my heart mr fry sir i am to understand then that you accuse the jailer of driving you to suicide by unlawful severities no sir i don't i only tell you how it happened and you should not have asked me if you didn't care to know and as for blaming folk the man i blame the most is john naylor his reverence there has taught me to look at home if i hadn't robbed honest folk i shouldn't have robbed myself of character and liberty and health and mr hawes wouldn't have robbed me of food and light and life wellnigh certainly there is a deal of ignorance and stupidity in this here jail the governor has no head piece can't understand that a prisoner is made out of the same stuff as he is skin and belly heart soul bones an' all i should say he wasn't fit to be trusted with the lives of a litter of pigs let alone a couple of hundred men and women but all is one for that if he was born without any gumption as the saying is i wasn't and i didn't ought to be in a fool's power that is my fault entirely not the fool's ain't it now if i hadn't come to the mill the miller would never have grinded me i sticks to that well said naylor come sir one higher than the state takes precedence here we must on no account shake a christian frame of mind or rekindle a sufferer's wrongs yes naylor forgive and you shall be forgiven i am pleased with you greatly pleased with you my poor fellow there is my hand naylor took his reverence's hand and his very forehead reddened with pride and pleasure at so warm a word of praise from the revered mouth they went out of the cell being now in the corridor mr eden addressed the government official thus my proofs draw to a close i could multiply instances ad infinitum but what is the use if these do not convince you you would not believe though one rose from the dead what do i say have not naylor and joram and many others come back from the dead to tell you by what roads they were driven there one example remains to be shown to a philosophical mind it is no stronger than the rest but there are many men who can receive no very strong impression except through their senses you may be one of these and it is my duty to give your judgment every aid where is mr fry he has left us i am coming to attend you sir cried evans from above mr fry is gone to the governor where are we going asked mr lacy to examine a prisoner whom the jailer tortured with the jacket and starved and ended by robbing him of his gas and his bed contrary to law evans since you are here relate all that happened to edward josephs on the fourth of this month and mind you don't exaggerate well sir they had been at him for near a month overtasking him and then giving him the jacket and starving him and overtasking him again on his empty stomach till the poor lad was a living skeleton on the fourth the governor put him in the jacket and there he was kept till he swooned ah then they flung two buckets of water over him and that brought him to then they sent him to his cell and there he was in his wet clothes then him being there shaking with cold the governor ordered his gas to be taken away his hands were shaking over it for a little warmth when they robbed him of that bit o' comfort hum contrary to law put in mr eden well sir he was a quiet lad not given to murmur but at losing his gas he began to cry out so loud you might hear him all over the prison what did he cry sir he cried murder go on then i came to him and found him shivering and dripping and crying fit to break his poor heart and did you do nothing for him i did what i could sir i took him and twisted his bedclothes so tight round him the air could not get in and before i left him his sobs went down and he looked like warm and sleeping after all his troubles well sir they can tell you better that did the job but it seems the governor sent another turnkey called hodges to take away his bed from under him oh well sir oh dear me i hope your reverence i shall never have to tell this story again for it chokes me every time and the man was unable to go on for a while well sir the poor thing it seems didn't cry out as he had about the gas he took it quite quiet that might have let them know but some folk can see nothing till it is too late and he gave hodges his hand to show he bore him no malice eh dear eh dear would to heaven i had never seen this wicked place wicked place indeed said mr lacy solemnly you make me almost dread to ask the result you shall see the result evans evans opened cell and he and mr eden stood sorrowful aside while mr lacy entered the cell the first thing he saw was a rude coffin standing upright by the window the next a dead body lying stark upon a mattress on the floor the official uttered a cry like the scream of a woman what is this how dare you bring me to such a place as this this is that edward josephs whose sufferings you have heard and pitied poor wretch heaven forgive us what did he did he he took one step to meet inevitable death he hanged himself that same night by his handkerchief to this bar turn his poor body evans see sir here is mr hawes's mark upon his back these livid stripes are from the infernal jacket and helped to lash him into his grave you are ill here some wine from my flask you will faint else thank you yes i was rather faint it is passed mr eden i find my life has been spent among words things of such terrible significance are new to me god forgive us how came this to pass in england in the nineteenth century the scoundrel kick him out of the jail but do not swear it is a sin by removing him from this his great temptation we may save even his blood stained soul but the souls of his victims oh sir when a good man is hurried to his grave our lamentations are natural but unwise but think what he commits who hurries thieves and burglars and homicides unprepared before their eternal judge in this poor boy lay the materials of a saint mild docile grateful believing i was winning him to all that is good when i fell sick the sufferings i saw and could not stop they made me sick you did not know that when you let my discolored cheeks prejudice you against my truth oh i forgive you dear sir yes heaven is inscrutable for had i not fallen ill yes i was leading you up to heaven was i not oh my lost sheep my poor lost sheep and the faithful shepherd at the bottom of whose wit and learning lay a heart simpler than beats in any dunce forgot hawes and everything else and began to mourn by the dead body of his wandering sheep then in that gloomy abode of blood and tears heaven wrought a miracle one who for twenty years past had been an official became a man for full five minutes light burst on him nature rushed back upon her truant son and seized her long forgotten empire the frost and reserve of office melted like snow in summer before the sun of religion and humanity how unreal and idle appeared now the twenty years gone in tape and circumlocution away went his life of shadows his career of watery polysyllables meandering through the great desert into the dead sea he awoke from his desk and saw the corpse of an englishman murdered by routine and the tears of a man of god dripping upon it then his soul burst its desk and his heart broke its polysyllables and its tapen bonds and the man of office came quickly to the man of god and seized his hand with both his which shook very much and pressed it again and again and his eyes glistened and his voice faltered this shall never be again how these tears honor you but they cut me to the heart there there i believe every word you have told me now be comforted you are not to blame there were always villains in the world and fools like us that could not understand or believe in an apostle like you we are all in fault but not you be comforted law and order shall be restored this very day and none of these poor creatures shall suffer violence again or wrong of any sort by god so these two grasped hands and pledged faith and for a while at least joined hearts mr eden thanked him with a grace and dignity all his own then he said with a winning sweetness go now my dear sir and do your duty act for once upon an impulse at this moment you see things as you will see them when you come to die a light from heaven shines on your path at this moment walk by it ere the world dims it go and leave me to repent the many unchristian tempers i have shown you in one short hour my heat and bitterness and arrogance in this solemn place his unchristian temper poor soul there take me to the justices mr evans and you follow me as soon as you like yes my worthy friend i will act upon an impulse for once ugh wheeling rapidly out of the cell as unlike his past self as a pin wheel in a shop drawer and ditto ignited he met at the very door mr hawes you have been witnessing a sad sight sir and one that nobody i assure you deplores more than i do said mr hawes in a gentle and feeling tone mr lacy answered mr hawes by looking him all over from head to foot and back then looking sternly into his eyes he turned his back on him sharp and left him standing there without a word chapter xxvi the jailer had been outwitted by the priest hawes had sneaked after fry to beg him for heaven's sake that was the phrase he used not to produce his journal fry thought this very hard and it took hawes ten minutes to coax him over mr eden had calculated on this and worked with the attested copy while hawes was wasting his time suppressing the original hawes was too cunning to accompany fry back to mr lacy he allowed five minutes more to elapse all which time his antagonist was pumping truth into the judge a gallon a stroke at last up came mr hawes to protect himself and baffle the parson he came he met mr lacy at the dead prisoner's door and read his defeat mr lacy joined the justices in their room i have one question to ask you gentlemen before i go how many attempts at suicide were made in this jail under captain o'connor while sole jailer i don't remember replied mr williams it would be odd if you did for no one such attempt took place under him are you aware how many attempts at suicide took place during the two years that this hawes governed a part of the jail being kept in some little check by o'connor but not much as unfortunately you encouraged the inferior officer to defy his superior five attempts at suicide during this period gentlemen and now do you know how many such attempts have occurred since mr hawes has been sole jailer i really don't know prisoners are always shamming replied mr woodcock i do not allude to feigned attempts of which there have been several but to desperate attempts some of which have left the prisoner insensible some have resulted in his death how many of these four or five i believe ah you have not thought it worth while to inquire hum well fourteen at least come in mr eden gentlemen you have neglected your duty making every allowance for your inexperience it still is clear that you have undertaken the supervision of a jail and yet have exercised no actual supervision even now the life or death of the prisoners seems to you a matter of indifference if you are reckless on such a point as this what chance have the minor circumstances of their welfare of being watched by you and frankly i am puzzled to conceive what you proposed to yourselves when you undertook an office so important and requiring so great vigilance i say this gentlemen merely to explain why i cannot have the pleasure i did promise myself of putting one of your names into the royal commission which will sit upon this prison in compliance with the chaplain's petition mr eden bowed gratefully and his point being formally gained he hurried away to make up for lost time and visit his longing prisoners while he passed like sunshine from cell to cell mr lacy took a note or two in solemn silence and the injustices conferred mr palmer whispered we had better have taken mr eden's advice the other two snorted ill assured defiance mr lacy looked up you will hold yourselves in readiness to be examined before the commission at this moment mr hawes walked into the room without his mask and in his own brutal voice the voice he spoke to prisoners with addressed himself with great insolence of manner to mr lacy don't trouble yourself to hold commissions over me i think myself worth a great deal more to the government than they have ever been to me what they give me is little enough for what i have given them and when insults are added to a man of honor and an old servant of the queen he flings his commission in your face and the unveiled ruffian raised his voice to a roar and with his hand flung an imaginary commission into mr lacy's face who drew back astounded then resuming his honeyed manner hawes turned to the justices i return into your hands gentlemen the office i received from you i thank you for the support you have afforded me in my endeavors to substitute discipline for the miserable laxity and slovenliness and dirt we found here and your good opinion will always console me for the insults i have received from a crack brained parson and his tools in the jail and out of it your resignation is accepted said mr lacy coldly and as your connection with jail is now ended in virtue of my powers from the secretary of state which i here produce i give you the use of the jailer's house for a week that you may have time to move your effects but for many reasons it is advisable that you should not remain in the jail a single hour be so good therefore as to quit the jail as soon as you conveniently can one of the turnkeys shall assist you to convey to your house whatever you have in this building i have nothing to take out of the jail man replied hawes rudely except and here he did a bit of pathos and dignity my zeal for her majesty's service and my integrity ah replied mr lacy quietly you won't want any help to carry them mr hawes left the room bowing to the justices and ostentatiously ignoring the government official mr williams shouted after him he carries our respect wherever he goes said this magistrate with a fidelity worthy a better cause the other two hung their heads and did not echo their chief the tide was turned against jailer hawes and these two were not the articles to swim against a stream even though that stream was truth mr hawes took his time he shook hands with fry who bade him farewell with regret who is there that somebody does not contrive to like and rejecting even this mastiff's company he made a gloomy solitary progress through the prison for the last time how clean and beautiful it all is it wasn't like that when i came to it and it never will again some gleams of remorse began to flit about that thick skull and self deceiving heart for punishment suggests remorse to sordid natures but his strong and abiding feeling was a sincere and profound sense of ill usage long service couldn't overlook a single error ungrateful government etc prison go to the devil now and serve them right at last he drew near the outer court and there he met a sight that raised all the fiend within him there was mr eden ushering strutt into the garden and telling evans the old man was to pass his whole days there till he was better so that is the way you keep the rules now you have undermined me no cell at all i thought what you would come to you haven't been long getting there mr hawes replied the other with perfect good temper rule of this prison enjoins that every prisoner shall take daily as much exercise in the open air as is necessary for his health you have violated this rule so long that now strutt's health requires him to pass many more hours in the air than he otherwise would he is dying for air and amusement and he shall have both sooner than die for the want of them or of anything i can give him and what is it to him retorted evans with rude triumph he is no longer an officer of this jail he has got the sack and orders to quit into the bargain fear is entertained that mr evans had listened more or less at the door of the justices' room is this so sir asked mr eden gravely politely and without a shadow of visible exultation you know it is you sneaking undermining villain you have weathered on me you have out maneuvered me when was an honest soldier a match for a parson ah cried mr eden then run to the gate evans and let the men into the jail with the printing press and the looms they have been waiting four hours for this hawes turned black with rage oh i know you made sure of winning a blackguard that loads the dice can always do that your triumph won't be long i was in this jail honored and respected for four years till you came you won't be four months before you are kicked out and no one to say a good word for you a pretty christian to suborn my own servants and rob me of my place and make me a beggar in my old age a man you are not worthy to serve under a man that served his country by sea and land before you were whelped ye black hypocrite you a christian you if i thought that i'd turn atheist or anything you poor backbiting tale telling sneaking undermining false witness bearing unhappy man cried mr eden turn those perverse eyes from the faults of others to your own danger the temptations under which you fell end here then let their veil fall from your eyes and you may yet bless those who came between your soul and its everlasting ruin your victims are dead their eternal fate is fixed by you heaven is more merciful it has not struck you dead by your victim's side it gives you the greatest sinner of all a chance to escape seize that chance waste no time in passion and petulance think only of your forfeited soul madman to your knees what dare you die as you have lived these three years past dare you die abhorred of heaven fool see yourself as every eye on earth and in heaven sees you the land contains no criminal so black as you other homicides have struck hastily on provocation or stung by injury or thrust or drawn by some great passion but you have deliberately gnawed away men's lives others have seen their one victim die but you have looked on your many victims dying yet not spared them other homicides' hands are stained but yours are steeped in blood to your knees man slayer i dare not promise you that a life given to penitence and charity will save so foul a soul but it may for heaven's mercy is infinite seize on that small chance seize it like one who feels satan clutching him and dragging him down to eternal flames life is short eternity is close judgment is sure a few short years and you must meet edward josephs again before the eternal judge what a tribunal to face your victims opposite you there the long standing prejudices that save you from a felon's death here will avail you nothing there the quibbles that pass current on earth will be blasted with the lips that dare to utter and the hearts that coin them before him who has neither body nor parts yet created all the forms of matter vainly will you pretend that you did not slay because forsooth the weapons with which you struck at life were invisible and not to be comprehended by a vulgar shallow sensual earthly judge there too the imperfection of human language will yield no leaf of shelter hope not to shift the weight of guilt upon poor josephs there on earth muddle heads will call his death and the self murderer's by one name of 'suicide' and so dream the two acts were one but you cannot gull omniscience with a word the wise man's counter and the money of a fool be not deceived as rosamond took poison in her hand and drank it with her own lips and died by her own act yet died assassinated by her rival so died josephs as men taken by pirates at sea and pricked with cold steel till in despair and pain they fling themselves into the sea so died josephs and his fellows murdered by you be not deceived i a minister of the gospel of mercy i whose character leans toward charity tell you that if you die impenitent so surely as the sun shines and the bible is true the murder of edward josephs and his brothers will damn your soul to the flames of hell forever and forever and forever begone then poor miserable creature do not look behind you fly from this scene where crime and its delusions still cling round your brain and your self deceiving heart waste no more time with me a minute lost may be a soul lost the avenger of blood is behind you run quickly to your own home go up to your secret chamber and there fall down upon your knees before your god and cry loud and long to him for pardon cry mightily for help cry humbly and groaning for the power to repent away away wash those red hands and that black soul in years and years of charity in tears and tears of penitence and in our redeemer's blood begone and darken and trouble us here no more the cowed jailer shrank and cowered before the thunder and lightning of the priest who mild by nature was awful when he rebuked an impenitent sinner out of holy writ he slunk away his knees trembling under him and the first fiery seeds of remorse sown in his dry heart he met the printing press coming in and the loom following it naturally he scowled at them and groaned evans held the door open for him with a look of joy that stirred all his bile again he turned on the very threshold and spat a volley of oaths upon evans evans at this put down his head like a bull and running fiercely with the huge door slammed it close on his heel with such ferocity that the report rang like a thunder clap through the entire building and the ex jailer was in the street five minutes more the printing press and loom were reinstalled and the punishment jacket packed up and sent to london to the home office ten minutes more the cranks were examined by the artists in iron mr eden had sent for and all condemned it being proved that the value of their resistance stated on their lying faces was scarce one third of their actual resistance so much for unerring science the effect of this little bit of science may be thus stated men for two years had been punished as refractory for not making all day two thousand revolutions per hour of a lb crank when all the while it was a lb crank they had been vainly struggling against all day the proportions of this gory lie never varied each crank tasked the sisyphus three times what it professed to do it was calculated that four prisoners on an average crank marked lb had to exert an aggregate of force equal to one horse and this exertion was prolonged day after day far beyond a horse's power of endurance and in many cases on a modicum of food so scanty that no horse ever foaled so fed could have drawn an armchair a mile five minutes more mr eden had placed in mr lacy's hands a list of prisoners to whom a free pardon ought now to be extended some having suffered a somewhat shorter period but a greater weight of misery than the judges had contemplated in their several sentences and others being so shaken and depressed by separate confinement pushed to excess that their life and reason now stood in peril for want of open air abundant light and free intercourse with their species at the head of these was poor strutt an old man crushed to clay by separate confinement recklessly applied so alarming was this man's torpor to mr eden that after trying in vain to interest him in the garden that observer ventured on a very strong measure he had learned from strutt that he could play the fiddle what does he do but runs and fetches his own violin into the garden tunes it and plays some most inspiriting rollicking old english tunes to him a spark came into the fishy eye of strutt at the third tune the old fellow's fingers began to work impatiently mr eden broke off directly put fiddle and bow into strutt's hand and ran off to the prison again to arrest melancholy despair lunacy stagnation mortification putrefaction by every art that philosophy and mother wit could suggest to christianity this determined man had collected his teaching mechanics again and he had them all into the prison the moment hawes was out he could not get the cranks condemned as monsters the day was not yet come for that so he got them condemned as liars and in their place tasks of rational and productive labor were set to most of the prisoners and london written to for six more trades and arts a copy of the prison rules was cut into eight portions and eight female prisoners set to compose each her portion copies to be printed on the morrow and put up in every cell according to the wise provision of rule defied by the late jailer for an obvious reason thus in an hour after the body of hawes had passed through that gate a firm and adroit hand was wiping his gloomy soul out of the cells as we wipe a blotch of ink off a written page care too was taken every prisoner should know the late jailer was gone forever this was done to give the wretches a happy night ejaculations of thanksgiving burst from the cells every now and then by some mysterious means the immured seemed to share the joyful tidings with their fellows and one pulse of hope and triumph to beat and thrill through all the life that wasted and withered there encased in stone and until sunset the faint notes of a fiddle struggled from the garden into the temple of silence and gloom and astounded every ear the merry tunes as strutt played them sounded like dirges but they enlivened him as they sighed forth they stirred his senses and through his senses his mind and through his mind his body and so the anthropologist made a fiddle help save a life which fact no mortal man will believe whose habit it is to chatter blindfold about man and investigate the crustaceonidunculae the cranks being condemned rational industry restored and the law reseated on the throne a manslaughtering dunce had usurped the champion of human nature went home to drink his tea and write the plot of his sermon he had won a great battle and felt his victory he showed it too in his own way on the evening of this great day his voice was remarkably gentle and winning and a celestial light seemed to dwell in his eyes no word of exultation nor even of self congratulation and he made no direct mention of the prison all the evening his talk was about susan's affairs and he paid his warm thanks to her and her aunt for all they had done for him you have been true friends true allies said he what do i not owe you you have supported me in a bitter struggle and now that the day is won i can find no words to thank you as i ought both these honest women colored and glistened with pleasure but they were too modest to be ready with praise or to bandy compliments as for you susan it was a masterstroke your venturing into my den oh we turn bold when a body is ill don't we aunt i am not shy for one at the best of times remarked the latter under heaven you saved my life at least i think so susan for the medicinal power of soothing influences is immense i am sure it is apt to be underrated and then it was you who flew to malvern and dragged gulson to me at the crisis of my fate dear little true hearted friend i am sorry to think i can never repay you you forget mr eden said susan almost in a whisper i was paid beforehand i wish i could convey the native grace and gentle dignity of gratitude with which the farmer's daughter murmured these four words like a duchess acknowledging a kindness eh inquired mr eden oh ah i forgot said he naively no that is nonsense susan you have still an immense cr against my name but i know a way mrs davies for as simple as i sit here you see in me the ecclesiastic that shall unite this young lady to an honest man who report says loves her very dearly so i mean to square our little account that is fair susan what do you say la aunt why i shouldn't look upon it as a marriage at all if any clergyman but mr eden said the words that is right laughed mr eden always set some little man above some great thing and then you will always be a woman i must write the plot of my sermon ladies but you can talk to me all the same he wrote and purred every now and then to the women who purred to each other and now and then to him neither hawes nor any other irritation rankled in his heart or even stuck fast in his memory he had two sermons to prepare for sunday next and he threw his mind into them as he had into the battle he had just won hoc agebat chapter xxvii his reverence in the late battle showed himself a strategist and won without bringing up his reserves if he had failed with mr lacy he had another arrow behind in his quiver he had been twice to the mayor and claimed a coroner's jury to sit on a suicide the mayor had consented and the preliminary steps had been taken the morning after the jailer's dismissal the inquest was held mr eden evans fry and others were examined and the case came out as clear as the day and black as the night when twelve honest englishmen men of plain sense not men of system men taken from the public not from public offices sat in a circle with the corpse of a countryman at their knees fiebat lux 'twas as though twelve suns had burst into a dust hole manslaughter cried they and they sent their spokesman to the mayor and said yet more light must be let into this dusthole and the mayor said ay and it shall too i will write to london and demand more light and the men of the public went to their own homes and told their wives and children and neighbors what cruelties and villainies they had unearthed and their hearers being men and women of that people which is a god in intellect and in heart compared with the criticasters that try to misguide it with their shallow guesses and cant and with the clerks that execute it in other men's names cried out see now what is the use our building courts of law or prisons unless they are to be open unto us shut us out keep walls and closed gate between us and our servants and what comes of our courts of law and our prisons why they turn nests of villainy in less than no time the twelve honest englishmen had hardly left the jail an hour crying manslaughter and crying shame when all in a moment tomb fell a single heavy stroke of the great prison bell the heart of the prison leaped and then grew cold a long chill pause then tomb again the jurymen had told most of his fellow sufferers how josephs was driven into his grave and now tomb the remorseless iron tongue crashed out one by one the last sad stern monosyllables of this sorrowfulest of human tales they put him in his coffin tomb a boy of sixteen who would be alive now but that caitiffs whom god confound on earth made life an impossibility to him tomb and that shallows and woodcocks whom god confound on earth and unconscientious non inspecting inspectors flunkeys humbugs hirelings whom god confound on earth tomb left these scoundrels month after month and year after year unwatched though largely paid by the queen and the people to watch them tomb look on your work hirelings and listen to that bell which would not be tolling now if you had been men of brains and scruples instead of sordid hirelings the priest was on his knees praying for help from heaven to go through the last sad office with composure for he feared his own heart when he should come to say ashes to ashes and dust to dust over this hapless boy that ought to be in life still and still the great bell tolled and many of the prisoners were invited kindly in a whisper to come into the chapel but fry could not be spared and hodges fiercely refused and now the bell stopped and as it stopped the voice of the priest arose i am the resurrection and the life a deep and sad gloom was upon all as the last sad offices were done for this poor young creature cut short by foul play in the midst of them and for all he could do the priest's voice trembled often and a heavy sigh mingled more than once with the holy words what is that this our brother a thief our brother ay the priest made no mistake those were the words pause on them two great characters contradicted each other to the face over dead josephs unholy state said here is the carcass of a thief whom i and society honestly believe to be of no more importance than a dog so it has unfortunately got killed between us no matter how take this carcass and bury it said unholy state holy church took the poor abused remains with reverence prayed over them as she prays over the just and laid them in the earth calling them this our brother judge now which is all in the wrong unholy state or holy church for both cannot be right now while the grave is being filled in judge women of england and america between these two unholy state and holy church the earth contains no better judges of this doubt than you judge and i will bow to your verdict with a reverence i know male cliques too well to feel for them in a case where the great capacious heart alone can enlighten the clever little narrow shallow brain thus in the nineteenth century in a kind hearted nation under the most humane sovereign the world has ever witnessed on an earthly throne holy church in vain denouncing the miserable sinners that slay the thief their brother edward josephs has been done to death in the queen's name in the name of england and in the name of the law but each of these great insulted names has its sworn defenders its honored and paid defenders it is not for us to suppose that men so high in honor will lay aside themselves and turn curs ere i close this long story let us hope i shall be able to relate with what zeal and honor statesmen disowned and punished wholesale manslaughter done in the name of the state and with what zeal and horror judges disowned and punished wholesale manslaughter done in their name and so in all good men's eyes washed off the blood with which a hireling had bespattered the state ermine and the snow white robe of law for the present the account between josephs and the law stands thus josephs has committed the smallest theft imaginable he has stolen food for this the law professing to punish him with certain months' imprisonment has inflicted capital punishment has overtasked crucified starved overtasked starved crucified robbed him of light of sleep of hope of life has destroyed his body and perhaps his soul sum total st page of account josephs a larcenist and a corpse the law a liar and a felon chapter xxviii josephs has dropped out of our story mr hawes has got himself kicked out of our story the other prisoners of whom casual mention has been made were never in our story any more than the boy xury in robinson crusoe there remains to us in the prison mr eden and robinson a saint and a thief my readers have seen how the saint has saved the thief's life they shall guess awhile how on earth susan merton can be affected by that circumstance they have seen a set of bipeds acting on the notion that all prisoners are incurable they have seen a thief thus despaired of driven toward despair and almost made incurable through being thought so then they have seen this supposed incurable fall into the hands of a christian that held it is never too late to mend and generally i think that feebly as my pen has drawn so great a character they can calculate by what mr eden has already done what he will do while i am with susan and george what love what eloquence what ingenuity he will move to save this wandering sheep to turn this thief honest and teach him how to be honest yet not starve i will ask my reader to bear in mind that the good and wise priest has no longer his hands tied by a jailer in the interest of the foul fiend but then against all this is to be set the slippery heart of a thief a thief almost from his cradle here are great antagonist forces and they will be in daily almost hourly collision for months to come in life nothing stands still all this will work goodward or badward i must leave it to work chapter xxix mr eden's health improved so visibly that susan merton announced her immediate return to her father it was a fixed idea in this young lady's mind that she and mrs davies had no business in the house of a saint upon earth as she called mr eden except as nurses the parting of attached friends has always a touch of sadness needless to dwell on at this time enough that these two parted as brother and young sister and a spiritual adviser and advised with warm expressions of christian amity and an agreement on susan's part to write for advice and sympathy whenever needed on her arrival at grassmere farm there was mr meadows to greet her well that is attentive cried susan there was also a stranger to her a mr clinton as nothing remarkable occurred this evening we may as well explain this mr clinton he was a speculator and above all a setter on foot of rotten speculations and a keeper on foot a little while of lame ones no man exceeded him in the art of rose tinting bad paper or parchment he was sanguine and fluent his mind had two eyes an eagle's and a bat's with the first he looked at the pros and with the second at the cons of a spec he was an old acquaintance of meadows and had come thirty miles out of the way to show him how to make per cent without the shadow of a risk meadows declined to violate the laws of nature but said he if you like to stay a day or two i will introduce you to one or two who have money to fling away and he introduced him to mr merton now that worthy had a fair stock of latent cupidity and mr clinton was the man to tempt it in a very few conversations he convinced the farmer that there were a hundred ways of making money all of them quicker than the slow process of farming and the unpleasant process of denying one's self superfluities and growing saved pennies into pounds what do you think john said merton one day to meadows i have got a few hundreds loose i'm half minded to try and turn them into thousands for my girl's sake mr clinton makes it clear don't you think well i don't know was the reply i have no experience in that sort of thing but it certainly looks well the way he puts it in short meadows did not discourage his friend from co operating with mr clinton for his own part he spoke him fair and expressed openly a favorable opinion of his talent and his various projects and always found some excuse or other for not risking a halfpenny with him chapter xxx one day mr meadows walked into the post office of farnborough and said to jefferies the postmaster a word with you in private mr jefferies certainly mr meadows come to my back parlor sir a fine day mr meadows but i think we shall have a shower or two shouldn't wonder do you know this five pound note can't say i do why it has passed through your hands has it well a good many of them pass through my hands in the course of the year i wish a few of 'em would stop on the road this one did it stuck to your fingers as the phrase goes i don't know what you mean sir said jefferies haughtily you stole it explained meadows quietly take care cried jefferies in a loud quaver take care what you say i'll have my action of defamation against you double quick if you dare to say such a thing of me so be it you will want witnesses defamation is no defamation you know till the scandal is published call in your lodger ugh and call your wife cried meadows raising his voice in turn heaven forbid don't speak so loud for goodness' sake hold your tongue then and don't waste my time with your gammon said meadows sternly then resuming his former manner he went on in the tone of calm explanation one or two in this neighborhood lost money coming through the post i said to myself 'jefferies is a man that often talks of his conscience he will be the thief' so i baited six traps for you and you took five this note came over from ireland you remember it now i am ruined i am ruined you changed it at evans' the grocer's you had four sovereigns and silver for it the other baits were a note and two sovereigns and two half sovereigns you spared one sovereign the rest you nailed they were all marked by lawyer crawley they have been traced from your hand and lie locked up ready for next assizes good morning mr jefferies jefferies turned a cold jelly where he sat and meadows walked out primed crawley and sent him to stroll in sight of the post office soon a quavering voice called crawley into the post office come into my back parlor sir oh mr crawley can nothing be done no one knows my misfortune but you and mr meadows it is not for my own sake sir but my wife's if she knew i had been tempted so far astray she would never hold up her head again sir if you and mr meadows will let me off this once i will take an oath on my bended knees never to offend again what good will that do me asked crawley contemptuously ah cried jefferies a light breaking in will money make it right i'll sell the coat off my back humph if it was only me but mr meadows has such a sense of public duty and yet hum i know a way to influence him just now oh sir do pray use your influence with him what will you do for me if i succeed do for you cut myself in pieces to serve you well jefferies i'm undertaking a difficult task to turn such a man as meadows but i will try it and i think i shall succeed but i must have terms every letter that comes here from australia you must bring to me with your own hands directly i will sir i will i shall keep it an hour or two perhaps not more and i shall take no money out of it i will do it sir and with pleasure it is the least i can do for you and you must find me pounds the little rogue must do a bit on his own account i must pinch to get it said jefferies ruefully pinch then replied crawley coolly and let me have it directly you shall you shall before the day is out and you must never let meadows know i took this money of you no sir i won't is that all that is all then i am very grateful sir and i won't fail you may depend thus the two battledores played with this poor little undetected one whom his respectability no less than his roguery placed at their mercy chapter xxxi whenever mr meadows could do mr levi an ill turn he did and vice versa they hated one another like men who differ about baptism susan sprinkled dewdrops of charity on each in turn levi listened to her with infinite pleasure your voice said he is low and melodious like the voice of my own people in the east and then she secretly quoted the new testament to him having first ascertained that he had never read it and he wondered where on earth this simple girl had picked up so deep a wisdom and so lofty and self denying a morality meadows listened to her with respect from another cause but the ill offices that kept passing between the two men counteracted her transitory influence and fed fat the ancient grudge chapter xxxii will fielding is in the town i'm to arrest him as agreed last night hum no why i have got the judgment in my pocket and the constable at the public hard by never mind he was saucy to me in the market yesterday i was angry and but anger is a snare what shall i gain by locking him up just now let him go well sir your will is law said crawley obsequiously but sadly now to business of more importance at your service sir but the business of more importance was interrupted by a sudden knock at the outside door of mr meadows' study well a young lady to see you a young lady inquired meadows with no very amiable air i am engaged do you know who it is it is farmer merton's daughter david says miss merton cried meadows with a marvelous change of manner show her up directly crawley run into the passage quick man and wait for signals he bundled crawley out shut the secret door threw open both the others and welcomed susan warmly at the threshold well this is good of you miss merton to come and shine in upon me in my own house i have brought your book back replied susan coloring a little that was my errand that is said she that was partly my errand she hesitated a moment i am going to mr levi meadows' countenance fell and i wouldn't go to him without coming to you because what i have to say to him i must say to you as well mr meadows do let me persuade you out of this bitter feeling against the poor old man oh i know you will say he is worse than you are so he is a little but then consider he has more excuse than you he has never been taught how wicked it is not to forgive you know it but don't practice it meadows looked at the simple minded enthusiast and his cold eye deepened in color as it dwelt on her and his voice dropped into the low and modulated tone which no other human creature but this ever heard from him human nature is very revengeful few of us are like you it is my misfortune that i have not oftener a lesson from you perhaps you might charm away this unchristian spirit that makes me unworthy to be your your friend oh no no cried susan if i thought so should i be here your voice and your face do make me at peace with all the world susan i beg your pardon miss merton and why not susan said the young lady kindly well susan is a very inviting name la mr meadows cried susan arching her brows why it is a frightful name it is so old fashioned nobody is christened susan nowadays it is a name for everything that is good and gentle and lovely a moment more and passion would have melted all the icy barriers prudence and craft had reared round this deep heart his voice was trembling his cheek flushing but he was saved by an enemy susan cried a threatening voice at the door and there stood william fielding with a look to match rage burned in meadows' heart he said bruskly come in and seizing a slip of paper he wrote five words on it and taking out a book flung it into the passage to crawley he then turned toward w fielding who by this time had walked up to susan was on the other side of the screen was told you had gone in here said william quietly so i came after you now that was very attentive of you replied susan ironically it is so nice to have a sensible young man like you following forever at one's heels like a dog a world of quiet scorn embellished this little remark william's reply was happier than usual the sheep find the dog often in their way but they are all the safer for him well i'm sure cried susan her scorn giving way to anger mr meadows put in i must trouble you to treat miss merton with proper respect when you speak to her in my house who respects her more than i retorted william but you see mr meadows sheep are no match for wolves when the dog is away so the dog is here i see the dog is here and by his own invitation all i say is that if the dog is to stay here he must behave like a man william gasped at this hit he didn't trust himself to answer meadows in fact a blow of his fist seemed to him the only sufficient answer he turned to susan susan do you remember poor george's last words to me with a tear in his eye and his hand in mine well i keep my promise to him i keep my eye upon such as i think capable of undermining my brother this man is a schemer susan and you are too simple to fathom him the look of surprise crafty meadows put on here and william fielding's implied compliment to his own superior sagacity struck susan as infinitely ludicrous and she looked at meadows and laughed like a peal of bells of course he looked at her and laughed with her at this all young fielding's self restraint went to the winds and he went on but sooner than that i'll twist as good a man's neck as ever schemed in jack meadows' shoes at this defiance meadows wheeled round on william fielding and confronted him with his stalwart person and eyes glowing with gloomy wrath susan screamed with terror at william's insulting words and at the attitude of the two men and she made a step to throw herself between them if necessary but before words could end in blows a tap at the study door caused a diversion and a cringing sort of voice said may i come in of course you may shouted meadows the place is public anybody walks into my room to day friend or foe don't ask my leave come in man whoever you are mr crawley well i didn't expect a call from you any more than from this one now don't you be angry sir i had a good reason for intruding on you this once jackson jackson stepped forward and touched william fielding on the shoulder you must come along with me said he what for inquired fielding you are arrested on this judgment explained crawley letting the document peep a moment from his waistcoat pocket william threw himself into an attitude of defense his first impulse was to knock the officer down and run into another county but the next moment he saw the folly and injustice of this and another sentiment overpowered the honest simple fellow shame he covered his face with both his hands and groaned aloud with the sense of humiliation oh my poor william cried susan oh mr meadows can nothing be done why miss merton said meadows looking down you can't expect me to do anything for him if it was his brother now lawyer crawley shouldn't ever take him out of my house susan flushed all over that i am sure you would mr meadows cried she for feeling obscured grammar now see dear william how your temper and unworthy suspicions alienate our friends but father shan't let you lie in prison mr meadows will you lend me a sheet of paper she sat down pen in hand in generous excitement while she wrote mr meadows addressed crawley and now a word with you mr crawley you and i meet on business now and then but we are not on visiting terms that i know of how come you to walk into my house with a constable at your back well sir i did it for the best said crawley apologetically our man came in here and the street door was open and i said 'he is a friend of mr meadows perhaps it would be more delicate to all parties to take him indoors than in the open street' oh yes cried william it is bitter enough as it is but that would have been worse thank you for arresting me here and now take me away and let me hide from all the world fools said a firm voice behind the screen fools at this word and a new voice susan started up from the table and william turned his face from the wall meadows did more another cried he in utter amazement why my house is an inn ah while speaking he had run round the screen and come plump upon isaac levi seated in a chair and looking up in his face with stern composure his exclamation brought the others round after him and a group of excited faces encircled this old man seated sternly composed fools repeated he these tricks were stale before england was a nation which of you two has the judgment i sir said crawley at a look from meadows the amount a hundred and six thirteen four here is the money give me the document here sir levi read it this action was taken on a bill of exchange i must have that too here it is sir would you like an acknowledgment mr levi said crawley obsequiously no foolish man are not these sufficient vouchers you are free sir said crawley to william with an air of cheerful congratulation am i then i advise you to get out of my way for my fingers do itch to fling you headforemost down the stairs on this hint out wriggled mr crawley with a semicircle of bows to the company constable touched his frontlock and went straight away as if he was going through the opposite wall of the house meadows pointed after him with his finger and said to levi you see the road get out of my house the old man never moved from his chair to which he had returned after paying william's debts it is not your house said he coolly the other stared no matter replied meadows sharply it is mine till my mortgage is paid off i am here to pay it ah principal and interest calculated up to twelve o'clock this eleventh day of march it wants five minutes to twelve i offer you principal and interest eight hundred and twenty two pounds fourteen shillings and fivepence three farthings before these witnesses and demand the title deeds meadows hung his head but he was not a man to waste words in mere scolding he took the blow with forced calmness as who should say this is your turn the next is mine miss merton said he almost in a whisper i never had the honor to receive you here before and i never shall again how long do you give me to move my things can you not guess inquired the other with a shade of curiosity why of course you will put me to all the inconvenience you can come now am i to move all my furniture and effects out of this great house in twenty four hours i give you more than that how kind what you give me a week perhaps asked meadows incredulously more than that you fool don't you see that it is on next lady day you will be turned into the street aha woman worshiper on lady day a tooth for a tooth and the old man ground his teeth which were white as ivory and his fist clinched itself while his eye glittered and he swelled out from the chair and literally bristled with hate a tooth for a tooth oh mr levi said susan sorrowfully how soon you have forgotten my last lesson meadows for a moment felt a chill of fear at the punctiliousness of revenge in this oriental whom he had made his enemy to this succeeded the old hate multiplied by ten but he made a monstrous effort and drove it from his face down into the recesses of his heart well said he may you enjoy this house as i have done this last twelvemonth that does you credit good mr meadows cried simple susan missing his meaning meadows continued in the same tone and i must make shift with the one you vacate on lady day solomon teach me to outwit this dog come mr levi i have visited mr meadows and now i am going to your house you shall be welcome kindly welcome said the old man with large and flowing courtesy and will you show me said susan very tenderly where leah used to sit ah and where rachel and sarah loved to play ah me ah me ah me yes i could not show another these holy places but i will show you and will you forget awhile this unhappy quarrel and listen to my words surely i shall listen to you for even now your voice is to my ear like the wind sighing among the cedars of lebanon and the wave that plays at night upon the sands of galilee 'tis but the frail voice of a foolish woman who loves and respects you and yet said susan her color mantling with enthusiasm with it i can speak you words more beautiful than lebanon's cedars or galilee's shore ay old man words that make the stars brighter and the sons of the morning rejoice i will not tell you whence i had them but you shall say surely they never came from earth selfish cruel revengeful earth these words that drop on our hot passions like the dew and speak of trespasses forgiven and peace and goodwill among men oh magic of a lovely voice speaking the truths of heaven how still the room was as these goodly words rang in it from a pure heart three men there had all been raging with anger and hate now a calming music fell like oil upon these human waves and stilled them the men drooped their heads and held their breath to make sure the balmy sounds had ceased then levi answered in a tone gentle firm and low very different from his last susanna bitterness fades from my heart as you speak but experience remains he turned to meadows when i wander forth at lady day she shall still be watched over though i be far away my eye shall be here and my hand shall still be so over you all and raising his thin hand he held it high up the nails pointing downward it looked just like a hawk hovering over its prey i will say no bitterer word than that to day and in fact he delivered this without apparent heat or malice come then with me susanna a goodly name it comes to you from the despised people come like peace to my dwelling susanna you know not this world's wiles as i do but you can teach me the higher wisdom that controls the folly of passion and purifies the soul the pair were gone and william and meadows were left alone the latter looked sadly and gloomily at the door by which susan had gone out he was in a sort of torpor he was not conscious of william's presence now the said william had a misgiving in the country a man's roof is sacred he had affronted meadows under his own roof and then mr levi had come and affronted him there too william began to doubt whether this was not a little hard moreover he thought he had seen meadows brush his eye hastily with the back of his hand as susan retired he came toward meadows with his old sulky honest hang the head manner and said mr meadows seems to me we have been a little hard upon you in your own house and i am not quite easy about my share on't meadows shrugged his shoulders imperceptibly well sir i am not the almighty to read folk's hearts least of all such a one as yours but if i have done you wrong i ask your pardon come sir if you don't mean to undermine my brother with the girl you can give me your hand and i can give you mine and there 'tis meadows wished this young man away and seeing that the best way to get rid of him was to give him his hand he turned round and scarcely looking toward him gave him his hand william shook it and went away with something that sounded like a sigh meadows saw him out and locked the door impatiently then he flung himself into a chair and laid his beating temples on the cold table then he started up and walked wildly to and fro the room the man was torn this way and that with rage love and remorse what shall i do thus ran his thoughts that angel is my only refuge and yet to win her i shall have to walk through dirt and shame and every sin that is i see crimes ahead such a heap of crimes my flesh creeps at the number of them why not be like her why not be the greatest saint that ever lived instead of one more villain added to so many let me tear this terrible love out of my heart and die oh if some one would but take me by the scurf of the neck and drag me to some other country a million miles away where i might never see my tempter again till this madness is out of me susan you are an angel but you will plunge me to hell now it happened while he was thus raving and suffering the preliminary pangs of wrong doing that his old servant knocked at the outside of the door and thrust a letter through the trap the letter was from a country gentleman one mr chester for whom he had done business mr chester wrote from lancashire he informed meadows he had succeeded to a very large property in that county it had been shockingly mismanaged by his predecessor he wanted a capable man's advice and moreover all the estates thereabouts were compelled to be surveyed and valued this year which he deplored but since so it was he would be surveyed and valued by none but john meadows come by return of post added this hasty squire and i'll introduce you to half the landed proprietors in this county meadows read this and seizing a pen wrote thus dear sir yours received this day at pm and will start for your house at pm he threw himself on his horse and rode to his mother's house mother i am turned out of my house why john you don't say so i must go into the new house i have built outside the town what the one you thought to let to mr james the same i have got only a fortnight to move all my things will you do me a kindness now will you see them put into the new house me john why i should be afraid something would go wrong well it isn't fair of me to put this trouble on you at your age but read this letter there is fifteen hundred pounds waiting for me in the north the old woman put on her spectacles and read the letter slowly go john go by all means i will see all your things moved into the new house don't let them be a hindrance you go your old mother will take care your things are not hurt moving nor you wronged in the way of expense thank you mother thank you they say there is no friend like a mother and i dare say they are not far wrong no such friend but god none such but god said the old woman with great emphasis and looking meadows in the face with a searching eye well then here are the keys of the new house and here are my keys i am off tonight so good by mother god bless you he had just turned to go when by an unusual impulse he turned took the old woman in his hands almost lifted her off the ground for she weighed light and gave her a hasty kiss on the cheek then he set her down and strode out of the house about his business when curious hannah ran in the next moment she found the old lady in silent agitation oh dear what is the matter dame meadows nothing at all silly girl nothing and look at you all of a tremble he took me up all in a moment and kissed me i dare say it is five and twenty years since he kissed me last he was a curly headed lad then so this had set the poor old thing trembling she soon recovered her firmness and that very evening hannah and she slept in john's house and the next day set to and began to move his furniture and prepare his new house for him chapter xxxiii peter crawley received a regular allowance during his chief's absence and remained in constant communication with him and was as heretofore his money bag his tool his invisible hand but if anybody had had a microscope and lots of time they might have discovered a gloomy hue spreading itself over crawley's soul a pleasant illusion had been rudely shaken all men have something they admire crawley admired cunning it is not a sublime quality but crawley thought it was and revered it with pious affectionate awe he had always thought mr meadows no in cunning but now came a doleful suspicion that he was no losing a portion of his veneration for the chief he had seen outmaneuvered he took the liberty of getting drunk contrary to his severe command and being drunk and maudlin he unbosomed himself on this head to a low woman who was his confidante whenever drink loosened his tongue i'm out spirits sal i'm tebbly out spirits where shall we all go to i dinn't think there was great a man on earth z mizza meadows but the worlz wide mizza levi z greada man a mudge greada man hic he was down upon us like a amma hic his jew's eye went through our lill sgeme like a gimlet 'fools' says he that's me and meadows 'these dodges were used up in our family before lunnun was built fools' mizza levi despises me and meadows and i respect him accordingly i'm tebbly out spirits hic chapter xxxiv farmer merton received a line from meadows telling him he had gone into lancashire on important business and did not expect to be back for three months except perhaps for a day at a time merton handed the letter to susan we shall miss him was her remark that we shall he is capital company and a worthy man into the bargain said susan warmly spite of what little minded folk say and think what do you think that will fielding did only yesterday i don't know well he followed me into there it is not worth while having an open quarrel but i shall hate the sight of his very face i can't think how such a fool can be george's brother no wonder george and he could not agree poor mr meadows to be affronted in his own house just for treating me with respect and civility so that is a crime now what are you saying girl that young pauper affront my friend meadows the warmest man for fifty miles round if he has he shall never come on my premises again you may take your oath of that susan looked aghast this was more than she had bargained for she was the last in the world to set two people by the ears now don't you be so peppery father said she there is nothing to make a quarrel about yes there is though if that ignorant beggar insulted my friend no no no why what did you say i say that here is mr clinton coming to the door let him in girl let him in and you needn't stay we are going to talk business chapter xxxv mrs meadows preparing her son's new home and defeating the little cheating tradesmen and workmen that fasten like leeches on such as carry their furniture to a new house hannah working round and round her in a state of glorious excitement crawley smelling of betts' british brandy and slightly regretting he was not no 's tool levi's instead of no 's as he now bitterly called him and writing obsequious letters to and doing the dirty work of the said no old merton speculating sometimes losing sometimes winning meadows gone to lancashire with a fixed idea that susan would be his ruin if he could not cure himself of his love for her susan rather regretting his absence and wishing for his return that she might show him how little she sympathized with will fielding's suspicions injustice and brutality leaving all this to work our story follows an honest fellow to the other side of the globe chapter xxxvi george fielding found farmer dodd waiting to drive him to the town where he was to meet mr winchester the farmer's wife would press a glass of wine upon george she was an old playmate of his and the tear was in her eye as she shook his hand and bade heaven bless him and send him safe back to the grove a taking of his hand and him going across sea can't ye do no better nor that cried the stout farmer i'm not a looking dame so then mrs dodd put her hands on george's shoulders and kissed him rustic wise on both cheeks and he felt a tear on his cheek and stammered good by jane you and i were always good neighbors but now we shan't be neighbors for a while ned drive me away please and let me shut my eyes and forget that ever i was born the farmer made a signal of intelligence to his wife and drove him hastily away they went along in silence for about two miles then the farmer suddenly stopped george looked up the other looked down allen's corner george you know 'the grove' is in sight from here and after this we shan't see it again on account of this here wood you know thank ye ned yes one more look the afternoon sun lies upon it oh how different it do seem to my eyes now by what it used when i rode by from market but then i was going to it now i'm going far far from it never heed me ned i shall be better in a moment heaven forgive me for thinking so little of the village folk as i have done then he suddenly threw up his hands god bless the place and bless the folk he cried very loud god bless them all from the oldest man in it and that is grandfather down to isaac king's little girl that was born yester night and may none of them ever come to this corner and their faces turned toward the sea doant ye george doant ye doant ye doant ye cried edward dodd in great agitation let the mare go on ned she is fretting through her skin i'll fret her roared the farmer lifting his whip exactly as if it was a sword and a cut to be made at a dragoon's helmet i'll cut her liver out no ye shan't said george poor thing she is thinking of her corn at the queen's head in newborough she isn't going across the sea let her go i've taken my last look and said my last word and he covered up his face farmer dodd drove on in silence except that every now and then he gave an audible snivel and whenever this occurred he always accommodated the mare with a smart cut reasonable at newborough they found mr winchester he drove george to the rail and that night they slept on board the phoenix emigrant ship here they found three hundred men and women in a ship where there was room for two hundred and fifty accommodation for eighty next morning farmer said mr winchester gayly we have four hours before we sail some of these poor people will suffer great hardships between this and sydney suppose you and i go and buy a lot of blankets brawn needles canvas greatcoats felt american beef solidified milk macintoshes high lows and thimbles that will rouse us up a little thank you sir kindly out they went into the ratcliffe highway and chaffered with some of the greatest rascals in trade the difference between what they asked and what they took made george stare their little cabin was crowded with goods only just room left for the aristocrat the farmer and carlo and now the hour came poor george was roused from his lethargy by the noise and bustle and oh the creaking of cables sickened his heart then the steamer came up and took them in tow and these our countrymen and women were pulled away from their native land too little and too full to hold us all it was a sad sight saddest to those whose own flesh and blood was on the shore and saw the steamer pull them away bitterest to those who had no friend to watch them go how they clung to england they stretched out their hands to her and when they could hold to her no other way they waved their hats and their handkerchiefs to their countrymen who waved to them from shore and so they spun out a little longer the slender chain that visibly bound them to her and at this moment even the iron hearted and the reckless were soft and sad our hearts' roots lie in the soil we have grown on no wonder then george fielding leaned over the ship side benumbed with sorrow and counted each foot of water as it glided by and thought now i am so much farther from susan for a wonder he was not sea sick but his appetite was gone from a nobler cause he could hardly be persuaded to eat at all for many days the steamer cast off at gravesend and the captain made sail and beat down the channel off the scilly isles a northeasterly breeze and the phoenix crowded all her canvas when topsails royals skyscrapers and all were drawing the men rigged out booms alow and aloft and by means of them set studding sails out several yards clear of the hull on either side so on she plowed her canvas spread out like an enormous fan or a huge albatross all wings a goodly gallant show but under all this vast and swelling plumage an exile's heart of all that smarted ached and throbbed beneath that swelling plumage few suffered more than poor george it was his first great sorrow and all so new and strange the ship touched at madeira and then flew southward with the favoring gale many leagues she sailed and still george hung over the bulwarks and sadly watched the waves this simple minded honest fellow was not a girl if they had offered to put the ship about and take him back he would not have consented but yet to go on almost broke his heart he was steel and butter his friend the honorable frank winchester was or seemed all steel he was one of those sanguine spirits that don't admit into their minds the notion of ultimate failure he was supported too by a natural and indomitable gayety whatever most men grumble or whine at he took as practical jokes played by fortune partly to try his good humor but more to amuse him the poorer passengers suffered much discomfort and the blankets etc stored in winchester's cabin often warmed these two honest hearts as with pitying hands they wrapped them round some shivering fellow creature off cape verd a heavy gale came on it lasted thirty six hours and the distress and sufferings of the over crowded passengers were terrible an unpaternal government had allowed a ship to undertake a voyage of twelve thousand miles with a short crew short provisions and just twice as many passengers as could be protected from the weather driven from the deck by the piercing wind and the deluges of water that came on board and crowded into the narrowest compass many of these unfortunates almost died of sickness and polluted air and when in despair they rushed back upon deck horrors and suffering met them in another shape in vain they huddled together for a little warmth and tried to shield themselves with blankets stretched to windward the bitter blast cut like a razor through their threadbare defenses and the water rushed in torrents along the deck and crept cold as ice up their bodies as they sat huddled or lay sick and despairing on the hard and tossing wood and whenever a heavier sea than usual struck the ship a despairing scream burst from the women and the good ship groaned and shivered and seemed to share their fears and the blast yelled into their souls i am mighty as fate as fate and pitiless pitiless pitiless pitiless pitiless oh then how they longed for a mud cabin or a hole picked with a pickax in some ancient city wall or a cow house or a cart shed in their native land but it is an ill wind that blows nobody good this storm raised george fielding's better part of man integer vitae scelerisque purus was not very much afraid to die once when the phoenix gave a weather roll that wetted the foresail to the yard arm he said my poor susan with a pitying accent not a quavering one but most of the time he was busy crawling on all fours from one sufferer to another with a drop of brandy in a phial the wind emptied a glass of the very moisture let alone the liquid in a moment so george would put his bottle to some poor creature's lips and if it was a man he would tell him in his simple way who was stronger than the wind or the sea and that the ship could not go down without his will to the women he whispered that he had just had a word with the captain and he said it was only a gale not a tempest as the passengers fancied and there was no danger none whatever the gale blew itself out and then for an hour or two the ship rolled frightfully but at last the angry sea went down the decks were mopped the phoenix shook her wet feathers and spread her wings again and glided on her way george felt a little better the storm shook him and roused him and did him good and it was a coincidence in the history of these two lovers that just as susan under mr eden's advice was applying the healing ointment of charitable employment to her wound george too was finding a little comfort and life from the little bit of good he and his friend did to the poor population in his wooden hamlet after a voyage of four months one evening the captain shortened sail though the breeze was fair and the night clear upon being asked the reason of this strange order he said knowingly if you get up with the sun perhaps you will see the reason curiosity being excited one or two did rise before the sun just as he emerged from the sea a young seaman called patterson who was in the foretop hailed the deck what is it roared the mate land on the weather bow sung out the seaman in reply land in one moment the word ran like electric fire through all the veins of the phoenix the upper deck was crowded in a minute but all were disappointed no one saw land but mr patterson whose elevation and keen sight gave him an advantage but a heavenly smell as of a region of cowslips came and perfumed the air and rejoiced all the hearts at six o'clock a something like a narrow cloud broke the watery horizon on the weather bow all sail was made and at noon the coast of australia glittered like a diamond under their lee then the three hundred prisoners fell into a wild excitement some became irritable others absurdly affectionate to people they did not care a button for the captain himself was not free from the intoxication he walked the deck in jerks instead of his usual roll and clapped on sail as if he would fly on shore at half past one they glided out of the open sea into the port jackson river they were now in a harbor fifteen miles long land locked on both sides and not a shoal or a rock in it this wonderful haven in which all the navies that float or ever will float might maneuver all day and ride at anchor all night without jostling was the sea avenue by which they approached a land of wonders it was the second of december the sky was purple and the sun blazed in its center the land glittered like a thousand emeralds beneath his glowing smile and the waves seemed to drink his glory and melt it into their tints so rich were the flakes of burning gold that shone in the heart of their transparent lovely blue oh what a heavenly land and after four months' prison at sea our humble hero's heart beat high with hope surely in so glorious a place as this he could make a thousand pounds and then dart back with it to susan long before the ship came to an anchor george got a sheet of paper and by a natural impulse wrote to susan a letter telling her all the misery the phoenix and her passengers had come through between london bridge and sydney cove and as soon as he had written it he tore it up and threw it into the water it would have vexed her to hear what i have gone through time enough to tell her that when i am home again sitting by the fire with her hand in mine so then he tried again and wrote a cheerful letter and concealed all his troubles except his sorrow at being obliged to go so far from her even for a time but it is only for a time susan dear and susan dear i've got a good friend here and one that can feel for us for he is here on the same errand as i am i am to bide with him six months and help him the best i can and so i shall learn how matters are managed here and after that i am to set up on my own account and susan dear i do think by all i can see there is money to be made here heaven knows my heart was never much set on gain but it is now because it is the road to you please tell will carlo has been a great comfort to me and is a general favorite he pointed a rat on board ship but it was excusable and him cooped up so long and had almost forgotten the smell of a bird i daresay and if anybody comes to make believe to threaten me he is ready to pull them down in a minute so tell will this and that i do think his master is as much my friend at home as the dog is out here susan dear i do beg of you as a great favor to keep up your heart and not give way to grief or desponding feelings i don't leastways i won't poor mr winchester is here on the same errand as i am but i often think his heart is stouter than mine which is much to his credit and little to mine susan dear i have come to the country that is farther from grassmere than any other in the globe that seems hard and my very face is turned the opposite way to yours as i walk but nothing can ever turn my heart away from my susan i desire my respects to mr merton and that you would tell him i will make the one thousand pounds please god but i hope you will pray for me susan that i may have that success you are so good that i do think the almighty will hear you sooner than me or any one so no more at present dear susan but remain with sincere respect your loving servant and faithful lover till death george fielding they landed mr winchester purchased the right of feeding cattle over a large tract a hundred miles distant from sydney and after a few days spent in that capital started with their wagons into the interior there for about five months george was mr winchester's factotum and though he had himself much to learn the country and its habits being new to him still he saved his friend from fundamental errors and from five in the morning till eight at night put zeal honesty and the muscular strength of two ordinary men at his friend's service at the expiration of this period mr winchester said to him one evening george i can do my work alone now and the time is come to show my sense of your services and friendship i have bought a run for you about eight miles from here and now you are to choose five hundred sheep and thirty beasts the black pony you ride goes with them oh no sir it is enough to rob you of them at all without me going and taking the pick of them well will you consent to pen the flocks and then lift one hurdle and take them as they come out so many from each lot that i consent to sir and remain your debtor for life i can't see it i set my life a great deal higher than sheepskin mr winchester did not stop there he forced a hundred pounds upon george if you start in any business with an empty pocket you are a gone coon so these two friends parted with mutual esteem and george set to work by prudence and vigor to make the thousand pounds one thousand pounds this one is to have the woman he loves for a thousand pounds that sounds cheap heaven upon earth for a thousand pounds what is a thousand pounds nothing there are slippery men that gain this in a week by time bargains trading on capital of round 's others who net as much in an evening and as honorably by cards there are merchants who net twenty times this sum by a single operation an operation inquires belgravia this is an operation you send forth a man not given to drink and consequently chatter to amsterdam another not given to drink and chatter to new orleans another n g t d and c to bordeaux cadiz canton liverpool japan and where not all with secret instructions then at an appointed day all the men n g t d and c begin gradually secretly cannily to buy up in all those places all the lac dye or something of the kind that you and i thought there was about thirty pounds of in creation this done mercator raises the price of lac dye or what not throughout europe if he is greedy and raises it a halfpenny a pound perhaps commerce revolts and invokes nature against so vast an oppression and nature comes and crushes our speculator but if he be wise and puts on what mankind can bear say three mites per pound then he sells tons and tons at this fractional profit on each pound and makes fourteen thousand pounds by lac dye or the like of which you and i thought creation held thirty or at most thirty two pounds these men are the warriors of commerce but its smaller captains watching the fluctuations of this or that market can often turn a thousand pounds ere we could say j r far more than a thousand pounds have been made in a year by selling pastry off a table in the boulevards of paris in matters practical a single idea is worth thousands this nation being always in a hurry paid four thousand pounds to a man to show them how to separate letter stamps in a hurry punch the divisions full of little holes said he and he held out his hand for the four thousand pounds and now test his invention tear one head from another in a hurry and you will see that money sometimes goes cheaper than invention a single idea is sometimes worth a thousand pounds in a book though books are by far the least lucrative channels ideas run in mr bradshaw's duodecimo to wit profit seven thousand pounds per annum a thousand pounds how many men have toiled for money all their lives have met with success yet never reached a thousand pounds eight thousand servants fed and half clothed at their master's expense have put by for forty years and yet not even by aid of interest and compound interest and perquisites and commissions squeezed out of little tradesmen and other time honored embezzlements have reached the rubicon of four figures five thousand little shopkeepers active intelligent and greedy have bought wholesale and sold retail yet never mounted so high as this above rent housekeeping bad debts and casualties many a writer of genius has charmed his nation and adorned her language yet never held a thousand pounds in his hand even for a day many a great painter has written the world wide language of form and color and attained to european fame but not to a thousand pounds sterling english among all these aspirants and a million more george fielding now made one urged and possessed by as keen an incentive as ever spurred a man george's materials were five hundred sheep twenty cows ten bullocks two large sheep dogs and carlo it was a keen clear frosty day in july when he drove his herd to his own pasture his heart beat high that morning he left abner his shepherd a white native of the colony to drive the slow cattle he strode out in advance and scarce felt the ground beneath his feet the thermometer was at degrees yet his coat was only tied round his neck by the sleeves as he swept along all health fire manhood love and hope he marched this day like dear smollett's lines whose thoughts though he had never heard them fired his heart thy spirit independence let me share lord of the lion heart and eagle eye thy steps i follow with my bosom bare nor heed the storm that howls along the sky he was on the ground long before abner and set to work building a roofless hut on the west side of some thick bushes and hard by the only water near at hand and here he fixed his headquarters stretched a blanket across the hut for a roof and slept his own master chapter xxxvii at the end of six months george fielding's stock had varied thus four hundred lambs ten calves fifteen cows four hundred sheep he had lost some sheep in lambing and one cow in calving but these casualties every feeder counts on he had been lucky on the whole he had sold about eighty sheep and eaten a few but not many and of his hundred pounds only five pounds were gone against which and the decline in cows were to be placed the calves and lambs george considered himself eighty pounds richer in substance than six months ago it so happened that on every side of george but one were nomads shepherd kings fellows with a thousand head of horned cattle and sheep like white pebbles by the sea but on his right hand was another small bucolical a scotchman who had started with less means than himself and was slowly working his way making a halfpenny and saving a penny after the manner of his nation these two were mighty dissimilar but they were on a level as to means and near neighbors and that drew them together in particular they used to pay each other friendly visits on sunday evenings and mclaughlan would read a good book to george for he was strict in his observances but after that the pair would argue points of husbandry but one sunday that george admiring his stock inadvertently proposed to him an exchange of certain animals he rebuked the young man with awful gravity is this a day for warldly dealings said he hoo div ye think to thrive gien y'offer your mairchandeeze o' the sabba day george colored up to the eyes ye'll may be no hae read the paurable o' the money changers

nae sen that ever i heerd't c way chapter xxxviii george heard of a farmer who was selling off his sheep about fifty miles off near the coast george put money in his purse rose at three and walked the fifty miles with carlo that day the next he chaffered with the farmer but they did not quite agree george was vexed but he knew it would not do to show it so he strolled away carelessly toward the water in this place the sea comes several miles inland not in one sheet but in a series of salt water lakes very pretty george stood and admired the water and the native blacks paddling along in boats of bark no bigger than a cocked hat these strips of bark are good for carriage and bad for carriage i mean they are very easily carried on a man's back ashore but they won't carry a man on the water so well and sitting in them is like balancing on a straw these absurd vehicles have come down to these blockheads from their fathers so they won't burn them and build according to reason they commonly paddle in companies of three so then whenever one is purled the other two come on each side of him each takes a hand and with amazing skill and delicacy they reseat him in his cocked hat which never sinks only purls several of these triads passed in the middle of the lake looking to george like inverted capital t's they went a tremendous pace with occasional stoppages when a purl occurred presently a single savage appeared nearer the land and george could see his lithe sinewy form and the grace and rapidity with which he urged his gossamer bark along it was like a hawk half a dozen rapid strokes of his wings and then a smooth glide for ever so far our savages would sit on the blade of a knife i do think was george's observation now as george looked and admired blackee it unfortunately happened that a mosquito flew into blackee's nostrils which were much larger and more inviting to a gnat than ours the aboriginal sneezed and over went the ancestral boat the next moment he was seen swimming and pushing his boat before him he was scarce a hundred yards from the shore when all of a sudden down he went george was frightened and took off his coat and was unlacing his boots when the black came up again oh he was only larking thought george but he has left his boat and why there he goes down again the savage made a dive and came up ten yards nearer the shore but he kept his face parallel to it and he was scarce a moment in sight before he dived again then a horrible suspicion flashed across george there is something after him this soon became a fearful certainty just before he dived next time a dark object was plainly visible on the water close behind him george was wild with fear for poor blackee he shouted at the monster he shouted and beckoned to the swimmer and last snatching up a stone he darted up a little bed of rock elevated about a yard above the shore the next dive the black came up within thirty yards of this very place but the shark came at him the next moment he dived again but before the fish followed him george threw a stone with great precision and force at him it struck the water close by him as he turned to follow his prey george jumped down and got several more stones and held one foot advanced and his arm high in air up came the savage panting for breath the fish made a dart george threw a stone it struck him with such fury on the shoulders that it span off into the air and fell into the sea forty yards off down went the man and the fish after him the next time they came up to george's dismay the sea tiger showed no signs of being hurt and the man was greatly distressed the moment he was above water george heard him sob and saw the whites of his eyes as he rolled them despairingly and he could not dive again for want of breath seeing this the shark turned on his back and came at him with his white belly visible and his treble row of teeth glistening in a mouth like a red grave rage as well as fear seized george fielding the muscles started on his brawny arm as he held it aloft with a heavy stone in it the black was so hard pressed the last time and so dead beat that he could make but a short duck under the fish's back and come out at his tail the shark did not follow him this time but cunning as well as ferocious slipped a yard or two inshore and waited to grab him not seeing him he gave a slap with his tail fin and reared his huge head out of water a moment to look forth then george fielding grinding his teeth with fury flung his heavy stone with tremendous force at the creature's cruel eye the heavy stone missed the eye by an inch or two but it struck the fish on the nose and teeth with a force that would have felled a bullock creesh went the sea tiger's flesh and teeth and the blood squirted in a circle down went the shark like a lump of lead literally felled by the crashing stroke i've hit him i've hit him roared george seizing another stone come here quick quick before he gets the better of it the black swam like a mad thing to george george splashed into the water up to his knee and taking blackee under the arm pits tore him out of the water and set him down high and dry give us your hand over it old fellow cried george panting and trembling oh dear my heart is in my mouth it is the black's eye seemed to kindle a little at george's fire but all the rest of him was as cool as a cucumber he let george shake his hand and said quietly thank you sar jacky thank you a good deal he added in the same breath suppose you lend me a knife then we eat a good deal george lent him his knife and to his surprise the savage slipped into the water again his object was soon revealed the shark had come up to the surface and was floating motionless it was with no small trepidation george saw this cool hand swim gently behind him and suddenly disappear in a moment however the water was red all round and the shark turned round on his belly jacky swam behind and pushed him ashore it proved to be a young fish about six feet long but it was as much as the men could do to lift it the creature's nose was battered and jacky showed this to george and let him know that a blow on that part was deadly to them you make him dead for a little while said he so then i make him dead enough to eat and he showed where he had driven the knife into him in three places jacky's next proceeding was to get some dry sticks and wood and prepare a fire which to george's astonishment he lighted thus he got a block of wood in the middle of which he made a little hole then he cut and pointed a long stick and inserting the point into the block worked it round between his palms for some time and with increasing rapidity presently there came a smell of burning wood and soon after it burst into a flame at the point of contact jacky cut slices of shark and toasted them black fellow stupid fellow eat 'em raw but i eat 'em burn't like white man he then told george he had often been at sydney and could speak the white man's language a good deal and must on no account be confounded with common black fellows he illustrated his civilization by eating the shark as it cooked that is to say as soon as the surface was brown he gnawed it off and put the rest down to brown again and so ate a series of laminae instead of a steak that it would be cooked to the center if he let it alone was a fact this gentleman had never discovered probably had never had the patience to discover george finding the shark's flesh detestable declined it and watched the other presently he vented his reflections well you are a cool one half an hour ago i didn't expect to see you eating him quite the contrary jacky grinned good humoredly in reply when george returned to the farmer the latter who had begun to fear the loss of a customer came at once to terms with him the next day he started for home with three hundred sheep jacky announced that he should accompany him and help him a good deal george's consent was not given simply because it was not asked however having saved the man's life he was not sorry to see a little more of him it is usual in works of this kind to give minute descriptions of people's dress i fear i have often violated this rule however i will not in this case jacky's dress consisted of in front a sort of purse made of rat skin behind a bran new tomahawk and two spears george fancied this costume might be improved upon he therefore bought from the farmer a second hand coat and trousers and his new friend donned them with grinning satisfaction the farmer's wife pitied george living by himself out there and she gave him several little luxuries a bacon ham some tea and some orange marmalade and a little lump sugar and some potatoes he gave the potatoes to jacky to carry they weighed but a few pounds george himself carried about a quarter of a hundredweight for all that the potatoes worried jacky more than george's burden him at last he loitered behind so long that george sat down and lighted his pipe presently up comes niger with the sleeves of his coat hanging on each side of his neck and the potatoes in them my lord had taken his tomahawk and chopped off the sleeves at the arm pit then he had sewed up their bottoms and made bags of them uniting them at the other end by a string which rested on the back of his neck like a milkmaid's balance being asked what he had done with the rest of the coat he told george he had thrown it away because it was a good deal hot but it won't be hot at night and then you will wish you hadn't been such a fool said george irate no he couldn't make jacky see this being hot at the time jacky could not feel the cold to come jacky became a hanger on of george and if he did little he cost little and if a beast strayed he was invaluable he could follow the creature for miles by a chain of physical evidence no single link of which a civilized man would have seen a quantity of rain having fallen and filled all the pools george thought he would close with an offer that had been made him and swap one hundred and fifty sheep for cows and bullocks he mentioned this intention to mclaughlan one sunday evening mclaughlan warmly approved his intention george then went on to name the customer who was disposed to make the exchange in question at this the worthy mclaughlan showed some little uneasiness and told george he might do better than deal with that person george said he should be glad to do better but did not see how humph said mclaughlan and fidgeted mclaughlan then invited george to a glass of grog and while they were sipping he gave an order to his man mclaughlan inquired when the proposed negotiation was likely to take place to morrow morning said george he asked me to go over about it this afternoon but i remembered the lesson you gave me about making bargains on this day and i said 'to morrow farmer' y're a guid lad said the scot demurely y're just as decent a body as ever i forgathered wi' and i'm thinking it's a sin to let ye gang twa miles for mairchandeeze whan ye can hae it a hantle cheaper at your ain door can i i don't know what you mean ye dinna ken what i mean maybe no mr mclaughlan fell into thought a while and the grog being finished he proposed a stroll he took george out into the yard and there the first thing they saw was a score and a half of bullocks that had just been driven into a circle and were maintained there by two men and two dogs george's eye brightened at the sight and his host watched it aweel said he has tamson a bonnier lot than yon to gie ye i don't know said george dryly i have not seen his but i hae and he hasna a lot to even wi' them i shall know to morrow said george but he eyed mclaughlan's cattle with an expression there was no mistaking aweel said the worthy scot ye're a neebor and a decent lad ye are sae i'll just speer ye ane question noo mon continued he in a most mellifluous tone and pausing at every word gien it were monday as it is the sabba day hoo mony sheep wud ye gie for yon bonnie beasties george finding his friend in this mind pretended to hang back and to consider himself bound to treat with thomson first the result of all which was that mclaughlan came over to him at daybreak and george made a very profitable exchange with him at the end of six months more george found himself twice as rich in substance as at first starting but instead of one hundred pounds cash he had but eighty still if sold up he would have fetched five hundred pounds but more than a year was gone since he began on his own account well said george i must be patient and still keep doubling on and if i do as well next year as last i shall be worth eight hundred pounds a month's dry hot weather came and george had arduous work to take water to his bullocks and to drive them in from long distances to his homestead where by digging enormous tanks he had secured a constant supply no man ever worked for a master as this rustic hercules worked for susan merton prudent george sold twenty bullocks and cows to the first bidder i can buy again at a better time argued he he had now one hundred and twenty five pounds in hand the drought continued and he wished he had sold more one morning abner came hastily in and told him that nearly all the beasts and cows were missing george flung himself on his horse and galloped to the end of his run no signs of them returning disconsolate he took jacky on his crupper and went over the ground with him jacky's eyes were playing and sparkling all the time in search of signs nothing clear was discovered then at jacky's request they rode off george's feeding ground altogether and made for a little wood about two miles distant suppose you stop here i go in the bush said jacky george sat down and waited in about two hours jacky came back i've found 'em said jacky coolly george rose in great excitement and followed jacky through the stiff bush often scratching his hands and face at last jacky stopped and pointed to the ground there there ye foolish creature cried george that's ashes where somebody has lighted a fire that and a bone or two is all i see beef bone replied jacky coolly george started with horror black fellow burn beef here and eat him black fellow a great thief black fellow take all your beef now we catch black fellow and shoot him suppose he not tell us where the other beef gone but how am i to catch him how am i even to find him you wait till the sun so then black fellow burn more beef then i see the smoke then i catch him you go fetch the make thunder with two mouths when he see him that make him honest a good deal off galloped george and returned with his double barreled gun in about an hour and a half he found jacky where he had left him at the foot of a gumtree tall and smooth as an admiral's main mast jacky who was coiled up in happy repose like a dog in warm weather rose and with a slight yawn said now i go up and look he made two sharp cuts on the tree with his tomahawk and putting his great toe in the nick rose on it made another nick higher up and holding the smooth stem put his other great toe in it and so on till in an incredibly short time he had reached the top and left a staircase of his own making behind him he had hardly reached the top when he slid down to the bottom again and announced that he had discovered what they were in search of george haltered the pony to the tree and followed jacky who struck farther into the wood after a most disagreeable scramble at the other side of the wood jacky stopped and put his finger to his lips they both went cautiously out of the wood and mounting a bank that lay under its shelter they came plump upon a little party of blacks four male and three female the women were seated round a fire burning beef and gnawing the outside laminae then putting it down to the fire again the men who always serve themselves first were lying gorged but at sight of george and jacky they were on their feet in a moment and their spears poised in their hands jacky walked down the bank and poured a volley of abuse into them between two of his native sentences he uttered a quiet aside to george suppose black fellow lift spear you shoot him dead and then abused them like pickpockets again and pointed to the make thunder with two mouths in george's hand after a severe cackle on both sides the voices began to calm down like water going off the boil and presently soft low gutturals passed in pleasant modulation then the eldest male savage made a courteous signal to jacky that he should sit down and gnaw jacky on this administered three kicks among the gins and sent them flying then down he sat and had a gnaw at their beef george's beef i mean the rage of hunger appeased he rose and with the male savages took the open country on the way he let george know that these black fellows were of his tribe that they had driven off the cattle and that he had insisted on restitution which was about to be made and sure enough before they had gone a mile they saw some beasts grazing in a narrow valley george gave a shout of joy but counting them he found fifteen short when jacky inquired after the others the blacks shrugged their shoulders they knew nothing more than this that wanting a dinner they had driven off forty bullocks but finding they could only eat one that day they had killed one and left the others of whom some were in the place they had left them the rest were somewhere they didn't know where far less care they had dined that was enough for them when this characteristic answer reached george he clinched his teeth and for a moment felt an impulse to make a little thunder on their slippery black carcasses but he groaned instead and said they were never taught any better then jacky and he set to work to drive the cattle together with infinite difficulty they got them all home by about eleven o'clock at night the next day up with the sun to find the rest two o'clock and only one had they fallen in with and the sun broiled so that lazy jacky gave in and crept in under the beast for shade and george was fain to sit on his shady side with moody brow and sorrowful heart presently jacky got up i find one said he where where cried george looking all round jacky pointed to a rising ground at least six miles off george groaned are you making a fool of me i can see nothing but a barren hill with a few great bushes here and there you are never taking those bushes for beasts jacky smiled with utter scorn white fellow stupid fellow he see nothing well and what does black fellow see snapped george black fellow see a crow coming from the sun and when he came over there he turned and went down and not get up again a good while then black fellow say 'i tink' presently come flying one more crow from that other side where the sun is not black fellow watch him and when he come over there he turn round and go down too and not get up a good while then black fellow say 'i know' oh come along cried george they hurried on but when they came to the rising ground and bushes jacky put his finger to his lips suppose we catch the black fellows that have got wings you make thunder for them he read the answer in george's eye then he took george round the back of the hill and they mounted the crest from the reverse side they came over it and there at their very feet lay one of george's best bullocks with tongue protruded breathing his last gasp a crow of the country was perched on his ribs digging his thick beak into a hole he had made in his ribs and another was picking out one of his eyes the birds rose heavily clogged and swelling with gore george's eyes flashed his gun went up to his shoulder and jacky saw the brown barrel rise slowly for a moment as it followed the nearest bird wobbling off with broad back invitingly displayed to the marksman bang the whole charge shivered the ill omened glutton who instantly dropped riddled with shot like a sieve while a cloud of dusky feathers rose from him into the air the other hearing the earthly thunder and jacky's exulting whoop gave a sudden whirl with his long wing and shot up into the air at an angle and made off with great velocity but the second barrel followed him as he turned and followed him as he flew down the wind bang out flew two handfuls of dusky feathers and glutton no died in the air and its carcass and expanded wings went whirling like a sheet of paper and fell on the top of a bush at the foot of the hill all this delighted the devil may care jacky but it may be supposed it was small consolation to george he went up to the poor beast who died even as he looked down on him drought jacky drought said he it is moses the best of the herd oh moses why couldn't you stay beside me i'm sure i never let you want for water and never would you left me to find worse friends and so the poor simple fellow moaned over the unfortunate creature and gently reproached him for his want of confidence in him that it was pitiful then suddenly turning on jacky he said gravely moses won't be the only one i doubt the words were hardly out of his mouth before a loud moo proclaimed the vicinity of cattle they ran toward the sound and in a rocky hollow they found nine bullocks and alas at some little distance another lay dead those that were alive were panting with lolling tongues in the broiling sun how to save them how to get them home a distance of eight miles oh for a drop of water the poor fools had strayed into the most arid region for miles round instinct makes blunders as well as reason bestiale est errare we must drive them from this jacky though half of them die by the way the languid brutes made no active resistance being goaded and beaten they got on their legs and moved feebly away three miles the men drove them and then one who had been already staggering more than the rest gave in and lay down and no power could get him up again jacky advised to leave him george made a few steps onward with the other cattle but then he stopped and came back to the sufferer and sat down beside him disconsolate i can't bear to desert a poor dumb creature he can't speak jacky but look at his poor frightened eye it seems to say have you got the heart to go on and leave me to die for the want of a drop of water oh jacky you that is so clever in reading the signs of nature have pity on the poor thing and do pray try and find us a drop of water i'd run five miles and fetch it in my hat if you would but find it do help us jacky and the white man looked helplessly up to the black savage who had learned to read the small type of nature's book and he had not jacky hung his head white fellow's eyes always shut black fellow's always open we pass here before and jacky look for water look for everything no water here but said he languidly jacky will go up high tree and look a good deal selecting the highest tree near he chopped a staircase and went up it almost as quickly as a bricklayer mounts a ladder with a hod at the top he crossed his thighs over the stem and there he sat full half an hour his glittering eye reading the confused page and his subtle mind picking out the minutest syllables of meaning several times he shook his head at last all of a sudden he gave a little start and then a chuckle and the next moment he was on the ground what is it black fellow stupid fellow look too far off and he laughed again for all the world like a jackdaw what is it a little water not much where is it where is it why don't you tell me where it is come was the answer not forty yards from where they stood jacky stopped and thrusting his hand into a tuft of long grass pulled out a short blue flower with a very thick stem saw him spark from the top of the tree said jacky with a grin this fellow stand with him head in the air but him foot in the water suppose no water he die a good deal quick then taking george's hand he made him press the grass hard and george felt moisture ooze through the herb yes my hand is wet but jacky this drop won't save a beast's life without it is a frog's jacky smiled and rose where that wet came from more stay behind he pointed to other patches of grass close by and following them showed george that they got larger and larger in a certain direction at last he came to a hidden nook where was a great patch of grass quite a different color green as an emerald water cried jacky a good deal of water he took a jump and came down flat on his back on the grass and sure enough though not a drop of surface water was visible the cool liquid squirted up in a shower round jacky nature is extremely fond of producing the same things in very different sizes here was a miniature copy of those large australian lakes which show nothing to the eye but rank grass you ride upon them a little way merely wetting your horse's feet but after a while the sponge gets fuller and fuller and the grass shows symptoms of giving way and letting you down to bottomless perdition they squeezed out of this grass sponge a calabash full of water and george ran with it to the panting beast oh how he sucked it up and his wild eye calmed and the liquid life ran through all his frame it was hardly in his stomach before he got up of his own accord and gave a most sonorous moo intended no doubt to express the sentiment of never say die george drove them all to the grassy sponge and kept them there till sunset he was three hours squeezing out water and giving it them before they were satisfied then in the cool of the evening he drove them safe home the next day one more of his strayed cattle found his way home the rest he never saw again this was his first dead loss of any importance unfortunately it was not the last the brutes were demoralized by their excursion and being active as deer they would jump over anything and stray sometimes the vagrant was recovered often he was found dead and sometimes he went twenty miles and mingled with the huge herds of some croesus and was absorbed like a drop of water and lost to george fielding this was a bitter blow this was not the way to make the thousand pounds better sell them all to the first comer and then i shall see the end of my loss i am not one of your lucky ones i must not venture a settler passed george's way driving a large herd of sheep and ten cows george gave him a dinner and looked over his stock you have but few beasts for so many sheep said he the other assented i could part with a few of mine to you if you were so minded the other said he should be very glad but he had no money to spare would george take sheep in exchange well drawled george i would rather it had been cash but such as you and i must not make the road hard to one another sheep i'll take but full value the other was delighted and nearly all george's bullocks became his for one hundred and fifty sheep george was proud of his bargain and said that is a good thing for you and me susan please god now the next morning abner came in and said to george i don't like some of your new lot the last that are marked with a red v why what is wrong about them come and see he found more than one of the new sheep rubbing themselves angrily against the pen and sometimes among one another oh dear said george i have prayed against this on my knees every night of my life and it is come upon me at last sharpen your knife abner what must they all all the new lot call jacky he will help you he likes to see blood i can't abide it one hundred and fifty sheep eighteen pennorth of wool and eighteen pennorth of fat when we fling 'em into the pot that is all that is left to me of yesterday's deal jacky was called now jacky said george these sheep have got the scab of the country if they get to my flock and taint it i am a beggar from that moment these sheep are sure to die so abner and you are to kill them he will show you how i can't look on and see their blood and my means spilled like water susan this is a black day for us he went away and sat down upon a stone a good way off and turned his back upon his house and his little homestead this was not the way to make the thousand pounds the next day the dead sheep were skinned and their bodies chopped up and flung into the copper the grease was skimmed as it rose and set aside and when cool was put into rough barrels with some salt and kept up until such time as a merchant should pass that way and buy it well said george with a sigh i know my loss but if the red scab had got into the large herd there would have been no end to the mischief soon after this a small feeder at some distance offered to change with mclaughlan that worthy liked his own ground best but willing to do his friend george a good turn he turned the man over to him george examined the new place found that it was smaller but richer and better watered and very wisely closed with the proposal when he told jacky that worthy's eyes sparkled black fellow likes another place not every day the same and in fact he let out that if this change had not occurred his intention had been to go a hunting for a month or two so weary had he become of always the same place the new ground was excellent and george's hopes lately clouded brightened again he set to work and made huge tanks to catch the next rain and as heretofore did the work of two it was a sad thing to have to write to susan and tell her that after twenty months' hard work he was just where he had been at first starting one day as george was eating his homely dinner on his knee by the side of his principal flock he suddenly heard a tremendous scrimmage mixed with loud abusive epithets from abner he started up and there was carlo pitching into a sheep who was trying to jam herself into the crowd to escape him up runs one of the sheep dogs growling but instead of seizing carlo as george thought he would what does he do but fall upon another sheep and spite of all their evasions the two dogs drove the two sheep out of the flock and sent them pelting down the hill in one moment george was alongside abner abner said he how came you to let strange sheep in among mine never saw them till the dog pinned them you never saw them said george reproachfully no nor your dog either till my carlo opened your eyes a pretty thing for a shepherd and his dog to be taught by a pointer well said george you had eyes enough to see whose sheep they were tell me that if you please abner looked down why abner i'd as lieve bite off my tongue as tell you george looked uneasy and his face fell a 'v' don't ye take on said abner they couldn't have been ten minutes among ours and there were but two and don't you blow me up for such a thing might happen to the carefulest shepherd that ever was i won't blow ye up will abner said george it is my luck not yours that has done this it was always so from a game of cricket upward i never had my neighbor's luck if the flock are not tainted i'll give you five pounds and my purse is not so deep as some if they are take your knife and drive it into my heart i'll forgive you that as i do this carlo let me look at you see here he is all over some stinking ointment it is off those sheep i knew it 'twasn't likely a pointer dog would be down on strange sheep like a shepherd's dog by the sight 'twas this stuff offended him heaven's will be done let us hope the best and not meet trouble half way yes said george feebly let us hope the best don't i hear that thompson has an ointment that cures the red scab so they say george whistled to his pony the pony came to him george did not treat him as we are apt to treat a horse like a riding machine he used to speak to him and caress him when he fed him and when he made his bed and the horse followed him about like a dog in half an hour's sharp riding they were at thompson's an invaluable man that sold and bought animals doctored animals and kept a huge boiler in which bullocks were reduced to a few pounds of grease in a very few hours you have an ointment that is good for the scab sir that i have farmer sold some to a neighbor of yours day before yesterday who was that a newcomer vesey is his name george groaned how do you use it if you please shear 'em close rub the ointment well in wash 'em every two days and rub in again give me a stone of it a stone of my ointment well you are the wisest man i have come across this year or two you shall have it sir george rode home with his purchase abner turned up his nose at it and was inclined to laugh at george's fears but george said to himself i have susan to think of as well as myself besides said he a little bitterly i haven't a grain of luck if i am to do any good i must be twice as prudent and thrice as industrious as my neighbors or i shall fall behind them now abner we'll shear them close shear them why it is not two months since they were all sheared and then we will rub a little of this ointment into them what before we see any sign of the scab among them i wouldn't do that if they were mine no more would i if they were yours replied george almost fiercely but they are not yours will abner they are unlucky george's during the next three days four hundred sheep were clipped and anointed jacky helped clip but he would not wear gloves and george would not let him handle the ointment without them suspecting mercury at last george yielded to abner's remonstrances and left off shearing and anointing abner altered his opinion when one day he found a sheep rubbing like mad against a tree and before noon half a dozen at the same game those two wretched sheep had tainted the flock abner hung his head when he came to george with this ill omened news he expected a storm of reproaches but george was too deeply distressed for any petulances of anger it is my fault said he i was the master and i let my servant direct me my own heart told me what to do yet i must listen to a fool and a hireling that cared not for the sheep how should he they weren't his they were mine to lose and mine to save i had my choice i took it i lost them call jacky and let's to work and save here and there one if so be god shall be kinder to them than i have been from that hour there was but little rest morning noon or night it was nothing but an endless routine of anointing and washing washing and anointing sheep to the credit of mr thompson it must be told that of the four hundred who had been taken in time no single sheep died but of the others a good many there are incompetent shepherds as well as incompetent statesmen and doctors though not so many abner was one of these an acute australian shepherd would have seen the more subtle signs of this terrible disease a day or two before the patient sheep began to rub themselves with fury against the trees and against each other but abner did not and george did not profess to have a minute knowledge of the animal or why pay a shepherd when this herculean labor and battle had gone on for about a week abner came to george and with a hang dog look begged him to look out for another shepherd why will surely you won't think to leave me in this strait why three of us are hardly able for the work and how can i make head against this plague with only the poor sav with only jacky that is first rate at light work till he gets to find it dull but can't lift a sheep and fling her into the water as the like of us can well ye see said abner doggedly i have got the offer of a place with mr meredith and he won't wait for me more than a week he is a rich man will and i am a poor one said george in a faint expostulating tone abner said nothing but his face showed he had already considered this fact from his own point of view he could spare you better than i can but you are right to leave a falling house that you have helped to pull down i don't want to go all in a moment i can stay a week till you get another a week how can i get a shepherd in this wilderness at a week's notice you talk like a fool well i can't stay any longer you know there is no agreement at all between us but i'll stay a week to oblige you you'll oblige me will you said george with a burst of indignation then oblige me by packing up your traps and taking your ugly face out of my sight before dinner time this day stay my man here are your wages up to twelve o'clock to day take 'em and out of my sight you dirty rascal let me meet misfortune with none but friends by my side away with you or i shall forget myself and dirty my hands with your mean carcass the hireling slunk off and as he slunk george stormed and thundered after him and wherever you may go may sorrow and sickness no george turned to jacky who sat coolly by his eyes sparkling at the prospect of a row jacky said he and then he seemed to choke and could not say another word suppose i get the make thunder then you shoot him shoot him what for too much bungality shoot him dead he let the sheep come that have my two fingers so on their backs here jacky made a v with his middle and forefinger so he kill the other sheep yet still you not shoot him that so stupid i call stupidity oh jacky hush don't you know me better than to think i would kill a man for killing my sheep oh fie oh fie no jacky heaven forbid i should do the man any harm but when i think of what he has brought on my head and then to skulk and leave me in my sore strait and trouble me that never gave him ill language as most masters would and then jacky do you remember when he was sick how kind you and i were to him and now to leave us there i must go into the house and you come and call me out when that man is off the premises not before at twelve o'clock selfish abner started to walk thirty miles to mr meredith's smarting under the sense of his contemptibleness and of the injury he was doing his kind poor master he shook his fist at the house and told jacky he hoped the scab would rot the flock and that done fall upon the bipeds on his own black hide in particular jacky only answered with his eye when the man was gone he called george george's anger had soon died jacky found him reading a little book in search of comfort and when they were out in the air jacky saw that his eyes were rather red why you cry said jacky i very angry because you cry it is very foolish of me said george apologetically but three is a small company and we in such trouble i thought i had made a friend of him often i saw he was not worth his wages but out of pity i wouldn't part with him when i could better have spared him than he me and now there no more about it work is best for a sore heart and mine is sore and heavy too this day jacky put his finger to his head and looked wise first you listen me this one time i speak a good many words dat stupid fellow know nothing and so because you not shoot him a good way behind you very stupid one counted jacky touching his thumb he know nothing with these pointing to his eyes jacky know possum jacky know kangaroo know turkey know snake know a good many some with legs like dis four fingers some with legs like dis two flngers dat stupid fellow know nothing but sheep and not know sheep let him die too much know nothing with 'um eyes one more touching his forefinger know nothing with dis touching his tongue jacky speak him good words he speak jacky bad words dat so stupid he know nothing with dis long ago opossum one more you do him good things he do you bad things he know nothing with these indicating his arms and legs as the seat of moral action so den because you not shoot him long ago now you cry den because you cry jacky angry yes jacky very good jacky a little good before he live with you since den very good but when dat fellow know nothing and now you cry at the bottom part jacky a little angry and jacky go hunting a little not much direckly at last with these words the savage caught up his tomahawk and two spears and was going across country without another word but george cried out in dismay oh stop a moment what to day jacky jacky jacky now don't ye go to day i know it is very dull for the likes of you and you will soon leave me but don't ye go to day don't set me against flesh and blood altogether i come back when the sun there pointing to the east but must hunt a little not much jacky uncomfortable continued he jumping at a word which from its size he thought must be of weight in any argument a good deal uncomfortable suppose i not hunt a little dis day i say no more i have no right goodby take my hand i shall never see you any more i shall come back when the sun there ah well i daresay you think you will good by jacky don't you stay to please me jacky glided away across country he looked back once and saw george watching him george was sitting sorrowful upon a stone and as this last bit of humanity fell away from him and melted away in the distance his heart died within him he thinks he will come back to me but when he gets in the open and finds the track of animals to hunt he will follow them wherever they go and his poor shallow head won't remember this place nor me i shall never see poor jacky any more the black continued his course for about four miles until a deep hollow hid him from george arrived here he instantly took a line nearly opposite to his first and when he had gone about three miles on this tack he began to examine the ground attentively and to run about like a hound after near half an hour of this he fell upon some tracks and followed them at an easy trot across the country for miles and miles his eye keenly bent upon the ground chapter xxxix our story has to follow a little way an infinitesimal personage abner the ungratefulish one with a bundle tied up in a handkerchief strode stoutly away toward mr meredith's grazing ground i am well out of that place was his reflection as he had been only once over the ground before he did not venture to relax his pace lest night should overtake him in a strange part he stepped out so well that just before the sun set he reached the head of a broad valley that was all meredith's about three miles off glittered a white mansion set in a sea of pasture studded with cattle instead of sails ay ay thought the ungratefulish one no fear of the scab breaking up this master i'm all right now as he chuckled over his prospects a dusky figure stole noiselessly from a little thicket an arm was raised behind him crosssh a hard weapon came down on his skull and he lay on his face with the blood trickling from his mouth and ears chapter xl he who a few months ago was so lighthearted and bright with hope now rose at daybreak for a work of herculean toil as usual but no longer with the spirit that makes labor light the same strength the same dogged perseverance were there but the sense of lost money lost time and invincible ill luck oppressed him then too he was alone everything had deserted him but misfortune i have left my susan and i have lost her left the only friend i had or ever shall have in this hard world this was his constant thought as doggedly but hopelessly he struggled against the pestilence single handed and leaden hearted he had to catch a sheep to fling her down to hold her down to rub the ointment into her and to catch another that had been rubbed yesterday and take her to the pool and fling her in and keep her in till every part of her skin was soaked four hours of this drudgery had george gone through single handed and leaden hearted when as he knelt over a kicking struggling sheep he became conscious of something gliding between him and the sun he looked up and there was jacky grinning george uttered an exclamation what come back well now that is very good of you i call how do you do and he gave him a great shake of the hand jacky very well jacky not at all uncomfortable after him hunt a little then i am very glad you have had a day's sport leastways a night's i call it since it has made you comfortable jacky oh yes very comfortable now and his white teeth and bright eye proclaimed the relief and satisfaction his little trip had afforded his nature there jacky if the ointment is worth the trouble it gives me rubbing of it in that sheep won't ever catch the scab i do think well jacky seems to me i ought to ask your pardon i did you wrong i never expected you would leave the kangaroos and opossums for me once you were off but i suppose fact is you haven't quite forgotten twofold bay two fool bay inquired jacky puzzled where i first fell in with you you made one in a hunt that day only instead of hunting you was hunted and pretty close too and if i hadn't been a good cricketer and learned to fling true why i do declare i think he has forgotten the whole thing shark and all at the word shark a gleam of intelligence came to the black's eye it was succeeded by a look of wonder shark come to eat me you throw stone so we eat him i see him now a little a very little dat a long way off a very long way off jacky can hardly see him when he try a good deal white fellow see a long way off behind him back dat is very curious george colored you are right lad it was a long while ago and i am vexed for mentioning it well any way you are come back and you are welcome now you shall do a little of the light work but i'll do all the heavy work because i'm used to it and indeed poor george did work and slave like hercules forty times that day he carried a full sized sheep in his hands a distance of twenty yards and flung her into the water and splashed in and rubbed her back in the water the fourth day after jacky's return george asked him to go all over the ground and tell him how many sheep he saw give signs of the fatal disorder about four o'clock in the afternoon jacky returned driving before him with his spear a single sheep the agility of both the biped and quadruped were droll the latter every now and then making a rapid bolt to get back to the pasture and jacky bounding like a buck and pricking her with a spear for the first time he found george doing nothing dis one scratch um back only dis one then we have driven out the murrain and the rest will live a hard fight jacky a hard fight but we have won it at last we will rub this one well help me put her down for my head aches after rubbing her a little george said jacky i wish you would do it for me for my head do ache so i can't abide to hold it down and work too after dinner they sat and looked at the sheep feeding no more dis said jacky gayly imitating a sheep rubbing against a tree no i have won the day but i haven't won it cheap jacky that fellow abner was a bad man an ungrateful man these words george spoke with a very singular tone of gravity never you mind you about him no i must try to forgive him we are all great sinners is it cold to day no it is a good deal hot i thought it must for the wind is in a kindly quarter well jacky i am as cool as ice dat very curious and my head do ache so i can hardly bear myself you ill a little soon be well i doubt i shall be worse before i am better never you mind you i go and bring something i know we make it hot with water den you drink it and after dat you a good deal better do jacky i won't take doctor's stuff it is dug out of the ground and never was intended for man's inside but you get me something that grows in sight and i'll take that and don't be long jacky for i am not well jacky returned toward evening with a bundle of simples he found george shivering over a fire he got the pot and began to prepare an infusion now you soon better said he i hope so jacky said george very gravely thank you all the same jacky i haven't been not to say dry for the last ten days with me washing the sheep and i have caught a terrible chill a chill like death and jacky i have tried too much i have abused my strength i am a very strong man as men go and so was my father but he abused his strength and he was took just as i am took now and in a week he was dead i have worked hard ever since i came here but since abner left me at the pinch it hasn't been man's work jacky it has been a wrestling match from dawn to dark no man could go on so and not break down but i wanted so to save the poor sheep well the sheep are saved but when jacky's infusion was ready he made george take it and then lie down unfortunately the attack was too violent to yield to this simple remedy fever was upon george fielding fever in his giant shape not as he creeps over the weak but as he rushes on the strong george had never a headache in his life before fever found him full of blood and turned it all to fire he tossed he raged and forty eight hours after his first seizure the strong man lay weak as a child except during those paroxysms of delirium which robbed him of his reason while they lasted and of his strength when they retired on the fourth day after a raging paroxysm he became suddenly calm and looking up saw jacky seated at some little distance his bright eye fixed upon him you better now inquired he with even more than his usual gentleness of tone you not talk stupid things any more what jacky are you watching me said the sick man now i call that very kind of you jacky i am not the man i was we are cut down in a day like the ripe grass how long is it since i was took ill one one one and one more day ay ay my father lasted till the fifth day and then jacky here jacky what you want go out on the hill and see whether any of the sheep are rubbing themselves jacky went out and soon returned not see one rub himself a faint gleam lighted george's sunken eye that is a comfort i hope i shall be accepted not to have been a bad shepherd for i may say 'i have given my life for my sheep' poor things george dozed toward evening he awoke and there was jacky just where he had seen him last i didn't think you had cared so much for me jacky my boy yes care very much for you see um make beef water for you a good deal and sure enough he had boiled down about forty pounds of beef and filled a huge calabash with the extract which he set by george's side and why are you so fond of me jacky it isn't on account of my saving your life for you had forgotten that what makes you such a friend to me i tell you often i go to tell you before but many words dat a good deal trouble one when you make thunder the bird always die one you take a sheep so and hold him up high um never see one more white fellow able do dat one you make a stone go and hit thing other white fellow never hit one little horse come to you other white fellow go to horse horse run away little horse run to you dat because you so good one carlo fond of you all day now he come in and go out and say so imitating a dog's whimper he so uncomfortable because you lie down so one when you speak to jacky you not speak big like white fellow you speak small and like a fiddle dat please jacky's ear one when you look at jacky always your face make like a hot day when dere no rain dat please jacky's eye and so when jacky see you stand up one day a good deal high and now lie down dat makes him uncomfortable and when he see you red one day and white dis day dat make him uncomfortable a good deal and when he see you so beautiful one day and dis day so ugly dat make him so uncomfortable he afraid you go away and speak no more good words to jacky and dat make jacky feel a thing inside here touching his breast no more can breathe and want to do like the gin but don't know how oh dear don't know how poor jacky i do wish i had been kinder to you than i have oh i am very short of wind and my back is very bad when black fellow bad in um back he always die said jacky very gravely ay said george quietly jacky will you do one or two little things for me now yes do um all give me that little book that i may read it thank you jacky this is the book of my religion and it was given to me by one i love better than all the world i have disobeyed her i have thought too little of what is in this book and too much of this world's gain god forgive me and i think he will because it was for susan's sake i was so greedy of gain jacky looked on awestruck as george read the book of his religion open the door jacky jacky opened the door then coming to george's side he said with an anxious inquiring look and trembling voice are you going to leave me george yes jacky my boy said george i doubt i am going to leave you so now thank you and bless you for all kindness put your face close down to mine there i don't care for your black skin he who made mine made yours and i feel we are brothers and you have been one to me good by dear and don't stay here you can do nothing more for your poor friend george jacky gave a little moan yes um can do a little more before he go and hide him face where there are a good deal of trees then jacky went almost on tiptoe and fetched another calabash full of water and placed it by george's head then he went very softly and fetched the heavy iron which he had seen george use in penning sheep and laid it by george's side next he went softly and brought george's gun and laid it gently by george's side down on the ground this done he turned to take his last look of the sick man now feebly dozing the little book in his drooping hand but as he gazed nature rushed over the poor savage's heart and took it quite by surprise even while bending over his white brother to look his last farewell with a sudden start he turned his back on him and sinking on his hams he burst out crying and sobbing with a wild and terrible violence chapter xli for near an hour jacky sat upon the ground his face averted from his sick friend and cried then suddenly he rose and without looking at him went out at the door and turning his face toward the great forests that lay forty miles distant eastward he ran all the night and long before dawn was hid in the pathless woods a white man feels that grief when not selfish is honorable and unconsciously he nurses such grief more or less but to simple minded jacky grief was merely a subtle pain and to be got rid of as quickly as possible like any other pain he ran to the vast and distant woods hoping to leave george's death a long way behind him and so not see what caused his pain so plain as he saw it just now it is to be observed that he looked upon george as dead the taking into his hand of the book of his religion the kind embrace the request that the door might be opened doubtless for the disembodied spirit to pass out all these rites were understood by jacky to imply that the last scene was at hand why witness it it would make him still more uncomfortable therefore he ran and never once looked back and plunged into the impenetrable gloom of the eastern forests the white man had left fielding to get a richer master the half reasoning savage left him to cure his own grief at losing him there he lay abandoned in trouble and sickness by all his kind but one friend never stirred a single hearted single minded non reasoning friend who was this pure minded friend a dog carlo loved george they had lived together they had sported together they had slept together side by side on the cold hard deck of the phoenix and often they had kept each other warm sitting crouched together behind a little bank or a fallen tree with the wind whistling and the rain shooting by their ears when day after day george came not out of the house carlo was very uneasy he used to patter in and out all day and whimper pitifully and often he sat in the room where george lay and looked toward him and whined but now when his master was left quite alone his distress and anxiety redoubled he never went ten yards away from george he ran in and out moaning and whining and at last he sat outside the door and lifted up his voice and howled day and night continually his meaner instincts lay neglected he ate nothing his heart was bigger than his belly he would not leave his friend even to feed himself and still day and night without cease his passionate cry went up to heaven what passed in that single heart none can tell for certain but his creator nor what was uttered in that deplorable cry love sorrow perplexity dismay all these perhaps and something of prayer for still he lifted his sorrowful face toward heaven as he cried out in sore perplexity distress and fear for his poor master oh o o o h o o o o h o o o o o o o o h so we must leave awhile poor honest unlucky george sick of a fever ten miles from the nearest hut leather heart has gone from him to be a rich man's hireling shallow heart has fled to the forest and is hunting kangaroos with all the inches of his soul single heart sits fasting from all but grief before the door and utters heartrending lamentable cries to earth and heaven chapter xlii jail is still a grim and castellated mountain of masonry but a human heart beats and a human brain throbs inside it now enter without fear of seeing children kill themselves and bearded men faint like women or weep like children horrible sights the prisoners no longer crouch and cower past the officers nor the officers look at them and speak to them as if they were dogs as they do in most of these places and used to here open this cell a woman rises with a smile why a smile because for months an open door has generally let in what is always a great boon to a separate prisoner a human creature with a civil word we remember when an open door meant way for a ruffian and a fool to trample upon the solitary and sorrowful what is this smiling personage doing as i live she is watchmaking a woman watchmaking with neat and taper fingers and a glass at her eye sometimes but not always for in vision as well as in sense of touch and patience nature has been bounteous to her she is one of four eight besides these four were tried and found incapable of excellence in this difficult craft they were put to other things for permanent failures are not permitted in jail the theory is that every home can turn some sort of labor to profit difficulties occur often impossibilities will bar the way now and then but there are so few real impossibilities when a difficulty arises the three hundred industrious arts and crafts are freely ransacked for a prisoner ay ransacked as few rich men would be bothered to sift the seven or eight liberal professions in order to fit a beloved son here as in the world the average of talent is low the majority can only learn easy things and vulgar things and some can do higher things and a few can do beautiful things and one or two have developed first rate gifts and powers there are shoemakers male tailors of whom female weavers of whom female watchmakers all female printers and composers female engrainers of wood female in this art we have the first artist in britain our old acquaintance thomas robinson he has passed all his competitors by a simple process beautiful specimens of all the woods have been placed and kept before him and for a month he has been forced to imitate nature with his eye never off her his competitors in the world imitate nature from memory from convention or from tradition by such processes truth and beauty are lost at each step down the ladder of routine mr eden gave clever tom at first starting the right end of the stick instead of letting him take the wrong nine joiners and carpenters female who color prints downright well female painters female pupils shorthand writing female fancy these attending the old bailey and taking it all down solemn as judges workers in gutta percha modelers in clay washers and getters up of linen hoe makers spade makers rake makers woodcarvers stonecutters bakers etc etc etc ad infinitum come to the hard labor yard do you see those fifteen stables there lurk in vain the rusty cranks condemned first as liars they fell soon after into disrepute as weapons of half science to degrade minds and bodies they lurk there grim as the used up giants in pilgrim's progress and like them can't catch a soul hark to the music of the shuttle and the useful loom we weave linen cotton woolen linsey woolsey and not to be behind the rogues outside cottonsey woolsey and cottonsey silksey damask we weave and a little silk and poplin and mary baker velvet itself for a treat now and then we of the loom relieve the county of all expense in keeping us and enrich a fund for taking care of discharged industrious prisoners until such time as they can soften prejudices and obtain lucrative employment the old plan was to kick a prisoner out and say there dog go without a rap among those who will look on you as a dog and make you starve or steal we have taught you no labor but crank and as there are no cranks in the outside world the world not being such an idiot as we are you must fill your belly by means of the only other thing you have ever been taught theft now the officers take leave of a discharged prisoner in english farewell good by a contraction for god be wi' ye etc it used to be in french sans adieu au revoir and the like having passed the merry useful looms open this cell a she thief looks up with an eye six times as mellow as when we were here last she is busy gilding see with what an adroit and delicate touch the jade slips the long square knife under the gossamer gold leaf which she has blown gently out of the book and turns it over and now she breathes gently and vertically on the exact center of it and the fragile yet rebellious leaf that has rolled itself up like a hedgehog is flattened by that human zephyr on the little leathern easel now she cuts it in three with vertical blade now she takes her long flat brush and applies it to her own hair once or twice strange to say the camel hair takes from this contact a soupcon of some very slight and delicate animal oil which enables the brush to take up the gold leaf and the artist lays a square of gold in its place on the plaster bull she is gilding said bull was cast in the prison by another female prisoner who at this moment is preparing a green artificial meadow for the animal to stand in these two girls had failed at the watchmaking they had sight and the fine sensation of touch required but they lacked the caution patience and judgment so severe an art demanded so their talents were directed elsewhere this one is a first rate gilder she mistressed it entirely in three days the last thing they did in this way was an elephant cost of casting him reckoning labor and the percentage he ought to pay to the mold was s d plaster chrome water size and oil size d goldleaf s foot of german velvet d thread needles and wear of tools d total s said gold elephant standing on a purple cushion was subjected to a severe test of his value he was sent to a low auction room in london there he fell to the trade at s this was a knock out transaction twelve buyers had agreed not to bid against one another in the auction room a conspiracy illegal but customary the same afternoon these twelve held one of their little private unlawful auctions over him here the bidding was like drops of blood oozing from flints but at least it was bona fide and he rose to s the seven shillings premium was divided among the eleven sharpers sharper no carried him home and sold him the very next day for s to a lady who lived in belgravia but shopped in filthy alleys misled perhaps by the phrase dirt cheap mr eden conceived him two detected ones made him at a cost of s twelve undetected ones caught him first for s and now he stands in belgravia and the fair ejaculate over him what a duck the aggregate of labor to make and gild this elephant was not quite one woman's work hours taking s as the true value of the work for in this world the workman has commonly to sell his production under the above disadvantages forced sale and the conspiracies of the unimprisoned we have still s for a day's work by a woman from the bull greater things are expected the cast is from the bull of the vatican a bull true to nature and nature adorned the very meadows when she produced the bull what a magnificent animal is a bull what a dewlap what a front what clean pasterns what fearless eyes what a deep diapason is his voice of which beholding this his true and massive effigy in jail we are reminded when he stands muscular majestic sonorous gold in his meadow pied with daisies it shall not be sweet and love and duck words of beauty but no earthly signification it shall be there i forgive europa and need i say there were more aimed at in all this than pecuniary profit mr eden held that the love of production is the natural specific antidote to the love of stealing he kindled in his prisoners the love of producing of what some by an abuse of language call creating and the producers rose in the scale of human beings their faces showed it the untamed look melted away the white of the eye showed less and the pupil and iris more and better quality gold leaf when first laid on adheres in visible squares with uncouth edges a ragged affair then the gilder takes a camelhair brush and under its light and rapid touch the work changes as under a diviner's rod so rapidly and majestically come beauty and finish over it perhaps no other art has so delicious a one minute as this is to the gilder the first work our prisoner gilded she screamed with delight several times at this crisis she begged to have the work left in her cell one day at least it lights up the cell and lights up my heart of course it does said mr eden aha what there are greater pleasures in the world than sinning are there that there are i never was so pleased in my life may i have it a few minutes my child you shall have it till its place is taken by others like it keep it before your eyes feed on it and ask yourself which is the best to work and add something useful or beautiful to the world's material wealth or to steal to be a little benefactor to your kind and yourself or a little vermin preying on the industrious which is best i'll never take while i can make this is of course but a single specimen out of scores to follow mr eden from cell to cell from mind to mind from sex to sex would take volumes and volumes i only profess to reveal fragments of such a man he never hoped from the mere separate cell the wonders that dreamers hope it was essential to the reform of prisoners that moral contagion should be checkmated and the cell was the mode adopted because it is the laziest cheapest selfishest and cruelest way of doing this that no discretion was allowed him to let the converted or the well disposed mix and sympathize and compare notes and confirm each other in good under a watchful officer's eye this he thought a frightful blunder of the system generally he held the good effect of separate confinement to be merely negative he laughed to scorn the chimera that solitude is an active agent capable of converting a rogue shut a rogue from rogues and let honest men in upon him the honest men get a good chance to convert him but if they do succeed it was not solitude that converted him but healing contact the moments that most good comes to him are the moments his solitude is broken he used to say solitude will cow a rogue and suspend his overt acts of theft by force and so make him to a non reflector seem no longer a thief but the notion of the cell effecting permanent cures might honestly be worded thus i am a lazy self deceiver and want to do by machinery and without personal fatigue what st paul could only do by working with all his heart with all his time with all his wit with all his soul with all his strength and with all himself or thus confine the leopards in separate cages jock the cages will take their spots out while ye're sleeping generally this was mr eden's theory of the cell a check to further contamination but no more he even saw in the cell much positive ill which he set himself to qualify separate confinement breeds monstrous egotism said he and egotism hardens the heart you can't make any man good if you never let him say a kind word or do an unselfish action to a fellow creature man is an acting animal his real moral character all lies in his actions and none of it in his dreams or cogitations moral stagnation or cessation of all bad acts and of all good acts is a state on the borders of every vice and a million miles from virtue his reverence attacked the petrifaction and egotism of the separate cell as far as the shallow system of this prison let him first he encouraged prisoners to write their lives for the use of the prison these were weeded if necessary the editor was strong minded and did not weed out the re poppies printed and circulated in the jail the writer's number was printed at the foot if he pleased but never his name biography begot a world of sympathy in the prison second he talked to one prisoner acquainted with another prisoner's character talked about no to no and would sometimes say now could you give no any good advice on this point then if 's advice was good he would carry it to and would think all the more of it that it came from one of his fellows then in matters of art he would carry the difficulties of a beginner or a bungler to a proficient and the latter would help the former the pleasure of being kind on one side a touch of gratitude on the other seeds of interest and sympathy in both then such as had produced pretty things were encouraged to lend them to other cells to adorn them and stimulate the occupants for instance no who gilded the bull was reminded that no who had cast him had never had the pleasure of setting him on her table in her gloomy cell and so raising its look from dungeon to workshop then no said poor no that is not fair she shall have him half the day or more if you like sir thus a grain of self denial justice and charity was often drawn into the heart of a cell through the very keyhole no robinson did many a little friendly office for other figures received their thanks and above all obliging these figures warmed and softened his own heart you might hear such dialogues as this no and how is poor old no to day strutt mr eden much the same no do you think you will bring him round sir mr eden i have great hopes he is much improved since he had the garden and the violin no will you give him my compliments sir no 's compliments and tell him i bid him 'never say die' mr eden well how are you this morning i am a little better sir this room the infirmary is so sweet and airy and they give me precious nice things to eat and drink are the nurses kind to you that they are sir kinder than i deserve i have a message for you from no on your corridor no have you sir he sends his best wishes for your recovery now that is very good of him and he would be very glad to hear from yourself how you feel well sir you tell him i am a trifle better and god bless him for troubling his head about me in short his reverence reversed the hawes system under that a prisoner was divested of humanity and became a number and when he fell sick the sentiment created was the figure written on the floor of that cell looks faint when he died or was murdered there is such and such a figure rubbed off our slate mr eden made these figures signify flesh and blood even to those who never saw their human faces when he had softened a prisoner's heart then he laid the deeper truths of christianity to that heart they would not adhere to ice or stone or brass he knew that till he had taught a man to love his brother whom he had seen he could never make him love god whom he has not seen to vary the metaphor his plan was first warm and soften your wax then begin to shape it after heaven's pattern the old fashioned way is freeze petrify and mold your wax by a single process not that he was mawkish no man rebuked sin more terribly than he often rebuked it in many of these cells and when he did so see what he gained by the personal kindness that preceded these terrible rebukes the rogue said what is it so bad that his reverence who i know has a regard for me rebukes me for it like this why it must be bad indeed a loving friend's rebuke is a rebuke sinks into the heart and convinces the judgment an enemy's or stranger's rebuke is invective and irritates not converts the great vice of the new prisons is general self deception varied by downright calculating hypocrisy a shallow zealot like mr lepel is sure to drive the prisoners into one or other of these it was mr eden's struggle to keep them out of it he froze cant in the bud puritanical burglars tried scriptural phrases on him as a matter of course but they soon found it was the very worse lay they could get upon in jail the notion that a man can jump from the depths of vice up to the climax of righteous habits spiritual mindedness at one leap shocked his sense and terrified him for the daring dogs that profess these saltatory powers and the geese that believe it he said to such let me see you crawl heavenward first then walk heavenward it will be time enough to soar when you have lived soberly honestly piously a year or two not here where you are tied hands feet and tongue but free among the world's temptations he had no blind confidence in learned by heart texts many a scoundrel has a good memory said he here he was quite opposed to his friend lepel this gentleman attributed a sort of physical virtue to holy writ poured anyhow into a human vessel his plan of making a thief honest will appear incredible to a more enlightened age yet it is widely accepted now and its advocates call mr eden a dreamer it was this he came into a cell cold and stern and set the rogues a lot of texts those that learned a great many he called good prisoners and those that learned few black sheep and the prisoners soon found out that their life bitter as it was would be bitterer if they did not look sharp and learn a good many texts so they learned lots and the slyest scoundrels learned the most why not said they in these cursed holes we have nothing better to do and it is the only way to get the parson's good word and that is always worth having in jail one rogue on getting out explained his knowledge of five hundred texts thus what did it hurt me learning texts i'd just as lieve be learning texts as turning a crank and as soon be d d as either this fellow had been one of mr lepel's sucking saints a show prisoner the bible and brute force how odd they sound together yet such was the lepel system humbug apart put a thief in a press between an old testament and a new testament turn the screw crush the texts in and the rogue's vices out conversion made easy what a wonder he opposes cunning cloaked with religion to brutality cloaked under religion ay brutality and laziness and selfishness all these are the true foundation of that system selfishness for such a man won't do anything he does not like no why should i make myself 'all things to all men' to save a soul i will save them this one way or none this is my way and they shall all come to it says the reverend procrustes forgetting that if the heart is not won in vain is the will crushed or perhaps not caring so that he gets his own way to work on mr eden's plan is a herculean effort day by day repeated but to set texts is easy easier even than to learn them and how easy that is appears from the multitude of incurable felons who have swapped texts for tickets of leave messieurs lepel who teach solitary depressed sinners the bible with screw and lifted lash and no love nor pity a word in your ear begin a step higher go first to some charitable priest and at his feet learn that bible yourselves forgive my heat dear reader i am not an eden and these fellows rile me when i think of the good they might do and they do nothing but force hypocrisy upon men who were bad enough without that i allow a certain latitude don't want to swim in hot water by quarreling with every madman or every dunce but i do doubt any man's right to combine contradictory vices now these worthies are stupid yet wild thick headed yet delirious tortoises and march hares my sketch of mr eden and his ways is feeble and unworthy but i conclude it with one master stroke of eulogy he was the opposite of these men chapter xliii we left thomas robinson writing his life he has written it it has been printed by prisoners and circulated among prisoners one copy lay in robinson's cell till he left the prison and to this copy were appended mr eden's remarks in ms this autobiography is a self drawn portrait of a true bohemian and his mind from boyhood up to the date when he fell into my hands unfortunately we cannot afford so late in our story to make any retrograde step the autobiography of a thief must therefore be thrust into my appendix or printed elsewhere the reader has seen robinson turned into a fiend by cruelty and turned back to a man by humanity on this followed many sacred softening improving lessons and as he loved mr eden his heart was open to them most prisoners are very sensible of genuine kindness and docile as wax in the hands of those who show it they are the easiest class in the world to impress the difficulty is to make the impression permanent but the people who pretend to you that kindness does not greatly affect persuade and help convince them have never tried anything but brutality and never will for nothing greater wiser or better is in them i will now indicate the other phases through which his mind passed in jail being shown that his crimes were virtually the cause of mary's hapless life and untimely death and hard pressed by his father confessor he fell into religious despondency believed his case desperate and his sins too many for heaven's mercy of all states of mind this was the one mr eden most dreaded he had observed that the notion that they cannot be reconciled to god and man is the cause of prisoners' recklessness and one great means by which jail officers and society england ad confirm them in ill he soothed and cheered the poor fellow with many a hopeful message from the gospel of mercy and soon drew him out of the slough of despond but he drew him out with so eager an arm that up went this impressionable personage from despond to the fifth heaven he was penitent forgiven justified sanctified all in three weeks moreover he now fell into a certain foul habit of course scripture formed a portion of his daily reading and discourse with the chaplain robinson had a memory that seized and kept everything like a vise so now a text occurred to him for every occasion and he interwove them with all his talk your shallow observers would have said what a hypocrite not a hypocrite oh criticaster but a chameleon who had been months out of the atmosphere of vice and in an atmosphere of religion his reverence broke him of this nasty habit of chattering bible and generally cooled him down finally he became sober penitent for his past life and firmly resolved to lead a better with this began to mingle ambition to rise very high in the world and a violent impatience to begin through all these phases ran one excellent and saving thing a genuine attachment to his good friend the chaplain the attachment was reciprocal and there was something touching in the friendship of two men so different in mind and worldly station but they had suffered together and indeed a much more depraved prisoner than robinson would have loved such a benefactor and brother as eden and many a scoundrel in this place did love him as well as he could love anything and as to the other the clew to him is simple while the vulgar self deceiving moralist loathes the detected criminal and never whatever he may think really rises to abhorrence of crime the saint makes two steps upward toward the mind of heaven itself abhors crime and loves pities and will not despair of the criminal but besides this robinson was an engaging fellow full of thought and full of facts and the rev francis tender conscience often spent an extra five minutes in his cell and then reproached himself for letting the more interesting personage rob other depressed and thirsty souls of those drops of dew one day mr eden who had just entered the cell said to robinson give me your hand it is as i feared your nerves are going are they said robinson ruefully do you not observe that you are becoming tremulous i notice that when my door is opened suddenly it makes me shake a little and twitches come in my thigh i feared as much it is not every man that can bear separate confinement for twelve months you cannot i shall have to whether i can or not will you three days after this mr eden came into his cell and said with a sad smile i have good news for you you are going to leave me oh your reverence is that good news those who have the disposal of you are beginning to see that all punishment except hanging is for the welfare of the culprit and must never be allowed to injure him strutt left the prison for my house a fortnight ago and you are to cross the water next week oh your reverence heaven forgive me for feeling glad for being human eh my poor fellow in the course of this conversation mr eden frankly regretted that robinson was going so soon four months more prison would have made you safer and i would have kept you here till the last minute of your sentence for the good of your soul said he grimly but your body and nerves might have suffered added he tenderly we must do all for the best a light burst on robinson why your reverence cried he is it for fear why you don't ever think that i shall turn rogue again after i get out of prison you are going among a thousand temptations what do you really think all your kindness has been wasted on me why sir if a thousand pounds lay there i would not stretch out my hand to take one that did not belong to me how ungrateful you must think me and what a fool into the bargain after all my experience ungrateful you are not but you are naturally a fool a weak flexible fool a man with a tenth of your gifts would lead you by the nose into temptation but i warn you if you fall now conscience will prick you as it never yet has you will be miserable and yet though miserable perhaps will never rise again for remorse is not penitence robinson was so hurt at this want of confidence that he said nothing in reply and then mr eden felt sorry he had said so much for after all thought he these are mere misgivings by uttering them i only pain him i can't make him share them let me think what i can do that very day he wrote to susan merton the letter contained the following thomas robinson goes to australia next week he will get a ticket of leave almost immediately on landing i am in great anxiety he is full of good resolves but his nature is unstable yet i should not fear to trust him anywhere if i could but choose his associates in this difficulty i have thought of george fielding you know i can read characters and though you never summed george up to me his sayings and doings reveal him to me he is a man in whom honesty is engrained poor robinson with such a companion would be as honest as the day and a useful friend for he is full of resources then dear friend will you do a christian act and come to our aid i want you to write a note to mr fielding and let this poor fellow take it to him armed with this my convert will not be shy of approaching the honest man and the exile will not hate me for this trick will he i send you inclosed the poor clever fool's life written by himself and printed by my girls read it and tell me are we wrong in making every effort to save such a man etc by return of post came a reply from susan merton full of pity for robinson and affectionate zeal to co operate in any way with her friend inclosed was a letter addressed to george fielding the envelope not closed mr eden slipped in a banknote and a very small envelope and closed it placed it in a larger envelope sealed that and copied the first address on its cover he now gave robinson more of his time than ever and seemed to cling to him with almost a motherly apprehension robinson noticed it and felt it very very much and his joy at getting out of prison oozed away more and more as the day drew near that day came at last robinson was taken by evans to the chaplain's room to bid him farewell he found him walking about the room in deep thought robinson when you are thousands of miles from me bear this in mind that if you fall again you will break my heart i know it sir i know it for you would say 'if i could not save him who can i hope to' you would not like to break my heart to discourage your friend and brother in the good work the difficult work i would rather die if it is to be so i pray heaven to strike me dead in this room while i am fit to die don't say that live to repair your crimes and to make me prouder of you than a mother of her first born he paused and walked the room in silence presently he stopped in front of robinson you have often said you owed me something my life and my soul's salvation was the instant reply i ask a return square the account with me that i can never do you can i will take two favors in return for all you say i have done for you no idle words but yes or no upon your honor will you grant them or won't you i will upon my honor one is that you will pray very often not only morning and evening but at sunset at that dangerous hour to you when evil association begins at that hour honest men retire out of sight and rogues come abroad like vermin and wild beasts but most of all at any hour of the day or night a temptation comes near you at that moment pray don't wait to see how strong the temptation is and whether you can't conquer it without help from above at the sight of an enemy put on heavenly armor pray no need to kneel or to go apart two words secretly cast heavenward 'lord help me' are prayer will you so pray yes then give me your hand here is a plain gold ring to recall this sacred promise put it on wear it and look at it and never lose it or forget your promise them that take it must cut my hand off with it enough it is a promise my second request is that the moment you are free you will go and stay with an honest man i ask no better sir if he will have me george fielding he has a farm near bathurst george fielding sir he affronted me when i was in trouble it was no more than i deserved i forgive him but you don't know the lad sir he would not speak to me he would not look at me he would turn his back on me if we ran against one another in a wilderness here is a talisman that will insure you a welcome from him a letter from the woman he loves come yes or no i will sir for your sake not for theirs sir do pray give me something harder to do for you than these two things no i won't overweight you nor encumber your memory with pledges these two and no more and here we part see what it is to sin against society i whom your conversation has so interested to whom your company is so agreeable in one word i who love you can find no kinder word to say to you to day than this let me never see your face again let me never hear your name in this world his voice trembled as he said these words and he wrung robinson's hand and robinson groaned and turned away so now i can do no more for you i must leave the rest to god and with these words for the second time in their acquaintance the good soul kneeled down and prayed aloud for this man and this time he prayed at length with ardor and tenderness unspeakable he prayed as for a brother on the brink of a precipice he wrestled with heaven and ere he concluded he heard a subdued sound near him and it was poor robinson who touched and penetrated by such angelic love and awestruck to hear a good man pour out his very soul at the mercy seat of heaven had crept timidly to his side and knelt there bearing his mute part in this fervent supplication as mr eden rose from his knees evans knocked gently at the door he had been waiting some minutes but had heard the voice of prayer and reverently forbore to interrupt it at his knock the priest and the thief started the priest suddenly held out both his hands the thief bowed his head and kissed them many times and on this they parted hastily with swelling hearts and not another word except the thousands that their moist eyes exchanged in one single look the last chapter xliv the ship was to sail in a week and meantime robinson was in the hulks at portsmouth now the hulks are a disgrace to europe and a most incongruous appendage to a system that professes to cure by separate confinement one or two of the worst convicts made the usual overtures of evil companionship to robinson these were coldly declined and it was a good sign that robinson being permitted by the regulations to write one letter did not write to any of his old pals in london or elsewhere but to mr eden he told him that he regretted his quiet cell where his ears were never invaded with blasphemy and indecency things he never took pleasure in even at his worst and missed his reverence's talk sadly he concluded by asking for some good books by way of antidote he received no answer while at portsmouth but the vessel having sailed and lying two days off plymouth his name was called just before she weighed again and a thick letter handed to him he opened it eagerly and two things fell on deck a sovereign and a tract the sovereign rolled off and made for the sea robinson darted after it and saved it from the deep and the surrounding rogues then he read a letter which was also in the inclosure it was short in it mr eden told him he had sent him the last tract printed in the prison it is called 'the wages of sin are death' it is not the same one you made into cards that being out of print and the author dead i have been tempted by that good true title to write another i think you will value it none the less for being written by me and printed by our brothers and sisters in this place i inclose one pound that you may not be tempted for want of a shilling robinson looked round for the tract it was not to be seen nobody had seen it n b it had been through a dozen light fingered hands already and was now being laughed at and blasphemed over by two filthy ruffians behind a barrel on the lower deck robinson was first in a fury and then when he found it was really stolen from him he was very much cut up i wish i had lifted it and let the money roll however thought he if i keep quiet i shall hear of it he did hear of it but he never saw it for one of these hardened creatures that had got hold of it had a spite against robinson for refusing his proffered amity and the malicious dog after keeping it several hours hearing robinson threaten to inform against whoever had taken it made himself safe and gratified his spite by flinging it into the channel this too came in due course to robinson's ears he moralized on it i made the first into the devil's books said he and now a child of the devil has robbed me of the second i shan't get a third chance i would give my sovereign and more to see what his reverence says about 'the wages of sin are death' the very title is a sermon i pray heaven the dirty hand that robbed me of it may rot off at the no i forgot bless and curse not and now robinson was confined for five months in a wooden prison with the scum of our jails no cell to take refuge in from evil society and in that wretched five months this perpetual contact with criminals many of them all but incurable took the gloss off him his good resolutions were unshaken but his repugnance to evil associates became gradually worn away at last they landed at sydney they were employed for about a fortnight in some government works a mile from the town and at the end of that time he was picked out by a gentleman who wanted a servant robinson's work was to call him not too early to clean his boots go on errands into the town and be always in the way till five o'clock from that hour until about two in the morning mr miles devoted to amusement returning with his latch key and often rousing the night owl and his servant with a bacchanalian or anacreontic melody in short mr miles was a loose fish a bachelor who had recently inherited the fortune of an old screw his uncle and was spending thrift in all the traditional modes horses dogs women cards etc he was a good natured creature and one morning as he brought him up his hot water and his soda water robinson ventured on a friendly remonstrance mr miles flung canting rogue and half a dozen oaths and one boot at his head and was preparing to add a tumbler when his mentor whipped into the lobby robinson could not have fallen to a worse master than this whose irregularities were so regular that his servant had always seven hours to spend in the town as he pleased there he was often solicited to join in depredations on property for he found half his old acquaintances were collected by the magic of the law on this spot of earth robinson took a particular pride in telling these gentlemen that he had no objection to taking a friendly glass with them and talking over old times but that as for taking what did not belong to him all that was over forever in short he improved on mr eden's instructions instead of flying from temptation like a coward conscious of weakness he nobly faced it and walked cool collected and safe on the edge of danger one good result of this was that he spent his wages every month faster than he got them and spent the clothes his master gave him and these were worth more than his wages for mr miles was going the pace wore nothing after the gloss was off it but robinson had never lived out of prison at less than five hundred per annum and the evening is a good time in the day for spending money in a town and his evenings were all his own one evening a young tradeswoman with whom he was flirting in the character of a merchant's clerk tremendously busy who could only get out in the evening this young woman whom he had often solicited to go to the theater consented i could go with you to morrow my sister and i said she robinson expressed his delight but consulting his pockets found he had not the means of paying for their seats and he could not pawn any clothes for he had but two sets one yellowish that government compelled him to wear by daylight and one a present from his master black that together with a mustache admitted him into the bosom of society at night what was to be done propose to the ladies to pay that was quite without precedent ask his master for an advance impossible his master was gone kangaroo hunting for three days borrow some of his master's clothes and pawn them that was too like theft he would pawn his ring it would only be for a day or two and he would not spend a farthing more till he had got it back he pawned mr eden's ring it just paid for their places at the theater where they saw the living puppets of the colony mop and mow and rant under the title of acting this was so interesting that robinson was thinking of his ring the whole time and how to get it back the girls agreed between themselves they had never enjoyed so dull a cavalier the next day a line from mr miles to say that he should not be back for a week no hope of funds from him so robinson pawned his black coat and got back his ring and as the trousers and waistcoat were no use now he pawned them for pocket money which soon dissolved mr robinson now was out of spirits service is not the thing for me i am of an active turn i want to go into business that will occupy me all day long business that requires some head even his reverence the first man in the country acknowledged my talents and what is the vent for them here the blacking bottle chapter xlv in a low public outside the town in a back room with their arms on the table and their low foreheads nearly touching sat whispering two men types one had the deep sunk colorless eyes the protruding cheek bones the shapeless mouth and the broad chin good in itself but bad in the above connection the other had the vulpine chin and the fiendish eyebrows descending on the very nose in two sharp arches both had the restless eye both the short cropped hair society's comment congruous and auxiliary though in itself faint by the side of habit's seal and nature's a small north window dimly lighted the gloomy uncouth cabin and revealed the sole furniture four chairs too heavy to lift too thick to break and a table discolored with the stains of a thousand filthy debauches and dotted here and there with the fresh ashes of pipes and cigars in this appropriate frame behold two felons putting their heads together by each felon's side smoked in a glass hot with heat and hotter with alcohol the enemy of man it would be difficult to give their dialogue for they spoke in thieves' latin the substance was this they had scent of a booty in a house that stood by itself three miles out of the town but the servants were incorruptible and they could not get access to inspect the premises which were intricate now your professional burglar will no more venture upon unexplored premises than a good seaman will run into an unknown channel without pilot soundings or chart it appeared from the dialogue that the two men were acquainted with a party who knew these premises having been more than once inside them with his master the more rugged one objected to this party he is no use he has turned soft i have heard him refuse a dozen good plants the last month besides i don't want a canting son of a gun for my pal ten to one if he don't turn tail and perhaps split n b all this not in english but in thieve's cant with an oath or a nasty expression at every third word the sentences measled with them you don't know how to take him replied he of the mephistopheles eye brow he won't refuse me why not he is an old pal of mine and i never found the thing i could not persuade him to he does not know how to say me nay you may bully him and queer him till all is blue and he won't budge and that is the lay you have been upon with him now i shall pull a long face make up a story take him by his soft bit tell him i can't get on without him and patter old lang syne to him then we'll get a fiddle and lots of whisky and when we have had a reel and he has shaken his foot on the floor and drank a gill or two you will see him thaw and then you leave him to me and don't put in your jaw to spoil it if we get him it will be all right he is no his little finger has seen more than both our carcasses put together chapter xlvi four days after this mephistopheles with a small m and brutus with a little b sat again in the filthy little cabin where men hatch burglaries but this time the conference wore an air of expectant triumph didn't i tell you you didn't do it easy no i had almost to go on my knees to him he isn't worth so much trouble he is worth it ten times over look at this and the speaker produced a plan of the premises they were plotting against could you have done this i don't say i could could any man you know have done it see here is every room and every door and window and passage put down and what sort of keys and bolts and fastenings to each how came he to know so much he never was in the house but twice a top sawyer like him looks at everything with an eye to business if he was in a church he'd twig the candlesticks and the fastenings while the rest were mooning into the parson's face he can't help it well he may be a top sawyer but i don't like him see how loth he was and when he did agree how he turned to and drank as if he would drown his pluck before it could come to anything wait till you see him work he will shake all that nonsense to blazes when he finds himself out under the moon with the swag on one side and the gallows on the other to go back a little mr miles did not return at the appointed day and robinson who had no work to do and could not amuse himself without money pawned mr eden's ring he felt ashamed and sorrowful but not so much so as the first time this evening as he was strolling moodily through the suburbs a voice hailed him in tones of the utmost cordiality he looked up and there was an old pal with whom he had been associated in many a merry bout and pleasant felony he had not seen the man for two years a friendly glass was offered and accepted two girls were of the party to oblige whom robinson's old acquaintance sent for blind bill the fiddler and soon robinson was dancing and shouting with the girls like mad high cut side cut heel and toe sailor's fling and the double shuffle he did not leave till three in the morning and after a promise to meet the same little party again next evening to dance and drink and drive away dull care chapter xlvii on a certain evening some days later the two men whose faces were definitions sat on a bench outside that little public in the suburbs one at the end of a clay pipe the other behind a pewter mug it was dusk he ought to be here soon said the one into whose forehead holes seemed dug and little bits of some vitreous substance left at the bottom well mate cried he harshly what do you want that you stick to us so tight this was addressed to a peddler who had been standing opposite showing the contents of his box with a silent eloquence now this very asperity made the portable shopman say to himself wants me out of the way perhaps buy me out so he stuck where he was and exhibited his wares we don't want your gim cracks said mephistopheles quietly the man eyed his customers and did not despair but gents said he i have got other things besides gim cracks something that will suit you if you can read of course we can read replied sunken eyes haughtily and in fact they had been too often in jail to escape this accomplishment the peddler looked furtively in every direction and after this precaution pressed a spring and brought a small drawer out from the bottom of his pack the two rogues winked at one another out of the drawer the peddler whipped a sealed packet what is it asked mephistopheles beginning to take an interest just imported from england said the peddler a certain pomp mingling with his furtive and mysterious manner england was the other's patriotic reply and translated from the french that is better but what is it them that buy it they will see something flash rather i should say is there plenty about the women in it the trader answered obliquely what are we obliged to keep it dark for the other put in why of course there is well said sunken eyes affecting carelessness what do you want for it got sixpence bill i sold the last to a gentleman for three and sixpence but as this is the last i've got say half a crown sunken eyes swore at the peddler what half a crown for a book no thicker than a quire of paper only half a crown for a thing i could be put in prison for selling is not my risk to be paid as well as my leaves this logic went home and after a little higgling two shillings was offered and accepted but in the very act of commerce the trader seemed to have a misgiving i daren't do it unless you promise faithfully never to tell you had it of me i have got a character to lose and i would not have it known not for the world that james walker had sold such loose licentious oh what it is very spicy is it come hand it over there's the two bob my poverty and not my will consents sighed the trader there you be off or we shall have all the brats coming round us the peddler complied and moved off and so willing was he to oblige his customers that on turning the corner he shouldered his pack and ran with great agility down the street till he gained a network of small alleys in which he wriggled and left no trace meantime sunken eyes had put his tongue to the envelope and drawn out the contents i'll go into the light and see what it is all about mephistopheles left alone had hardly given his pipe two sucks ere brutus returned black with rage and spouting oaths like a whale why what is the matter matter didn't he sell this to me for a flash story why he didn't say so but certainly he dropped a word about loose books of course he did well and ain't they ain't they cried the other with fury here you young shaver bring the candle out here ain't they no they ain't and and the look here mephisto 'mend your ways' a tract brutus i'll break his head instead mephisto 'narrative of mr james the missionary' brutus the cheating undermining rip mephisto and here is another to the same tune brutus didn't i tell you so the hypocritical humbugging rascal mephisto stop a bit here is a little one 'memoirs of a gentleman's housekeeper' brutus oh is there i did not see that mephisto you are so hasty the case mayn't be so black as it looks the others might be thrown in to make up the parcel hold the candle nearer brutus ay let us see about the housekeeper the two men read the housekeeper eagerly but as they read the momentary excitement of hope died out of their faces not a sparkle of the ore they sought all was dross the housekeeper was one of those who make pickles not eat them and in a linen apron a yard wide save their master's money from the fangs of cook and footman not help him scatter it in a satin gown there was not even a stray hint or an indelicate expression for the poor fellow's two shillings the fraud was complete it was not like the ground coffee pepper and mustard in a london shop in which there is as often as not a pinch of real coffee mustard and pepper to a pound of chicory and bullock's blood of red lead dirt flour and turmeric here the do was pure then brutus relieved his swelling heart by a string of observations partly rhetorical partly zoological he devoted to horrible plagues every square inch of the peddler enumerating more particularly those interior organs that subserve vitality and concluded by vowing solemnly to put a knife into him the first fair opportunity i'll teach the rogue to sell you medicine for poison eh mephistopheles either because he was a more philosophic spirit or was not the one out of pocket took the blow more coolly it is a bite and no mistake but what of it our money said he with a touch of sadness goes as it comes this is only two bob flung in the dirt we should not have invested them in the three per cents and to night's swag will make it up he then got a fresh wafer and sealed the pamphlets up again there said he you keep dark and sell the first flat you come across the same way the varmint sold you brutus sickened at heart by the peddler's iniquity revived at the prospect of selling some fellow creature as he had been sold he put the paper trap in his pocket and cheated of obscenity consoled himself with brandy such as bacchus would not own but beelzebub would brew for man if permitted to keep an earthly distillery presently they were joined by the third man and for two hours the three heads might all have been covered by one bushel basket and peddler walker's heartless fraud was forgotten in business of a higher order at last mephistopheles gave brutus a signal and they rose to interrupt the potations of the newcomer who was pouring down fire and hot water in rather a reckless way we won't all go together said mephistopheles you two meet me at jonathan's ken in an hour as brutus and the newcomer walked along an idea came to brutus here is a fellow that passes for a sharp what if i sell him my pamphlets and get a laugh at his expense mate said he here is a flash book all sealed up what will you give me for it well i don't much care for that sort of reading old fellow but this is cheap i got it a bargain come a shilling won't hurt you for it see there is more than one under the cover now the other had been drinking till he was in that state in which a good natured fellow's mind if decomposed would be found to be all yes and dine with me to morrow so he fell into the trap i'll give it you my boy said he let us see it there are more than one inside it you're an honest fellow owe you a shilling and the sealed parcel went into his pocket then seeing brutus look rather rueful at this way of doing business he hiccoughed out stop your bob out of the swag and chuckled chapter xlviii a snow white suburban villa standing alone with its satellites that occupied five times as much space as itself coach house stable offices greenhouse clinging to it like dew to a lily and hot house farther in the rear a wall of considerable height inclosed the whole it booked as secure and peaceful as innocent in the fleeting light the young moon cast on it every time the passing clouds left her clear a moment yet at this calm thoughtful hour crime was waiting to invade this pretty little place under the scullery window lurked brutus and mephistopheles faces blackened tools in hand ready to whip out a pane of said window and so penetrate the kitchen and from the kitchen the pantry where they made sure of a few spoons and up the back stairs to the plate chest they would be in the house even now but a circumstance delayed them a light was burning on the second floor now it was contrary to their creed to enter a house where a light was burning above all if there was the least chance of that light being in a sitting room now they had been some hours watching the house and that light had been there all the time therefore argued mephistopheles it is not a farthing glim in a bedroom or we should have seen it lighted it is some one up we must wait till they roost they waited and waited and waited still the light burned they cursed the light no wonder light seems the natural enemy of evil deeds they began to get bitter and their bodies cold even burglary becomes a bore when you have to wait too long idle out in the cold at last at about half past two the light went out then keenly listening the two sons of darkness heard a movement in the house and more than one door open and shut and then the sound of feet going rapidly down the road toward sydney why it is a party only just broke up lucky i would not work till the glim was out but i say bill he is at that corner the nobs must have passed close to him suppose they saw him he is not so green as let them see him the next question was how long they should wait to let the inmates close their peepers all had been still and dark more than half an hour when the pair began to work mephisto took out a large piece of putty and dabbed it on the middle of the pane this putty he worked in the center up to a pyramid this he held with his left hand while with his right be took out his glazier's diamond and cut the pane all round the edges by the hold the putty gave him he prevented the pane from falling inside the house and making a noise and finally whipped it out clean and handed it to brutus a moment more the two men were in the scullery thence into the kitchen through a door which they found open in the kitchen were two doors trying one they found it open into a larder here casting the light of his dark lantern round brutus discovered some cold fowl and a ham they took these into the kitchen and somewhat coolly took out their knives and ate a hasty but hearty supper their way of hacking the ham was as lawless as all the rest they then took off their shoes and dropped them outside the scullery window and now the serious part of the game began creeping like cats they reached the pantry and sure enough found more than a dozen silver spoons and forks of different sizes that had been recently used these they put into a small bag and mephisto went back through the scullery into the back garden and hid these spoons in a bush then if we should be interrupted we can come back for them and now the game became more serious and more nervous the pair drew their clasp knives and placed them in their bosoms ready in case of extremity then creeping like cats one foot at a time and then a pause ascended the back stairs at the top of which was a door but this door was not fastened and in another moment they passed through it and were on the first landing the plan correct in every particular indicated the plate closet to their right a gleam from the lantern showed it the key hole was old fashioned as also described and in a moment brutus had it open then mephisto whipped out a green baize bag with compartments and in a minute these adroit hands had stowed away cups tureens baskets soup spoons etc to the value of three hundred pounds and scarce a chink heard during the whole operation it was done a look passed as much as to say this is enough and they crept back silent and cat like as they had come brutus leading with the bag now just as he had his hand on the door through which they had come up snick click a door was locked somewhere down below brutus looked round and put the bag gently down where he whispered near the kitchen was the reply scarce audible sounded to me to come from the hall whispered the other both men changed color but retained their presence of mind and their cunning brutus stepped back to the plate closet put the bag in it and closed it but without locking it stay there whispered he and if i whistle run out the back way empty handed if i mew out with the bag and come out by the front door nothing but inside bolts to it plan says they listened a moment there was no fresh sound then brutus slipped down the front stairs in no time he found the front door not bolted he did not quite understand that and drawing a short bludgeon he opened it very cautiously the caution was not superfluous two gentlemen made a dash at him from the outside the moment the door was open one of their heads cracked like a broken bottle under the blow the ready ruffian struck him with his bludgeon and he dropped like a shot but another was coming flying across the lawn with a drawn cutlass and brutus finding himself overmatched gave one loud whistle and flew across the hall making for the kitchen flew he never so fast mephisto was there an instant before him as for the gentleman at the door he was encumbered with his hurt companion who fell across his knees as he rushed at the burglar brutus got a start of some seconds and dashed furiously into the kitchen and flew to the only door between them and the scullery window the door was locked the burglar's eyes gleamed in their deep caverns back will and cut through them he cried and out flashed his long bright knife chapter xlix while the two burglars were near the scullery window watching the light in the upper story a third man stood sentinel on the opposite side of the house he was but a few yards from the public road yet hundreds would have passed and no man seen him for he had placed himself in a thick shadow flat against the garden wall his office was to signal danger from his side should any come now the light that kept his comrades inactive was not on his side of the house he waited therefore expecting every moment their signal that the job was done on this the cue was to slip quietly off and all make by different paths for the low public house described above and there divide the swag the man waited and waited and waited for this signal it never came we know why then he became impatient miserable he was out of his element wanted to be doing something at last all this was an intolerable bore not feeling warm toward the job he had given the active business to his comrades which he now regretted for two reasons first he was kept here stagnant and bored and second they must be a pair of bunglers he'd have robbed a parish in less time he would light a cigar tobacco blunts all ills even ennui putting his hand in his pocket for a cigar it ran against a hard square substance what is this oh the book mephisto had sold him no he would not smoke he would see what the book was all about he knelt down and took off his hat and put his dark lantern inside it before he ventured to move the slide then undid the paper and putting it into the hat threw the concentrated rays on the contents and peered in to examine them now the various little pamphlets had been displaced by mephisto and the first words that met the thief's eye in large letters on the back of a tract were these the wages of sin are death thomas robinson looked at these words with a stupid gaze at first he did not realize all that lay in them he did not open the tract he gazed benumbed at the words and they glared at him like the eyes of green fire when we come in the dark on some tiger cat crouching in his lair oh that i were a painter and could make you see what cannot be described the features of this strange incident that sounds so small and was so great the black night the hat the renegade peering under it in the wall's deep shadows to read something trashy and the half open lantern shooting its little strip of intense fire and the grim words springing out in a moment from the dark face of night and dazzling the renegade's eyes and chilling his heart the wages of sin are death to his stupor now succeeded surprise and awe how comes this he whispered aloud was this a trick of 's no he doesn't know this is the devil's own doing no it is not more likely it is the third time i'll read it my hands shake so i can hardly hold it it is by him yes signed f e heaven have mercy on me this is more than natural he read it shaking all over as he read the tract was simply written it began with a story of instances some of them drawn from the histories of prisoners and it ended with an earnest exhortation and a terrible warning when the renegade came to this part his heart beat violently for along with the earnest straightforward unmincing words of sacred fire there seemed to rise from the paper the eloquent voice the eye rich with love the face of inexhaustible intelligence and sympathy that had so often shone on robinson while just words such as these issued from those golden lips he read on but not to the end for as he read he came to one paragraph that made him fancy that mr eden was by his very side you into whose hands these words of truth shall fall and find you intending to do some foolish or wicked thing to morrow or the next day or to day or this very hour stop do not that sin on your soul do it not fall on your knees and repent the sin you have meditated better repent the base design than suffer for the sin as suffer you shall so surely as the sky is pure so surely as god is holy and sin's wages are death at these words as if the priest's hand had been stretched across the earth and sea and laid on the thief's head he fell down upon his knees with his back toward the scene of burglary and his face toward england crying out i will your reverence i am lord help me cried he then first remembering how he had been told to pray in temptation's hour the next moment he started to his feet he dashed his lantern to the ground and leaped over a gate that stood in his way and fled down the road to sydney he ran full half a mile before he stopped his mind was in a whirl another reflection stopped him he was a sentinel and had betrayed his post suppose his pals were to get into trouble through reckoning on him was it fair to desert them without warning what if he were to go back and give the whistle of alarm pretend he had seen some one watching and so prevent the meditated crime as well as be guiltless of it himself but then thought he and suppose i do go back what will become of me while he hesitated the question was decided for him as he looked back irresolute his keen eye noticed a shadow moving along the hedge side to his left why they are coming away was his first thought but looking keenly down the other edge which was darker still he saw another noiseless moving shadow why are they on different sides of the road and both keeping in the shadow thought this shrewd spirit and he liked it so ill that he turned at once and ran off toward sydney at this out came the two figures with a bound into the middle of the road and with a loud view halloo raced after him like the wind robinson as he started and before he knew the speed of his pursuers ventured to run sidewise a moment to see who or what they were he caught a glimpse of white waistcoats and glittering studs and guessed the rest he had a start of not more than twenty yards but he was a good runner and it was in his favor that his pursuers had come up at a certain speed while he started fresh after a rest he squared his shoulders opened his mouth wide for a long race and ran as men run for their lives in the silent night robinson's highlows might have been heard half a mile off clattering along the hard road pit pit pit pat came two pair of dress boots after him robinson heard the sound with a thrill of fear they in their pumps and i in boots thought he and his pursuers heard the hunted one groan and redoubled their efforts as dogs when the stag begins to sob he had scarce run a hundred yards with his ears laid back like a hare's when he could not help thinking the horrible pit pit pit got nearer he listened with agonized keenness as he ran and so fine did his danger make his ear that he could tell the exact position of his pursuers a cold sweat crept over him as he felt they had both gained ten yards out of the twenty on him then he distinctly felt one pursuer gain upon the other and this one's pit pit pit crept nearer and nearer an inch every three or four yards the other held his own no more no less at last so near crept no that robinson felt his hot breath at his ear he clinched his teeth and gave a desperate spurt and put four or five yards between them he could have measured the ground gained by the pit pit pat but the pursuer put on a spurt and reduced the distance by half i may as well give in thought the hunted one but at that moment came a gleam of hope this pursuer began suddenly to pant very loud he had clinched his teeth to gain the twenty yards he had gained them but had lost his wind robinson heard this and feared him no longer and in fact after one or two more puffs came one despairing snort and no pulled up dead short thoroughly blown as no passed him he just panted out won't catch him won't i ejaculated no expelling the words rather than uttering them klopetee klop klopetee klop klopetee klopetee klopetee klop pit pat pit pat pit pat pat pit pit pat ten yards apart no more no less nor nearer might the dog attain nor farther might the quarry strain they have done me between them thought poor robinson i could have run from either singly but one blows me and then the other runs me down i can get out of it by fighting perhaps but then there will be another crime robinson now began to pant audibly and finding he could not shake the hunter off he with some reluctance prepared another game he began to exaggerate his symptoms of distress and imperceptibly to relax his pace on this the pursuer came up hand over head he was scarce four yards behind when robinson suddenly turned and threw himself on one knee with both hands out like a cat's claws the man ran on full tilt in fact he could not have stopped robinson caught his nearest ankle with both hands and rose with him and lifted him aided by his own impulse high into the air and sent his heels up perpendicular the man described a parabola in the air and came down on the very top of his head with frightful force and as he lay his head buried in his hat and his heels kicking robinson without a moment lost jumped over his body and klopetee klop rang fainter and fainter down the road alone the plucky pursuer wrenched his head with infinite difficulty out of his hat which sat on his shoulders with his nose pointing through a chasm from crown to brim shook himself and ran wildly a few yards in pursuit but finding he had in his confusion run away from robinson as well as robinson from him and hopeless of recovering the ground now lost he gave a rueful sort of laugh made the best of it put his hands in his pockets and strolled back to meet no meantime robinson fearful of being pursued on horseback relaxed his speed but little and ran the three miles out into sydney he came home with his flank heating and a glutinous moisture on his lip and a hunted look in his eye he crept into bed but spent the night thinking ay and praying too not sleeping chapter l thomas robinson rose from his sleepless bed an altered man altered above all in this that his self confidence was clean gone how little i knew myself said he and how well his reverence knew me i am the weakest fool on earth he saw that and told me what to do he provided help for me and i like an ungrateful idiot never once thought of obeying him but from this hour i see myself as i am and as he used to call me a clever fool i can't walk straight without some honest man to hold by well i'll have one though i give up everything else in the world for it then he went to his little box and took out the letter to george fielding he looked at it and reproached himself for forgetting it so long a letter from the poor fellow's sweetheart too i ought to have sent it by the post if i did not take it but i will take it i'll ask mr miles's leave the moment he comes home and start that very day then he sat down and read the tract again and as he read it was filled with shame and contrition by one of those freaks of mind which it is so hard to account for every good feeling rushed upon him with far greater power than when he was in prison and strange to say he now loved his reverence more and took his words deeper to heart than he had done when they were together his flesh crept with horror at the thought that he had been a criminal again at least in intention and that but for heaven's mercy he would have been taken and punished with frightful severity and above all would have wounded his reverence to the heart in return for more than mortal kindness goodness and love and to do robinson justice this last thought made his heart sicken and his flesh creep more than all the rest he was like a man who had fallen asleep on the brink of an unseen precipice awoke and looked down the penitent man said his prayers this morning and vowed on his knees humility and a new life henceforth he would know himself he would not attempt to guide himself he would just obey his reverence and to begin whenever a temptation came in sight he would pray against it then and there and fly from it and the moment his master returned he would leave the town and get away to honest george fielding with his passport susan's letter with these prayers and these resolutions a calm complacency stole over him he put his reverence's tract and george's letter in his bosom and came down into the kitchen the first person he met was the housemaid jenny oh here is my lord cried she where were you last night robinson stammered out nowhere in particular why oh because the master was asking for you and you weren't to be found high or low what is he come home came home last night i'll go and take him his hot water why he is not in the house stupid he dressed the moment he came home and went out to a party he swore properly at your not being in the way to help him dress what did he say asked robinson a little uneasy the girl's eyes twinkled he said 'how ever am i to lace myself now that scamp is not in the way' come none of your chaff jenny why you know you do lace him and pretty tight too i do nothing of the kind oh of course you won't tell on one another tell me our head scamp does not wear stays a man would not be as broadshouldered as that and have a waist like a wasp and his back like a board without a little lacing and a good deal too well have it your own way jenny won't you give me a morsel of breakfast well tom i can give you some just for form's sake but bless you you won't able to eat it why not gents that are out all night bring a headache home in the morning in place of an appetite but i was not out all night i was at home soon after twelve really really tom well jane those that ain't clever enough to hide secrets should trust them to those that are i don't know what you mean my lass oh nothing only i sat up till halfpast one in the kitchen and i listened till three in my room you took a deal of trouble on my account oh it was more curiosity than regard was the keen reply so i should say the girl colored and seemed nettled by this answer she set demurely about the work of small vengeance now said she with great cordiality you tell me what you were doing all night and why you broke into the house like a a hem instead of coming into it like a man and then you'll save me the trouble of finding it out whether you like or not these words chilled robinson what had a spy been watching him perhaps for days and above all a female spy a thing with a velvet paw a noiseless step an inscrutable countenance and a microscopic eye he hung his head over his cup in silence jenny's eye was scanning him he felt that without seeing it he was uneasy under it but his self reproach was greater than his uneasiness at this juncture the street door was opened with a latch key here comes the head scamp' said jenny with her eye on robinson the next moment a bell was rung sharply robinson rose finish your breakfast said jenny i'll answer the bell and out she went she returned in about ten minutes with a dressing gown over her arm and a pair of curling irons in her hand there said she you are to go in the parlor and get up the young buck curl his nob and whiskers i wish it was me i'd curl his ear the first thing i'd curl what jane did you take the trouble to bring them down for me they look like it replied the other tartly as if she repented the good office robinson went in to his master he expected a rebuke for being out of the way but no he found the young gentleman in excellent humor and high spirits help me off with this coat tom yes sir oh not so rough confound you ah ugh coat's a little too tight sir no it isn't it fits me like a glove but i am stiff and sore there now get me a shirt robinson came back with the shirt and aired it close to the fire and this being a favorable position for saying what he felt awkward about he began mr miles sir hallo i am going to ask you a favor out with it you have been a kind master to me i should think i have too by jove you won't find such another in a hurry no sir i am sure i should not but there is an opening for me of a different sort altogether i have a friend a squatter near bathurst and i am to join him if you will be so kind as to let me go what an infernal nuisance cried the young gentleman who was like most boys good natured and selfish the moment i get a servant i like he wants to go to the devil only to bathurst sir said robinson deprecatingly to put him in a good humor and what am i to do for another at this moment in came jenny with all the paraphernalia of breakfast here jenny cried he here's robinson wants to leave us stupid ass jenny stood transfixed with the tray in her hand since when asked she of her master but looking at robinson this moment the faithful creature greeted my return with that proposal well sir a servant isn't a slave and suppose he has a reason oh they have always got a reason such as it is wants to go and squat at bathurst well tom you are a fool for leaving us but of course we shan't pay you the compliment of keeping you against your will shall we looking at jane what have i to do with it replied she opening her gray eyes what is it to me whether he goes or stays come i like that why you are the housemaid and he is the footman and those two we know are always and the young gentleman eked out his meaning by whistling a tune mr miles said jenny very gravely like an elder rebuking a younger you must excuse me sir but i advise you not to make so free with your servants servants are encroaching and they will be sure to take liberties with you in turn and turning suddenly red and angry if you talk like that to me i shall leave the room well if you must you must but bring the tea kettle back with you that is a duck jenny could not help laughing and went for the tea kettle on her return robinson made signals to her over the master's head which he had begun to frizz at first she looked puzzled but following the direction of his eye she saw that her master's right hand was terribly cut and swollen oh cried the girl oh dear oh dear eh cried mr miles what is the row look at your poor hand sir oh ay isn't it hideous met with an accident soon get well no it won't not of itself but i have got a capital lotion for bruises and i shall bathe it for you jenny brought in a large basin of warm water and began to foment it first touching it so tenderly and his hand that was as white as a lady's said jenny pitifully po o r bo y this kind expression had no sooner escaped her than she colored and bent her head down over her work hoping it might escape notice young woman said mr miles with paternal gravity servants are advised not to make too free with their masters or the beggars will forget their place and take liberties with you he he he jenny put his hand quietly down into the water and got up and ran across the room for the door her course was arrested by a howl from the jocose youth murder take him off jenny kick him the beggar is curling and laughing at the same time confound you can't you lay the irons down when i say a good thing ha ha ha this strange trio chuckled a space miles the loudest tom pour out my tea and you jenny if you will come to the scratch again ha ha i'll tell you how i came by this this promise brought the inquisitive jenny to the basin directly you know hazeltine yes sir a tall gentleman that comes here now and then that is the one you are to run a race with on the public course put in jenny looking up with a scandalized air that is the boy but how the deuce did you know gentlemen to run with all the dirty boys looking on like horses remonstrated the grammatical one it is a disgrace so it is for the one that is beat well i was to meet hazeltine to supper out of town by the by you don't know tom yates oh said jenny i have heard of him too i doubt that there are a good many of his name the rake i mean lives a mile or two out of sydney so do half a dozen more of them this one is about the biggest gambler and sharper unhung all right that is my friend well he gave us a thundering supper lots of lush what is lush tea and coffee and barley water my dear oh can't you put the thundering irons down when i say a good thing well i mustn't be witty any more the penalty is too severe i need hardly say it was not mr miles's jokes that agitated robinson now on the contrary in the midst of his curiosity and rising agitation these jokes seemed ghastly impossibilities well at ten o'clock we went upstairs to a snug little room and all four sat down to a nice little green table to gamble no to whist but now comes the fun we had been playing about four hours and the room was hot and yates was gone for a fresh pack and old hazeltine was gone into the drawing room to cool himself presently he comes back and he says in a whisper come here old fellows we went with him to the drawing room and at first sight we saw nothing but presently flash came a light right in our eyes it seemed to come from something glittering in the field and these flashes kept coming and going at last we got the governor and he puzzled over it a little while 'i know what it is' cried he 'it is my cucumber glass' jenny looked up glass might glitter said she but i don't see how it could flash no more did we and we laughed in the governor's face for all that we were wrong 'there is somebody under that wall with a dark lantern' said tom yates 'and every now and then the glass catches the glare and reflects it this way' 'solomon' cried the rest of us the fact is jenny when tom yates gets half drunk he develops sagacity more than human robinson gave a little groan aha cried miles the beggar has burned his finger i'm glad of it why should i be the only sufferer by his thundering irons 'here is a lark' said i 'we'll nab this dark lantern won't we hazy' 'rather' said hazy 'wait till i get my pistols and i'll give you a cutlass george' says tom yates i forget who george was but he said he was of noble blood and i think myself he was some relation to the king of trumps the whole family came about him so mind my hair now 'oh bother your artillery' said i 'thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just' when i'm a little cut you may know it by my quoting shakespeare when i'm sober i don't remember a word of him and don't want to no the sporting magazine that is your bible sir suggested jenny yes and let me read it without your commentary mind my hair now where was i oh hazeltine and i opened the door softly and whipped out but the beggar was too sharp for us no doubt he heard the door anyway before we could get through the shrubbery he was off and we heard him clattering down the road ever so far off however we followed quietly on the grass by the road side at a fair traveling pace and by and by what do you think our man had pulled up in the middle of the road and stood stock still 'that is a green trick' thought i however before we could get up to him he saw us or heard us and off down the road no end of a pace 'tally ho' cried i out came hazy from the other hedge and away we went 'pug' ahead 'growler' and 'gay lad' scarce twenty yards from his brush and the devil take the hindmost well of course we made sure of catching him in about a hundred yards two such runners as hazy and me and did not you i'll tell you at first we certainly gained on him a few yards but after that i could not near him but hazy put on a tremendous spurt and left me behind for all i could do 'here is a go' thought i 'and i have backed myself for a hundred pounds in a half mile race against this beggar' well i was behind but hazy and the fox seemed to me to be joined together running when all of a sudden pouff hazy's wind and his pluck blew out together he tailed off wasn't i pleased 'good by hazy' says i as i shot by him and took up the running well i tried all i knew but this confounded fellow ran me within half a mile of sydney n b within two miles of it my throat and all my inside was like an oven and i was thinking of tailing off too when i heard the beggar puff and blow so then i knew i must come up with him before long and did you sir asked jenny in great excitement yes said the other i passed him even but did you catch him well why yes i caught him as the chinese caught the tartar this was one of your downy coves that are up to every move when he found he hadn't legs to run from me he slips back to meet me down he goes under my leg i go blundering over him twenty miles an hour he lifts me clear over his head and i come flying down from the clouds heel over tip i'd give twenty pounds to know how it was done and fifty to see it done to a friend all i know is that i should have knocked my own brains out if it had not been for my hat and my hand they bore the brunt between them as you see and what became of the poor man asked jane well when the poor man had flung me over his head he ran on faster than ever and by the time i had shaken my knowledge box and found out north from south i heard the poor man's nailed shoes clattering down the road to start again a hundred yards behind a poor man who could run like that would have been making a toil of a trouble so i trotted back to meet hazy well i am glad he got off clear ain't you tom yes no a scoundrel that hashed the master like this why jane you must be mad spare your virtuous indignation said the other coolly remember i had been hunting him like a wild beast till his heart was nearly broke and when i was down he could easily have revenged himself by giving me a kick with his heavy shoes on the head or the loins that would have spoiled my running for a month of sundays what do you say to that robinson colored i say you are very good to make excuses for an unfortunate man for a rascal that is to say a burglar a and how do you know he was all that asked jenny very sharply why did he run if he was not guilty inquired robinson cunningly guilty what of asked jenny that is more than i can tell you replied robinson i dare say said jenny it was some peaceable man that took fright at seeing two wild young gentlemen come out like mad bulls after him when i have told you my story you will be better able to judge what isn't the story ended ended the cream of it is coming oh sir cried jenny please don't go on till i come back i am going for the cold lotion now i have fomented it enough well look sharp then here is the other all in a twitter with excitement me sir no yes i am naturally interested well you haven't been long i don't think i want any lotion the hot water has done it a good deal of good this will do it more but do you know it is rather a bore to have only one hand to cut bread and butter with i'll cut it sir said robinson laying down his irons for a moment how long shall you be jenny asked mr miles i shall have done by when your story is done replied she coolly mr miles laughed well jenny said he i hadn't walked far before i met hazeltine 'have you got him' says he 'do i look like it' said i rather crustily fancy a fool asking me whether i had got him so i told him all about it and we walked back together by and by we met the other two just outside the gate well just as we were going in tom yates said 'i say suppose we look round the premises before we go to bed' we went softly round the house and what did we find but a window with the glass taken out we poked about and we found a pair of shoes 'why there's some one in the house' says tom yates 'as i'm a sinner' so we held a council of war tom was to go into the kitchen lock the door leading out and ambush in the larder with his pistols and we three were to go in by the front door and search the house well hazeltine and i had got within a yard or two of it and the knave of trumps in the rear with a sword or something when by george sir the door began to open and out slips a fellow quietly long hazy and i went at him hazy first crack he caught hazy on the head with a bludgeon down went daddy long legs and i got entangled in him and the robber cut like the wind for the kitchen 'come on' shouted i to the honorable thingunibob bother his name there the knave of trumps and i pulled up hazy but couldn't wait for him and after the beggar like mad well as i came near the kitchen door i heard a small scrimmage and back comes my man flying bludgeon in one hand and knife in the other both whirling over his head like a windmill i kept cool doubled my right and put in a heavy one from the armpit you know tom caught him just under the chin you might have heard his jaw crack a mile off down goes my man on his back flat on the bricks and his bludgeon rattled one way and his knife the other such a lark oh oh oh what are you doing robinson you hurt me most confoundedly i won't tell you any more so now he was down in popped the knave of swords and fell on him and hazy came staggering in after and insulted him a bit and we bagged him and the other sir asked tom affecting an indifferent tone he didn't get off i hope what other inquired jenny the other unfor the other rascal the burglar why he never said there were two y yes he said they found their shoes no he said he found a pair of shoes for all that you are wrong jenny and he is right there were two and what is more tom yates had got the other threatening to blow out his brains if he moved so down he sat on the dresser and took it quite easy and whistled a tune while we trussed the other beggar with his own bludgeon and our chokers tom yates says the cool one tumbled down from upstairs just as we drove our one in tom let them try the door before he bounced out then my one flung a chair at tom's head and cut back tom nailed the other and i floored mine hurrah through this whole narrative robinson had coolly and delicately to curl live hair with a beating heart and to curl the very man who was relating all the time how he had hunted him and caught his comrades meantime a shrewd woman there listening with all her ears a woman too who had certain vague suspicions about him and had taken him up rather sharper than natural he thought when being off his guard for a moment he anticipated the narrator and assumed there were two burglars in the house tom therefore though curious and anxious shut his face and got on his guard and it was with an admirable imitation of mere sociable curiosity that he inquired and what did the rascals say for themselves what could they say said jenny they were caught in the fact to do them justice they did not speak of themselves but they said three or four words too very much to the point how interesting it is cried jenny what about well it was about your friend my friend the peaceable gentleman the two young ruffians had chased down the road oh he was one of them said jane that is plain enough now in course what did they say about him 'sold' says my one to tom's 'and no mistake' says tom's oh they spoke out took no more notice of us four than if we had no ears then says mine 'what do you think of your pal now' and what do you think tom's answered jenny it was rather a curious answer multum in parvo as we say at school and one that makes me fear there is a storm brewing for our mutual friend the peaceable gentleman jenny alias the downy runner why what did he say he said 'i think he won't be alive this day week ' the wretches no you don't see they thought he had betrayed them but of course you undeceived them said robinson no i didn't why you precious greenhorn was that our game well sir cried robinson cheerfully any way it was a good night's work the only thing vexes me added he with an intense air of mortification is that the worst scoundrel of the lot got clear off that is a pity a downright pity make your mind easy replied mr miles calmly he won't escape we shall have him before the day is out will you sir that is right but how the honorable thingumbob tom yates's friend put us up to it we sent the pair down to sydney in the break and we put yates's groom he is a ticket of leave in with them and a bottle of brandy and he is to condole with them and have a guinea if they let out the third man's name and they will for they are bitter against him robinson sighed what is the matter said his master trying to twist his head round nothing only i am afraid they they won't split fellows of that sort don't split on a comrade where they can get no good by it well if they don't still we shall have him one of us saw his face ah it was the honorable the knave of trumps while yates was getting the arms trumps slipped out by the garden gate and caught a glimpse of our friend he saw him take the lantern up and fling it down and run the light fell full on his face and he could swear to it out of a thousand so the net is round our friend and we shall have him before the day is out dring a dong dring a ring at the bell have you done tom just one more turn sir then jenny you see who that is jenny went and returned with an embossed card it is a young gentleman mustache and lavender gloves oh such a buck who can it be the 'honorable george lascelles' why that is the very man i remember he said he would do himself the honor to call on me that is the knave of trumps go down directly robinson and tell him i'm at home and bring him up yes sir yes sir well then why don't you go um perhaps jenny will go while i clear these things away and without waiting for an answer robinson hastened to encumber himself with the tea tray and flung the loaf and curling irons into it and bustled about and showed a sudden zeal lest this bachelor's room should appear in disorder and as jenny mounted the front stairs followed by the sprig of nobility he plunged heavily laden down the back stairs into the kitchen and off with his coat and cleaned knives like a mad thing oh if i had but a pound in my pocket thought he i would not stay another hour in sydney i'd get my ring and run for bathurst and never look behind me how comfortable and happy i was until i fell back into the old courses and now see what a life mine has been ever since what a twelve hours hunted like a wild beast suspected and watched by my fellow servant and forced to hide my thoughts from this one and my face from that one but i deserve it and i wish it was ten times as bad oh you fool you idiot you brute it is not the half of what you deserve i ask but one thing of heaven that his reverence may never know don't let me break that good man's heart i'd much rather die before the day is out at this moment jenny came in robinson cleaned the poor knives harder still and did not speak his cue was to find out what was passing in the girl's mind but she washed her cup and saucer and plates in silence presently the bell rang tom said jenny quietly would you mind going jenny me it is not my business no jenny but once in a way if you will be so kind once why i have been twice to the door for you to day you to your place and i to mine shan't go look at me with my coat off and covered with brickdust put your coat on and shake the dust off oh jenny that is not like you to refuse me such a trifle i would not disoblige you so i didn't refuse said jenny making for the door i only said 'no' once or twice we don't call that refusing but as she went out of the door she turned sharp as if to catch robinson's face off its guard and her gray eye dwelt on him with one of those demure inexplicable looks her sex can give all ab extra seeing all revealing nothing she returned with her face on fire that is what i get for taking your place what is the matter that impudent young villain wanted to kiss me oh is that all no it is not all he said i was the prettiest girl in sydney with an appearance of rising indignation well but jenny that is no news i could have told him that then why did you never tell me i thought by your manner you knew it having tried to propitiate the foe thus robinson lost no more time but went upstairs and asked mr miles for the trifle due to him as wages mr miles was very sorry but he had been cleaned out at his friend yates's had not a shilling left and no hopes of any for a fortnight to come then sir said robinson doggedly i hope you will allow me to go into the town and try and make a little for myself just enough to pay my traveling expenses by all means was the reply tell me if you succeed and i'll borrow a sovereign of you out went robinson into the town of sydney he got into a respectable street and knocked at a good house with a green door he introduced himself to the owner as a first rate painter and engrainer and offered to turn this door into a mahogany walnut oak or what not door the house is beautiful all but the door said sly tom it is blistered i am quite content with it as it is was the reply in a rude supercilious tone robinson went away discomfited he went doggedly down the street begging them all to have their doors beautified and wincing at every refusal at last he found a shopkeeper who had no objection but doubted robinson's capacity show me what you can do said he slyly and then i'll talk to you send for the materials replied the artist and give me a board and i'll put half a dozen woods on the face of it and pray said the man why should i lay out my money in advertising you no you bring me a specimen and if it is all right i'll give you the job that is a bargain replied robinson and went off how hard they make honesty to a poor fellow muttered he bitterly but i'll beat them and he clinched his teeth he went to a pawnbroker and pawned the hat off his head it was a new one then for a halfpenny he bought a sheet of brown paper and twisted it into a workman's cap he bought the brushes and a little paint and a little varnish and then he was without a penny again he went to a wheelwright's and begged the loan of a small valueless worm eaten board he saw kicking about telling him what it was for the wealthy wheelwright eyed him with scorn should i ever see it again asked he ironically keep it for your coffin said robinson fiercely and passed on how hard they make honesty to a poor fellow i was a fool for asking for it when i might have taken it what was there to hinder me honesty my lass you are bitter presently he came to the suburbs and there was a small wooden cottage the owner a common laborer was repairing it as well as he could robinson asked him very timidly if he could spare a couple of square feet off a board he was sawing what for robinson showed his paintpot and brushes and told him how he was at a stand still for want of a board it is only a loan of it i ask said he the man measured the plank carefully and after some hesitation cut off a good piece i can spare that much said he poor folk should feel for one another i'll bring it back you may depend said robinson you needn't trouble replied the laboring man with a droll wink as much as to say gammon when robinson returned to the skeptical shopkeeper with a board on which oak satin wood walnut etc were imitated to the life in squares that worthy gave a start and betrayed his admiration and robinson asked him five shillings more than he would if the other had been more considerate in short before evening the door was painted a splendid imitation of walnut wood the shopkeeper was enchanted and robinson had fifteen shillings handed over to him he ran and got mr eden's ring out of pawn and kissed it and put it on next he liberated his hat he slept better this night than the last one more such day and i shall have enough to pay my expenses to bathurst he turned out early and went into the town he went into the street where he had worked last evening and when he came near this door there was a knot of persons round it robinson joined them presently one of the shop boys cried out why here he is this is the painter instantly three or four hands were laid on robinson come and paint my door no come and paint mine no mine tom had never been in such request since he was an itinerant quack his sly eye twinkled and this artist put himself up to auction then and there he was knocked down to a tradesman in the same street twenty one shillings the price of this door mock mahogany while he was working commissions poured in and robinson's price rose the demand for him being greater than the supply the mahogany door was really a chef d'oeuvre he came home triumphant with thirty shillings in his pocket he spread them out on the kitchen table and looked at them with a pride and a thrill of joy money never gave him before he had often closed the shutters and furtively spread out twice as many sovereigns but they were only his these shillings were his own and they were not only his own but his own by labor each sacred shilling represented so much virtue for industry is a virtue he looked at them with a father's pride how sweet the butter our own hands have churned t t he blessed his reverend friend for having taught him an art in a dunghole where idiots and savages teach crank he blessed his reverence's four bones his favorite imprecation of the benevolent kind i conclude the four bones meant the arms and legs if so it would have been more to the point had he blessed the fifth the skull jenny came in and found him gloating over his virtuous shillings she stared he told her what he had been about these two days past his difficulties his success the admiration his work excited throughout the capital he must exaggerate a little or it would not be tom robinson and the wealth he was amassing jenny was glad to hear this very glad but she scolded him well for pawning his hat why didn't you ask me said she i would have lent you a pound or even two or given them you for any honest purpose and jenny pouted and got up a little quarrel the next day a gentleman caught robinson and made him paint two doors in his fancy villa satin wood this time and he received three pounds three shillings a good dinner and what bohemians all adore praise now as he returned in the evening a sudden misgiving came to him i have not thought once of bathurst to day i see all this money making is a contrivance to keep me in sydney it is absurd my coining paint at this rate i see your game my lad either i am to fall into bad company again or to be split upon and nabbed for that last job to morrow i will be on the road to bathurst i can paint there just as well as here besides i have got my orders from his reverence to go and i'll go he told jane his resolution she made no answer while these two were sitting cozily by the fireside for since robinson took to working hard all day he began to relish the hearth at night suddenly cheerful boisterous voices and mr miles and two friends burst in and would have an extempore supper and nothing else would serve these libertines but mutton chops off the gridiron so they invaded the kitchen out ran jenny to avoid them or put on a smarter cap and robinson was to cut the chops and lay a cloth on the dresser and help cook while his master went off to the cellar the two rakes who remained chattered and laughed both pretty loud they had dined together and the bottle had not stood still i have heard that voice before thought robinson it is a very peculiar voice whose voice is that he looked the gentleman full in the face and could hardly suppress a movement of surprise the gentleman by the instinct of the eye caught his and his attention was suddenly attracted to robinson and from that moment his eye was never off robinson following him everywhere robinson affected not to notice this the chops were grilling jenny came in and bustled about and pretended not to hear the side compliments of the libertines presently the young gentleman with the peculiar voice took out his pocketbook and said i have a bet to propose i'll bet you fifty pounds i find the man you two hunted down the road on monday night no takers replied mr hazeltine with his mouth full stop a bit i don't care if i make a time bet said miles how soon will you bet you catch him in half an hour was the cool reply and the honorable george while making it managed at the same time in a sauntering sort of way to put himself between robinson and the door that led out into the garden robinson eyed him in silence and never moved in half a hour that is a fair bet said mr miles shall i take him better not he is a knowing one he has seen him to earth somewhere or he would not offer you such a bet well i'll bet you five to three proposed the honorable george done done robinson put in a hasty word and what is to become of thimble rig jem sir these words addressed to mr lascelles produced a singular effect that gentleman gave an immediate shiver as if a bullet had passed clean through him and out again then opened his eyes and looked first at one door then at the other as if hesitating which he should go by robinson continued addressing him with marked respect what i mean sir is that there is a government reward of two hundred pounds for thimble rig jem and the police wouldn't like to be drawn away from two hundred pounds after a poor fellow like him you saw on monday night one that is only suspected and no reward offered now jem is a notorious culprit who is this jem my man what is he asked mr lascelles with a composure that contrasted remarkably with his late emotion a convict escaped from norfolk island sir an old offender i fell in with him once he has forgotten me i dare say but i never forget a man they say he has grown a mustache and whiskers and passes himself off for a nob but i could swear to him how by what cried mr miles if he should ever be fool enough to get in my way hang thimble rig jem cried hazeltine is it a bet lascelles what that you nab our one in half an hour mr lascelles affected an aristocratic drawl no i was joking i couldn't afford to leave the fire for thirty pounds why should i run after the poor dayvil find him yourselves he never annoyed me got a cigar miles after their chops etc the rakes went off to finish the night elsewhere there they are gone at last why jenny how pale you look said robinson not seeing the color of his own cheek what is wrong jenny answered by sitting down and bursting out crying tom sat opposite her with his eyes on the ground oh what i have gone through this day cried jenny oh oh oh oh sobbing convulsively what could tom do but console her and she found it so agreeable to be consoled that she prolonged her distress an impressionable bohemian on one side a fireplace and a sweet pretty girl crying on the other what wonder that two o'clock in the morning found this pair sitting on the same side of the fire aforesaid her hand in his the next morning at six o'clock jenny was down to make his breakfast for him before starting if she had said don't go it is to be feared the temptation would have been too strong but she did not she said sorrowfully you are right to leave this town she never explained tom never heard from her own lips how far her suspicions went he was a coward and seeing how shrewd she was was afraid to ask her and she was one of your natural ladies who can leave a thing unsaid out of delicacy tom robinson was what jenny called capital company he had won her admiration by his conversation his stories of life and now and then a song and by his good looks and good nature she disguised her affection admirably until he was in danger and about to leave her and then she betrayed herself if she was fire he was tow at last it came to this don't you cry so dear girl i have got a question to put to you if i come back a better man than i go will you be mrs robinson yes chapter li robinson started for bathurst just before he got clear of the town he passed the poor man's cottage who had lent him the board bless me how came i to forget him said he at that moment the man came out to go to work here i am said robinson meeting him full and here is your board showing it to him painted in squares can't afford to give it you back it is my advertisement but here is half a crown for it and for your trusting me well to be sure cried the man now who'd have thought this why if the world is not turning honest but half a crown is too much 'tain't worth the half of it it was worth five pounds to me i got employment through it look here and he showed him several pounds in silver all this came from your board so take your half crown and my thanks on the head of it the half crown lay in the man's palm he looked in robinson's face well cried he with astonishment you are the honestest man ever i fell in with i am the honestest man you will go to heaven for saying those words to me cried robinson warmly and with agitation good by my good charitable soul you deserve ten times what you have got and robinson made off the other as soon as he recovered the shock shouted after him good by honest man and good luck wherever you go and robinson heard him scuttle about and hastily convene small boys and dispatch them down the road to look at an honest man but the young wood did not kindle at his enthusiasm had the rarity been a bear with a monkey on him well and good i'm pretty well paid for a little honesty thought robinson he stepped gallantly out in high spirits and thought of jenny and fell in love with her and saw in her affection yet another inducement to be honest and industrious nothing of note happened on his way to bathurst except that one day as he was tramping along very hot and thirsty a luscious prickly pear hung over a wall and many a respectable man would have taken it without scruple but tom was so afraid of beginning again he turned his back on it and ran on instead of walking to make sure when he reached bathurst his purse was very low and he had a good many more miles to go and not feeling quite sure of his welcome he did not care to be penniless so he went round the town with his advertising board and very soon was painting doors in bathurst he found the natives stingier here than in sydney and they had a notion a traveler like him ought to work much cheaper than an established man but still he put by something every day he had been three days in the town when a man stepped up to him as he finished a job and asked him to go home with him the man took him to a small but rather neat shop plumber's glazier's and painter's why you don't want me said robinson we are in the same line of business step in said the man in a few words he let robinson know that he had a great bargain to offer him i am going to sell the shop said he it is a business i never much fancied and i had rather sell it to a stranger than to a bathurst man for the trade have offended me there is not a man in the colony can work like you and you may make a little fortune here robinson's eyes sparkled a moment then he replied i am too poor to buy a business what do you want for it only sixty pounds for the articles in the shop and the good will and all well i dare say it is moderate but how am i to find sixty pounds i'll make it as light as a feather five pounds down five pounds in a month after that ten pounds a month till we are clear take possession and sell the goods and work the good will on payment of the first five that is very liberal said robinson well give me till next thursday and i'll bring you the first five oh i can't do that i give you the first offer but into the market it goes this evening and no later i'll call this evening and see if i can do it robinson tried to make up the money but it was not to be done then fell a terrible temptation upon him handling george fielding's letter with his delicate fingers he had satisfied himself there was a bank note in it why not borrow this bank note the shop would soon repay it the idea rushed over him like a flood at the same moment he took fright at it lord help me he ejaculated he rushed to a shop bought two or three sheets of brown paper and a lot of wafers with nimble fingers he put the letter in one parcel that parcel in another that in another and so on till there were a dozen envelopes between him and the irregular loan this done he confided the grand parcel to his landlord give it me when i start he went no more near the little shop till he had made seven pounds then he went the shop and business had been sold just twenty four hours robinson groaned if i had not been so very honest never mind i must take the bitter with the sweet for all that the town became distasteful to him he bought a cheap revolver for there was a talk of bushrangers in the neighborhood and started to walk to george fielding's farm he reached it in the evening there is no george fielding here was the news he left this more than six months ago do you know where he is not i robinson had to ask everybody he met where george fielding was gone to at last by good luck he fell in with george's friend mclaughlan who told him it was twenty five miles off twenty five miles that must be for to morrow then mclaughlan told him he knew george fielding very well he is a fine lad then he asked robinson what was his business robinson took down a very thin light board with ornamented words painted on it that is my business said he at the sight of a real business the worthy scot offered to take care of him for the night and put him on the road to fielding's next morning next morning robinson painted his front door as a return for bed and breakfast mclaughlan gave him somewhat intricate instructions for to morrow's route robinson followed them and soon lost his way he was set right again but lost it again and after a tremendous day's walk made up his mind he should have to camp in the open air and without his supper when he heard a dog baying in the distance there is a house of some kind anyway thought robinson but where i see none better make for the dog he made straight for the sound but still he could not see any house at last however coming over a hill he found a house beneath him and on the other side of this house the dog was howling incessantly robinson came down the hill walked round the house and there sat the dog on the steps well it is you for howling anyway said robinson anybody at home he shouted no one answered and the dog howled on why the place is deserted i think haven't i seen that dog before why it is carlo here carlo poor fellow carlo what is the matter the dog gave a little whimper as robinson stooped and patted him but no sign of positive recognition but he pattered into the house robinson followed him and there he found the man he had come to see stretched on his bed pale and hollow eyed and grisly and looking like a corpse in the fading light robinson was awestruck oh what is this said he have i come all this way to bury him he leaned over and felt his heart it beat feebly but equably and he muttered something unintelligible when robinson touched him then robinson struck a light and right glad he was to find a cauldron full of gelatinized beef soup he warmed some and ate a great supper and carlo sat and whimpered and then wagged his tail and plucked up more and more spirit and finally recognized tom all in a moment somehow and announced the fact by one great disconnected bark and a saltatory motion this done he turned to and also ate a voracious supper robinson rolled himself up in george's great coat and slept like a top on the floor next morning he was waked by a tapping and there was carlo seated bolt upright with his tail beating the floor because george was sitting up in the bed looking about him in a puzzled way jacky said he is that you robinson got up rubbed his eyes and came toward the bed george stared in his face and rubbed his eyes too for he thought he must be under an ocular delusion who are you a friend well i didn't think to see you under a roof of mine again just the welcome i expected thought robinson bitterly he answered coldly well as soon as you are well you can turn me out of your house but i should say you are not strong enough to do it just now no i am weak enough but i am better i could eat something oh you could do that what even if i cooked it here goes then tom lit the fire and warmed some beef soup george ate some but very little however he drank a great jugful of water then dozed and fell into a fine perspiration it was a favorable crisis and from that moment youth and a sound constitution began to pull him through moreover no assassin had been there with his lancet behold the thief turned nurse the next day as he pottered about clearing the room opening or shutting the windows cooking and serving he noticed george's eye following him everywhere with a placid wonder which at last broke into words you take a deal of trouble about me i do was the dry answer it is very good of you but you would as lieve it was anybody else but your other friends have left you to die like a dog said robinson sarcastically well they left you when you were sick i'll leave you when you are well what for seems to me that you have earned a right to stay as long as you are minded the man that stands by me in trouble i won't bid him go when the sun shines again and at this precise point in his sentence without the least warning mr fielding ignited himself and inquired with fury whether it came within robinson's individual experience that george fielding was of an ungrateful turn or whether such was the general voice of fame now don't you get in a rage and burst your boiler said robinson well george without joking though i have been kind to you not for nursing you what christian would not do that for his countryman and his old landlord sick in a desert but what would you think of me if i told you i had come a hundred and sixty miles to bring you a letter i wouldn't show it you before for they say exciting them is bad for fever but i think i may venture now here it is and robinson tore off one by one the twelve envelopes to george's astonishment and curiosity there i don't know the hand said george but opening the inclosure he caught a glance of a hand he did know and let everything else drop on the bed while he held this and gazed at it and the color flushed into his white cheek oh cried he and worshipped it in silence again then opened it and devoured it first came some precious words of affection and encouragement he kissed the letter you are a good fellow to bring me such a treasure and i'll never forget it as long as i live then he went back to the letter there is something about you tom about me she tells me you never had a father not to say a father she says true susan says that is a great disadvantage to any man and so it is and poor fellow what she says they came between your sweetheart and you oh poor tom what you lost your sweetheart no wonder you went astray after that what would become of me if i lost my susan and ay you were always better than me susan she says she and i have never been sore tempted like you bless her little heart for making excuses for a poor fellow but she was always a charitable kind hearted young lady wasn't she tom and what sweet eyes ain't they tom brimful of heaven i call them and when she used to smile on you master george oh the ivories now you take my hand this minute how foolish i am i can't see now you shall read it on to me because you brought it 'and you george that are as honest a man as ever lived do keep him by you a while and keep him in the right way he is well disposed but weak do it to oblige me' will you stay with me tom inquired george cheerful and business like i am not a lucky man but while i have a shilling there's sixpence for the man that brought me this dew in the desert i call it and to think you have seen her since i have how was she looking had she her beautiful color what did she say to you with her own mouth then robinson had to recall every word susan had said to him this done george took the inclosure stop here is something for you 'george fielding is requested to give this to robinson for the use of thomas sinclair' there you are tom well what is the matter nothing it is a name i have not heard a while i did not know any creature but me knew it is it glamour or what why tom what is the matter don't look like that open it and let us see what there is inside robinson opened it and there was the five pound note for him with this line if you have regained the name of sinclair keep it robinson ran out of the house and walked to and fro in a state of exaltation i'm well paid for my journey i'm well paid for not fingering that note who would not be honest if they knew the sweets how could he know my name is he really more than man keep it will i not chapter lii the old attachment was revived robinson had always a great regard for george and after nursing and bringing him through a dangerous illness this feeling doubled and as for george the man who had brought him a letter from susan one hundred and sixty miles became such a benefactor in his eyes that he thought nothing good enough for him in a very few days george was about again and on his pony and he and robinson and carlo went a shepherding one or two bullocks had gone to jericho while george lay ill and the poor fellow's heart was sore when he looked at his diminished substance and lost time robinson threw himself heart and soul into the business and was of great service to george but after a bit he found it a dull life george saw this and said to him you would do better in a town i should be sorry to lose you but if you take my advice you will turn your back on unlucky george and try the paint brush in bathurst for robinson had told him all about it and painted his front door can't afford to part from honesty was the firm reply george breathed again robinson was a great comfort to the weak solitary and now desponding man one day for a change they had a thirty mile walk to see a farmer that had some beasts to sell a great bargain he was going to boil them down if he could not find a customer they found them all just sold just my luck said george they came home another way returning home george was silent and depressed robinson was silent but appeared to be swelling with some grand idea every now and then he shot ahead under its influence when they got home and were seated at supper he suddenly put this question to george did you ever hear of any gold being found in these parts no never what not in any part of the country no never well that is odd i am afraid it is a very bad country for that ay to make it in but not to find it in what do you mean george said the other lowering his voice mysteriously in our walk to day we passed places that brought my heart into my mouth for if this was only california those places would be pockets of gold but you see it is not california but australia where all the world knows there is nothing of what your mind is running on don't say 'knows' say 'thinks' has it ever been searched for gold i'll be bound it has or if not with so many eyes constantly looking on every foot of soil a speck or two would have come to light one would think so but it is astonishing how blind folks are till they are taught how to look and where to look 'tis the mind that sees things george not the eye ah said george with a sigh this chat puts me in mind of 'the grove' do you mind how you used to pester everybody to go out to california yes and i wish we were there now and all your talk used to be gold gold gold as well say it as think it that is true well we shall be very busy all day to morrow but in the afternoon dig for gold an hour or two then you will be satisfied but it is no use digging here it was full five and twenty miles from here the likely looking place then why didn't you stop me at the place why replied robinson sourly because his reverence did so snub me whenever i got upon that favorite topic that i really had got out of the habit i was ashamed to say 'george let us stop on the road and try for gold with our finger nails' i knew i should only get laughed at well said george sarcastically since the gold mine is twenty five miles off and our work is round about the door suppose we pen sheep to morrow and dig for gold when there is nothing better to be done robinson sighed unbucolical to the last degree was the spirit in which our bohemian tended the flocks next morning his thoughts were deeper than the soil and every evening up came the old topic oh how sick george got of it at last one night he said my lad i should like to tell you a story but i suppose i shall make a bungle of it shan't cut the furrow clean i am doubtful never mind try well then once upon a time there was an old chap that had heard or read about treasures being found in odd places a pot full of guineas or something and it took root in his heart till nothing would serve him but he must find a pot of guineas too he used to poke about all the old ruins grubbing away and would have taken up the floor of the church but the churchwardens would not have it one morning he comes down and says to his wife 'it is all right old woman i've found the treasure' 'no have you though' says she 'yes' says he 'leastways it is as good as found it is only waiting till i've had my breakfast and then i'll go out and fetch it in' 'la john but how did you find it' 'it was revealed to me in a dream' says he as grave as a judge 'and where is it' asks the old woman 'under a tree in our own orchard no farther' says he 'oh john how long you are at breakfast to day' up they both got and into the orchard 'now which tree is it under' john he scratches his head 'blest if i know' 'why you old ninny' says the mistress 'didn't you take the trouble to notice' 'that i did' said he 'i saw plain enough which tree it was in my dream but now they muddle it all there are so many of 'em' 'drat your stupid old head' says she 'why didn't you put a nick on the right one at the time' robinson burst out laughing george chuckled oh said he there were a pair of them for wisdom you may take your oath of that 'well' says he 'i must dig till i find the right one' the wife she loses heart at this for there was eighty apple trees and a score of cherry trees 'mind you don't cut the roots' says she and she heaves a sigh john he gives them bad language root and branch 'what signifies cut or no cut the old faggots they don't bear me a bushel of fruit the whole lot they used to bear two sacks apiece in father's time drat 'em' 'well john' says the old woman smoothing him down 'father used to give them a deal of attention' ' 'tain't that 'tain't that' says he quick and spiteful like 'they have got old like ourselves and good for fire wood' out pickax and spade and digs three foot deep round one and finding nothing but mould goes at another makes a little mound all round him too no guinea pot well the village let him dig three or four quiet enough but after that curiosity was awakened and while john was digging and that was all day there was mostly seven or eight watching through the fence and passing jests after a bit a fashion came up of flinging a stone or two at john then john he brought out his gun loaded with dust shot along with his pick and spade and the first stone came he fired sharp in that direction and then loaded again so they took that hint and john dug on in peace till about the fourth sunday and then the parson had a slap at him in church 'folks were not to heap up to themselves treasures on earth' was all his discourse well but said robinson this one was only heaping up mould so it seemed when he had dug the five score holes for no pot of gold didn't come to light then the neighbors called the orchard 'jacobs' folly' his name was jacobs john jacobs 'now then wife' says he 'suppose you and i look out for another village to live in for their gibes are more than i can bear' old woman begins to cry 'been here so long brought me home here john when we were first married john and i was a comely lass and you the smartest young man i ever saw to my fancy any way couldn't sleep or eat my victuals in any house but this' 'oh couldn't ye well then we must stay perhaps it will blow over' 'like everything else john but dear john do ye fill in those holes the young folk come far and wide on sundays to see them' 'wife i haven't the heart' says he 'you see when i was digging for the treasure i was always a going to find it kept my heart up but take out shovel and fill them in i'd as lieve dine off white of egg on a sunday' so for six blessed months the heaps were out in the heat and frost till the end of february and then when the weather broke the old man takes heart and fills them in and the village soon forgot 'jacobs' folly' because it was out of sight comes april and out burst the trees 'wife' says he 'our bloom is richer than i have known it this many a year it is richer than our neighbors'' bloom dies and then out come about a million little green things quite hard ay ay said robinson i see michaelmas day the old trees were staggering and the branches down to the ground with the crop thirty shillings on every tree one with another and so on for the next year and the next sometimes more sometimes less according to the year trees were old and wanted a change his letting in the air to them and turning the subsoil up to the frost and sun had renewed their youth so by that he learned that tillage is the way to get treasure from the earth men are ungrateful at times but the soil is never ungrateful it always makes a return for the pains we give it well george said robinson thank you for your story it is a very good one and after it i'll never dig for gold in a garden but now suppose a bare rock or an old river's bed or a mass of shingles or pipe clay would you dig or manure them for crops why of course not well those are the sort of places in which nature has planted a yellower crop and a richer crop than tillage ever produced and i believe there are plums of gold not thirty miles from here in such spots waiting only to be dug out well tom i have wasted a parable that is all good night i hope to sleep and be ready for a good day's work to morrow you shall dream of digging up gold here if you like i'll never speak of it again said robinson doggedly if you want to make a man a bad companion interdict altogether the topic that happens to interest him robinson ceased to vent his chimera so it swelled and swelled in his heart and he became silent absorbed absent and out of spirits ah thought george poor fellow he is very dull he won't stay beside me much longer this conviction was so strong that he hesitated to close with an advantageous offer that came to him from his friend mr winchester that gentleman had taken a lease of a fine run some thirty miles from george he had written george that he was to go and look at it and if he liked it better than his own he was to take it mr winchester could make no considerable use of either for some time to come george hesitated he felt himself so weak handed with only robinson who might leave him and a shepherd lad he had just hired however his hands were unexpectedly strengthened one day as the two friends were washing a sheep an armed savage suddenly stood before them robinson dropped the sheep and stood on his defense but george cried out no no it is jacky why jacky where on earth have you been and he came warmly toward him jacky fled to a small eminence and made warlike preparations you stop you a good while and i speak who you who am i stupid why who should i be but george fielding i see you one george fielding but i not know you dis george fielding george die i see him die you alive you please you call dog carlo carlo wise dog well i never hie carlo carlo up came carlo full pelt george patted him and carlo wagged his tail and pranced about in the shape of a reaping hook jacky came instantly down showed his ivories and admitted his friend's existence on the word of the dog jacky a good deal glad because you not dead now when black fellow die he never live any more black fellow stupid fellow i tink i like white fellow a good deal bigger than black fellow now i stay with you a good while george's hands thus strengthened he wrote and told mr winchester he would go to the new ground which as far as he could remember was very good and would inspect it and probably make the exchange with thanks it was arranged that in two days' time the three friends should go together inspect the new ground and build a temporary hut there meantime robinson and jacky make great friends robinson showed him one or two sleight of hand tricks that stamped him at once a superior being in jacky's eyes and jacky showed robinson a thing or two he threw his boomerang and made it travel a couple of hundred yards and return and hover over his head like a bird and settle at his feet but he was shy of throwing his spear keep spear for when um angry not throw him straight now don't you believe that tom said george fact is the little varmint can't hit anything with 'em now look at that piece of bark leaning against that tree you don't hit it come try jacky jacky yawned and threw a spear carelessly it went close by but did not hit it didn't i tell you so said george i'd stand before him and his spears all day with nothing but a cricket stump in my hand and never be hit and never brag neither jacky showed his ivories when i down at sydney white man put up a little wood and a bit of white money for jacky then jacky throw straight a good deal now hark to that black skin or white skin 'tis all the same we can't do our best till we are paid for it don't you encourage him tom i won't have it the two started early one fine morning for the new ground distant full thirty miles at first starting robinson was in high glee his nature delighted in change but george was sad and silent three times he had changed his ground and always for the better but to what end these starts in early morning for fresh places used once to make him buoyant but not now all that was over he persisted doggedly and did his best like a man but in his secret heart not one grain of hope was left indeed it was but the other day he had written to susan and told her it was not possible he could make a thousand pounds the difficulties were too many and then his losses had been too great and he told her he felt it was scarcely fair to keep her to her promise you would waste all your youth susan dear waiting for me and he told her how he loved her and never should love another but left her free to add to his troubles he was scarcely well of the fever when he caught a touch of rheumatism and the stalwart young fellow limped along by robinson's side and instead of his distancing jacky as he used in better days jacky rattled on ahead and having got on the trail of an opossum announced his intention of hunting it down and then following the human trail me catch you before the sun go and bring opossum then we eat a good deal and off glided jacky after his opossum the pair plodded and limped on in gloomy silence for at a part of the road where they emerged from green meadows on rocks and broken ground robinson's tongue had suddenly ceased they plodded on one sad and stiff the other thoughtful any one meeting the pair would have pitied them ill success was stamped on them their features were so good their fortunes so unkind their clothes were sadly worn their beards neglected their looks thoughtful and sad the convert to honesty stole more than one look at the noble figure that limped beside him and the handsome face in which gentle uncomplaining sorrow seemed to be a tenant for life and to the credit of our nature be it said that his eyes filled and his heart yearned oh honesty said he you are ill paid here i have been well paid for my little bit of you but here is a life of honesty and a life of ill luck and bitter disappointment poor george poor dear george leave you never while i have hands to work and a brain to devise they now began slowly to mount a gentle slope that ended in a long black snakelike hill when we get to that hill we shall see my new pasture said george new or old i doubt 'twill be all the same and he sighed and relapsed into silence meantime jacky had killed his opossum and was now following their trail at an easy trot leaving the two sad ones with worn clothes and heavy hearts plodding slowly and stiffly up the long rough slope our story runs on before and gains the rocky platform they are making for and looks both ways back toward the sad ones and forward over a grand long sweeping valley this pasture is rich in proportion as it recedes from this huge backbone of rock that comes from the stony mountains and pierces and divides the meadows as a cape the sea in the foreground the grass suffers from its stern neighbor is cut up here and there by the channels of defunct torrents and dotted with fragments of rock some of which seem to have pierced the bosom of the soil from below others have been detached at different epochs from the parent rock and rolled into the valley but these wounds are only discovered on inspection at a general glance from the rocky road into the dale the prospect is large rich and laughing fairer pastures are to be found in that favored land but this sparkles at you like an emerald roughly set and where the backbone of rock gives a sudden twist bursts out all at once broad smiling in your face a land flowing with milk and every bush a thousand nosegays at the angle above mentioned which commanded a double view a man was standing watching some object or objects not visible to his three companions they were working some yards lower down by the side of a rivulet that brawled and bounded down the hill every now and then an inquiry was shouted up to that individual who was evidently a sort of scout or sentinel at last one of the men in the ravine came up and bade the scout go down i'll soon tell you whether we shall have to knock off work and he turned the corner and disappeared he shaded both his eyes with his hands for the sun was glaring about a mile off he saw two men coming slowly up by a zig zag path toward the very point where he stood presently the men stopped and examined the prospect each in his own way the taller one took a wide survey of the low ground and calling his companion to him appeared to point out to him some beauty or peculiarity of the region our scout stepped back and called down to his companions shepherds he then strolled back to his post with no particular anxiety arrived there his uneasiness seemed to revive the shorter of the two strangers had lagged behind his comrade and the watcher observed that he was carrying on a close and earnest inspection of the ground in detail he peered into the hollows and loitered in every ravine this gave singular offense to the keen eye that was now upon him presently he was seen to stop and call his taller companion to him and point with great earnestness first to something at their feet then to the backbone of rocks and it so happened by mere accident that his finger took nearly the direction of the very spot where the observer of all his movements stood the man started back out of sight and called in a low voice to his comrades come here they came straggling up with troubled and lowering faces lie down and watch them said the leader the men stooped and crawled forward to some stunted bushes behind which they lay down and watched in silence the unconscious pair who were now about two furlongs distant the shorter of the two still loitered behind his companion and inspected the ground with particular interest the leader of the band who went by the name of black will muttered a curse upon his inquisitiveness the others assented all but one a huge fellow whom the others addressed as jem nonsense said jem dozens pass this way and are none the wiser ay replied black will with their noses in the air but that is a notice taking fellow look at him with his eyes forever on the rocks or in the gullies or there if he is not picking up a stone and breaking it ha ha laughed jem incredulously how many thousand have picked up stones and broke them and all and never known what we know he has been in the same oven as we retorted the other here one of the others put in his word that is not likely captain but if it is so there are no two ways a secret is no secret if all the world is to know it you remember our oath jem said the leader sternly why should i forget it more than another replied the other angrily have you all your knives asked the captain gloomily the men nodded assent cross them with me as we did when we took our oath first the men stretched out each a brawny arm and a long sharp knife so that all the points came together in a focus and this action suited well with their fierce and animal features their long neglected beards their matted hair and their gleaming eyes it looked the prologue to some deed of blood this done at another word from their ruffianly leader they turned away from the angle in the rock and plunged hastily down the ravine but they had scarcely taken thirty steps when they suddenly disappeared in the neighborhood of the small stream i have mentioned was a cavern of irregular shape that served these men for a habitation and place of concealment nature had not done all the stone was soft and the natural cavity had been enlarged and made a comfortable retreat enough for the hardy men whose home it was a few feet from the mouth of the cave on one side grew a stout bush that added to the shelter and the concealment and on the other the men themselves had placed two or three huge stones which from the attitude the rogues had given them appeared like many others to have rolled thither years ago from the rock above in this retreat the whole band were now silently couched two of them in the mouth of the cave black will and another lying flat on their stomachs watching the angle of the road for the two men who must pass that way and listening for every sound black will was carefully and quietly sharpening his knife on one of the stones and casting back every now and then a meaning glance to his companions the pertinacity with which he held to his idea began to tell on them and they sat in an attitude of sullen and terrible suspicion but jem wore a look of contemptuous incredulity however small a society may be if it is a human one jealousy shall creep in jem grudged black will his captaincy jem was intellectually a bit of a brute he was a stronger man than will and therefore thought it hard that merely because will was a keener spirit will should be over him half an hour passed thus and the two travelers did not make their appearance not even coming this way at all said jem hush replied will sternly hold your tongue they must come this way and they can't be far off jem you can crawl out and see where they are if you are clever enough to keep that great body out of sight jem resented this doubt cast upon his adroitness and crawled out among the bushes he had scarcely got twenty yards when he halted and made a signal that the men were in sight soon afterward he came back with less precaution they are sitting eating their dinner close by just on the sunny side of the rock shepherds as i told you got a dog go yourself if you don't believe me the leader went to the spot and soon after returned and said quietly pals i dare say he is right lie still till they have had their dinner they are going farther no doubt soon after this he gave a hasty signal of silence for george and robinson at that moment came round the corner of the rock and stood on the road not fifty yards above them here they paused as the valley burst on their view and george pointed out its qualities to his comrade it is not first rate tom but there is good grass in patches and plenty of water robinson instead of replying or giving his mind to the prospect said to george why where is he who the man that i saw standing at this corner a while ago he came round this way i'll be sworn he is gone away i suppose i never saw any one for my part i did though gone away how could he go away the road is in sight for miles and not a creature on it he is vanished i don't see him anyway tom of course you don't he is vanished into the bowels of the earth i don't like gentlemen that vanish into the bowels of the earth how suspicious you are bushrangers again i suppose they are always running in your mind them and gold you know the country george here take my stick and he handed george a long stick with a heavy iron ferule if a man is safe here he owes it to himself not to his neighbor then why do you give me your weapon said george with a smile i haven't was the reply i carry my sting out of sight like a humble bee and mr robinson winked mysteriously and the process seemed to relieve his mind and soothe his suspicions he then fell to inspecting the rocks and when george pointed out to him the broad and distant pasture he said in an absent way yes and turning round george found him with his eyes glued to the ground at his feet and his mind in a deep reverie george was vexed and said somewhat warmly why tom the place is worth looking at now we are come to it surely robinson made no direct reply george said he thoughtfully how far have you got toward your thousand pounds oh tom don't ask me don't remind me how can i ever make it no market within a thousand miles of any place in this confounded country forced to boil down sheep into tallow and sell them for the price of a wild duck i have left my susan and i have lost her oh why did you remind me so much for the farming lay don't you be down hearted there's better cards in the pack than the five of spades and the farther i go and the more i see of this country the surer i am there is a good day coming for you and me listen george when i shut my eyes for a moment now where i stand and then open them i'm in california dreaming no wide awake wider than you are now george look at these hills you could not tell them from the golden range of california but that is not all when you look into them you find they are made of the same stuff too granite mica and quartz now don't you be cross no no why should i show me said george trying out of kindheartedness to take an interest in this subject which had so often wearied him well here are two of them that great dark bit out there is mica and all this that runs in a vein like is quartz quartz and mica are the natural home of gold and some gold is to be found at home still but the main of it has been washed out and scattered like seed all over the neighboring clays you see george the world is a thousand times older than most folks think and water has been working upon gold thousands and thousands of years before ever a man stood upon the earth ay or a dog either carlo for as wise as you look squatting out there thinking of nothing and pretending to be thinking of everything well drop gold said george and tell me what this is and he handed robinson a small fossil robinson eyed it with wonder and interest where on earth did you find this hard by what is it plenty of these in california what is it why i'll tell you it is a pale old joey you don't say so looks like a shell sit down a moment george and let us look at it he bids me drop gold and then goes and shows me a proof of gold that never deceived us out there you are mad how can this be a sign of gold i tell you it is a shell and i tell you that where these things are found among mica quartz and granite there gold is to be found if men have the wit the patience and the skill to look for it i can't tell you why the laws of gold puzzle deeper heads than mine but so it is i seem to smell gold all round me here and robinson flushed all over so powerfully did the great idea of gold seated here on his native throne grapple and agitate his mind tom said the other doggedly if there is as much gold on the ground of new south wales as will make me a wedding ring i am a dutchman and he got up calmly and jerked the pale old joey a tremendous way into the valley this action put robinson's blood up george cried he springing up like fire and bringing his foot down sharp upon the rocky floor if i don't stand upon gold i'm d d and a wild but true inspiration seemed to be upon the man a stranger could hardly have helped believing him but george had heard a good deal of this though the mania had never gone quite so far he said quickly come let us go down into the pasture not i replied robinson come george prejudice is for babies experience for men here is an unknown country with all the signs of gold thicker than ever i have got a calabash stay and try for gold in this gully it looks to me just like the mouth of a purse not i i will then why not i don't think you will find anything in it but anyway you will have a better chance when i am not by to spoil you luck is all against me if i want rain comes drought if i want sun look for a deluge if there is money to be made by a thing i'm out of it to be lost i'm in it if i loved a vixen she'd drop into my arms like a medlar i love an angel and that is why i shall never have her never from a game of marbles to the game of life i never had a grain of luck like other people leave me tom and try if you can find gold you will have a chance my poor fellow if unlucky george is not aside you leave you george not if i know it you are to blame if you don't turn your back on me as i did on you in england never i'd rather not find gold than part with honesty there i'm coming let us go quick come let us leave here and the two men left the road and turned their faces and their steps across the ravine during all this dialogue the men in the cave had strained both eyes and ears to comprehend the speakers the distance was too great for them to catch all the words but this much was clear from the first that one of the men wished to stay on the spot for some purpose and the other to go on but presently as the speakers warmed a word traveled down the breeze that made the four ruffians start and turn red with surprise and the next moment darken with anger and apprehension the word came again and again they all heard it its open vowel gave it a sonorous ring it seemed to fly farther than any other word the speaker uttered or perhaps when he came to it he spoke it louder than smaller words or the hearers' ears were watching for it the men interchanged terrible looks and then they grasped their knives and watched their leader's eye for some deadly signal again and again the word g o l d came like an aeolian note into the secret cave and each time eye sought eye and read the unlucky speaker's death warrant there but when george prevailed and the two men started for the valley the men in the cave cast uncertain looks on one another and he we have called jem drew a long breath and said brutally yet with something of satisfaction you have saved your bacon this time the voices now drew near and the men crouched close for george and robinson passed within fifteen yards of them they were talking now about matters connected with george's business for robinson made a violent effort and dropped his favorite theme to oblige his comrade they passed near the cave and presently their backs were turned to it good by my lads whispered jem and curse you for making us lose a good half hour muttered another of the gang the words were scarce out of his mouth before a sudden rustle was heard and there was carlo he had pulled up in mid career and stood transfixed with astonishment literally pointing the gang it was but for a moment he did not like the looks of the men at all he gave a sharp bark that made george and robinson turn quickly round and then he went on hunting a kangaroo shouted robinson it must have got up near that bush come and look if it is we will hunt it down george turned back with him but on reflection he said no tom we have a long road to go let us keep on if you please and they once more turned their backs to the cave whistled carlo and stepped briskly out toward the valley a few yards before them was the brook i have already noticed it was about three yards broad at this spot however robinson who was determined not to make george lose any more time took the lead and giving himself the benefit of a run cleared it like a buck but as he was in the air his eye caught some object on this side the brook and making a little circle on the other side he came back with ludicrous precipitancy and jumping short landed with one foot on shore and one in the stream george burst out laughing do you see this cried robinson yes somebody has been digging a hole here said george very coolly come higher up cried robinson all in a flutter do you see this yes it is another hole 'it is do you see this wet too i see there has been some water spilled by the brook side what kind of work has been done here have they been digging potatoes farmer don't be foolish tom is it any kind of work you know here is another trench dug no it is nothing in my way that is the truth but it is work the signs of which i know as well as you know a plowed field from a turnpike road why what is it then it is gold washing you don't say so tom this is gold washing as beginners practice it in california and mexico and peru and wherever gold dust is found they have been working with a pan they haven't got such a thing as a cradle in this country come lower down this was yesterday's work let us find to day's the two men now ran down the stream busy as dogs hunting an otter a little lower down they found both banks of the stream pitted with holes about two feet deep and the sides drenched with water from it well if it is so you need not look so pale why dear me how pale you are tom you would be pale gasped tom if you could see what a day this is for you and me ay and for all the world old england especially george in a month there will be five thousand men working round this little spot ay come cried he shouting wildly at the top of his voice there is plenty for all gold gold gold i have found it i tom robinson i've found it and i grudge it to no man i a thief that was make a present of it to its rightful owner and that is all the world here gold gold gold though george hardly understood his companion's words he was carried away by the torrent of his enthusiasm and even as robinson spoke his cheeks in turn flushed and his eyes flashed and he grasped his friend's hands warmly and cried gold gold blessings on it if it takes me to susan gold gold the poor fellows' triumph and friendly exultation lasted but a moment the words were scarce out of robinson's mouth when to his surprise george started from him turned very pale but at the same time lifted his iron shod stick high in the air and clinched his teeth with desperate resolution four men with shaggy beards and wild faces and murderous eyes were literally upon them each with a long glittering knife raised in the air at that fearful moment george learned the value of a friend that had seen adventure and crime rapid and fierce and unexpected as the attack was robinson was not caught off his guard his hand went like lightning into his bosom and the assailants in the very act of striking were met in the face by the long glistening barrels of a rifle revolver while the cool wicked eye behind it showed them nothing was to be hoped in that quarter from flurry or haste or indecision the two men nearest the revolver started back the other two neither recoiled nor advanced but merely hung fire george made a movement to throw himself upon them but robinson seized him fiercely by the arm he said steadily but sternly keep cool young man no running among their knives while they are four strike across me and i shall guard you till we have thinned will you said black will here pals the four assailants came together like a fan for a moment and took a whisper from their leader they then spread out like a fan and began to encircle their antagonists so as to attack on both sides at once back to the water george cried robinson quickly to the broad part here robinson calculated that the stream would protect his rear and that safe he was content to wait and profit by the slightest error of his numerous assailants this however was to a certain degree a miscalculation for the huge ruffian we have called jem sprang boldly across the stream higher up and prepared to attack the men behind the moment they should be engaged with his comrades the others no sooner saw him in position than they rushed desperately upon george and robinson in the form of a crescent and as they came on jem came flying knife in hand to plunge it into robinson's back as the front assailants neared them true to his promise robinson fired across george and the outside man received a bullet in his shoulder blade and turning round like a top fell upon his knees unluckily george wasted a blow at this man which sung idly over him he dropping his head and losing his knife and his powers at the very moment by this means robinson the moment he had fired his pistol had no less than three assailants one of these george struck behind the neck so furiously with a back handed stroke of his iron shod stick that he fell senseless at robinson's feet the other met in front by the revolver recoiled but kept robinson at bay while jem sprang on him from the rear this attack was the most dangerous of all in fact neither robinson nor george had time to defend themselves against him even if they had seen him which they did not now as jem was in the very act of making his spring from the other side of the brook a spear glanced like a streak of light past the principal combatants and pierced jem through and through the fleshy part of the thigh and there stood jacky at forty yards' distance with the hand still raised from which the spear had flown and his emu like eye glittering with the light of battle jem instead of bounding clear over the stream fell heavily into the middle of it and lay writhing and floundering at george's mercy who turning in alarm at the sound stood over him with his long deadly staff whirling and swinging round his head in the air while robinson placed one foot firmly on the stunned man's right arm and threatened the leader black will with his pistol and at the same moment with a wild and piercing yell jacky came down in leaps like a kangaroo his tomahawk flourished over his head his features entirely changed and the thirst of blood written upon every inch of him black will was preparing to run away and leave his wounded companions but at sight of the fleet savage he stood still and roared out for mercy quarter quarter cried black will down on your knees cried robinson in a terrible voice the man fell on his knees and in that posture jacky would certainly have knocked out his brains but that robinson pointed the pistol at his head and forbade him and carlo who had arrived hastily at the sound of battle in great excitement but not with clear ideas seeing jacky whom he always looked on as a wild animal opposed in some way to robinson seized him directly by the leg from behind and held him howling in a vise hold your cursed noise all of you roared robinson d'ye ask quarter quarter cried black will quarter gurgled jem quarter echoed more faintly the wounded man the other was insensible then throw me your knives the men hesitated throw me them this instant or they threw down their knives george take them and tie them up in your wipe george took the knives and tied them up now pull that big brute out of the water or he'll drown himself george and jacky pulled jem out of the water with the spear sticking in him the water was discolored with his blood pull the spear out of him george pulled and jem roared with pain but the spear head would not come back through the wound then jacky came up and broke the light shaft off close to the skin and grasping the head drew the remainder through the wound forward and grinned with a sense of superior wisdom by this time the man whom george had felled sat up on his beam ends winking and blinking and confused like a great owl at sunrise then robinson who had never lost his presence of mind and had now recovered his sang froid made all four captives sit around together on the ground in one little lot while i show you the error of your ways said he i could forgive a rascal but i hate a fool you thought to keep such a secret as this all to yourselves you dunces the very birds in the air would carry it it never was kept secret in any land and never will and you would spill blood sooner than your betters should know it ye ninny cumpoops what the worse are you for our knowing it if a thousand knew it to day would that lower the price of gold a penny an ounce no all the harm they could do you would be this that some of them would show you where it lies thickest and then you'd profit by it you had better tie that leg of yours up you have lost blood enough i should say by the look of you haven't you got a wipe here take mine you deserve it don't you no man's luck hurts his neighbor at this work how clever you were you have just pitched on the unlikeliest place in the whole gulley and you wanted to kill the man that would have taught you which are the likelier ones i shall find ten times as much gold before the sun sets as you will find in a week by the side of that stream why it hasn't been running above a thousand years or two i should say by the look of it you have got plenty to learn you bloody minded greenhorns now i'll tell you what it is continued robinson getting angry about it since you are for keeping dark what little you know i'll keep you dark and in ten minutes my pal here and the very nigger shall know more about gold finding than you know so be off for i'm going to work come march where are we to go mate said the leader sullenly do you see that ridge about three miles west well if we catch you on this side of it we will hang you like wild cats on the other side of it do what you like and try all you know but this gully belongs to us now you wanted to take something from us that did not belong to you our blood so now we take something from you that didn't belong to us a minute or two ago come mizzle and no more words or and he pointed the tail of his discourse with his revolver the men rose and with sullen rueful downcast looks moved off in the direction of the boundary but one remained behind the man was jem well captain i wish you would let me join in with you what for well captain you've lent me your wipe and i think a deal of it for it's what i did not deserve but that is not all you are the best man and i like to be under the best man if i must be under anybody robinson hesitated a moment come here said he the man came and fronted him look me in the face now give me your hand quick no thinking about how the man gave him his hand readily robinson looked into his eyes what is your name jem jem we take you on trial jem's late companions who perfectly comprehended what was passing turned and hooted the deserter jem whose ideas of repartee were primitive turned and hooted them in reply while the men were retreating robinson walked thoughtfully with his hands behind him backward and forward like a great admiral on his quarter deck enemy to leeward every eye was upon him and watched him in respectful inquiring silence knowledge is power this was the man now the rest children what tools have you there is a spade and trowel in that bush captain fetch them george hadn't you a pan no captain we used a calabash he will find it lower down george after a little search found all these objects and brought them back now cried robinson these greenhorns have been washing in a stream that runs now but perhaps in the days of noah was not a river at all but you look at the old bed of a stream down out there that was a much stronger stream than this in its day and it ran for more than a hundred thousand years before it dried up how can you tell that said george resuming some of his incredulity look at those monstrous stones in it here there and everywhere it has been a powerful stream to carry such masses with it as that and it has been running many thousand years for see how deep it has eaten into its rocky sides here and there that was a river my lads and washed gold down for hundreds of thousands of years before ever adam stood on the earth the men gave a hurrah and george and jacky prepared to run and find the treasure stop cried robinson you are not at the gold yet can you tell in what parts of the channel it lies thick and where there isn't enough to pay the labor of washing it well i can look at that bend where the round pebbles are collected so there was a strong eddy there well under the ridge of that eddy is ten times as much gold lying as in the level parts stop a bit again do you know how deep or how shallow it lies do you think you can find it by the eye do you know what clays it sinks through as if they were a sieve and what stops it like an iron door your quickest way is to take captain robinson's time and that is now he snatched the spade and giving full vent to the ardor he had so long suppressed with difficulty plunged down a little declivity that led to the ancient stream and drove his spade into its shingle the debris of centuries of centuries george sprang after him his eyes gleaming with hope and agitation the black followed in wonder and excitement and the wounded jem limped last and unable through weakness to work seated himself with glowing eyes upon that ancient river's bank away with all this gravel and shingle these are all newcomers the real bed of the stream is below all this and we must go down to that trowel and spade and tomahawk went furiously to work and soon cleared away the gravel from a surface of three or four feet beneath this they found a bed of gray clay let us wash that captain said jem eagerly no jem was the reply that is the way novices waste their time this gray clay is porous too porous to hold gold we must go deeper tomahawk spade and trowel went furiously to work again give me the spade said george and he dug and shoveled out with herculean strength and amazing ardor his rheumatism was gone and nerves came back from that very hour here is a white clay let me see it pipe clay go no deeper george if you were to dig a hundred feet you would not find an ounce of gold below that george rested on his spade what are we to do then try somewhere else not till we have tried here first but you say there is nothing below this pipe clay no more there is well then but i don't say there is nothing above it well but there is nothing much above it except the gray without 'tis this small streak of brownish clay but that is not an inch thick george in that inch lies all the gold we are likely to find if it is not there we have only to go elsewhere now while i get water you stick your spade in and cut the brown clay away from the white it lies on don't leave a spot of the brown sticking to the white the lower part of the brown clay is the likeliest a shower having fallen the day before robinson found water in a hole not far distant he filled his calabash and returned meantime george and jacky had got together nearly a barrowful of the brown or rather chocolate colored clay mixed slightly with the upper and lower strata the gray and white i want yon calabash and george's as well robinson filled george's calabash two thirds full of the stuff and pouring some water upon it said good naturedly to jem there you may do the first washing if you like thank you captain said jem who proceeded instantly to stir and dissolve the clay and pour it carefully away as it dissolved jacky was sent for more water and this when used as described had left the clay reduced to about one sixth of its original bulk now captain cried jem in great excitement no it's not now captain yet said robinson is that the way you do pan washing he then took the calabash from jem and gave him jacky's calabash two thirds full of clay to treat like the other and this being done he emptied the dry remains of one calabash into the other and gave jem a third lot to treat likewise this done you will observe he had in one calabash the results of three first washings but now he trusted jem no longer he took the calabash and said you look faint you are not fit to work besides you have not got the right twist of the hand yet my lad pour for me george robinson stirred and began to dissolve the three remainders and every now and then with an artful turn of the hand he sent a portion of the muddy liquid out of the vessel at the end of this washing there remained scarce more than a good handful of clay at the bottom more water was poured on this now said robinson we shall know this time and if you see but one spot of yellow among it we are all gentlemen and men of fortune he dissolved the clay and twisted and turned the vessel with great dexterity and presently the whole of the clay was liquefied now said robinson all your eyes upon it and if i spill anything i ought to keep you tell me he said this conceitedly but with evident agitation he was now pouring away the dirty water with the utmost care so that anything however small that might be heavier than clay should remain behind presently he paused and drew a long breath he feared to decide so great a question it was but for a moment he began again to pour the dirty water away very slowly and carefully every eye was diving into the vessel there was a dead silence robinson poured with great care there was now little more than a wine glassful left dead silence suddenly a tremendous cry broke from all these silent figures at the same instant a cry it was a yell i don't know what to compare it to but imagine that a score of wolves had hunted a horse for two centuries up and down round and round sometimes losing a yard sometimes gaining one on him and at last after a thousand disappointments and fierce alternations of hope and despair the horse had suddenly stumbled and the wild gluttons had pounced on him at last such a fierce yell of triumph burst from four human bosoms now hurrah we are the greatest men above ground if a hundred emperors and kings died to day their places could be filled to morrow but the world could not do without us and our find we are gentlemen we are noblemen we are whatever we like to be hurrah cried robinson hurrah cried george i see my susan's eyes in you you beauty hurrah whined jem feebly let me see how much there is and clutching the calabash he fainted at that moment from loss of blood and fell forward insensible his face in the vessel that held the gold and his hands grasping it so tight that great force had to be used to separate them they lifted jem and set him up again and sprinkled water in his face the man's thick lip was cut by the side of the vessel and more than one drop of blood had trickled down its sides and mingled with the gold dust no comment was made on this at the time they were so busy there he's coming to and we've no time to waste in nursing the sick work and they sprang up on to the work again it was not what you have seen pass for work in europe it was men working themselves for once as they make horses work forever work it was battle it was humanity fighting and struggling with nature for her prime treasure so esteemed how they dug and scraped and fought tooth and spade and nail and trowel and tomahawk for gold their shirts were wet through with sweat yet they felt no fatigue their trousers were sheets of clay yet they suffered no sense of dirt the wounded man recovered a portion of his strength and thirsting for gold brought feeble hands but indomitable ardor to the great cause they dug they scraped they bowed their backs and wrought with fury and inspiration unparalleled and when the sun began to decline behind the hills these four human mutes felt injured they lifted their eyes a moment from the ground and cast a fretful look at the great tranquil luminary are you really going to set this afternoon the same as usual when we need your services so would you know why that wolfish yell of triumph would you see what sight so electrified those gloating eyes and panting bosoms would you realize that discovery which in six months peopled that barren spot with thousands of men from all the civilized tribes upon earth and in a few years must and will make despised australia a queen among the nations nations who must and will come with the best thing they have wealth talent cunning song pencil pen tongue arm and lay them all at her feet for this one thing would you behold this great discovery the same in appearance and magnitude as it met the eyes of the first discoverers picked with a knife from the bottom of a calabash separated at last by human art and gravity's great law from the meaner dust it had lurked in for a million years then turn your eyes hither for here it is knife handle drawing chapter liii mr meadows dispatched his work in shropshire twice as fast as he had calculated and returned home with two forces battling inside him love and prudence the battle was decided for him william fielding's honest but awkward interference had raised in susan merton a desire to separate her sentiments from his by showing mr meadows a marked respect she heard of his arrival and instantly sent her father to welcome him home old merton embraced the commission for he happened to need meadows's advice and assistance the speculations into which he had been led by mr clinton after some fluctuations wore a gloomy look which could only be temporary said that gentleman still a great loss would be incurred by selling out of them at a period of depression and mr clinton advised him to borrow a thousand pounds and hold on till things brightened mr meadows smiled grimly as the fly came and buzzed all this in his web dear dear what a pity my money is locked up go to lawyer crawley use my name he won't refuse my friend for i could do him an ill turn if i chose i will you are a true friend you will look in and see us of course market day why not meadows did not resume his visits at grassmere without some twinges of conscience and a prudent resolve not to anchor his happiness upon susan merton that man might come here any day with his thousand pounds and take her from me said he he seems by his letters to be doing well and they say any fool can make money in the colonies well if he comes home respectable and well to do i'll go out if i am not to have the only woman i ever loved or cared for let thousands and thousands of miles of sea lie between me and that pair but still he wheeled about the flame ere long matters took a very different turn the tone of george's letters began to change his repeated losses of bullocks and sheep were all recorded in his letters to susan and these letters were all read with eager anxiety by meadows a day before they reached grassmere the respectable man did not commit this action without some iron passing through his own soul nemo repente turpissimus the first letter he opened it was like picking a lock he writhed and blushed and his uncertain fingers fumbled with another's property as if it had been red hot the next cost him some shame too but the next less and soon these little spasms of conscience began to be lost in the pleasure the letters gave him it is clear he will never make a thousand pounds out there and if he doesn't the old farmer won't give him susan won't he shan't he shall be too deep in my debt to venture on it even if he was minded meadows exulted over the letters and as he exulted they stabbed him for by the side of the records of his ill fortune the exile never failed to pour out his love and confidence in his susan and to acknowledge the receipt of some dear letter from her which meadows could see by george's must have assured him of undiminished or even increased affection thus did sin lead to sin by breaking a seal which was not his and reading letters which were not his meadows filled himself with the warmest hopes of possessing susan one day and got to hate george for the stabs the young man innocently gave him at last he actually looked on george as a sort of dog in the manger who could not make susan happy yet would come between her heart and one who could all weapons seemed lawful against such a mere pest as this a dog in the manger meadows started with nothing better nor worse than a commonplace conscience a vicious habit is an iron that soon sears that sort of article when he had opened and read about four letters his moral nature turned stone blind of one eye and now he was happier on the surface than he had been ever since he fell in love with susan sure now that one day or another she must be his he waited patiently enjoyed her society twice a week got everybody into his power and bided his time and one frightful thing in all this was that his love for susan was not only a strong but in itself a good love i mean it was a love founded on esteem it was a passionate love and yet a profound and tender affection it was the love which under different circumstances has often weaned men ay and women too from a frivolous selfish and sometimes from a vicious life this love meadows thought and hoped would hallow the unlawful means by which he must crown it in fact he was mixing vice and virtue the snow was to whiten the pitch not the pitch blacken the snow thousands had tried this before him and will try it after him oh that i could persuade them to mix fire and gunpowder instead men would bless me for this when all else i have written has been long long forgotten he felt good all over when he sat with susan and thought how his means would enable that angel to satisfy her charitable nature and win the prayers of the poor as well as the admiration of the wealthy if ever a woman was cherished she shall be if ever a woman was happy she shall be and as for him if he had done wrong to win her he would more than compensate it afterward in short he had been for more than twenty years selling buying swapping driving every conceivable earthly bargain so now he was proposing one to heaven at last came a letter in which george told susan of the fatal murrain among his sheep of his fever that had followed immediately of the further losses while he lay ill and concluded by saying that he had no right to tie her to his misfortunes and that he felt it would be more manly to set her free when he read this meadows' exultation broke all bounds ah ha cried he is it come to that at last well he is a fine fellow after all and looks at it the sensible way and if i can do him a good turn in business i always will the next day he called at grassmere susan met him all smiles and was more cheerful than usual the watchful man was delighted come she does not take it to heart he did not guess that susan had cried for hours and hours over the letter and then had sat quietly down and written a letter and begged george to come home and not add separation to their other misfortunes and that it was this decision and having acted upon it that had made her cheerful meadows argued in his own favor and now made sure to win the next week he called three times at grassmere instead of twice and asked himself how much longer he must wait before he should speak out prudence said a little more patience and so he still hid in his bosom the flame that burned him the deeper for this unnatural smothering but he drank deep silent draughts of love and reveled in the bright future of his passion it was no longer hope it was certainty susan liked him her eye brightened at his coming her father was in his power there was nothing between them but the distant shadow of a rival sooner or later she must be his so passed three calm delicious weeks away chapter liv meadows sat one day in his study receiving crawley's report old mr merton came yesterday i made difficulties as instructed is to come to morrow he shall have the eight hundred that makes two thousand four hundred why his whole stock won't cover it no don't understand it it is too deep for me what is the old gentleman doing hunting will o' the wisp throwing it away in speculations that are colored bright for him by a man that wants to ruin him aha cackled crawley and do him no harm augh how far is it to the bottom of the sea sir if you please i'm sure you know mr levi and you crawley said meadows suddenly turning the conversation the world calls me close fisted have you found me so liberal as running water sir i sometimes say how long will this last before such a great man breaks peter crawley and flings him away and takes another and crawley sighed then your game is to make yourself necessary to me i wish i could said peter with mock candor sir he crept on if the most ardent zeal if punctuality secrecy and unscrupulous fidelity hold your gammon are we writing a book together answer me this in english how far dare you go along with me as far as your purse extends only only what only your thermometer is going down already i suppose no sir but what i mean is i shouldn't like to do anything too bad what d'ye mean by too bad punishable by law it is not your conscience you fear then asked the other gloomily oh dear no sir only the law i envy you there is but one crime punishable by law and that i shall never counsel you to only one too deep sir too deep which is that the crime of getting found out what a great man how far would i go with you to the end of the earth i have but one regret sir and what is that that i am not thought worthy of your confidence that after so many years i am still only a too i mean an honored instrument and not a humble friend crawley said meadows solemnly let well alone don't ask my confidence for i am often tempted to give it you and that would be all one as if i put the blade of a razor in your naked hand i don't care sir you are up to some game as deep as a coal pit and i go on working and working all in the dark i'd give anything to be in your confidence anything is nothing put it in figures sneered meadows incredulously i'll give twenty per cent off all you give me if you will let me see the bottom the bottom the reason sir the motive the why the wherefore the what it is all to end in the bottom why not say you would like to read john meadows' heart don't be angry sir it is presumption but i can't help it deduct twenty per cent for so great a honor why the fool is in earnest he is we have all got our little vanity and like to be thought worthy of confidence humph and then i can't sleep for puzzling why should you stop every letter that comes here from australia oh bless me how neglectful i am here is a letter from there just come to think of me bringing it and then forgetting give it me directly there it is and then why on earth are we ruining old mr merton without benefiting you and you seem so friendly with him and indeed you say he is not to be harmed only ruined it makes my head ache why what is the matter mr meadows sir what is wrong no ill news i hope i wish i'd never brought the letter that will do crawley said meadows faintly you may go crawley rose with a puzzled air come here to morrow evening at nine o'clock and you shall have your wish all the worse for you added he moodily all the worse for me now go without one word crawley retired dumfounded he saw the iron man had received some strange unexpected and terrible blow but for a moment awe suppressed curiosity and he went off on tiptoe saying almost in a whisper to morrow night at nine sir meadows spread george's letter on the table and leaned on his two hands over it the letter was written some weeks after the last desponding one it was full of modest but warm and buoyant exultation heaven had been very good to susan and him robinson had discovered gold gold in such abundance and quality as beat even california the thousand pounds so late despaired of was now a certainty six months' work with average good fortune would do it robinson said five thousand apiece was the least they ought to bring home but how could he george wait so long as that would take and susan dear if anything could make this wonderful luck sweeter it is to think that i owe it to you and to your goodness it was you that gave tom the letter and bade me be kind to him and keep him by me for his good he has repaid me by making us two man and wife please god see what a web life is tom and i often talk of this but tom says it is parson eden i have to thank for it and the lessons he learned in the prison but i tell him if he goes so far back as that he should go farther and thank farmer meadows for he it was that sent tom to the prison where he was converted and became as honest a fellow as any in the world and a friend to your george as true as steel the letter concluded as it began with thanks to heaven and bidding susan expect his happy return in six months after this letter in short the letter was one hurrah tempered with simple piety and love meadows turned cold as death in reading it at the part where farmer meadows was referred to as the first link in the golden chain he dashed it to the ground and raised his foot to trample on it but forbore lest he should dirty a thing that must go to susan then he walked the room in great agitation too late george fielding he cried aloud too late i can't shift my heart like a weathercock to suit the changes in your luck you have been feeding me with hopes till i can't live without them i never longed for a thing yet but what i got it and i'll have this though i trample a hundred george fieldings dead on my way to it now let me think he pondered deeply his great brows knitted and lowered for full half an hour invention and resource poured scheme after scheme through that teeming brain and prudence and knowledge of the world sat in severe and cool judgment on each in turn and dismissed the visionary ones at last the deep brow began to relax and the eye to kindle and when he rose to ring the bell his face was a sign post with eureka written on it in nature's vivid handwriting in that hour he had hatched a plot worthy of machiavel a plot complex yet clear a servant girl answered the bell tell david to saddle rachel directly and in five minutes mr meadows with a shirt a razor a comb and a map of australia was galloping by cross lanes to the nearest railway station there he telegraphed mr clinton to meet him at peel's coffee house at two o'clock the message flashed up to town like lightning the man followed it slowly like the wind chapter lv meadows found mr clinton at peel's mr clinton i want a man of intelligence to be at my service for twenty four hours i give you the first offer mr clinton replied that really he had so many irons in the fire that twenty four hours meadows put a fifty pound note on the table will all your irons iron you out fifty pounds as flat as that why hem no nor five come sir sharp is the word can you be my servant for twenty four hours for fifty pounds yes or no why this is dramatic yes it is half past two between this and four o'clock i must buy a few hundred acres in australia a fair bargain humph well that can be done i know an old fellow that has land in every part of the globe take me to him in ten minutes they were in one of those dingy narrow alleys in the city of london that look the abode of decent poverty and they could afford to buy grosvenor square for their stables and mr clinton introduced his friend to a blear eyed merchant in a large room papered with maps the windows were incrusted mustard and cress might have been grown from them beauty in clean linen collar and wristbands would have shown here with intolerable luster but the blear eyed merchant did not come out bright by contrast he had taken the local color you could see him and that was all he was like a partridge in a furrow a snuff colored man coat rusty all but the collar and that greasy poor as its color was his linen had thought it worth emulating blackish nails cotton wipe little bald place on head but didn't shine for the same reason the windows didn't mr clinton approached this dhirrrty money this rusty coin in the spirit of flunkyish sir said he in a low reverential tone this party is disposed to purchase a few hundred acres in the colonies mr rich looked up from his desk and pointed with a sweep of his pen to the walls there are the maps the red crosses are my land they are numbered refer to the margin of map and you will find the acres and the latitude and longitude calculated to a fraction when you have settled in what part of the world you buy come to me again time is gold and the blear eyed merchant wrote and sealed and filed and took no notice of his customers they found red crosses in several of the united states in canada in borneo in nearly all the colonies and as luck would have it they found one small cross within thirty miles of bathurst and the margin described it as five hundred acres mr meadows stepped toward the desk i have found a small property near bathurst bathurst where is that in australia suit if the price suits what is the price sir the books must tell us that mr rich stretched out his arm and seized a ledger and gave it meadows i have but one price for land and that is five per cent profit on my outlay book will tell you what it stands me in you can add five per cent to that and take the land away or leave it with this curt explanation mr rich resumed his work it seems you gave five shillings an acre sir said mr clinton five times five hundred shillings one hundred and twenty five pounds interest at five per cent six pounds five when did i buy it asked mr rich oh when did you buy it sir mr rich snatched the book a little pettishly and gave it to meadows you make the calculation said he the figures are all there come to me when you have made it the land had been bought twenty seven years and some months ago mr meadows made the calculation in a turn of the hand and announced it rich rang a hand bell another snuffy figure with a stoop and a bald head and a pen came through a curtain jones verify that calculation penny halfpenny twopence penny halfpenny twopence mum mum halfpenny wrong sir there is a halfpenny wrong cried mr rich to meadows with a most injured air there is sir said meadows but it is on the right side for you i thought i would make it even money against myself there are only two ways wrong and right was the reply jones make it right there that is the price for the next half hour after business hours to day add a day's interest and jones if he does not buy write your calculation into the book with date save time next customer comes for it you need not trouble mr jones said meadows i take the land here is two hundred and fifty pounds that is rather more than half the purchase money jones count when can i have the deeds ten to morrow receipt for two hundred and fifty pounds said meadows falling into the other's key jones write receipt two five naught write me an agreement to sell proposed meadows no you write it i'll sign it jones enter transaction in the books have you anything to do young gentleman addressing clinton no sir then draw this pen through the two crosses on the map and margin good morning gentlemen and the money making machine rose and dismissed them as he had received them with a short sharp business conge' ye fair who turn a shop head over heels maul sixty yards of ribbon and buy six which being sent home insatiable becomes your desire to change it for other six which you had fairly closely and with all the powers of your mind compared with it during the seventy minutes the purchase occupied let me respectfully inform you that the above business took just eight minutes and that when it was done 'twas done shakespeare you have given too much my friend said mr clinton come to my inn was all the reply this is the easy part the game is behind after dinner now said meadows business do you know any respectable firm disposed toward speculation in mines plenty any that are looking toward gold why no gold is a metal that ranks very low in speculation stop yes i know one tip top house that has gone a little way in it but they have burned their fingers so they will go no farther you are wrong they will be eager to go on first to recover the loss on that article of account and next to show their enemies and in particular such of them as are their friends that they didn't blunder you will go to them to morrow and ask if they can allow you a commission for bringing them an australian settler on whose land gold has been found now my good sir began mr clinton a little superciliously that is not the way to gain the ear of such a firm as that the better way will be for you to show me your whole design and leave me to devise the best means for carrying it into effect up to this moment meadows had treated mr clinton with a marked deference as from yeoman to gentleman the latter therefore was not a little surprised when the other turned sharp on him thus this won't do we must understand one another you think you are the man of talent and i am the clodhopper think so to morrow night but for the next twenty four hours you must keep that notion out of your head or you will bitch my schemes and lose your fifty pounds look here sir you began life with ten thousand pounds you have been all your life trying all you know to double it and where is it the pounds are pence and the pence on the road to farthings i started with a whip and a smock frock and this touching his head and i have fifty thousand pounds in government securities which is the able man of these two the bankrupt that talks like an angel and loses the game or the wise man that quietly wins it and pockets what all the earth are grappling with him for so much for that and now which is master the one who pays or the one who is paid i am not a liberal man sir i am a man that looks at every penny i don't give fifty pounds i sell it that fifty pounds is the price of your vanity for twenty four hours i take a day's loan of it you are paid fifty pounds per diem to see that there is more brains in my little finger than in all your carcass see it for twenty four hours or i won't fork out or don't see it but obey me as if you did see it you shan't utter a syllable or move an inch that i have not set down for you is this too hard then accept ten pounds for to day's work and let us part before you bungle your master's game as you have done your own mr clinton was red with mortified vanity but forty pounds he threw himself back in his chair this is amusing said he well sir i will act as if you were solomon and i nobody of course under these circumstances no responsibility rests with me you are wasting my time with your silly prattle said meadows very sternly man alive you never made fifty pounds cash since you were calved it comes to your hand to day and even then you must chatter and jaw instead of saying yes and closing your fingers on it like a vise yes shouted clinton there take that quire said meadows sharply now i'll dictate the very words you are to say learn them off by heart and don't add a syllable or subtract one or no fifty pounds meadows being a general by nature not horse guards gave clinton instructions down to the minutest matters of detail and he whose life had been spent in proving he would succeed and failing began to suspect the man who had always succeeded might perhaps have had something to do with his success next morning well primed by meadows mr clinton presented himself to messrs brathwaite stevens and requested a private audience he inquired whether they were disposed to allow him a commission if he would introduce them to an australian settler on whose land gold had been discovered the two members of the firm looked at one another after a pause one of them said commission really must depend on how such a thing turned out they had little confidence in such statements but would see the settler and put some questions to him clinton went out and introduced meadows this happened just as meadows had told him it would outside the door mr meadows suddenly put on a rustic carriage and so came in and imitated natural shyness with great skill he had to be twice asked to sit down the firm cross examined him he told them gold had been discovered within a stone's throw of his land thirty miles from bathurst that his friends out there had said go home to england and they will give you a heavy price for your land now that he did hope to get a heavy price and so be able to live at home didn't want to go out there again that the land was worth money for there was no more to be sold in that part government land all round and they wouldn't sell for he had tried them his sharp eye had seen this fact marked on mr rich's map well said the senior partner we have information that gold has been discovered in that district the report came here two days ago by the anne amelia but the account is not distinct as yet we do not hear on whose land it is found if at all i presume you have not seen gold found could i afford to leave my business out there and come home on a speculation the eyes of the firm began to glitter have you got any gold to show us nothing to speak of sir only what they chucked me for giving them a good dinner but they are shoveling it about like grains of wheat i assure you the firm became impatient show us what they gave you as the price of a dinner meadows dug into a deep pocket and chased into a corner and caught and produced a little nugget of quartz and gold worth about four pounds also another of somewhat less value they don't look handsome gents said he but you may see the stuff glitter here and there and here is some of the dust i had to buy this gave them fifty shillings an ounce for it i wish i had bought a hundred weight for they tell me it is worth three pound ten here may we inspect these specimens why not sir i'll trust it with you i wouldn't with everybody though the partners retired with the gold tested it with muriatic acid weighed it and after a short excited interview one of them brought it back and asked with great nonchalance the price of the land meadows hung his head twenty thousand pounds twenty thousand pounds and the partner laughed in his face i don't wonder you are surprised sir i wonder at myself asking so much why before this if you had offered me five thousand i would have jumped into your arms as the saying is but they all say i ought to have twenty thousand and they have talked to me till they make me greedy the partner retired and consulted and the firm ended by offering ten thousand i am right down ashamed to say no was the answer but i suppose i must not take it the firm undertook to prove it was a magnificent offer meadows offered no resistance he thought so too but he must not take it everybody told him it was worth more at last when his hand was on the door they offered him twelve thousand five hundred he begged to consider it no they were peremptory if he was off they were off he looked this way and that way with a frightened air what shall i do sir said he helplessly to clinton and nudged him secretly take it and think yourself very lucky said that gentleman exchanging a glance with the firm well then if you say so i will you shall have it gentlemen five hundred acres in two lots and clinton acting on his secret instructions now sought a private interview with the firm i am to have a commission gentlemen yes fifty pounds but really we can hardly afford it well then as you give me an interest in it i say pin him why don't you see he is one of those soft fellows who listen to everybody if he goes away and they laugh at him for not getting more for it i really could hardly answer for his ever coming back here the firm came in cheerfully well mr mr not mr sir crawley plain john crawley we will terminate this affair with you we will have a contract of sale drawn up and make you an advance when can you give us the title deeds in a couple of hours if the lawyer is at home by the by you will not object to draw upon us at three months for one half of the money no sir i should say by the look of you you were as good as the bank the other half by check in two hours the parties signed the contract respectively then meadows and clinton went off to the five per center completed with him got the title deeds brought them received check and accepted draft clinton by meadows' advice went in and dunned for his commission then and there and got it and the confederates went off and took a hasty dinner together after dinner they settled as you showed me how to get this commission out of them it belongs to you said clinton sorrowfully it does sir give it to me i return it to you sir do me the favor to accept it you are very generous mr meadows and here is the other fifty you have earned thank you my good sir are you satisfied with the day's work amply sir your skill and ingenuity brought us through triumphant said meadows resuming the deferential since he risked nothing by it now well i think i managed it pretty well by the by that gold you showed them was it really gold certainly oh because i thought no sir you did not a man of your ability knows i would not risk ten thousand pounds for want of a purchase i could not lose ten shillings by ore is not a fancy article oh ah yes very true no of course not one question more where did the gold come from california but i mean how did you get it i bought it out of a shop window those two knowing ones pass twice every day of their lives ha ha ha you pass it oftener than that sir excuse me sir i must catch the train but one word before i go my name must never be mentioned in this business very well it never shall transpire upon my honor meadows felt pretty safe as he put on his greatcoat he thought to himself when the story is blown and laughed over this man's vanity will keep my name out of it he won't miss a chance of telling the world how clever he is my game is to pass for honest not for clever no thank you good by sir was his last word it is you for hoodwinking them ha ha ha good by farmer in a patronizing tone soon after this meadows was in a corner of a railway carriage twelve thousand four hundred and fifty pounds in his pocket and the second part of his great complex scheme boiling and bubbling in his massive head there he sat silent as the grave his hat drawn over his powerful brows that were knitted all the journey by one who never knitted them in vain he reached home at eight and sat down to his desk and wrote for more than half an hour then he sealed up the paper and when crawley came he found him walking up and down the room at a silent gesture crawley took a chair and sat quivering with curiosity meadows walked in deep thought you demanded my confidence it is a dangerous secret for once you know it you must serve me with red hot zeal or be my enemy and be crushed out of life like a blind worm or an adder peter crawley i know that dear sir assented peter ruefully first how far have you guessed i guess mr levi is somehow against us he is replied meadows carelessly then that is a bad job he will beat us he is as cunning as a fox meadows looked up contemptuously but as he could not afford to let such a sneak as crawley think him anything short of invincible he said coolly he is and i have measured cunning with a fox you have that must have been a tight match a fox used to take my chickens one hard winter an old fox cautious and sly as the jew you rate so high the men sat up with guns for him no a keeper set traps in a triangle for him no he had the eye of a hawk the ear of a hare and his own nose he would have the chickens and he would not get himself into trouble the women complained to me of the fox i turned a ferret loose into the rabbit hutch and in half a minute there was as nice a young rabbit dead as ever you saw lookee there now cried crawley i choked the ferret off but never touched the rabbit i took the rabbit with a pair of tongs the others had handled their baits and pug crept round 'em and nosed the trick i poured twenty drops of croton oil into the little hole ferret had made in bunny's head and i dropped him in the grass near pug's track next morning rabbit had been drawn about twenty yards and the hole in his head was three times as big pug went the nearest way to blood went in at ferret's hole i knew he would yes sir yes yes yes and there lay the fox no signs of him then i said 'go to the nearest water croton oil makes 'em dry' they went along the brook and on the very bank there lay an old dog fox blown up like bladder as big as a wolf and as dead as a herring now for the jew look at that and he threw him a paper why this is the judgment on which i arrested will fielding and here is the acceptance levi bought them to take the man out of my power he left them with old cohen i have got them again you see and got young fielding in my power spite of his foxy friend capital sir capital cried the admiring crawley he then looked at the reconquered documents ah said he spitefully how i wish i could alter one of these names only one what d'ye mean i mean that i'd give fifty pound if i had it if it was but that brute george fielding that was in our power instead of this fool william meadows opened his eyes why because he put an affront upon me was the somewhat sulky reply what was that oh no matter sir but it is matter tell me i am that man's enemy then i am in luck you are just the enemy i wish him what was the affront he called me a pettifogger oh is that all no he discharged me from visiting his premises that was not very polite and threatened to horsewhip me next time i came there oh is that where the shoe pinches no it is not cried crawley almost in a shriek but he altered his mind and did horsewhip me then and there curse him meadows smiled grimly he saw his advantage crawley said he quickly he shall rue the day he lifted his hand over you you want to see to the bottom of me oh mr meadows that is too far for the naked eye to see was the despondent reply not when it suits my book i am going to keep my promise and show you my heart ah listen and hear the secret of my life are you listening what do you think sir was the tremulous answer i love miss merton and for once his eyes sank before crawley's sir you love a woman not as libertines love nor as boys flirt and pass on heaven have mercy on me i love her with all my heart and soul and brain i love her with more force than such as you can hate the deuce you do i love the sweetheart of the man who lashed you like a dog crawley winced and rubbed his hands and your fortune is made if you help me to win her crawley rubbed his hands old merton has promised the woman i love to this george fielding if he comes back with a thousand pounds don't you be frightened sir that he will never do will he not read this letter ah the letter that put you out so let me see mum mum found gold pheugh pheugh pheeeugh crawley most men reading that letter would have given in then and there and not fought against such luck as this i only said to myself 'then it will cost me ten thousand pounds to win the day' well between yesterday eleven forenoon and this hour i made the ten thousand pounds he told him briefly how beautiful sir what did you make the ten thousand out of your own rival's letter yes i taxed the enemy for the expenses of the war oh mr meadows what a fool what a villain i was to think mr levi was as great a man as you i must have been under a hallucination crawley the day that john and susan meadows walk out of church man and wife i put a thousand pounds into your hand and set you up in any business you like in any honest business for from that day our underhand dealings must end the husband of that angel must never grind the poor or wrong a living creature if heaven consents to my being happy in this way the least i can do is to walk straight and straightforward the rest of my days and i will s'help me god that is fair i knew you were a great man but i had no idea you were such a good one crawley said the other with a sudden gloomy misgiving i am trying to cheat the devil i fear no man can do that and he hung his head no ordinary man sir replied the parasite but your skill has no bounds your plan sir at once that i may co operate and not thwart your great skill through ignorance my plan has two hands one must work here the other a great many miles from here if i could but cut myself in two all would be well but i can't i must be one hand you the other i work thus post office here is under my thumb i stop all letters from him to her presently comes a letter from australia telling among pork grains etc how george fielding has made his fortune and married a girl out there but who is to write the letter can't you guess haven't an idea she won't believe it not at first perhaps but when she gets no more letters from him she will so she will so then you will run him down to her not such a fool she would hate me i shall never mention his name i make one of my tools hang jail over old merton susan thinks george married i strike upon her pique and her father's distress i ask him for his daughter offer to pay my father in law's debts and start him afresh beautiful beautiful susan likes me already i tell her all i suffered silent while she was on with george i press her to be mine she will say no perhaps three or four times but the fifth she will say yes she will you are a great man and she will be happy can't see it a man that marries a virtuous woman and loves her is no man at all if he can't make her love him they can't resist our stronger wills except by flight or by leaning upon another man i'll be back directly mr meadows returned with a bottle of wine and two glasses crawley was surprised this was a beverage he had never seen his friend drink or offer him another thing puzzled him when mr meadows came back with the wine he had not so much color as usual in his face not near so much crawley said meadows in a low voice suppose while i am working this george fielding were to come home with money in both pockets he would kick it all down in a moment i am glad you see that then you see one hand is not enough another must be working far away yes but i don't see you will see drink a glass of wine with me my good friend your health same to you sir is it to your mind elixir this is the stuff that sharpens a chap's wit and puts courage in his heart i brought it for that you and i have no chicken's play on hand another glass success to your scheme sir crawley george fielding must not come back this year with one thousand pounds no he must not thank you sir your health mustn't he shan't but how on earth can you prevent him that paper will prevent him it is a paper of instructions my very brains lie in that paper put it in your pocket in my pocket sir highly honored shall be executed to the letter what wine and this is a check book no is it

that is right where am i going sir what don't you know no nor i don't care so long as it is in your service i go still it is a long journey oh is it your health then and my happy return you are not afraid of the sea or the wind i am afraid of nothing but your wrath and and the law the sea be hanged and the wind be blowed when i see your talent and energy and hold your checkbook in my hand and your instructions in my pocket i feel to play at football with the world when shall i start to morrow morning to night if you like where am i to go to to australia that single word suspended the glass going to crawley's lips and the chuckle coming from them a dead silence on both sides followed it and now two colorless faces looked into one another's eyes across the table chapter lvi three days the gold finders worked alone upon the pre adamite river's bed at evening on the third day they looked up and saw a figure perched watching them with a pipe in its mouth it disappeared in silence next day there were men on their knees beside them digging scraping washing and worshipping gold soon they were the center of a group soon after of a humming mob as if the birds had really carried the secret north south east and west men swarmed and buzzed and settled like locusts on the gold bearing tract they came in panting gleaming dusty and travel stained and flung off their fatigue at sight and running up dived into the gullies and plied spade and pickax with clinched teeth and throbbing hearts they seamed the face of nature for miles turned the streams to get at their beds pounded and crushed the solid rock to squeeze out the subtle stain of gold it held in its veins hacked through the crops as through any other idle impediment pecked and hewed and fought and wrestled with nature for the treasure that lay so near yet in so tight a grip we take off our clothes to sleep and put them on to play at work but these put on their clothes to sleep in and tore them off at peep of day and labor was red hot till night came and cooled it and in this fight lives fell as quickly as in actual war and by the same enemy disease small wonder when hundreds and hundreds wrought the livelong day one half in icy water the other half dripping with sweat men rotted like sheep and died at the feet of that gold whom they stormed here in his fortress and some alas met a worse fate for that befell which the world has seen in every age and land where gold has come to light upon a soil men wrestling fiercely with nature jostled each other cupidity inflamed hate to madness and human blood flowed like water over that yellow dirt and now from this one burning spot gold fever struck inward to the heart of the land burned its veins and maddened its brain the workman sold his tools bought a spade and a pickax and fled to the gold the lawyer flung down his parchment and off to the gold the penny a liner his brass pen and off to a greater wonder than he had ever fabricated the schoolmaster to whom little boys were puzzling out quid non mortalia pectora cogis auri sacra fames made the meaning perfectly clear he dropped ferrule and book and ran with the national hunt for gold shops were closed for want of buyers and sellers the grass crept up between the paving stones in great thoroughfares outward bound ships lay deserted and helpless in the roads the wilderness was peopled and the cities desolate commerce was paralyzed industry contracted the wise and good trembled for the destiny of the people the government trembled for itself idle fear that which shook this colony for a moment settled it as firm as a granite mountain and made it great with a rapidity that would have astounded the puny ages cant appeals to as the days of wonders the sacra fames was not australian but human and so at the first whisper of gold the old nations poured the wealth they valued their food and clothes and silk and coin and the prime treasure they valued not their men into that favored land then did great labor insulted and cheated so many years in narrow overcrowded corners of the huge unpeopled globe lift his bare arm and cry who bids for this and a dozen gloved hands jumped and clutched at the prize and in bargains where a man went on one side and money on the other the money had to say thank you over it instead of the man but still though the average value of labor was now full as high in the cities as in the mine men flowed to the desert and the gold tempted by the enormous prizes there that lay close to all and came to fortune's favorites hence a new wonder a great moral phenomenon the world had never seen before on such a wide scale at a period of unparalleled civilization and refinement society with its artificial habits and its jealous class distinctions on its back took a sudden unprepared leap from the heights it had been centuries constructing into a gold mine it emerged its delicate fabric crushed out of all recognizable shape its petty prides annihilated and even its just distinctions turned topsy turvey for mind is really more honorable than muscle yet when these two met in a gold mine it fared ill with mind classical and mathematical scholars joined their forces with navvies to dig gold and nearly always the scholars were found after a while cooking shoe cleaning and doing generally menial offices for the navvies those who had no learning but had good birth genteel manners and kid gloves and feeble loins sunk lower and became the dregs of gold digging society ere a week's digging had passed over their backs not that all wit yielded to muscle low cunning often held its own hundreds of lazy leeches settled on labor's bare arm and bled it such as could minister to the diggers' physical needs appetites vices had no need to dig they made the diggers work for them and took toll of the precious dust as it fell into their hands one brute that could not spell chicory to save himself from the gallows cleared two thousand pounds a month by selling it and hot water at a pinch a cup thus ran his announcement cofy allus rady meantime trigonometry was frying steaks and on sunday blacking boots after a while lucky diggers returned to the towns clogged with gold and lusting and panting for pleasure they hired carriages and sweethearts and paraded the streets all day crying we be the hairy stocracy now the shopkeepers bowed down and did them homage even here nature had her say the sexes came out the men sat in the carriages in their dirty fustian and their checkered shirts and no jacket their inamoritas beside them glittered in silk and satin and some fiend told these poor women it was genteel to be short sighted so they all bought gold spy glasses and spied without intermission then the old colonial aristocracy who had been born in broadcloth and silk and unlike the new had not been transported but only their papas and mammas were driven to despair but at last they hit upon a remedy they would be distinguished by hook or by crook and the only way left now was always to go on foot so they walked the pavement wet or dry nothing could induce them to enter the door of a carriage item they gave up being shortsighted the few who for reasons distinct from fashion could not resign the habit concealed it as if it was a defect instead of a beauty this struggle of classes in the towns with its hundred and one incidents was an excellent theme for satire of the highest class how has it escaped is it that even satire low and easy art is not so low and easy as detraction but these are the outskirts of a great theme the theme itself belonged not to little satire but to great epic in the sudden return of a society far more complex artificial and conventional than pericles ever dreamed of to elements more primitive than homer had to deal with in this with its novelty and nature and strange contrasts in the old barbaric force and native color of the passions as they burst out undisguised around the gold in the hundred and one personal combats and trials of cunning in a desert peopled and cities thinned by the magic of cupidity in a huge army collected in ten thousand tents not as heretofore by one man's constraining will but each human unit spurred into the crowd by his own heart in the siege of gold defended stoutly by rock and disease in the world wide effect of the discovery the peopling of the earth at last according to heaven's long published and resisted design fate offered poetry a theme broad and high yet piquant and various as the dolphin and the rainbow i cannot sing this song because i am neither lamartine nor hugo nor walter scott i cannot hum this song because the severe conditions of my story forbid me even to make the adventurous attempt i am here to tell not the great tale of gold but the little story of how susan merton was affected thereby yet it shall never be said that my pen passed close to a great man or a great thing without a word of homage and sympathy to set against the sneers of groveling criticasters the blindness of self singing poetasters and the national itch for detraction of all great things and men that live and deification of dead dwarfs god has been bountiful to the human race in this age most bountiful to poets most bountiful to all of us who have a spark of nobleness in ourselves and so can see and revere at sight the truly grand and noble any snob can do this after it has been settled two hundred years by other minds that he is to do it he has given us warlike heroes more than we can count far less honor as they deserve and valor as full of variety as courage in the iliad is monotonous except when it takes to its heels he has given us one hero a better man than hector or achilles for hector ran away from a single man this hero was never known to run away at all achilles was a better egotist than soldier wounded in his personal vanity he revenged himself not on the man who had wronged him prudence forbade but on the army and on his country this antique hero sulked my hero deprived of the highest command retained a higher still the command that places the great of heart above all petty personal feeling he was a soldier and could not look from his tent on battle and not plunge into it what true soldier ever could he was not a greek but a frenchman and could not love himself better than his country above all he was not achilles but canrobert he has given us to see nineveh disinterred by an english hero he has given us to see the northwest passage forced and winter bearded on his everlasting throne by another is it the hero's fault if self and snowdrop singing poetasters cannot see this feat with the eyes of camoens he has given us to see titans enslaved by man steam harnessed to our carriages and ships galvanism tamed into an alphabet a gamut and its metal harp strings stretched across the earth malgre' mountains and the sea and so men's minds defying the twin monsters time and space and now gold revealed in the east and west at once and so mankind now first in earnest peopling the enormous globe yet old women and children of the pen say this is a bad a small a lifeless an unpoetic age and they are not mistaken for they lie as only tooth stoppers retailers of conventional phrases links in the great cuckoo chain universal pill venders satan and ancient booksellers' ancient nameless hacks can lie they lie it is they who are small eyed now as heretofore weaklings cannot rise high enough to take a bird's eye view of their own age and calculate its dimensions the age smaller than epochs to come is a giant compared with the past and full of mighty materials for any great pen in prose or verse my little friends aged nineteen and downward fourscore and upward who have been lending your ears to the stale little cant of every age as chanted in this one by buffo bombastes and other foaming at the pen old women of both sexes take by way of antidote to all that poisonous soul withering drivel ten honest words i say before heaven and earth that the man who could grasp the facts of this day and do an immortal writer's duty by them ie so paint them as a later age will be content to engrave them would be the greatest writer ever lived such is the force weight and number of the grand topics that lie this day on the world's face i say that he who has eyes to see may now see greater and far more poetic things than human eyes have seen since our lord and his apostles and his miracles left the earth it is very hard to write a good book or a good play or to invent a good picture and having invented paint it but it always was hard except to those to whom it was impossible bunglers will not mend matters by blackening the great canvases they can't paint on nor the impotent become males by detraction justice when we write a story or sing a poem of the great nineteenth century there is but one fear not that our theme will be beneath us but we miles below it that we shall lack the comprehensive vision a man must have from heaven to catch the historical the poetic the lasting features of the titan events that stride so swiftly past in this gigantic age chapter lvii the life of george fielding and thomas robinson for months could be composed in a few words tremendous work from sunrise to sundown and on sunday welcome rest a quiet pipe and a book at night they slept in a good tent with carlo at their feet and a little bag between them this bag never left their sight it went out to their work and in to sleep it is dinner time george and tom are snatching a mouthful and a few words over it how much do you think we are tom hush don't speak so loud for heaven's sake he added in a whisper not a penny under seven hundred pounds' worth george sighed it is slower work than i thought but it is my fault i am so unlucky unlucky and we have not been eight months at it but one party near us cleared four thousand pounds at a haul one thousand pounds apiece ah and hundreds have only just been able to keep themselves come you must not grumble we are high above the average george persisted the reason we don't get on is we try for nothing better than dust you know what you told me that the gold was never created in dust but in masses like all metals the dust is only a trifle that has been washed off the bulk then you said we ought to track the gold dust coarser and coarser till we traced the metal to its home in the great rocks ay ay i believe i used to talk so but i am wiser now look here george no doubt the gold was all in block when the world started but how many million years ago was that this is my notion george at the beginning of the world the gold was all solid at the end it is all to be dust now which are we nearer the end or the beginning not knowing can't say tom then i can for his reverence told me we are fifty times nearer the end than the beginning follows there is fifty times as much gold dust in nature as solid gold what a head you ha' got tom but i can't take it up so seems to me this dust is like the grain that is shed from a ripe crop before it comes to the sickle now if we could trace how can you trace syrup to the lump when the lump is all turned to syrup george held his peace shut up but not convinced hallo you two lucky ones cried a voice distant about thirty yards will you buy our hole it is breaking our heart here robinson went up and found a large hole excavated to a great depth it was yielding literally nothing and this determined that paradoxical personage to buy it if it was cheap what there is must be somewhere all in a lump he offered ten pounds for it which was eagerly snapped at well done gardiner said one of the band we would have taken ten shillings for it explained he to robinson robinson paid the money and let himself down into the hole with his spade he drove his spade into the clay and the bottom of it just reached the rock he looked up i would have gone just one foot deeper before i gave in said he he called george come george we can know our fate in ten minutes they shoveled the clay away down to about one inch above the rock and there in the white clay they found a little bit of gold as big as a pin's head we have done it this time cried robinson shave a little more off not too deep and save the clay this time a score of little nuggets came to view sticking in the clay no need for washing they picked them out with their knives the news soon spread and a multitude buzzed round the hole and looked down on the men picking out peas and beans of pure gold with their knives presently a voice cried shame give the men back their hole gammon cried others they paid for a chance and it turned out well a bargain is a bargain gardiner and his mates looked sorrowfully down robinson saw their faces and came out of the hole a moment he took gardiner aside and whispered jump into our hole like lightning it is worth four pound a day god bless you said gardiner he ran and jumped into the hole just as another man was going to take possession by digger's law no party is allowed to occupy two holes all that afternoon there was a mob looking down at george and robinson picking out peas and beans of gold and envy's satanic fire burned many a heart these two were picking up at least a hundred pounds an hour now it happened late in the afternoon that a man of shabby figure evidently not a digger observing that there was always more or less crowd in one place shambled up and looked down with the rest as he looked down george happened to look up the newcomer drew back hastily after that his proceedings were singular he remained in the crowd more than two hours not stationary but winding in and out he listened to everything that was said especially if it was muttered and not spoken out and he peered into every face and peering into every face it befell that at last his eye lighted on one that seemed to fascinate him it belonged to a fellow with a great bull neck and hair and beard flowing all into one a man more like the black maned lion of north africa than anything else but it was not his appearance that fascinated the serpentine one it was the look he cast down upon those two lucky diggers a scowl of tremendous hatred hatred unto death instinct told the serpent there must be more in this than extempore envy he waited and watched and when the black maned one moved away he followed him about everywhere till at last he got him alone then he sidled up and in a cringing way said what luck some men have don't they the man answered by a fierce grunt the serpent was half afraid of him but he went on there will be a good lump of gold in their tent to night the other seemed struck with these words they have been lucky a long time explained the other and now this added well what about it nothing only i wish somebody else had it instead why that is a secret for the present i only tell you because i think somehow they are no friends of yours either perhaps not what then then we might perhaps do business together it will strike you singular but i have a friend who would give money to any one that would take a little from those two say that again would give money to any one that would take it from those two and you won't ask for any share of the swag me i have nothing to do with it gammon well your friend will he not a farthing and what will he give suppose i have a friend that will do the trick according to the risk the man gave a whistle a fellow with forehead villainously low came from behind some tents what is it will asked the newcomer a plant this one in it yes this is too public come to bevan's store chapter lviii george i want you to go to bathurst what for to buy some things what things first of all a revolver there were fellows about our tent last night creeping and prowling i never heard them no more you would an earthquake but i heard them and got up and pointed my revolver at them so then they cut all the better for them we must mind our eye george a good many tents are robbed every week and we are known to have a good swag well i must start this moment if i am to be back and take a pound of dust and buy things that we can sell here to a profit george came back at night looking rather sheep faced tom said he i am afraid i have done wrong you see there was a confounded auction and what with the hammer and the folk bidding and his palaver i could not help it but what is it you have bought a bit o' land tom robinson groaned but recovering himself he said gayly well have you brought it with you no it is not so small as all that as nice a bit of grass as ever you saw tom and just outside the town of bathurat only i didn't ought to have spent your money as well as my own stuff and nonsense i accept the investment let me load your new revolver now look at my day's work i wouldn't take a hundred pound for these little fellows george gloated over the little nuggets for he saw susan's eyes in them to night she seemed so near the little bag was placed between them the day's spoils added to it and the tired friends were soon asleep chapter lix help help murder help murder such were the cries that invaded the sleepers' ears in the middle of the night to which horrible sounds was added the furious barking of carlo the men seized their revolvers and rushed out of the tent at about sixty yards distant they saw a man on the ground struggling under two fellows and still crying though more faintly murder and help they are killing him cried george and robinson and he cocked their revolvers and ran furiously toward the men but these did not wait the attack they started up and off like the wind followed by two shots from robinson that whistled unpleasantly near them have they hurt you my poor fellow said robinson the man only groaned for answer robinson turned his face up in the moonlight and recognized a man to whom he had never spoken but whom his watchful eye had noticed more than once in the mine it was in fact the peddler walker stop george i have seen this face in bad company oh back to our tent for your life and kill any man you see near it they ran back they saw two dark figures melting into the night on the other side the tent they darted in they felt for the bag gone they felt convulsively all round the tent gone with trembling hands robinson struck a light gone the work of months in a moment the hope of a life snatched out of a lover's very hand and held out a mile off again the poor fellows rushed wildly out into the night they saw nothing but the wretched decoy vanishing behind the nearest tents they came into the tent again they sat down and bowed to the blow in silence and looked at one another and their lips quivered and they feared to speak lest they should break into unmanly rage or sorrow so they sat like stone till daybreak and when the first streak of twilight came in george said in a firm whisper take my hand tom before we go to work so the two friends sat hand in hand a minute or two and that hard grip of two workingmen's hands though it was not gently eloquent like beauty's soft expressive palm did yet say many things good for the heart in this bitter hour it said a great calamity has fallen but we do not blame each other as some turn to directly and do it is not your fault george it is not your fault tom it said we were lucky together now we are unlucky together all the more friends we wrought together now we have been wronged together all the more friends with this the sun rose and for the first time they crept to their work instead of springing to it they still found gold in it but not quite so abundant or so large they had raised the cream of it for the thieves moreover a rush had been made to the hole claims measured off actually touching them so they could not follow the gold bearing strata horizontally it belonged to their neighbors they worked in silence they ate their meal in silence but as they rose to work again robinson said very gravely even solemnly george now i know what an honest man feels when he is robbed of the fruits of his work and his self denial and his sobriety if i had known it fifteen years ago i should never have been a what i have been for two months the friends worked stoutly with leaden hearts but did little more than pay their expenses the bag lay between them light as a feather one morning tom said to george george this won't do i am going prospecting moore will lend me his horse for a day that day george worked alone robinson rode all over the country with a tin pan at his back and tested all the places that seemed likely to his experienced eye at night he returned to their tent george was just lying down no sleep to night george said he instinctively lowering his voice to a whisper i have found surface gold ten miles to the southward well we will go to it to morrow what by daylight watched as we are we the two lucky ones said robinson bitterly no wait till the coast is clear then strike tent and away at midnight they stole out of the camp by peep of day they were in a little dell with a brook running at the bottom of it now george listen to me here is ten thousand pounds if we could keep this gully and the creek a fortnight to ourselves oh tom and we will nobody will find us here it is like a box robinson smiled sadly the men drove their spades in close to the little hole which robinson had made prospecting yesterday and the very first cradleful yielded an ounce of gold dust extremely small and pure they found it diffused with wonderful regularity within a few inches of the surface here for the first time george saw gold dust so plentiful as to be visible when a spadeful of the clay was turned up it glittered all over when they tore up the grass which was green as an emerald specks of bright gold came up clinging to the roots they fell like spaded tigers on the prey what are you doing george going to light a fire for dinner we must eat i suppose though i do grudge the time we must eat but not hot why not because if you light a fire the smoke will be seen miles off and half the diggings will be down upon us i have brought three days' cold meat here it is will this be enough asked george simply his mouth full yes it will be enough replied the other bitterly do you hear that bird george they call him a leather head what is he singing george laughed seems to me he is saying 'off we go' 'off we go' 'off we go' that is it and look now off he is gone and what is more he has gone to tell all the world he saw two men pick up gold like beans work cried george that night the little bag felt twice as heavy as last night and susan seemed nearer than for many a day these two worked for their lives they counted each minute and george was a goliath the soil flew round him like the dust about a wmnnowing machine he was working for susan robinson wasted two seconds admiring him well said he gold puts us all on our mettle but you beat all i ever saw you are a man it was the morning of the third day and the friends were filling the little bag fast and at breakfast george quizzed robinson's late fears the leather head didn't tell anybody for here we are all alone robinson laughed but we should not have been if i had let you light a fire however i really begin to hope now they will let us alone till we have cleared out the gully hallo what is the matter look there george what is it smoke rising down the valley we are done didn't i tell you don't say so tom why it is only smoke and five miles off what signifies what it is or where it is it is on the road to us i hope better what is the use of hoping nonsense was it there yesterday well then don't you be faint hearted said george we are not caught yet i wonder whether susan would say it was a sin to try and mislead them a sin i wish i knew how i'd soon see that was a good notion this place is five hundred pound a day to us we must keep it to day by hook or by crook come with me quick bring your tools and the bag george followed robinson in utter ignorance of his design that worthy made his way as fast as he could toward the smoke when they got within a mile of it the valley widened and the smoke was seen rising from the side of the stream concealing themselves they saw two men beating the ground on each side like pointers robinson drew back they are hunting up the stream said he it is there we must put the stopper on them they made eastward for the stream which they had left come said robinson here is a spot that looks likely to a novice dig and cut it up all you can george was mystified but obeyed and soon the place looked as if men had been at work on it some time then robinson took out a handful of gold dust and coolly scattered it over a large heap of mould what are you at are you mad tom why there goes five pounds what a sin did you never hear of the man that flung away a sprat to catch a whale now turn back to our hole stop leave your pickax then they will think we are coming back to work in little more than half an hour they were in their little gully working like mad they ate their dinner working at five o'clock george pointed out to robinson no less than seven distinct columns of smoke rising about a mile apart all down the valley ay said robinson those six smokes are hunting the smoke that is hunting us but we have screwed another day out just as the sun was setting a man came into the gully with a pickax on his shoulder ah how d'ye do said robinson in a mock friendly accent we have been expecting you thank you for bringing us our pickax the man gave a sort of rueful laugh and came and delivered the pick and coolly watched the cradle why don't you ask what you want to know said robinson the man sneered is that the way to get the truth from a digger said he it is from me and the only one oh then what are you doing mate about ten ounces of gold per hour the man's mouth and eyes both opened come my lad said robinson good naturedly of course i am not glad you have found us but since you are come call your pals light fires and work all night to morrow it will be too late the man whistled he was soon joined by two more and afterward by others the whole party was eight a hurried conference took place and presently the captain whose name was ede came up to robinson with a small barrel of beer and begged him and his pal to drink as much as they liked they were very glad of the draught and thanked the men warmly the newcomers took robinson's advice lighted large fires divided their company and groped for gold every now and then came a shout of joy and in the light of the fires the wild figures showed red as blood against the black wall of night and their excited eyes glowed like carbuncles as they clawed the sparkling dust george and robinson fatigued already by a long day broke down about three in the morning they reeled into their tent dug a hole put in their gold bag stamped it down tumbled dead asleep down over it and never woke till morn gn l r r r gn l r r r what is the matter carlo gn l r r r hum hum hum crash crash at these sounds robinson lifted up the corner of his tent the gully was a digging he ran out to see where he was to work and found the whole soil one enormous tan yard the pits ten feet square and so close there was hardly room to walk to your hole without tumbling into your neighbor's you had to balance yourself like boys going along a beam in a timber yard in one of these he found ede and his gang working mr ede had acquired a black eye ditto one of his mates good morning captain robinson said this personage with a general gayety of countenance that contrasted most drolly with the mourning an expressive organ had gone into well was i right asked robinson looking ruefully round the crowded digging you were captain robinson and thank you for last night well you have picked up my name somehow now just tell me how you picked up something else how did you suspect us in this retired spot we were working just clear of the great digging by the side of the creek and doing no good when your cork came down my cork cork out of your bottle i had no bottle oh yes my pal had a bottle of small beer ay he must have thrown it into the creek for a cork came down to us then i looked at it and i said 'here is a cork from moore's store there is a party working up stream by this cork' robinson gave a little groan we are never to be at the bottom of gold digging said he so we came up the stream and tried several places as we came but found nothing at last we came to your pickax and signs of work so my lads would stay and work there and i let them an hour or two and then i said 'come now lads the party we are after is higher up' now how could you pretend to know that inquired robinson with curiosity easy enough the water came down to us thick and muddyish so i knew you were washing up stream confound my stupid head cried robinson i deserve to have it cut off after all my experience and he actually capered with vexation the best may make a mistake said the other soothingly well captain you did us a good turn last night so here is your claim we put your pal's pick in it here close to us oh there was a lot that made difficulties but we over persuaded them indeed how gave them a hiding and promised to knock out any one's brains that went into it oh kindness begets kindness even in a gold mine it does cried robinson and the proof is that i give you the claim here come this way and seem to buy it of me all their eyes are upon us now split your gang and four take my claim well that is good of you but what will you do captain where shall you go and his eyes betrayed his curiosity humph well i will tell you on condition that you don't bring two thousand after me again you should look behind you as well as before stupid these terms agreed to robinson let ede know that he was going this moment back to the old digging the other was greatly surprised robinson then explained that in the old digging gold lay at various depths and was inexhaustible that this afternoon there would be a rush made from it to robinson's gully so the spot where they stood was already called that thousands of good claims would thus by diggers' law be vacated and that he should take the best before the rush came back which would be immediately since robinson's gully would be emptied of its gold in four hours so clear out your two claims said he it won't take you two hours all the gold lies in one streak four inches deep then back after me i'll give you the office i'll mark you down a good claim mr ede who was not used to this sort of thing since he fought for gold wore a ludicrous expression of surprise and gratitude robinson read it and grinned superior but the look rendered words needless so he turned the conversation how did you get your black eye oh didn't i tell you fighting with the blackguards for your claim it was now robinson's turn to be touched you are a good fellow you and i must be friends ah if i could but get together about forty decent men like you and that had got gold to lose well said ede why not here are eight that have got gold to lose thanks to you and your own lot that makes ten we could easy make up forty for any good lay there is my hand for one what is it robinson took ede's hand with a haste and an energy that almost startled him and his features darkened with an expression unusual now to his good natured face to put down thieving in the camp said he sternly ah said the other half sadly the desirableness of this had occurred to him before now but how are we to do that asked he incredulously the camp is choke full of them robinson looked blacker uglier and more in earnest so was his answer when it came make stealing death by the law the law what law lynch chapter lx about a fortnight after robinson's return to the diggings two men were seated in a small room at bevan's store there was little risk of their being interrupted by any honest digger for it was the middle of the day i know that well enough growled the black maned one everybody knows the lucky rip has got a heavier swag than ever but we shan't get it so cheap if we do at all why not he is on his guard now night and day and what is more he has got friends in the mine that would hang me or you either up to dry if they but caught us looking too near his tent the ruffians well but if he has friends he has enemies not so many none that i know of but you and me i wonder what he has done to you the other waived this question and replied i have found two parties that hate him two that came in last week have you then if you are in earnest make me acquainted with them for i am weak handed i lost one of my pals yesterday indeed how they caught him at work and gave him a rap over the head with a spade the more fool he for being caught here is to his memory ugh what is he is he dead as a herring where shall we all go to what lawless fellows these diggers are i will bring you the men for the last two months the serpentine man had wound in and out the camp poking about for a villain of the darker sort as minutely as diogenes did for an honest man and dispensing liquor and watching looks and words he found rogues galore and envious spirits that wished the friends ill but none of them seemed game to risk their lives against two men one of whom said openly he would kill any stranger he caught in his tent and whom some fifty stout fellows called captain robinson and were ready to take up his quarrel like fire but at last he fell in with two old lags who had a deadly grudge against the captain and a sovereign contempt for him into the bargain by the aid of liquor he wormed out their story this was the marrow of it the captain had been their pal and while they were all three cracking a crib had with unexampled treachery betrayed them and got them laid by the heels for nearly a year in fact if they had not broken prison they would not have been here now in short in less than half an hour he returned with our old acquaintances brutus and mephistopheles these two came half reluctant suspicious and reserved but at sight of black will they were reassured villain was so stamped on him with instantaneous sympathy and an instinct of confidence the three compared notes and showed how each had been aggrieved by the common enemy next they held a council of war the grand object of which was to hit upon some plan of robbing the friends of their new swag it was a difficult and very dangerous job plans were proposed and rejected and nothing agreed upon but this that the men should be carefully watched for days to find out where they kept their gold at night and where by day and an attempt timed and regulated accordingly moreover the same afternoon a special gang of six was formed including walker which pitiful fox was greatly patronized by the black maned lion at sight of him brutus who knew him not indeed by name but by a literary transaction was for laying on but his patron interposed and having inquired and heard the offense bellowed with laughter and condemned the ex peddler to a fine of half a crown in grog this softened brutus and a harmonious debauch succeeded like the old egyptians they debated first sober and then drunk and to stagger my general notion that the ancients were unwise candor compels me to own it was while stammering maudling stinking and in every sense drunk that mephistopheles driveled out a scheme so cunning and so new as threw everybody and everything into the shade it was carried by hiccoughation to work this scheme mephistopheles required a beautiful large new tent the serpentine man bought it money to feed the gang serpent advanced it robinson's tent was about thirty yards from his claim which its one opening faced so he and george worked with an eye ever upon their tent at night two men of robinson's party patrolled armed to the teeth they relieved guard every two hours captain robinson's orders to these men if they saw anybody doing anything suspicious after dark were these first fire then inquire this general order was matter of publicity for a quarter of a mile round robinson's tent and added to his popularity and our rascals' perplexities these orders had surely the double merit of conciseness and melody well for all that they were disgustingly offensive to one true friend of the captain viz to george fielding what is all the gold in the world compared with a man's life said he indignantly an ounce of it is worth half a dozen such lives as some here was the cool reply i have heard you talk very different i mind when you could make excuses even for thieves that were never taught any better poor unfortunate souls did i said the captain a little taken aback well perhaps i did it was natural hem under the circumstances no not for such thieves as these that haven't got any honor at all honor eh yes honor look here suppose in my unconverted days i had broke into a jeweler's shop that comes nearest to a mine with four or five pals do you think i should have held it lawful to rob my pals of any part of the swag just because we happened to be robbing a silversmith certainly not i assure you george the punishment of such a nasty sneaking dishonorable act would be death in every gang and cheap too well we have broken into nature's shop here and we are to rifle her and not turn to like unnatural monsters and rob our ten thousand pals thieving is thieving in my view was the prejudiced reply and hanging is hanging as all thieves shall find if caught convenient you make my flesh creep tom i liked you better when you were not so great a man more humble like have you forgotten when you had to make excuses for yourself then you had susan on your side and brought me round for i was bitter against theft but never so bad as you are now oh never mind what i said in those days why you must be well aware i did not know what i was talking about i had been a rogue and a fool and i talked like both but now i am a man of property and my eyes are open and my conscience revolts against theft and the gallows is the finest institution going and next to that comes a jolly good prison i wish there was one in this mine as big as pentonville then property here the dialogue was closed by the demand the pick made upon the man of property's breath but it rankled and on laying down the pick he burst out well to think of an honest man like you having a word to say for thieving why it is a despicable trait in a gold mine i'll go farther i'll prove it is the sin of sins all round the world stolen money never thrives goes for drink and nonsense now you pick and i'll wash theft corrupts the man that is robbed as well as the thief drives him to despair and drink and ruin temporal and eternal no country could stand half an hour without law the very honest would turn thieves if not protected and there would be a go besides this great crime is like a trunk railway other little crimes run into it and out of it lies buzz about it like these australian flies drat you drunkenness precedes and follows it and perjury rushes to its defense well tom you are a beautiful speaker i haven't done yet what wonder it degrades a man when a dog loses his dignity under it behold the dog who has stolen look at carlo yesterday when he demeaned himself to prig jem's dinner the sly brute won't look at ours how mean he cut with his tail under his belly instead of turning out to meet folk all jolly and waggle um tail um as on other occasions hallo you sir what are you doing so near our tent and up jumped the man of property and ran cocking a revolver to a party who was kneeling close to the friends' tent the man looked up coolly he was on his knees we are newly arrived and just going to pitch and a digger told us we must not come within thirty yards of the captain's tent so we are measuring the distance well measure it and keep it robinson stayed by his tent till the man whose face was strange to him had measured and marked the ground soon after the tent in question was pitched and it looked so large and new that the man of property's suspicions were lulled it is all right said he tent is worth twenty pounds at the lowest farthing while black will and his gang were scheming to get the friends' gold robinson though conscious only of his general danger grew more and more nervous as the bag grew heavier and strengthened his defenses every day this very day one was added to the cause of order in a very characteristic way i must first observe that mr mclaughlan had become george's bailiff that is on discovery of the gold he had agreed to incorporate george's flocks to use his ground and to account to him sharing the profits and george running the risks george had however encumbered the property with abner as herdsman that worthy had come whining to him lame of one leg from a blow on the head which he convinced george jacky had given him with his battle ax i'm spoiled for life and by your savage i have lost my place do something for me good hearted george did as related and moreover promised to give jacky a hiding if ever he caught him again george's aversion to bloodshed is matter of history it was also his creed that a good hiding did nobody any harm now it was sheep shearing time and mclaughlan was short of hands he came into the mine to see whether out of so many thousands he could not find four or five who would shear instead of digging when he put the question to george george shook his head doubtfully however said he look out for some unlucky ones that is your best chance leastways your only one so mclaughlan went cannily about listening here and there to the men who were now at their dinners and he found ede's gang grumbling and growling with their mouths full in short enjoying at the same time a good dinner and an englishman's grace this will do thought the scot misled like continental nations by that little trait of ours he opened the ball i'm saying my lads will ye gie ower this weary warrk a wee whilee and sheer a wheen sheep to me the men looked in his face then at one another and the proposal struck them as singularly droll they burst out laughing in his face mclaughlan keeping his temper thoroughly but not without a severe struggle oh fine i ken i'll ha'e to pay a maist deevelich price for your highnesses aweel i'se pay aw thing has its price jaast name your wage for shearing five hunder sheep the men whispered together the scot congratulated himself on his success it would be a question of price after all we will do it for the wool th' 'oo oo ay but hoo muckle o' th' 'oo for ye ken how muckle why all a' the 'oo ye blackguard ye're no blate keep your temper farmer it is not worth our while to shear sheep for less than that de'il go wi' ye then and he moved off in great dudgeon stop cried the captain you and i are acquainted you lived out wellington way me and another wandered to your hut one day and you gave us our supper ay lad i mind o' ye the noo the jolliest supper ever i had a haggis you called it ay did i my fine lad i cookit it till ye myssel ye meicht help me for ane i will said captain ede and a conference took place in a whisper between him and his men it is a' reicht the noo thought mclaughlan we have an offer to make you said ede respectfully let us hear't our party is large we want a cook for it and we offer you the place in return for past kindness me a cuik y' impudent vagabond cried the caledonian red as a turkey cock and if a look could have crushed a party of eight their hole had been their grave mclaughlan took seven ireful steps wide ones then his hot anger assumed a cold sardonic form he returned and with blighting satire speered this question by way of gratifying an ironical curiosity an' whaat would ye ha'e the cheek t'offer a mclanghlan to cuik till ye you that kens sae fine the price o' wark thirty shillings thretty shilling the week for a mclaughlan the week cried ede nonsense thirty shillings a day of course we sell work for gold sir and we give gold for it look here and he suddenly bared a sturdy brown arm and smacking it cried that is dirt where you come from but it is gold here ye're a fine lad said the scot smoothly and ye've a boeny aerm added he looking down at it i'se no deny that i'm thinking i'll just come and cuik till ye a wee for auld lang syne thretty schelln the day an' ye'll buy the flesh o' me i'll sell it a hantle cheaper than thir warldly minded fleshers bref he came to be shorn and remained to fleece he went and told george what he had done hech hech whined he thir's a maist awfu' come doon for the mclaughlans but wha wadna' stuip to lift gowd he left his head man a countryman of his own in charge of the flocks and tarried in the mine he gave great satisfaction except that he used to make his masters wait for dinner while he pronounced a thundering long benediction but his cookery compensated the delay robinson enrolled him in his police and it was the fashion openly to quiz and secretly respect him robinson also made friends with the women in particular with one mary mcdogherty wife of a very unsuccessful digger many a pound of potatoes pat and she had from the captain and this getting wind secured the good will of the irish boys chapter lxi george was very homesick haven't we got a thousand pounds apiece yet hush no not quite but too much to bawl about and we never shall till you take my advice and trace the gold to its home in the high rocks here we are plodding for dust and one good nugget would make us well well said robinson the moment the dry weather goes you shall show me the home of the gold poor george and his nuggets that is a bargain said george and now i have something more to say why keep so much gold in our tent it makes me fret i am for selling some of it to mr levi what at three pounds the ounce not if i know it then why not leave it with him to keep because it is safer in its little hole in our tent what do the diggers care for mr levi you and i respect him but i am the man they swear by no george tom weasel isn't caught napping twice in the same year don't you see i've been working this four months past to make my tent safe and i've done it it is watched for me night and day and if our swag was in the bank of england it wouldn't be safer than it is put that in your pipe well carlo what is the news in your part carlo came running up to george and licked his face which just rose above the hole what is it carlo asked george in some astonishment ha ha laughed the other here is the very dog come out to encourage his faint hearted master no said george it can't be that he means something be quiet carlo licking me to pieces but what it is heaven only knows don't you encourage him he has no business out of the tent go back carlo go into kennel sir and off slunk carlo back into the tent of which he was the day sentinel tom remarked george thoughtfully i believe carlo wanted to show me something he is a wonderful wise dog nonsense cried robinson sharply he heard you at the old lay grumbling and came to say cheer up old fellow while robinson was thus quizzing george a tremendous noise was suddenly heard in their tent a scuffle a fierce muffled snarl and a human yell with a cry almost as loud the men bounded out of their hole and the blood running like melting ice down their backs with apprehension burst into the tent then they came upon a sight that almost drew the eyes out of their heads in the center of the tent not six inches from their buried treasure was the head of a man emerging from the bowels of the earth and cursing and yelling for carlo had seized his head by the nape of the neck and bitten it so deep that the blood literally squirted and was stamping and going back snarling and pulling and hauling in fierce jerks to extract it from the earth while the burly headed ruffian it belonged to cramped by his situation and pounced on unawares by the fiery teeth was striving and battling to get down into the earth again spite of his disadvantage such were his strength and despair that he now swung the dog backward and forward but the men burst in george seized him by the hair of his head tom by the shoulder and with carlo's help wrenched him on to the floor of the tent where he was flung on his back with tom's revolver at his temple and carlo flew round and round barking furiously and now and then coming flying at him on which occasions he was always warded off by george's strong arm and passed devious his teeth clicking together like machinery the snap and the rush being all one design that must succeed or fail together captain robinson put his lips to his whistle and the tent was full of his friends in a moment get me a bullock rope ay and drive a stout pole into the ground ay in less than five minutes brutus was tied up to a post in the sun with a placard on his breast on which was written in enormous letters thief and underneath in smaller letters caught trying to shake captain robinson's tent first offense n b to be hanged next time then a crier was sent through the mine to invite inspection of brutus's features and ere sunset thousands looked into his face and when he tried to lower it pulled it savagely up i shall know you again my lad was the common remark and if i catch you too near my tent rope or revolver one of the two captain robinson's men did not waste five minutes with brutus they tied him to the stake and dashed into their holes to make up lost time but robinson and george remained quiet in their tent george said tom in a low contrite humble voice let us return thanks to heaven for vain is man's skill and they did george said tom rising from his knees the conceit is taken out of me for about the twentieth time i felt so strong and i was nobody the danger came in a way i never dreamed and when it had come we were saved by a friend i never valued give a paw carlo carlo gave a paw he has been a good friend to us this day said george i see it all now he must have heard the earth move and did not understand it so he came for me and when you would not let me go he went back and says he 'i dare to say it is a rabbit burrowing up' so he waited still as death watching and nailed six feet of vermin instead of bunny here they both fell to caressing carlo who jumped and barked and finished with a pretended onslaught on the captain as he was kneeling looking at their so late imperiled gold and knocked him over and slobbered his face when he was down opinions varied but the impression was he knew he had been a clever dog this same evening jem made a collar for him on which was written policeman c the fine new tent was entered and found deserted nothing there but an enormous mound of earth that came out of the subterranean which robinson got a light and inspected all the way to its debouchure in his own tent as he returned holding up his light and peering about he noticed something glitter at the top of the arch he held the light close to it and saw a speck or two of gold sparkling here and there he took out his knife and scraped the roof in places and brought to light in detached pieces a layer of gold dust about the substance of a sheet of blotting paper and full three yards wide it crossed the subterranean at right angles dipping apparently about an inch in two yards the conduct of brutus and co had been typical they had been so bent on theft that they were blind to the pocketfuls of honest safe easy gold they rubbed their very eyes and their thick skulls against on their subterraneous path to danger and crime two courses occurred to robinson one was to try and monopolize this vein of gold the other to take his share of it and make the rest add to his popularity and influence in the mine he chose the latter for the bumptiousness was chilled in him this second attack on his tent made him tremble i am a marked man said he well if i have enemies the more need to get friends all round me i must here observe that many men failed altogether at the gold diggings and returned in rags and tatters to the towns many others found a little enough to live like a gentleman anywhere else but too little for bare existence in a place where an egg cost a shilling a cabbage a shilling and baking two pounds of beef one shilling and sixpence and a pair of mining boots eight pounds and a frying pan thirty shillings and so on besides the hundreds that fell by diarrhea their hands clutching in vain the gold that could not follow them many a poor fellow died of a broken heart and hardships suffered in vain and some long unlucky but persevering suddenly surprised by a rich find of gold fell by the shock of good fortune went raving mad dazzled by the gold and perished miserably for here all was on a great heroic scale starvation wealth industry crime retribution madness and disease now the good natured captain had his eye upon four unlucky men at this identical moment no mr miles his old master who having run through his means had come to the diggings he had joined a gang of five they made only about three pounds a week each and had expelled him alleging that his work was not quite up to their mark he was left without a mate and earned a precarious livelihood without complaining for he was game but robinson's quick eye and ear saw his clothes were shabby and that he had given up his ha ha ha no jem whose mate had run away and robbed him and he was left solus with his tools no mr stevens an accomplished scholar and above all linguist broad in the forehead but narrow in the chest who had been successively rejected by five gangs and was now at a discount he picked up a few shillings by interpreting but it was a suspicious circumstance that he often came two miles from his end of the camp to see robinson just at dinner time then a look used to pass between those two good hearted creatures and mr stevens was served first and carlo docked till evening titles prevailed but little in the mine they generally addressed the males of our species thus hi man the females thus hi woman the spartans but these two made an exception in favor of this reduced scholar they called him sir and felt abashed his black coat should be so rusty and they gave him the gristly bits for he was not working but always served him first no unlucky jack a digger this man really seemed to be unlucky gangs would find the stuff on four sides of him and he none his last party had dissolved owing they said to his ill luck and he was forlorn these four robinson convened with the help of mary mcdogherty who went for stevens and made them a little speech telling them he had seen all their four ill lucks and was going to end that with one blow he then taking the direction of brutus's gold vein marked them out a claim full forty yards off and himself one close to them organized them and set them working in high spirits tremulous expectation and a fervor of gratitude to him and kindly feeling toward their unlucky comrades you won't find anything for six feet said the captain meantime all of you turn to and tell the rest how you were the unluckiest man in the whole mine till you fell in with me he he and the captain chuckled his elastic vanity was fast recovering from brutus and his spirits rising toward evening he collected his whole faction got on the top of two cradles made a speech thanked them for their good will and told them he had now an opportunity of making them a return he had discovered a vein of gold which he could have kept all to himself but it was more just and more generous to share it with his partisans now pass through this little mine one at a time said he and look at the roof where i have stuck the two lighted candles and then pass on quick to make room for others the men dived one after another examined the roof and rushing wildly out at the other end in great excitement ran and marked out claims on both sides of the subterranean but with all their greediness and eagerness they left ten feet square untouched on each side the subterranean what is this left for that is left for the clever fellow that found the gold after a thief had missed it cried one and for the generous fellow that parted his find roared another from a distance robinson seemed to reflect no i won't spoil the meat by cutting myself the fat no i am a digger but not only a digger i aspire to the honor of being a captain of diggers my claim lies out there hurrah three cheers for captain robinson will you do me a favor in return hurrah won't we i am going to petition the governor to send us out police to guard our tents hurrah and even beaks if necessary doubtful murmurs and above all soldiers to take our gold safe down to sydney hurrah where we can sell it at three fifteen the ounce hurrah hurrah hurrah instead of giving it away here for three pounds and then being robbed if you will all sign mr stevens and i will draw up the petition no country can stand without law hurrah for captain robinson the diggers' friend and the wild fellows jumped out of the holes and four seized the diggers' friend and they chaired him in their rough way and they put carlo into a cradle and raised him high and chaired him and both man and dog were right glad to get safe out of the precarious honor the proceedings ended by brutus being loosed and set between two long lines of men with lumps of clay and pelted and knocked down and knocked up again and driven bruised battered and bleeding out of that part of the camp he found his way to a little dirty tent not much bigger than a badger's hole crawled in and sank down in a fainting state and lay on his back stiff and fevered and smarting soul and body many days and while robinson was exulting in his skill his good fortune his popularity his swelling bag and the constabulary force he was collecting and heading this tortured ruffian driven to utter desperation by the exposure of his features to all the camp with thief blazing on him lay groaning stiff and sore but lived for revenge let him keep his gold i don't care for his gold now i'll have his blood chapter lxii i wonder at you giving away the claim that lay close to the gold it is all very well to be generous but you forget susan don't you be silly george the vein dips and those that cut down on it where it is horizontalish will get a little we that nick it nearly verticalish will get three times as much out of a ten foot square claim well you are a sharp fellow to be sure but if it is so why on earth did you make a favor to them of giving them the milk and taking the cream policy george policy chapter lxiii sunday tom i invite you to a walk ay ay i'd give twenty pounds for one but the swag leave it this one day with mr levi he has got two young men always armed in his tent and a little peevish dog and gutta percha pipes running into all the jews' tents that are at his back like chicks after the old hen oh he is a deep one and he has got mouth pieces to them and so he could bring thirty men upon a thief in less than half a minute well then george a walk is a great temptation this beautiful day in short by eight o'clock the gold was deposited and the three friends for policeman c must count for one stepped lustily out in the morning air it was the month of january a blazing hot day was beginning to glow through the freshness of morning the sky was one cope of pure blue and the southern air crept slowly up its wings clogged with fragrance and just tuned the trembling leaves no more is not this pleasant tom isn't it sweet i believe you george and what a shame to run down such a country as this there they come home and tell you the flowers have no smell but they keep dark about the trees and bushes being haystacks of flowers snuff the air as we go it is a thousand english gardens in one look at all those tea scrubs each with a thousand blossoms on it as sweet as honey and the golden wattles on the other side and all smelling like seven o'clock after which flowers be hanged ay lad it is very refreshing and it is sunday and we have got away from the wicked for an hour or two but in england there would be a little white church out yonder and a spire like an angel's forefinger pointing from the grass to heaven and the lads in their clean smock frocks like snow and the wenches in their white stockings and new shawls and the old women in their scarlet cloaks and black bonnets all going one road and a tinkle tinkle from the belfry that would turn all these other sounds and colors and sweet smells holy as well as fair on the sabbath morn ah england ah you will see her again no need to sigh oh i was not thinking of her in particular just then of who of susan prejudice be hanged this is a lovely land so 'tis tom so 'tis but i'll tell you what puts me out a little bit nothing is what it sets up for here if you see a ripe pear and go to eat it it is a lump of hard wood next comes a thing the very sight of which turns your stomach and that is delicious a loquot for instance there now look at that magpie well it is australia so that magpie is a crow and not a magpie at all everything pretends to be some old friend or other of mine and turns out a stranger here is nothing but surprises and deceptions the flowers make a point of not smelling and the bushes that nobody expects to smell or wants to smell they smell lovely what does it matter where the smell comes from so that you get it why tom replied george opening his eyes it makes all the difference i like to smell a flower flower is not complete without smell but i don't care if i never smell a bush till i die then the birds they laugh and talk like christians they make me split my sides god bless their little hearts but they won't chirrup oh dear no bless you they leave the christians to chirrup they hold conversations and giggle and laugh and play a thing like a fiddle it is australia where everything is inside out and topsy turvy the animals have four legs so they jump on two ten foot square of rock lets for a pound a month ten acres of grass for a shilling a year roasted at christmas shiver o' cold on midsummer day the lakes are grass and the rivers turn their backs on the sea and run into the heart of the land and the men would stand on their heads but i have taken a thought and i've found out why they don't why because if they did their heads would point the same way a man's head points in england robinson laughed and told george he admired the country for these very traits novelty for me against the world who'd come twelve thousand miles to see nothing we couldn't see at home hang the same old story always where are we going george oh not much farther only about twelve miles from the camp where to to a farmer i know i am going to show you a lark tom said george his eyes beamed benevolence on his comrade robinson stopped dead short george said he no don't let us i would rather stay at home and read my book you can go into temptation and come out pure i can't i am one of those that if i go into a puddle up to my shoe i must splash up to my middle what has that to do with it your proposing to me to go in for a lark on the sabbath day why tom am i the man to tempt you to do evil asked george hurt why no but for all that you proposed a lark ay but an innocent one one more likely to lift your heart on high than to give you ill thoughts well this is a riddle and robinson was intensely puzzled carlo cried george suddenly come here i will not have you hunting and tormenting those kangaroo rats to day let us all be at peace if you please come to heel the friends strode briskly on and a little after eleven o'clock they came upon a small squatter's house and premises here we are cried george and his eyes glittered with innocent delight the house was thatched and whitewashed and english was written on it and on every foot of ground round it a furzebush had been planted by the door vertical oak palings were the fence with a five barred gate in the middle of them from the little plantation all the magnificent trees and shrubs of australia had been excluded with amazing resolution and consistency and oak and ash reigned safe from overtowering rivals they passed to the back of the house and there george's countenance fell a little for on the oval grass plot and gravel walk he found from thirty to forty rough fellows most of them diggers ah well said he on reflection we could not expect to have it all to ourselves and indeed it would be a sin to wish it you know now tom come this way here it is here it is there tom looked up and in a gigantic cage was a light brown bird he was utterly confounded what is it this we came twelve miles to see ay and twice twelve wouldn't have been much to me well but what is the lark you talked of this is it this this is a bird well and isn't a lark a bird oh ay i see ha ha ha ha robinson's merriment was interrupted by a harsh remonstrance from several of the diggers who were all from the other end of the camp hold your cackle cried one he is going to sing and the whole party had their eyes turned with expectation toward the bird like most singers he kept them waiting a bit but at last just at noon when the mistress of the house had warranted him to sing the little feathered exile began as it were to tune his pipes the savage men gathered round the cage that moment and amid a dead stillness the bird uttered some very uncertain chirps but after a while he seemed to revive his memories and call his ancient cadences back him to one by one and string them sotto voce and then the same sun that had warmed his little heart at home came glowing down on him here and he gave music back for it more and more till at last amid breathless silence and glistening eyes of the rough diggers hanging on his voice out burst in that distant land his english song it swelled his little throat and gushed from him with thrilling force and plenty and every time he checked his song to think of its theme the green meadows the quiet stealing streams the clover he first soared from and the spring he sang so well a loud sigh from many a rough bosom many a wild and wicked heart told how tight the listeners had held their breath to hear him and when he swelled with song again and poured with all his soul the green meadows the quiet brooks the honey clover and the english spring the rugged mouths opened and so stayed and the shaggy lips trembled and more than one drop trickled from fierce unbridled hearts down bronzed and rugged cheeks dulce dornurn and these shaggy men full of oaths and strife and cupidity had once been white headed boys and had strolled about the english fields with little sisters and little brothers and seen the lark rise and heard him sing this very song the little playmates lay in the churchyard and they were full of oaths and drink and lusts and remorses but no note was changed in this immortal song and so for a moment or two years of vice rolled away like a dark cloud from the memory and the past shone out in the song shine they came back bright as the immortal notes that lighted them those faded pictures and those fleeted days the cottage the old mother's tears when he left her without one grain of sorrow the village church and its simple chimes the clover field hard by in which he lay and gamboled while the lark praised god overhead the chubby playmates that never grew to be wicked the sweet hours of youth and innocence and home chapter lxiv what will you take for him mistress i will give you five pounds for him no no i won't take five pounds for my bird of course she won't cried another she wouldn't be such a flat here missus cried he i'll give you that for him and he extended a brown hand with at least thirty new sovereigns glittering in it the woman trembled she and her husband were just emerging from poverty after a hard fight oh she cried it is a shame to tempt a poor woman with so much gold we had six brought over and all died on the way but this one and she threw her white apron over her head not to see the glittering bribe you put the blunt up and don't tempt the woman was the cry another added why you fool it wouldn't live a week if you had it and they all abused the merchant but the woman turned to him kindly and said you come to me every sunday and he shall sing to you you will get more pleasure from him so said she sweetly than if he was always by you so i will old girl replied the rough in a friendly tone george stayed till the lark gave up singing altogether and then he said now i am off i don't want to hear bad language after that let us take the lark's chirp home to bed with us and they made off and true it was the pure strains dwelt upon their spirits and refreshed and purified these sojourners in a godless place meeting these two figures on sunday afternoon armed each with a double barreled gun and a revolver you would never have guessed what gentle thoughts possessed them wholly they talked less than they did coming but they felt so quiet and happy the pretty bird purred george seeing him by the ear i feel after him there as if i had just come out o' church so do i george and i think his song must be a psalm if we knew all that it is for heaven taught it him we must try and keep all this in our hearts when we get among the broken bottles and foul language and gold says george how sweet it all smells sweeter than before that is because it is afternoon yes or along of the music that tune was a breath from home that makes everything please me now this is the first sunday that has looked and smelled and sounded sunday george it is hard to believe the world is wicked everything seems good and gentle and at peace with heaven and earth a jet of smoke issued from the bush followed by the report of a gun and carlo who had taken advantage of george's revery to slip on ahead gave a sharp howl and spun round upon all fours the scoundrels shrieked robinson and in a moment his gun was at his shoulder and he fired both barrels slap into the spot whence the smoke had issued both the men dashed up and sprang into the bush revolver in hand but ere they could reach it the dastard had run for it and the scrub was so thick pursuit was hopeless the men returned full of anxiety for carlo the dog met them his tail between his legs but at sight of george he wagged his tail and came to him and licked george's hand and walked on with them licking george's hand every now and then look tom he is as sensible as a christian he knows the shot was meant for him though they didn't hit him by this time the men had got out of the wood and pursued their road but not with tranquil hearts sunday ended with the noise of that coward's gun they walked on hastily guns ready fingers on trigger at war suddenly robinson looked back and stopped and drew george's attention to carlo he was standing with all his four legs wide apart like a statue george called him he came directly and was for licking george's hand but george pulled him about and examined him all over i wish they may not have hurt him after all the butchers they have too see here tom here is one streak of blood on his belly nothing to hurt though i do hope never mind carlo cried george it is only a single shot by what i can see 'tisn't like when will put the whole charge into you rabbit shooting is it carlo no says he we don't care for this do we carlo cried george rather boisterously make him go into that pool there said robinson then he won't have fever i will here cess cess he threw a stone into the pool of water that lay a little off the road and carlo went in after it without hesitation though not with his usual alacrity after an unsuccessful attempt to recover the stone he swam out lower down and came back to the men and wagged his tail slowly and walked behind george they went on tom said george after a pause i don't like it don't like what he never so much as shook himself what of that he did shake himself i should say not as should be who ever saw a dog come out of the water and not shake himself carlo hie carlo and george threw a stone along the ground after which carlo trotted but his limbs seemed to work stiffly the stone spun round a sharp corner in the road the dog followed it he will do now said robinson they walked briskly on on turning the corner they found carlo sitting up and shivering with the stone between his paws we must not let him sit said tom keep his blood warm i don't think we ought to have sent him into the water i don't know muttered george gloomily carlo cried he cheerfully don't you be down hearted there is nothing so bad as faint heartedness for man or beast come up and away ye go and shake it off like a man carlo got up and wagged his tail in answer but he evidently was in no mood for running he followed languidly behind let us get home said robinson there is an old pal of mine that is clever about dogs he will cut the shot out if there is one in him and give him some physic the men strode on and each to hide his own uneasiness chatted about other matters but all of a sudden robinson cried out why where is the dog they looked back and there was carlo some sixty yards in the rear but he was not sitting this time he was lying on his belly oh this is a bad job cried george the men ran up in real alarm carlo wagged his tail as soon as they came near him but he did not get up carlo cried george despairingly you wouldn't do it you couldn't think to do it oh my dear carlo it is only making up your mind to live keep up your heart old fellow don't go to leave us alone among these villains my poor dear darling dog oh no he won't live he can't live see how dull his poor dear eye is getting oh carlo carlo at the sound of his master's voice in such distress carlo whimpered and then he began to stretch his limbs out at the sight of this robinson cried hastily rub him george we did wrong to send him into the water george rubbed him all over after rubbing him a while he said tom i seem to feel him turning to dead under my hand george's hand in rubbing carlo came round to the dog's shoulder then carlo turned his head and for the third time began to lick george's hand george let him lick his hand and gave up rubbing him for where was the use carlo never left off licking his hand but feebly very feebly more and more feebly presently even while he was licking his hand the poor thing's teeth closed slowly on his loving tongue and then he could lick the beloved hand no more breath fluttered about his body a little while longer but in truth he had ceased to live when he could no longer kiss his master's hand and so the poor single hearted soul was gone george took it up tenderly in his arms robinson made an effort to console him don't speak to me if you please said george gently but quickly he carried it home silently and laid it silently down in a corner of the tent robinson made a fire and put some steaks on and made george slice some potatoes to keep him from looking always at what so little while since was carlo then they sat down silently and gloomily to dinner it was long past their usual hour and they were workingmen until we die we dine come what may the first part of the meal passed in deep silence then robinson said sadly we will go home george i fall into your wishes now gold can't pay for what we go through in this hellish place not it replied george quietly we are surrounded by enemies seems so was the reply in a very languid tone labor by day and danger by night ay but in a most indifferent tone and no sabbath for us two no i'll do my best for you and when we have five hundred pounds more you shall go home to susan thank you he was a good friend to us that lies there under my coat he used to lie over it and then who dare touch it no but don't give way to that george do eat a bit it will do you good i will tom i will thank you kindly ah now i see why he came to me and kept licking my hand so the moment he got the hurt he had more sense than we had he knew he and i were to part that hour and i tormented his last minutes sending him into the water and after stones when the poor thing wanted to be bidding me good by all the while oh dear oh dear and george pushed his scarce tasted dinner from him and left the tent hurriedly his eyes thick with tears thus ended this human day so happily begun and thus the poor dog paid the price of fidelity this sunday afternoon siste viator iter and part with poor carlo for whom there are now no more little passing troubles no more little simple joys his duty is performed his race is run peace be to him and to all simple and devoted hearts ah me how rare they are among men what are you doing tom if you please laying down a gut line to trip them up when they get into our tent when who those that shot carlo they won't venture near me won't they what was the dog shot for they will come and come to their death to night i hope let them come you will hear me cry 'carlo' in their ears as i put my revolver to their skulls and pull the trigger george said nothing but he clinched his teeth after a pause he muttered we should pray against such thoughts robinson was disappointed no attack was made in fact even if such a thing was meditated the captain's friends watched his tent night and day and made such a feat a foolhardy enterprise full of danger from without and within in the course of the next week a good deal of rain fell and filled many of the claims and caused much inaction and distress among the diggers and robinson guarded the tent and wrote letters and studied australian politics with a view to being shortly a member of congress in these parts george had his wish at last and cruised about looking for the home of the gold george recollected to have seen what he described as a river of quartz sixty feet broad and running between two black rocks it ran in his head that gold in masses was there locked up for argued he all the nuggets of any size i have seen were more than half quartz robinson had given up debating the point george was uneasy and out of spirits at not hearing from susan for several months and robinson was for indulging him in everything poor george he could not even find his river of quartz and when he used to come home day after day empty handed and with this confession the other's lips used to twitch with the hard struggle not to laugh at him and he used to see the struggle and be secretly more annoyed than if he had been laughed out at one afternoon tom robinson internally despising the whole thing and perfectly sure in his own mind that there was no river of quartz but paternal and indulgent to his friend's one weakness said to him i'll tell you how to find this river of quartz if it is anywhere except in your own head i shall be much obliged to you how jem has come back to camp and he tells me that jacky is encamped with a lot more close to the gully he is working it was on the other side the bush there and jacky inquired very kind after you the little viper he grinned from ear to ear jem tells me and says he 'me come and see george a good deal soon' says he if he does george will tan his black hide for him what makes you hold spite so long against poor jacky he is a little sneaking varmint he knows every part of this country and he would show you 'the home of the gold' observed robinson restraining his merriment with great difficulty this cock would not fight as vulgar wretches say jacky had rather mortified george by deserting him upon the first discovery of gold dis a good deal stupid was that worthy's remark on the second day when i hunt tings run and i run behind and catch dem you hunt it not run yet you not catch it always dat a good deal stupid before we hunt gold you do many tings now do one dat a good deal stupid before you go so erecting a forefinger now you always so crooking it dat too stupid and with this whir my lord was off to the woods on the head of this came abner limping in and told how a savage had been seen creeping after him with a battle ax and how he had lain insensible for days and now was lame for life george managed to forgive jacky's unkind desertion but for creeping after abner and spoiling him for life to use abner's phrase he vowed vengeance on that black hide and heart now if the truth must be told jacky had come back to the camp with jem and would have marched before this into george's tent but robinson knowing how angry george was with him and not wishing either jacky to be licked or george to be tomahawked insisted on his staying with jem till he had smoothed down his friend's indignation soon after this dialogue robinson slipped out and told jacky to stay with jem and keep out of george's way for a day or two and now the sun began to set red as blood and the place to sparkle far and wide with the fiery rays emitted from a hundred thousand bottles that lay sown broadcast over the land and the thunder of the cradles ceased and the accordions came out all over five miles of gold mine their gentler strains lasted till the sun left the sky then just at dusk came a tremendous discharge of musketry roaring rattling and re echoing among the rocks this was tens of thousands of diggers discharging their muskets and revolvers previous to reloading them for the night for calm as the sun had set to the music of accordions many a deadly weapon they knew would be wanted to defend life and gold ere that same tranquil sun should rise again thus the tired army slept not at their ease like other armies guarded by sentinels and pickets but every man in danger every night and every hour of it each man lay in his clothes with a weapon of death in his hand robinson with two a revolver and a cutlass ground like a razor outside it was all calm and peaceful no boisterous revelry all seemed to sleep innocent and calm in the moonlight after the day of herculean toil perhaps if any one eye could have visited the whole enormous camp the children of theft and of the night might have been seen prowling and crawling from one bit of shade to another but in the part where our friends lay the moon revealed no human figures but robinson's patrol three men who with a dark lantern and armed to the teeth went their rounds and guarded forty tents above all the captain's it was at his tent that guard was relieved every two hours so all was watched the livelong night two pointed rocks connected at the base faced the captain's tent the silver rays struck upon their foreheads wet with the vapors of night and made them like frost seen through phosphorus it was startling the soul of silver seemed to be sentinel and eye the secret gold below and now a sad a miserable sound grated on the ear of night a lugubrious quail doled forth a grating dismal note at long but measured intervals offending the ear and depressing the heart this was the only sound nature afforded for hours the neighboring bush though crammed with the merriest souls that ever made feathers vibrate and dance with song was like a tomb of black marble not a sound only this little raven of a quail tolled her harsh lugubrious crake those whose musical creed is time before sentiment might have put up with this night bird for to do her justice she was a perfect timist one crake in a bar the livelong night but her tune ugh she was the mother of all files that play on iron throughout the globe crake crake crake untuning the night an eye of red light suddenly opened in the silver stream shows three men standing by a snowy tent it is the patrol waiting to be relieved three more figures emerge from the distant shade and join them the first three melt into the shade crake the other three remain and mutter now they start on their rounds what is that mutters one i'll go and see click well oh it is only that brown donkey that cruises about here she will break her neck in one of the pits some day not she she is not such an ass these three melted into the night going their rounds and now nothing is left in sight but a thousand cones of snow and the donkey paddling carefully among the pits craake now the donkey stands a moment still in the moonlight now he paddles slowly away and disappears on the dark side the captain's tent what is he doing he stoops he lies down he takes off his head and skin and lays them down it is a man he draws his knife and puts it between his teeth a pistol is in his hand he crawls on his stomach the tent is between him and the patrol his hand is inside the tent he finds the opening and winds like a serpent into the tent craake chapter lxv black will no sooner found himself inside the tent than he took out a dark lantern and opened the slide cautiously there lay in one corner the two men fast asleep side by side casting the glare around he saw at his feet a dog with a chain round him it startled him for a moment but only for a moment he knew that dog was dead mephistopheles had told him within an hour after the feat was performed close to his very hand was a pair of miner's boots he detached them from the canvas and passed them out of the tent and now looking closely at the ground he observed a place where the soil seemed loose his eye flashed with triumph at this he turned up the openings of the tent behind him to make his retreat clear if necessary he made at once for the loose soil and the moment he moved forward robinson's gut lines twisted his feet from under him he fell headlong in the middle and half a dozen little bells rang furiously at the sleepers' heads up jumped tom and george weapons in hand but not before black will had wrenched himself clear and bounded back to the door at the door in his rage at being balked he turned like lightning and leveled his pistol at robinson who was coming at him cutlass in hand the ex thief dropped on his knees and made a furious upward cut at his arm at one and the same moment the pistol exploded and the cutlass struck it and knocked it against the other side of the tent the bullet passed over robinson's head black will gave a yell so frightful that for a moment it paralyzed the men and even with this yell he burst backward through the opening and with a violent wrench of his left hand brought the whole tent down and fled leaving george and robinson struggling in the canvas like cats in an empty flour sack the baffled burglar had fled but a few yards when casting his eye back he saw their helplessness losing danger in hatred he came back not now to rob but murder his left hand lifted high and gleaming like his cruel eye as he prepared to plunge his knife through the canvas flash bang flash bang bang came three pistol shots in his face from the patrol who were running right slap at him not thirty yards off and now it was life or death he turned and ran for his life the patrol blazing and banging at him eighteen shots they fired at him one after another more than one cut his clothes and one went clean through his hat but he was too fleet he distanced them but at the reports diggers peeped out of distant tents and at sight of him running flash bang went a pistol at him from every tent he passed and george and robinson who had struggled out into the night saw the red flashes issue and then heard the loud reports bellow and re echo as he dodged about down the line and then all was still and calm as death under the cold pure stars craake they put up their tent again the patrol came panting back he has got off but he carried some of our lead in him go to bed captain we won't leave your tent all night robinson and george lay down again thus guarded the patrol sat by the tent two slept one loaded the arms again and watched in a few minutes the friends were actually fast asleep again lying silent as the vast camp lay beneath the silver stars craake and now it was cold much colder than before darker too no moon now only the silver stars it makes one shiver nature seemed to lie stark and stiff and dead and that accursed craake her dirge all tended to shivering and gloom yet a great event approached craake a single event a thousand times weightier to the world each time it comes than if with one fell stroke all the kingdoms of the globe became republics and all the republics empires so to remain a thousand years an event a hundred times more beautiful than any other thing the eye can hope to see while in the flesh yet it regaled the other senses too and blessed the universal heart before this prodigious event came its little heralds sweeping across the face of night first came a little motion of cold air it was dead still before then an undefinable freshness then a very slight but rather grateful smell from the soil of the conscious earth next twittered from the bush one little hesitating chirp craake went the lugubrious quail pooh poohing the suggestion then somehow rocks and forest and tents seemed less indistinct in shape outlines peeped where masses had been jug jug went a bird with a sweet jurgle in his deep throat craake went the ill omened one directly disputing the last inch of nature but a gray thrush took up the brighter view otock otock tock o tuee o o o tuee oo o chio chee o chio chee sang the thrush with a decision as well as a melody that seemed to say ah but i am sure of it i am sure i am sure wake up joy joy from that moment there was no more craake the lugubrious quail shut up in despair perhaps in disdain and out gurgled another jug jug jug as sweet a chuckle as nature's sweet voice ever uttered in any land and with that a mist like a white sheet came to light but only for a moment for it dared not stay to be inspected i know who is coming i'm off and away it crept off close to the ground and little drops of dew peeped sparkling in the frost powdered grass like anonymous detraction before vox populi yock yock o chio faliera po otock otock tock o chio chee o chio chee jug jug jug jug off we go off we go and now a thin red streak came into the sky and perfume burst from the bushes and the woods rang not only with songs some shrill some as sweet as honey but with a grotesque yet beautiful electric merriment of birds that can only be heard in this land of wonders the pen can give but a shadow of the drollery and devilry of the sweet merry rogues that hailed the smiling morn ten thousand of them each with half a dozen songs besides chattering and talking and imitating the fiddle the fife and the trombone niel gow niel gow niel gow whined a leather head take care o' my hat cries a thrush in a soft melancholy voice then with frightful harshness and severity where is your bacca box your box your box then before any one could answer in a tone that said devil may care where the box is or anything else gyroc de doc gyroc de doc roc de doc cheboc cheboc then came a tremendous cackle ending with an obstreperous hoo hoo ha from the laughing jackass who had caught sight of the red streak in the sky harbinger like himself of morn and the piping crows or whistling magpies modulating and humming and chanting not like birds but like practiced musicians with rich baritone voices and the next moment creaking just for all the world like punch or barking like a pug dog and the delicious thrush with its sweet and mellow tune nothing in an english wood so honey sweet as his otock otock tock o tuee o o o tuee o o o chio chee o chio chee but the leather heads beat all niel gow niel gow niel gow off we go off we go off we go followed by rapid conversations the words unintelligible but perfectly articulate and interspersed with the oddest chuckles plans of pleasure for the day no doubt then ri tiddle tiddle tiddle tiddle tiddle tiddle playing a thing like a fiddle with wires then off we go again and bow wow wow jug jug jug jug jug and the whole lot in exuberant spirits such extravagance of drollery such rollicking jollity evidently splitting their sides with fun and not able to contain themselves for it oh it was twelve thousand miles above the monotonous and scanty strains of a european wood and when the roving and laughing and harshly demanding bacca boxes and then as good as telling you they didn't care a feather for bacca boxes or anything else gyroc de doc cheboc cheboc cheboc and loudly announcing their immediate departure and perching in the same place all the more and sweet low modulations ending in putting on the steam and creaking like punch and then almost tumbling off the branches with laughing at the general accumulation of nonsense when all this drollery and devilry and joy and absurdity were at their maddest and a thousand feathered fountains bubbling song were at their highest then came the cause of all the merry hubbub the pinnacles of rock glowed burnished gold nature that had crept from gloom to pallor burst from pallor to light and life and burning color the great sun's forehead came with one gallant stride into the sky and it was day out shone ten thousand tents of every size and hue and shape from isaac levi's rood of white canvas down to sugar loaves and even to miserable roofs built on the bare ground with slips of bark under which unlucky diggers crept at night like badgers roofed beds no more the stars twinkling through chinks in the tester the myriad tents were clustered for full five miles on each side of the river and it wound and sparkled in and out at various distances and shone like a mirror in the distant background at the first ray the tents disgorged their inmates and the human hive began to hum then came the fight the maneuvering the desperate wrestle with nature and the keen fencing with their fellows in short the battle to which that nothing might be wanting out burst the tremendous artillery of ten thousand cradles louder than thunder and roaring and crashing without a pause the base of the two peaked rock that looked so silvery in the moon is now seen to be covered with manuscript advertisements posted on it we can only read two or three as we run to our work immense reduction in eggs only one shilling each bevan's store go ahead library and registration office for new chums tom long in the dead horse gully if this meets the i of tom bowles he will ear of is pal in the iron bark gully this is to give notice that whereas my wife elizabeth sutton has taken to drink and gone off with my mate bob i will not be answerable for your debts nor hold any communication with you in future james sutton a young jew nathan issued from levi's tent with a rough table and two or three pair of scales and other paraphernalia of a gold assayer and merchant this was not the first mine by many the old jew had traded in his first customers this morning were george and robinson our tent was attacked last night mr levi again humph tom thinks he has got enemies in the camp humph the young man puts himself too forward not to have enemies well said george quickly if he makes bitter enemies he makes warm friends george then explained that his nerve and robinson's were giving way under the repeated attacks we have had a talk and we will sell the best part of our dust to you sir give him the best price you can afford for susan's sake and away went george to look for his quartz river leaving the ex thief to make the bargain and receive the money in the transaction that followed mr levi did not appear to great advantage he made a little advance on the three pounds per ounce on account of the quantity but he would not give a penny above three guineas no business was business he could and would have given george a couple of hundred pounds in day of need but in buying and selling the habits of a life could not be shaken off wherefore robinson kept back eight pounds of gold dust and sold him the rest for notes of the sydney bank well sir said tom cheerfully now my heart is light what we have got we can carry round our waists now by night or day well friend what do you want poking your nose into the tent coming out suddenly he had run against a man who was in a suspicious attitude at the entrance no offense muttered the man i wanted to sell a little gold dust levi heard what robinson said and came quickly out he seated himself behind the scales where is your gold the man fumbled and brought out about an ounce all the time he weighed it the jew's keen eye kept glancing into his face he lowered his eyes and could not conceal a certain uneasiness when he was gone levi asked robinson whether he knew that face no said robinson i don't levi called nathan out nathan look at that man follow him cautiously and tell me where we have seen him above all know him again surely that is the face of an enemy then the old man asked himself where he had seen such an eye and brow and shambling walk as that and he fell into a brown study and groped among many years for the clew what is erin go bragh up with the sun for once cried robinson to mary mcdogherty who passed him spade on shoulder sure if she warn't she'd never keep up with newgut was the instant rejoinder hem how is your husband mary och captain it is a true friend ye are for inquiring then it's tied in a knot he is mercy on us tied in a knot tied in a knot intirely wid the rheumatism and it's tin days i'm working for him and the childhre and my

leave it andrew i will examine it with the utmost minuteness the dog used fine words on these occasions that he might pass for a pundit with his clique and being now alone he pored over his police sheet as solemn and stern as if the nation depended on his investigations a short explosion of laughter from andrew interrupted this grave occupation the beak looked up with offended dignity and in spite of a mighty effort fell a sniggering for following andrew's eyes he saw two gig umbrellas gliding erect and peaceful side by side among the pits what on earth are they chinamen captain they are too lazy to dig they go about all day looking at the heaps and poking all over the camp they have got eyes like hawks it is wonderful i am told what they contrive to pick up first and last what hats why one of 'm would roof a tent hurroo what is up now hurroo and up came mary mcdogherty dancing and jumping as only irish ever jumped she had a lump of dim metal in one hand and a glittering mass in the other she came up to the table with a fantastic spring and spanked down the sparkling mass on it bounding back one step like india rubber even as she struck the table there ould gintleman what will ye be after giving me for that sure the luck is come to the right colleen at last i deal but in the precious metals and stones replied isaac quietly sure and isn't gould a precious metal do you offer me this for gold this is not even a metal it is mica yellow mica mikee cried mary ruefully with an inquiring look at this juncture in ran george hot as fire there cried he triumphantly to robinson was i right or wrong what becomes of your gold dust and he laid a nugget as big as his fist on the table ochone cried the irishwoman they all have the luck barrin' poor molly mcdogherty the mica was handled and george said to her compassionately you see my poor girl the first thing you should do is to heft it in your hand now see your lump is not heavy like pyrites said isaac dryly handing george back his lump no pyrites is heavier than mica and gold than pyrites mr levi don't go to tell me this is not a metal remonstrated george rather sulkily for i won't have it nay it is a metal replied levi calmly and a very useful metal but not of the precious metals it is iron how can it be iron when it is yellow and how is one to know iron from gold at any rate be patient my son said the old jew calmly and learn take this needle here is a scale of gold take it up on the needle point you have done it why because gold is a soft metal now take up this scale from your pyrites i can't no because iron is a hard metal here is another childish test a bloodstone called by some the touchstone rub the pyrites on it it colors it not a hard metal now rub this little nugget of pure gold i have just bought ay this stains the stone yellow a soft metal here in this little phial is muriatic acid pour a drop on my nugget the metal defies it now pour on your pyrites see how it smokes and perishes it cannot resist the acid there are many other tests but little needed no metal no earthly substance resembles gold in the least not to a jew's eye whispered robinson and much i marvel that any man or even any woman who has been in a gold mine and seen and handled virgin gold should take mica here he knocked the mica clean off the table or pyrites here he spanged that in another direction for the royal metal i'll tell you what to do mary began robinson cheerfully hallo she is crying here is a faint heart och captain dear pat an' me we are kilt right out for want of luck oh oh we niver found but one gould and that was mikee we can't fall upon luck of any sort good bad or indifferent that is where i'm broke and spiled and kilt hintirely oh oh oh don't cry you have chosen a bad spot captain avick they do be turning it up like carrots on both sides of huz and i dig right down as if i'd go through the 'orld back to dear old ireland again he he he oh oh an' i do be praying to the virgin at every stroke of the spade i do and she sends us no gould at all at all barrin' mikee bad cess to 't oh that is it you are on two wrong tacks you dig perpendicular and pray horizontal now you should dig horizontal and pray perpendicular och captain thim's hard words for poor molly mcdogherty to quarry through what is that in your hand sure it is an illigant lump of lead i found replied poor mary the base metal rising in estimation since her gold turned out dross ye are great with the revolver captain said she coaxingly ye'll be afther giving me the laste pinch of the rale stuff for it robinson took the lump good heavens what a weight cried he he eyed it keenly come mr levi cried he here is a find be generous she is unlucky i shall be just said the old man gravely he weighed the lump and made a calculation on paper then handed her forty sovereigns she looked at them oh now it is mocking me ye are old man and she would not take the money on this he put it coolly down on the table what is it at all asked she faintly platinum replied isaac coldly and a magnificent lump of it cried robinson warmly och captain och captain dear and what is plateenum at all if ye plaze it is not like your mica said isaac see it is heavier than gold and far more precious than silver it has noble qualities it resists even the simple acid that dissolves gold fear not to take the money i give you but your metal's value minus the merchant's just profit platinum is the queen of the metals och captain avick och och come here till i eat you and she flung her arm round robinson's neck and bestowed a little furious kiss on him then she pranced away then she pranced back platinum you are the boy y'are the queen of the mitals may the lord bless you ould gentleman and the saints bless you and the virgin mary bless you and she made at isaac with the tears in her eyes to kiss him but he waved her off with calm repulsive dignity hurroo and the child of nature bounded into the air like an antelope and frisked three times then she made another set at them may you live till the skirts of your coat knock your brains out the pair of ye hurroo then with sudden demureness an' here's wishing you all sorts of luck good bad an' indifferent my darlin's plateenum foriver and gould to the divil cried she suddenly with a sort of musical war shout the last words being uttered three feet high in air and accompanied with a vague kick utterly impossible in that position except to irish and intended it is supposed to send the obnoxious metal off the surface of the globe forever and away she danced these imprecations are printed on the ascending scale by way of endeavor to show how the speaker delivered them breakfast now and all the cradles stopped at once what a delightful calm said robinson now i can study my police sheet at my ease this morning as he happened to be making no noise the noise of others worried him mr levi how still and peaceful they are when their time comes to grub 'the still sow sups the kail' as we used to say in the north the english turn the proverb differently they say 'the silent hog ' jabber jabber jabber aie aie hallo there's a scrimmage and there go all the fools rushing to see it i'll go too alas poor human nature the row was this the peaceful children of the moon whom last we saw gliding side by side vertical and seemingly imperturbable had yielded to the genius loci and were engaged in bitter combat after the manner of their nation the gig umbrellas were resolved into their constituent parts the umbrellas proper or hats lay on the ground the sticks or men rolled over one another scratching and biting europe wrenched them asunder with much pain and held them back by their tails grinning horribly at each other and their long claws working unamiably the diggers were remonstrating their morality was shocked is that the way to fight what are fists given us for ye varmint robinson put himself at the head of the general sentiment i must do a bit of beak here cried he bring those two tom cats up before me the proposal was received with acclamation a high seat was made for the self constituted beak and mr stevens was directed to make the orientals think that he was the lawful magistrate of the mine mr stevens entering into the fun persuaded the orientals who were now gig umbrellas again that robinson was the mandarin who settled property and possessed among other trifles the power of life and death on this they took off their slippers before him and were awestruck and secretly wished they had not kicked up a row still more that they had stayed quiet by the banks of the hoang ho robinson settled himself demanded a pipe and smoked calm and terrible while his myrmidons kept their countenances as well as they could after smoking in silence a while he demanded of the chinese what was the row st chinaman jabber jabber jabber d chinaman jabber jabber jabber both jabber jabber jabber what is that can't they speak any english at all no no wonder they can't conduct themselves then remarked a digger the judge looked him into the earth for the interruption you get the story from them and tell it after a conference mr stevens came forward it is about a nugget of gold which is claimed by both parties robinson stop bring that nugget into court that is the regular course great interest began to be excited and all their necks craned forward when mr stevens took from one of the chinese the cause of so sanguinary a disturbance and placed it on the judge's table a roar of laughter followed it was between a pea and a pin's head in magnitude robinson you know this is shocking asia i am ashamed of you silence in the court proceed with the evidence mr stevens this one saw the gold shining and he said to the other 'ah' robinson writing his notes said to the other 'ah' stop what was the chinese for 'ah' stevens 'ah robinson oh andrew come the beggars have got hold of some of our words robinson silence in the court andrew i ask pardon captain stevens but the other pounced on it first so they both claim it robinson well i call it a plain case stevens so i told them robinson exactly which do you think ought to have it stevens why i told them we have a proverb 'losers seekers finders keepers' robinson of course and which was the finder stevens oh of course this one that hum well to be sure he only said 'ah' he did not point then perhaps but on the other hand hum robinson why don't you see but no yes why it must be the one that ugh drat you both why couldn't one of you find it and the other another robinson was puzzled at last he determined that this his first judgment should satisfy both parties remove the prisoners said he are they the prisoners or the witnesses remove them anyway and keep them apart robinson then searched his pockets and produced a little gold swan shot scarce distinguishable from the chinese he put this on the table and took up the other fetch in number one the chinaman came in with obeisances and misgivings but when the judge signed to him to take up the gold which he mistook for the cause of quarrel his face lightened with a sacred joy he receded and with a polite gesture cleared a space then advancing one foot with large and lofty grace he addressed the judge whose mouth began to open with astonishment in slow balanced and musical sentences this done he retired with three flowing salaams to which the judge replied with three little nods what on earth did the beggar say what makes you grin mr stevens stevens he said click robinson come tell me first laugh after stevens he said 'may your highness flourish like a tree by the side of a stream that never overflows yet is never dry but glides click even and tranquil as the tide of your prosperity ' robinson well i consent stevens 'may dogs defile the graves of your enemies ' robinson with all my heart provided i am not dancing over them at the time stevens when satiated with earthly felicity may you be received in paradise by seventy dark eyed houris ' robinson oh my eye stevens click 'each bearing in her hand the wine of the faithful and may the applause of the good at your departure resemble the waves of the ocean beating musically upon rocky caverns thy servant inexperienced in oratory retires abashed at the greatness of his subject and the insignificance of his expressions' so then he cut his stick robinson a very sensible speech well boys i'm not greedy i take the half of that offer and give you the rest bring in the other gentleman no advanced with reverences and misgivings robinson placed the gold on the table and assigned it to him a sacred joy illumined him and he was about to retire with deep obeisances where is his speech cried the judge ruefuly stevens explained to him that the other had returned thanks on this no smiled assentingly and advancing delivered the following sentences your slave lay writhing in adversity despoiled by the unprincipled he was a gourd withered by the noonday sun until your virtues descended like the dew and refreshed him with your justice and benignity wherefore hear now the benediction of him whom your clemency has raised from despair may your shadow increase and cover many lands may your offspring be a nation dwelling in palaces with golden roofs and walls of ivory and on the terraces may peacocks be as plentiful as sparrows are to the undeserving may you live many centuries shining as you now shine and at your setting may rivulets of ink dug by the pens of poets flow through meadows of paper in praise of the virtues that embellish you here on earth sing tu che a person of small note but devoted to your service wishes these frivolous advantages to the pearl of the west on whom be honor chorus of diggers my eye robinson rose with much gravity and delivered himself thus sing tu che you are a trump an orator and a humbug all the better for you may felicity attend you heichster guchster honi soit qui mal y pense donner und blitzen tempora mutantur o mia cara and pax vobiscum the court is dissolved it was and i regret to add that judge robinson's concluding sentences raised him greatly in the opinion of the miners captain knows a thing or two if ever we send one to parliament that is the man halo you fellows come here come here a rush was made toward jem who was roaring and gesticulating at mr levi's table when they came up they found jem black and white with rage and mr levi seated in calm indifference what is it asked robinson the merchant refuses my gold i refuse no man's gold objected levi coolly but this stuff is not gold not gold dust cried a miner and they all looked with wonder at the rejected merchandise mr levi took the dust and poured it out from one hand to the other he separated the particles and named them by some mighty instinct brass or molu gilt platinum to give it weight this is from birmingham not from australia nor nature such as it is it cost me thirty pounds cried jem keep it i shall find him my spade shall never go into the earth again till i'm quits with this one that is right roared the men bring him to us and the captain shall sit in judgment again and the men's countenances were gloomy for this was a new roguery and struck at the very root of gold digging i'll put it down mr levi said robinson after the others had gone to their work here is a new dodge brummagem planted on us so far from home i will pull it down with a tenpenny cord but i'll end it crash went ten thousand cradles the mine had breakfasted i wish i could give the european reader an idea of the magnitude of this sound whose cause was so humble i must draw on nature for a comparison did you ever stand upon a rocky shore at evening when a great storm has suddenly gone down leaving the waves about as high as they were while it raged then there is no roaring wind to dull the clamor of the tremendous sea as it lashes the long re bellowing shore such was the sound of ten thousand cradles yet the sound of each one was insignificant hence an observation and a reflection the latter i dedicate to the lovers of antiquity that multiplying sound magnifies it in a way science has not yet accounted for and that though men are all dwarfs napoleon included man is a giant the works of man are so prodigious they contradict all we see of any individual's powers and even so when you had seen and heard one man rock one cradle it was all the harder to believe that a few thousand of them could rival thunder avalanches and the angry sea lashing the long reechoing shore at night these miserable wooden cradles lost their real character when combined in one mighty human effort it seemed as if giant labor had stretched forth an arm huge as an arm of the sea and rocked one enormous engine whose sides where these great primeval rocks and its mouth a thundering sea crash from meal to meal the more was robinson surprised when full an hour before dinner time this mighty noise all of a sudden became feebler and feebler and presently human cries of a strange character made their way to his ear through the wooden thunder what on earth is up now thought he an earthquake presently he saw at about half a mile off a vast crowd of miners making toward him in tremendous excitement they came on swelled every moment by fresh faces and cries of vengeance and excitement were now heard which the wild and savage aspect of the men rendered truly terrible at last he saw and comprehended all at a glance there were jem and two others dragging a man along whose white face and knocking knees betrayed his guilt and his terror robinson knew him directly it was walker who had been the decoy duck the night his tent was robbed here is the captain hurrah i've got him captain this is the beggar that peppered the hole for me and now we will pepper him a fierce burst of exultation from the crowd they thirsted for revenge jem had caught the man at the other end of the camp and his offense was known by this time to half the mine proceed regularly jem said robinson don't condemn the man unheard oh no he shall be tried and you shall be the judge i consent said robinson somewhat pompously then arose a cry that made him reflect lynch lynch a seat for judge lynch and in a moment a judgment seat was built with cradles and he was set on high with six strange faces scowling round him for one of his own clique he determined to back out of the whole thing no no cried he that is impossible i cannot be a judge in such a serious matter why not roared several voices why not because i am not a regular beak because i have not got authority from the crown there was a howl of derision we give you authority we order you to be judge we are king lords and commons do what we bid you or added a stranger we will hang you and the prisoner with one rope grim assent of the surrounding faces robinson sat down on the judgment seat not a little discomposed now then remonstrated one what are you waiting for name the jury me me me i i i and there was a rush for the office keep cool replied another lynch law goes quick but it goes by rule judge name the jury robinson a man whose wits seldom deserted him at once determined to lead since he could not resist he said with dignity i shall choose one juryman from each of the different countries that are working in this mine that no nation may seem to be slighted for this gold belongs to all the world hurrah well done judge three cheers for judge lynch when i call a country give me a name which i will inscribe on my report of the proceedings i want a currency lad first here is one william parker pass over france present pierre chanot germany here hans muller holland here jan van der stegen spain and italy were called but no reply asleep i take it united states here nathan tucker here robinson casting his eyes round spied mclaughlan and being minded to dilute the severity of his jury he cried out scotland mclaughlan you shall represent her no answer mclaughlan cried several voices where are ye don't you hear judge lynch speak to you come mclaughlan come over you are a respectable man mr mclaughlan intimated briefly in his native dialect that he was and intended to remain so by way of comment on which he made a bolt from the judgment hall but was rudely seized and dragged before the judge for heaven's sake don't be a fool mclaughlan no man must refuse to be a juryman in a trial by lynch i saw a quaker stoned to death for it in california i guess i was thyar said a voice behind the judge who shifted uneasily mclaughlan went into the jury box with a meaning look at robinson but without another audible word mercy mercy cried walker you must not interrupt the proceedings said judge lynch haud your whist ye gowk ye are no fand guilty yet remonstrated a juror the jury being formed the judge called the plaintiff the man sold me a claim for thirty pound i gave him the blunt because i saw the stuff was glittery well i worked it and i found it work rather easy that is a fact haw haw haw roared the crowd but with a horrible laughter no placability in it well i found lots of dust and i took it to the merchant and he says it is none of it gold that is my tale have you any witnesses i don't know yes the nigger he saw it here jacky come and tell them jacky was thrust forward but was interrupted by mclaughlan as soon as he opened his mouth the scottish juror declined to receive evidence but upon oath the judge allowed the objection swear him in then cried a hundred voices swear inquired jacky innocently another brutal roar of laughter followed jacky was offended what for you laugh you stupid fellows i not a common black fellow i been to sydney and learn all the white man knows jacky will swear added he left your hond cried mclaughlan it is no swearing if you dinna left your hond dat so stupid said jacky lifting his hand peevishly this done he delivered his evidence thus damme i saw dis fellow sell dirt to dis fellow and damme i saw dis fellow find a good deal gold and damme i heard him say dis is a dam good job and den damme he put down his spade and go to sell and directly he come back and say damme i am done aweel said mclaughlan we jaast refuse yon lad's evidence the deevelich heathen a threatening murmur silence hear the defendant walker trembling like an aspen owned to having sold the claim but denied that the dust was false this is what i dug out of it said he and he produced a small pinch of dust hand it to me said the judge it seems genuine put it to the test call the merchant for a witness cried another a party ran instantly for levi he refused to come they dragged him with fearful menaces a test old man a test of gold the old jew cast his eyes around took in the whole scene and with a courage few of the younger ones would have shown defied that wild mob i will give you no test i wash my hands of your mad passions and your mockeries of justice men of belial a moment's silence and wonder a yell of rage and a dozen knives in the air the judge rose hastily and in a terrible voice that governed the tumult for an instant said down knives i hang the first man that uses one in my court and during the momentary pause that followed this he cried out he has given me a test run and fetch me the bottle of acid on his table hurrah judge lynch forever was now the cry and in a minute the bottle was thrust into the judge's hand young man said isaac solemnly do not pour lest heaven bring your soul to as keen a test one day who are you that judge your brother judge lynch trembled visibly as the reverend man rebuked him thus but fearing isaac would go farther and pay the forfeit of his boldness he said calmly friends remove the old man from the court but use respect he is an aged man isaac was removed the judge took the bottle and poured a drop on that small pinch of dust the man had last given him no effect followed i pronounce this to be gold there put in mclaughlan ye see the lad was no deceiving ye is it his fault if a' the gowd is no the same no whimpered walker eagerly and the crowd began to whisper and allow he might be innocent the man standing behind the judge said with a cold sneer that is the stuff he did not sell now pour on the stuff he sold these words brought back the prejudice against the prisoner and a hundred voices shouted pour while their eyes gleamed with a terrible curiosity judge lynch awestruck by this terrible roar now felt what it is to be a judge he trembled and hesitated pour roared the crowd still louder and more fiercely mclaughlan read the judge's feeling and whimpered out let it fa' lad let it fa' if he does our knives fall on him and you pour robinson poured all their fierce eyes were fixed on the experiment he meant to pour a drop or two but the man behind him jogged his arm and half the acid in the bottle fell upon walker's dust a quantity of smoke rose from it and the particles fizzed and bubbled under the terrible test trash a rope no dig a hole and bury him no fling him off the rock into the water silence roared robinson i am the judge and it is for me to pronounce the verdict silence hear judge lynch silence was not obtained for five minutes during which the court was like a forest of wild beasts howling i condemn him to be exposed all day with his dust tied round his neck and then drummed out of the camp this verdict was received first with a yell of derisive laughter then with a roar of rage down with the judge we are the judges to the rock with him ay to the rock with him with this an all overpowering rush was made and walker was carried off up the rock in the middle of five hundred infuriated men the poor wretch cried mercy mercy justice dog was the roar in reply the raging crowd went bellowing up the rock like a wave and gained a natural platform forty feet above the great deep pool that lay dark and calm below at the sight of it the poor wretch screamed to wake the dead but the roars and yells of vengeance drowned his voice put his dust in his pocket cried one crueler than the rest their thirst of vengeance was too hot to wait for this diabolical proposal in a moment four of them had him by the shoulders and heels another moment and the man was flung from the rock uttering a terrible death cry in the very air then down his body fell like lead and struck with a tremendous plunge the deep water that splashed up a moment then closed and bubbled over it from that moment the crowd roared no longer but buzzed and murmured and looked down upon their work half stupidly hush what is that it is his head he is up again can he swim fling stones on him no let him alone or we'll fling you atop of him he is up but he can't swim he is only struggling he is down again he was down but only for a moment then he appeared again choking and gurgling mercy mercy justice thieving dog was the appalling answer save me save me oh save me save me save yourself if you are worth it was the savage reply the drowning despairing man's head was sinking again his strength exhausted by his idle struggles when suddenly on his left hand he saw a round piece of rock scarce a yard from him he made a desperate effort and got his hand on it alas it was so slimy he could not hold by it he fell off it into the water he struggled up again tried to dig his feet into the rock but after a convulsive fling of a few seconds fell back the slimy rock mocked his grasp he came up again and clung and cried piteously for help and mercy there was none but a grim silence and looks of horrible curiosity at his idle struggles his crime had struck at the very root of their hearts and lives then this poor cowardly wretch made up his mind that he must die he gave up praying to the pitiless who could look down and laugh at his death agony and he cried upon the absent only my children my wife my poor jenny and with this he shut his eyes and struggling no more sank quietly down down down first his shoulders disappeared then his chin then his eyes and then his hair who can fathom human nature that sad despairing cry which was not addressed to them knocked at the bosoms that all his prayers to them for pity had never touched a hasty low and uneasy murmur followed it almost as a report follows a flash his wife and children cried several voices with surprise but there were two men this cry not only touched but pierced the plaintiff and the judge the man has got a wife and children cried jem in dismay as he tried to descend the rock by means of some diminutive steps they never offended me he is gone down me if i see the man drowned like a rat hallo splash jem's foot had slipped and as he felt he must go he jumped right out and fell twenty feet into the water at this the crowd roared with laughter and now was the first shade of good nature mixed with the guffaw jem fell so near walker that on coming up he clutched the drowning man's head and dragged him up once more from death at the sight of walker's face above water again what did the crowd think you they burst into a loud hurrah and cheered jem till the echoes rang again hurrah bravo hurrah pealed the fickle crowd now walker no sooner felt himself clutched than he clutched in return with the deadly grasp of a drowning man jem struggled to get free in vain walker could not hear or see he was past all that but he could cling and he got jem round the arms and pinned them after a few convulsive efforts jem gave a loud groan he then said quietly to the spectators he will drown me in another half minute but at this critical moment out came from the other extremity of the pool judge lynch swimming with a long rope in his hand one end of this rope he had made into a bight ere he took the water he swam behind walker and jem whipped the noose over their heads and tightened it under their shoulders haul cried he to ede who held the other end of the rope ede hauled and down went the two heads a groan of terror and pity from the mob their feelings were reversed haul quick ede shouted robinson or you will drown them man alive ede hauled hand over hand and a train of bubbles was seen making all across the pool toward him and the next moment two dripping heads came up to hand close together like cherries on a stalk and now a dozen hands were at the rope and the plaintiff and defendant were lifted bodily up on to the flat rock which came nearly to the water's edge on this side the pool augh augh augh augh gasped jem walker said nothing he lay white and motionless water trickling from his mouth nose and ears robinson swam quietly ashore the rocks thundered with cheers over his head the next moment the many headed beast remembered that all this was a waste of time and bolted underground like a rabbit and dug and pecked for the bare life with but one thought left and that was gold how are you jem oh captain oh gasped poor jem i am choked i am dead i am poisoned why i'm full of water bring this other beggar to my tent and we will take a nanny goat together so jem was taken off hanging his head and deadly sick supported by two friends and walker was carried to the same tent and stripped and rubbed and rolled up in a blanket and lots of brandy poured down him and jem to counteract the poison they had swallowed robinson went to mr levi to see if he would lend him a suit while he got his own dried the old jew received my lord judge with a low ironical bow and sent nathan to borrow the suit from another israelite he then lectured my lord lynch learn from this young man how easy it is to set a stone rolling down hill how hard to stop it half way down law must always be above the mob or it cannot be law if it fall into their hands it goes down to their own level and becomes revenge passion cruelty anything but law the madmen they have lost two thousand ounces of gold to themselves and to the world while they have been wasting their time and risking their souls over a pound of brass and aspiring to play the judge and the executioner and playing nothing but the brute and the fool as in the days of old mr levi concluded by intimating that there was very little common sense left upon earth and that little it would be lost time to search for among the gentiles finally his discourse galled judge lynch who thereupon resolved to turn the laugh against him mr levi said he i see you know a thing or two will you be so good as to answer me a question if it come within my knowledge replied the senior with grave politeness which weighs the heaviest sir a pound of gold or a pound of feathers and he winked at nathan but looked in isaac's face as demure as a quakeress a pound of feathers replied isaac robinson looked half puzzled half satirical a childish question said isaac sternly what boy knows not that feathers are weighed by avoirdupois and gold by troy weight and consequently that a pound of feathers weighs sixteen ounces and a pound of gold but twelve well that is a new answer cried robinson good by sir you are too hard for me and he made off to his own tent it was a day of defeats the moment he was out of hearing isaac laughed the only time he had done it during six years and what a laugh how sublimely devoid of merriment a sudden loud cackle of three distinct cachinni not declining into a chuckle as we do but ending sharp in abrupt and severe gravity i discomfited the young man nathan i mightily discomfited him ha ha ho nathan did you as i bade you yes master i found the man and i sent samuel who went hastily to him and cried out 'mr meadows is in the camp and wishes to speak to you' master he started up in wonder and his whole face changed without doubt he is the man you suspected yes said isaac reflecting deeply the man is peter crawley and what does he here some deep villainy lies at the bottom of this but i will fathom it ay and thwart it i swear by the god of abraham let me think awhile in my tent sit you at the receipt of gold the old man sat upon a divan in his tent and pondered on all that had happened in the mine above all on the repeated attacks that had been made on that one tent he remembered too that george had said sorrowfully to him more than once no letters for me mr levi no letter again this month the shrewd old man tied these two threads together directly all these things are one said isaac levi thus pondering and patiently following out his threads the old man paced a mile down the camp to the post office for he had heard the postman's horn and he expected important letters from england from his friend and agent at farnborough old cohen there were letters from england but none in old cohen's hand he put them in his bosom with a disappointed look and paced slowly and deeply pondering back toward his tent he was about half way when much to his surprise a stone fell close to him he took however no notice did not even accelerate his pace or look round but the next moment a lump of clay struck him on the arm he turned round quivering with rage at the insult and then he saw a whole band of diggers behind him who the moment he turned his face began to hoot and pelt him who got poor walker drowned ah ah ah who refused to give evidence before judge lynch cried another ah ah ah there were clearly two parties in the mob down with the jew the blood sucker we do all the work and he gets all the profit ah ah ah and a lump of clay struck that reverend head and almost stunned the poor old man he sunk upon his knees and in a moment his coat was torn to shreds but with unexpected activity he wriggled himself free and drew a dagger long bright and sharp as a needle his assailants recoiled a moment the next a voice was heard from behind get on both sides of him at once isaac looked and saw peter crawley then the old man trembled for his life and cried help help and they hemmed him in and knocked his dagger out of his hand and hustled and pommeled him and would have torn him in pieces but he slipped down and two of them got in front and dragged him along the ground to walker's pool cried brutus putting himself at the head of those who followed all of a sudden isaac though half insensible heard a roar of rage that seemed to come from a lion a whiz a blow like a thunder clap saw one of his assassins driven into the air and falling like a dead clod three yards off found himself dropped and a man striding over him it was george fielding who stood a single moment snorting and blowing out his cheeks with rage then went slap at the mob as a lion goes at sheep seized one of the small ruffians by the knees and by a tremendous effect of strength and rage actually used him as a flail and struck brutus with the man's head and knocked that ruffian down stunned and his nose leveled with his cheeks the mob recoiled a moment from this one hero george knew it could be but for a moment so he had no sooner felled brutus and hurled the other's carcass in their faces than he pounced on isaac whipped him on his back and ran off with him he had got thirty yards with him ere the staggered mob could realize it all the mob recovered their surprise and with a yell like a pack of hounds bursting covert dashed after the pair the young hercules made a wonderful effort but no mortal man could run very fast so weighted in spite of his start they caught him in about a hundred yards he heard them close upon him put the jew down and whispered hastily run to your tent and instantly wheeled round and flung himself at thirty men he struck two blows and disabled a couple the rest came upon him like one battering ram and bore him to the ground but even as he went down he caught the nearest assailant by the throat and they rolled over one another the rest kicking savagely at george's head and loins the poor fellow defended his head with one arm and his assailant's body for a little while but he received some terrible kicks on the back and legs give it him on the head kick his life out settle his hash they were so fiercely intent on finishing george that they did not observe a danger that menaced themselves as a round shot cuts a lane through a column of infantry so clean came two files of special constables with their short staves severing the mob in two crick crack crick crick crick crick crack crack in three seconds ten heads were broken with a sound just like glass bottles under the short deadly truncheon and there lay half a dozen ruffians writhing on the ground and beating the devil's tattoo with their heels charge back cried the head policeman as soon as he had cut clean through but at the very word the cowardly crew fled on all sides yelling the police followed in different directions a little way and through this error three of the felled got up and ran staggering off when the head policeman saw that he cried out back and secure prisoners they caught three who were too stupefied to run and rescued brutus from george who had got him by the throat and was hammering the ground with his head let go george cried policeman robinson in some anxiety you are killing the man oh i don't want to kill him neither said george and he slowly withdrew his grasp and left off hammering with the rascal's head but looked at him as if he would have preferred to have gone on a little longer they captured the three others now secure them cried ede out with your wipes there is no need of wipes said robinson he then with a slight blush and rather avoiding george's eye put his hand in his pockets and produced four beautiful sets of handcuffs bran new polished to the fine with a magical turn of the hand he handcuffed the three men still avoiding george's eye unnecessary george's sense of humor was very faint and so was his sweetheart's a sad defect perhaps i may as well explain here how robinson came so opportunely to the rescue the fact is that a week ago he had ordered a lot of constables' staves and four sets of handcuffs the staves were nicely painted lettered captain robinson's police a b c etc they had just come home and robinson was showing them to ede and his gang when a hullabaloo was heard and levi was seen full half a mile off being hunted such an opportunity of trying the new staves was not to be neglected ede and his men jumped out of their claim and ran with robinson to the rescue but they would have been too late if george who had just come into the camp at that very part had not made his noble and desperate assault and retreat which baffled the assailants for two precious minutes robinson what shall we do with them now we have got them george give them a kick apiece on their behinds and let them go the rubbish robinson not if i know it ede i say blackguard 'em robinson no that would be letting ourselves down to their level no we will expose them as we did my old pal here before ede why that is what i mean ticket them put a black card on them with their offense wrote out large no sooner said than done all four were tied to posts in the sun and black carded or as some spell it placarded thus coward attacked and abused an old man n b not hanged this time because they got a licking then and there let us go and see after mr levi george well tom i had rather not why not he ought to be very much obliged to you that is it tom the old man is of rather a grateful turn of mind and it is ten to one if he doesn't go and begin praising me to my face and then that makes me i don't know which way to look wait till he has cooled upon it a bit you are a rum one well george i have got one proposal you won't say no to first i must tell you there is really a river of quartz in the country didn't i tell you yes and i didn't believe it but i have spoken to jacky about it and he has seen it it is on the other side of the bush i am ready to start for it to morrow for there is little good to be done here now the weather has broken george assented with joy but when robinson suggested that jacky would be very useful to pilot them through the bush his countenance fell don't think of it said he i know he is here tom and i shan't go after him but don't let him come near me the nasty little creeping murdering varmint poor abner will never get over his tomahawk not if he lives fifty years in short it was agreed they should go alone at peep of day i have talked it over with jem already and he will take charge of our tent till we come back so be it we must take some provisions with us george i'll go and get some cold meat and bread tom do i'm going to the tent robinson it is to be observed had not been in his tent since george and he left it and took their gold out of it just before sunrise as he now carried their joint wealth about his person his anxiety was transferred now at the door of the tent he was intercepted by jem very red in the face partly with brandy partly with rage walker whose life he had saved whom he had taken to his own tent and whom robinson had seen lying asleep in the best blanket this walker had absconded with his boots and half a pound of tobacco well but you knew he was a rogue why did you leave him alone in your tent i only left him for a minute to go a few steps with you if you remember and you said yourself he was asleep well the moment our backs were turned he must have got up and done the trick i don't like it said robinson no more don't i said jem if he was not asleep he must have heard me say i was going to cross the bush with my mate to morrow at daybreak well and what if he did he is like enough to have gone and told the whole gang and what if he has robinson was about to explain to jem that he now carried all the joint gold in his pocket but he forbore it is too great a stake for me to trust anybody unless i am forced thought he so he only said well it is best to be prudent i shall change the hour for starting you are a cunning one captain but i really think you are overcareful sometimes jem said the other gravely there is a mystery in this mine there is a black gang in it and that walker is one of them i think they have sworn to have my gold or my life and they shan't have either if i can help it i shall start two hours before the sun he was quite right walker had been shamming sleep and full four hours ago he had told his confederates as a matter of course all that he had heard in the enemy's camp walker a timid villain was unprepared for the burst of savage exultation from brutus and black will that followed this intelligence these two by an instinct quick as lightning saw the means of gratifying at one blow their cupidity and hate crawley had already told them he had seen robinson come out of levi's tent after a long stay and their other spies had told them his own tent had been left unguarded for hours they put these things together and conjectured at once that the men had now their swag about them in one form or other when do they go to morrow at break of day he said the bush is very thick and dark too it is just the place for a job will two of you be enough plenty the way we shall work the men are strong and armed their strength will be no use to them and they shan't get time to use their arms for heaven's sake shed no blood unnecessarily said crawley beginning to tremble at the pool of crime to whose brink he had led these men do you think they will give up their swag while they are alive asked brutus scornfully then i wash my hands of it all cried the little self deceiving caitiff and he affected to have nothing to do with it walker was then thanked for his information and he thought this was a good opportunity for complaining of his wrongs and demanding redress this fellow was a thorough egotist saw everything from his own point of view only jem had dragged him before judge robinson robinson had played the beak and found him guilty levi had furnished the test on which he had been convicted all these had therefore cruelly injured and nearly killed him himself was not the cause he had not set all these stones rolling by forging upon nature and robbing jem of thirty pounds no he could not see that nor did he thank jem one bit for jumping in and saving his life at risk of his own why did he ever get him thrown in the brute if he was not quite drowned he was nearly and jem the cause his confederates soothed him with promises of vengeance on all their three his enemies and soon after catching sight of one of them levi they kept their word they roused up some of the other diggers against isaac on the plea that he had refused to give evidence against walker and so they launched a mob and trusted to mob nature for the rest the recoil of this superfluous villainy was as often happens a blow to the head scheme brutus who was wanted at peep of day for the dark scheme already hinted at got terribly battered by george fielding and placarded and what was worse chained to a post by robinson and ede it became necessary to sound his body and spirit one of the gang was sent by crawley to inquire whether he felt strong enough to go with black will on that difficult and dangerous work to morrow the question put in a passing whisper was answered in a whisper i am as strong as a lion for revenge tell them i would not miss to morrow's work for all the gold in australia the lowering face spoke loud enough if the mouth whispered the message was brought back to black will and crawley what energy said crawley admiringly ay said black will that is your sort give me a pal with his skin smarting and his bones aching for the sort of job that wood shall see to morrow have they marked him he inquired with a strange curiosity i am afraid they have his nose is smashed frightful i am glad of it now we are brothers and will have blood for blood your expressions are dreadfully terse said crawley trying to smile but looking scared instead but i don't understand your remark you were not in the late unsuccessful attack on mr levi and you escaped most providentially in the night business the men have not marked you my good friend haven't they yelled the man with a tremendous oath haven't they look here a glance was enough crawley turned wan and shuddered from head to foot chapter lxvi we left robinson and jem talking at the entrance to the tent come in said robinson you will take care of this tent while we are gone jem promised faithfully he then asked robinson to explain to him the dodge of the gut lines robinson showed him and how the bells were rung at his head by the thief's foot jem complimented him highly robinson smiled but the next moment sighed they will be too clever for us some of these dark nights see how nearly they have nicked us again and again don't be down on your luck captain jem what frightens me is the villains getting off so there they are to try again and next time the luck will be theirs it can't be always ours why should it jem there was a man in my tent last night there is no denying that captain well jem i can't get it off my heart that i was to kill that man or he me everything was on my side i had my gut lines and i had a revolver and a cutlass and i took up the cutlass like a fool if i had taken up the revolver the man would be dead i took up the wrong and that man will be my death the cards never forgive i had the odd trick and didn't take it i shall lose the game no ye shan't cried jem hastily what if the man got clear for the moment we will hunt him out for you you give me his description i couldn't said robinson despondingly it was so dark here is his pistol but that is no use if i had but a clew ay ever so slight i'd follow it up but no there is none hallo what is the matter what is it what on earth is the man looking at like that what was you asking for stammered jem wasn't it a clew yes robinson got up and came to jem who was standing with dilated eyes looking at the ground in the very corner of the tent he followed the direction of jem's eyes and was instantly transfixed with curiosity and rising horror take it up jem he gasped no you take it up it was you who no yes there is george's voice i wouldn't let him see such a thing for the world oh god here is another another yes in the long grass and there is george's voice come out jem not a word to george for the world i want to talk to you if it hasn't turned me sick i should make a poor hangman but it was in self defense thank heaven for that where are you going in such a hurry tom said george oh only a little way with jem don't be long it is getting late no george jem this is an ugly job an ugly job no him i wish it was his head give them me captain what will you take charge of them that i will captain and what is more i'll find your enemy out by them and when you come back he shall be in custody waiting your orders give them me yes take them oh but i am glad to be rid of them what a ghastly look they have i don't care for their looks i am right glad to see them they are a clew and no mistake keep dark to night don't tell this to ede he is a good fellow but chatters too much let me work it out i'll find the late owner double quick said jem with a somewhat brutal laugh your orders about the prisoners captain cried ede coming up robinson reflected turn them all loose but one and what shall i do with him hum put a post up in your own tent yes tie him to it in his handcuffs give him food enough and when shall we loose him at noon to morrow it shall be done but you must come and show me which of the four it is robinson went with ede and his men turn this one loose said he it was done on the instant and this and this and laying his finger on brutus keep this one prisoner in your tent handcuffed and chained till noon to morrow at the touch brutus trembled with hate at the order his countenance fell like cain's full two hours before sunrise the patrol called robinson by his own order and the friends made for the bush with a day's provision and their blankets their picks and their revolvers when they arrived at the edge of the bush robinson halted and looked round to see if they were followed the night was pretty clear no one was in sight the men struck rapidly into the bush which at this part had been cut and cleared in places lying as it did so near a mine what are we to run tom yes i want to get to the river of quartz as soon as possible was the dry answer with all my heart after running about half a mile george pulled up and they walked what do you keep looking behind for tom oh nothing you fidget me tom can't help it i shall be like that till daylight they have shaken my nerves among them don't give way to such nonsense what are you afraid of i am not afraid of anything come george another run oh as you like this beats all this run brought them to the end of the broad road and they found two smaller paths after some hesitation robinson took the left hand one and it landed them in such a terribly thick scrub they could hardly move they forced their way through it getting some frightful scratches but after struggling with it for a good half hour began to fear it was impenetrable and interminable when the sun rising showed them a clear space some yards ahead they burst through the remainder of the scrub and came out upon an old clearing full a mile long and a quarter of a mile broad they gave a hurrah at the sight of it but when they came to walk on it the ground was clay and so sticky with a late shower that they were like flies moving upon varnish and at last were fain to take off their shoes and stockings and run over it on the tips of their toes at the end of this opening they came to a place like the seven dials no end of little paths into the wood and none very promising after a natural hesitation they took the one that seemed to be most on their line of march and followed it briskly till it brought them plump upon a brook and there it ended robinson groaned confound the bush cried he you were wrong not to let me bring jacky what is to be done go back i hate going back i would rather go thirty miles ahead than one back i've got an idea off shoes and paddle up the stream perhaps we shall find a path that comes to it from the other side they paddled up the stream a long way and at last sure enough they found a path that came down to the stream from the opposite side they now took a hasty breakfast washing it down with water from the brook then dived into the wood the sun was high in heaven yet still they had not got out of the bush i can't make it out george there is nothing to steer by and these paths twist and turn so i don't think we shall do any good till night when i see the southern cross in the sky i shall be able to steer northeast that is our line don't give in said george i think it looks clearer ahead i believe we are at the end of it no such luck i am afraid was the despondent reply for all that in a few yards more they came upon an open place they could not help cheering at last cried they but this triumph gave way to doubts i am afraid we are not clear yet said robinson see there is wood again on the other side why it is that sticky clay again why george it is the clearing we crossed before breakfast you are talking nonsense tom cried george angrily no i am not said the other sadly come across we shall soon know by our footsteps in the clay sure enough half way across they found a track of footsteps george was staggered it is the place i really think said he but tom when you talk of the footsteps look here you and i never made all these tracks this is the track of a party robinson examined the ground tracks of three men two barefoot one in nailed boots well is that us look at the clearing george you have got eyes it is the same so 'tis but i can't make out the three tracks robinson groaned i can this third track has come since we went by no doubt of that tom well well don't you see no what you and i are being hunted george looked blank a moment can't we be followed without being hunted no others might but not me we are being hunted said robinson sternly george i am sick of this let us end it let us show these fellows they are hunting lions and not sheep is your revolver loaded yes then come on and he set off to run following the old tracks george ran by his side his eyes flashing with excitement they came to the brook robinson showed george that their pursuer had taken some steps down the stream no matter said he don't lose time george go right up the bank to our path he will have puzzled it out you may take your oath sure enough they found another set of footsteps added to their own robinson paused before entering the wood he put fresh caps on his revolver now george said he in a low voice we couldn't sleep in this wood without having our throats cut but before night i'll be out of danger or in my grave for life is not worth having in the midst of enemies hush hus s sh you must not speak to me but in a whisper no whispered george nor rustle against the boughs no i won't whispered george but make me sensible tom tell me what all this caution is to lead to what are you doing i am hunting the hunter hissed robinson with concentrated fury and he glided rapidly down the trodden path his revolver cocked his ears pricked his eye on fire and his teeth clinched george followed silent and cautious his revolver ready cocked in his hand as they glided thus following their own footsteps and hunting their hunter with gloomy brows and nerves quivering and hearts darkening with anger and bitterness sudden a gloom fell upon the wood it darkened and darkened meantime a breeze chill as ice disturbed its tepid and close air forerunner of a great wind which was soon heard first moaning in the distance then howling and rushing up and sweeping over the tall trees and rocking them like so many bulrushes a great storm was coming chapter lxvii this very afternoon mr levi came to inquire for george fielding unable to find him he asked of several diggers where the young man was he could get no information till jem saw him and came and told him now when he heard they were gone and not expected back for some days isaac gave quite a start and showed a degree of regret and vexation that jem was puzzled to account for on reflection he begged jem to come to his tent there he sat down and wrote a letter young man said he i do entreat you to give this to george fielding the moment he returns to the camp why did he go without coming to see me my old heart is full of misgivings you needn't have any sir said jem surprised at the depth of feeling in the old jew's face and voice he shall have the letter you may depend levi thanked him he then said to nathan strike the tents collect our party and let us be gone what going to leave us sir yes young man this very hour well now i am sorry for that and so will the captain be and his pal that you think so much of we shall not be long parted said the old man in his sweet musical eastern accent not very long if you are faithful to your trust and give the good young man my letter may good angels hover round him may the god of abraham isaac and jacob guard him amen said rough jem for the reverend face glowed with piety and the voice was the voice of prayer suddenly an unpleasant reflection occurred to jem well but if you go who is to buy our gold dust the christian merchants said isaac with an indifferent air but they are such jews cried jem inadvertently i mean i mean and rough as he was he looked as if he could have bitten his tongue off i know what you mean said isaac sadly he added such as they are they are all you have now the old jew was hunted and hooted and insulted in this place yesterday here then he trades no more those who set no value on him can of course supply his place the blackguards cried jem the ruffians i wish i had seen them come mr levi that was not the mine that was only the riffraff you might forgive us that i never forgive was the calm reply chapter lxviii a tremendous snow storm fell upon the mine and drove jem into his tent where he was soon after joined by jacky a circumstance in itself sufficient to prove the violence of the storm for jacky loathed indoors it choked him a good deal the more was jem surprised when he heard a lamentable howl coming nearer and nearer and a woman burst into his tent a mere pillar of snow for she was covered with a thousand flakes each as big as a lady's hand ochone ochone ochone cried mary mcdogherty and on being asked what was the matter she sat down and rocked herself and moaned and cried ochone och captain avick what will i do for you an' who will i find to save you an' oh it is the warm heart and the kind heart ye had to poor molly mcdogherty that ud give her life to save yours this day the captain cried jem in great alarm what is wrong with the captain he is lying could and stiff in the dark bloody wood och the murthering villains och what will i do at all och captain avick warm was your heart to the poor irish boys but it is could now ochone ochone woman cried jem in great agitation leave off blubbering and tell me what is the matter thus blandly interrogated mary told him a story often interrupted with tears and sighs of what had been heard and seen yester eve by one of the irish boys a story that turned him cold for it left on him the same impression it had left on the warmhearted irishwoman that at this moment his good friend was lying dead in the bush hard by he rose and loaded robinson's double barreled gun he loaded it with bullets and as he rammed them fiercely down he said angrily leave off crying and wringing your hands what on earth is the use of that here goes to save him or to revenge him an' och james take the wild ingine wid ye they know them bloody murthering woods better than our boys glory be to god for taching them that same of course i shall take him you hear jacky will you show me how to find the poor dear captain and his mate if they are in life if they are alive jacky will find them a good deal soon if they are dead still jacky will find them the irishwoman's sorrow burst out afresh at these words the savage then admitted the probability of that she dreaded and their enemies the cowardly villains what will you do to them asked jem black with rage jacky's answer made mary scream with affright and startled even jem's iron nerves for a moment at the very first word of the irishwoman's story the savage had seated himself on the ground with his back turned to the others and unnoticed by them had rapidly painted his face with the war paint of his tribe words cannot describe the ghastly terrors the fiendish ferocity these traditional lines and colors gave his countenance this creature that looked so like a fiend came erect into the middle of the tent with a single bound as if that moment vomited forth by hell and yet with a grander carriage and princelier presence than he had worn in time of peace and even as he bounded he crossed his tomahawk and narrow wooden shield to signify that his answer was no vulgar asseveration but a vow of sacred war kalingalunga will kill them and drink their blood kalingalunga glided from the tent jem followed him the snow fell in flakes as large as a lady's hand and the air was dark jem could not see where the hunter was taking him but he strode after him and trusted to his sagacity five hours' hard walking and then the snow left off the air became clear and to jem's surprise the bush instead of being on his right hand was now on his left and there on its skirts about a mile off was the native camp they had hardly come in sight of it when it was seen to break from quietude into extraordinary bustle what is up asked jem the hunter smiled and pointed to his own face kalingalunga painted war what eyes the beggars must have said jem the next minute a score of black figures came tearing up in such excitement that their long rows of white teeth and the whites of their eyes flashed like budelights in their black heads kalingalunga soon calmed them down by letting them know that he was painted for a private not a national feud he gave them no further information i suspect he was too keen a sportsman to put others on the scent of his game he went all through the camp and ascertained from the stragglers that no men answering the description of george and robinson had passed out of the wood they are in the wood said he he then ordered a great fire bade jem dry his clothes and eat he collected two of his wives and committed jem to their care and glided like a panther into the wood what with the great heat succeeding to the great cold and the great supper the gins gave him jem fell fast asleep it was near daylight when a hand was laid on his shoulder and there was kalingalunga not a track on the snow no then let us hope they are not in the wood the hunter hung his head me tink they are in the wood said he gravely jem groaned then they are lying under the soil of it or in some dark pit kalingalunga reflected he replied to this effect that there were no more traces of an assassin than of victims consequently that it was impossible to know anything and that it was a good deal too stupid to speak a good deal knowing nothing all this time jem's fear and rage and impatience contrasted greatly with the philosophic phlegm of the pict who looked so fierce and took it all so cool ending with an announcement that now kalingalunga would sleep a good deal the chief was soon asleep but not till he had ordered his gins to wake him the moment the snow should be melted this occurred at noon and after snatching a hasty meal he put a tomahawk into jem's hands and darted into the bush all the savage's coldness disappeared now he was at work he took jem right across the wood from southeast to northwest nothing stopped him when the scrub was thick above but hollow below he threw himself on his belly and wriggled along like a snake when it was all thick he hacked into it with fury and forced a path when it was impenetrable he went round it and by some wonderful instinct got into the same line again thus they cut clean across the wood but found no tracks then the savage being out in the open trotted easily down the woodside to the southwest point here he entered and took a line straight as an arrow to the northeast it was about five in the afternoon kalingalunga was bleeding all over with scratches and jem was torn to pieces and done up he was just about to tell the other that he must give in when kalingalunga suddenly stopped and pointed to the ground track what of a white man's shoe how many are there one jem sighed i doubt it is a bad job jacky said he follow not too close was the low reply and the panther became a serpent so smooth and undulating were the motions with which he glided upon the track he had now discovered jem well aware that he could not move noiselessly like the savage obeyed him and crept after at some distance the savage had followed the man's footsteps about half a mile and the white man the savage when suddenly both were diverted from their purpose kalingalunga stood still and beckoned jem jem ran to him and found him standing snuffing the air with his great broad nostrils like a stag what is it white fellow burn wambiloa wood how d'ye know how d'ye know wambiloa wood smell a good way off when him burn and how do you know it is a white man black fellow never burn wambiloa wood not good to burn that keep it for milmeridien the chief now cut off a few of his long hairs and held them up to ascertain the exact direction of the wind this done he barked a tree to mark the spot to which he had followed the trail and striking out into quite a different direction he hunted by scent jem expected to come on the burning wambiloa very soon but he underrated either the savage's keen scent or the acrid odor of the sacred wood perhaps both they had gone half a mile at least before his companion thought it necessary to show any caution at last he stopped short and then jem smelled a smell as if cinnamon and ginger nutmegs and cloves were all blazing in one bonfire with some difficulty he was prevailed on to stand still and let the subtle native creep on nor would he consent to be inactive until the other solemnly vowed to come back for him and give him his full share of the fighting then kalingalunga went gliding like a shadow and flitted from tree to tree woe be to the enemy the subtle noiseless pitiless remorseless savage surprises he has not put on his war paint in sport or for barren show chapter lxix a man was hunting robinson and george fielding and they were hunting him both parties inflamed with rage and bitterness both master of the other's fate they thought a change of wind brought a fall of snow and the fall of snow baffled both parties in five minutes down came the australian flakes large as a woman's hand i am not romancing and effaced the tracks of the pursuing and pursued and pursuers so tremendous was the fall that the two friends thought of nothing but shelter they drew their blankets over their heads and ran hither and thither looking for a friendly tree at last they found an old tree with a prodigious stem that parted about ten feet up into two forks with some effort they got up into this cleft and then they were on a natural platform robinson always carried nails in his pocket and he contrived to nail the two blankets to the forks so as to make a screen then they took out their provisions and fortified themselves with a hearty supper as they were eating it they were suddenly startled by an explosion so tremendous that their tree seemed to have been struck by lightning out went robinson with his mouth full on to a snowdrift four feet high he looked up and saw the cause of the fracas a large bough of a neighboring tree had parted from the trunk with the enormous weight of the snow robinson climbed back to george and told him supper recommenced but all over the wood at intervals they now heard huge forks and boughs parting from their parent stems with a report like a thirty two pounder ringing and echoing through the wood others so distant that they were like crackers these sounds were very appalling in the ghostly wood the men instinctively drew closer to each other but they were no chickens use soon hardened them even to this they settled it that the forks they were sitting on would not give way because there were no leaves on them to hold a great burden of snow and soon they yielded to nature and fell fast asleep in spite of all the dangers that hemmed them at his regular hour just before sunrise robinson awoke and peeped from below the blanket he shook george getup directly george we are wasting time when time is gold what is it 'what is it' there is a pilot in the sky that will take us out of this cursed trap if the day does not come and spoil all george's eye followed robinson's finger and in the center of the dark vault of heaven this glittered southern cross constellation chapter lxx i know it tom when i was sailing to this country we came to a part where the north star went down and down to the water's edge and this was all we got in exchange for it george said tom rather sternly how do you know they don't hear us and here we are surrounded by enemies and would you run down our only friend that silver star will save our lives if they are to be saved at all come on and george if you were to take your revolver and blow out my brains it is no more than i deserve for sleeping away the precious hours of night when i ought to have been steering out of this cursed timber net by that blessed star with these words robinson dived into the wood steering due east by the southern cross it was like going through a frozen river the scrub was loaded with snow which it discharged in masses on the travelers at every step keep your revolver dry in your hat and your lucifers too cried robinson we shall have to use them both ten to one as to our skins that is hopeless then the men found how hard it is to take a line and keep it in the australian bush when the southern cross was lost in a cloud though but for a minute they were sure to go all wrong as they found upon its reappearance and sometimes the scrub was impenetrable and they were forced to go round it and walk four hundred yards advancing eastward but twenty or thirty thus they battled on till the sun rose now we shall be all in the dark again said poor robinson here comes a fog stop tom said george oughtn't we to make this good before we go on what do you mean we have come right by the star so far have we not yes then let us bark fifty of these trees for a mark i have seen that varmint jacky do that a capital idea george out with our knives here goes no breakfast to day tom no george nor dinner either till we are out of the wood these two poor fellows walked and ran and crept and struggled all day sometimes hoping sometimes desponding at last at five o'clock in the afternoon their bellies gnawed with hunger their clothes torn to rags their skin bleeding they came out upon some trees with the bark stripped they gave one another a look that words can hardly paint they were the trees they had barked twelve hours ago the men stood silent neither cared to tell the other all he felt for now there crept over these two stout bosoms a terrible chill the sense of a danger new to them in experience but not new in report they had heard of settlers and others who had been lost in the fatal labyrinth of the australian bush and now they saw how easily it might be true we may as well sit down here and rest we shall do no good till night what are you in pain george yes tom a little where something gnaws my stomach like an adder oh that is the soldier's gripes said tom with a ghastly attempt at a jest poor george said he kindly i dare say you never knew what it was to go twenty four hours without food before never in my life tom well i have and i'll tell you the only thing to do when you can't fill the breadbasket shut it go to sleep till the southern cross comes out again what sleep in our dripping clothes no we will make a roaring fire with these strips of bark they are dry as tinder by now a pyre four feet high was raised the strips being laid from north to south and east to west alternately and they dried their blankets and warmed their smoking bodies george i have got two cigars they must last us two days oh i'm no great smoker keep them for your own comfort robinson wore a sad smile we can't afford to smoke them this is to chew it is not food george but it keeps the stomach from eating itself we must do the best for our lives we can for susan's sake give it me tom i'll chew it and thank you kindly you are a wise companion in adversity tom it is a great grief to me that i have brought you into this trouble looking for what i know you think is a mare's nest as the saying is don't talk so george true pals like you and me never reproach one another they stand and fall together like men the fire is warm george that is one comfort the fire is well enough but there's nothing down at it i'd give a hundred pounds for a mutton chop the friends sat like sacrifices by the fire and chewed their cigars in silence with foreboding hearts after a while as the heat laid hold of him george began to dose robinson felt inclined to do the same but the sense that perhaps a human enemy might be near caused him to fight against sleep in this exposed locality so whenever his head bobbed down he lifted it sharply and forced his eyes open it was on one of these occasions that looking up he saw set as it were in a frame of leaves a hideous countenance glaring at him it was painted in circular lines red blue and white get up george roared robinson they are upon us and both men were on their feet revolvers pointed the leaves parted and out came this diabolical face which they had never seen before but with it a figure they seemed to know and a harsh cackle they instantly recognized and it sounded like music to them oh my dear jacky cried george who'd have thought it was you well you are a godsend good afternoon oh jacky how d'ye do jacky not jacky now cos um a good deal angry and paint war kalingalunga berywelltanku he always took these four words for one now i go fetch white fellow and he disappeared who is he going to fetch is it the one that was following us no doubt then tom it was not an enemy after all jacky came back with jem who at sight of them alive and well burst into extravagances he waved his hat round his head several times and then flung it into a tree then danced a pas seul consisting of steps not one of them known at the opera house and chanted a song of triumph the words of which were ri tol de riddy iddydol and the ditty naught finally he shook hands with both never say die well that is hearty and how thoughtful of him to come after us and above all to bring jacky that it was replied george jem said he with feeling i don't know but what you have saved two men's lives if i don't it shan't be my fault farmer george oh jacky i am so hungry i have been twenty four hours without food kalingalunga you stupid fellow to go widout food always a good deal food in bush george is there then for heaven's sake go and get us some of it kalingalunga no need go food here he stepped up to the very tree against which george was standing showed him an excrescence on the bark made two clean cuts with his tomahawk pulled out a huge white worm and offered it george george turned from it in disgust the wild chief grinned superior and ate it himself and smacked his lips with infinite gusto meantime his quick eye had caught sight of something else a good deal dinner in dis tree said he and he made the white men observe some slight scratches on the bark possum claws go up tree then he showed them that there were no marks with the claw reversed a clear proof the animal had not come down possum in tree the white men looked up into the bare tree with a mixture of wonder and incredulity jacky cut steps with his tomahawk and went up the main stem which was short and then up a fork one out of about twelve among all these he jumped about like a monkey till he found one that was hollow at the top throw kalingalunga a stone den he find possum a good deal quick they could not find a stone for their lives so being hungry robinson threw a small nugget of gold he had in his pocket jacky caught it placed it at the top of the hollow fork and let it drop listening keenly his fine ear heard the nugget go down the fork striking the wood first one side then another and then at a certain part sound no more down he slips to that silent part makes a deep cut with his tomahawk just above the spot thrusts in his hand and pulls out a large opossum yelling and scratching and emitting a delicious scent in an agony of fear the tomahawk soon silenced him and the carcass fell among the applauding whites now it was robinson's turn he carved the raw animal for greater expedition and george helped him to wrap each limb and carcass in a thin covering of clay thus prepared it was thrust into the great pile of burning ashes look yonder do look at that jem why jem what are you up to patroling like a sentinel out there never you heed jem was the dry reply you mind the roast captain and i'll mind my business and jem continued to parade up and down with his gun cocked and his eye piercing the wood to robinson's repeated and uneasy inquiries what meant this pantomime jem persisted in returning no answer but this you want your dinner captain eat your dinner and then i'll hoffer a hobservation meantime as these woods are queer places a little hextra caution is no sin the pie dishes were now drawn out of the ashes and broken and the meat baked with all its juices was greedily devoured it tastes like a rabbit stuffed with peppermint said george and uncommon nice it is now i am another man so am i jacky forever now jem i have dined your story if you please why are you here for you are a good fellow but you haven't got gumption enough to say to yourself 'these two will get lost in the bush i'll take jacky and pull them out' you are right captain that wasn't the way at all and since your belly is full and your courage up you will be able to enjoy my story better than you could afore yes so let us have it and robinson leaned back luxuriously being filled and warmed first and foremost commenced this artful narrator there is a chap prowling in this wood at the present time with a double barreled gun to blow out your brains captain the devil cried robinson starting to his feet and yours farmer how do you know asked george without moving that is what i am going to tell you that mary mcdogherty came crying to my tent all through the snow 'what is up' says i says she 'murder is up' then she told me her cousin an irish boy was at bevan's store and he heard some queer talk and he looked through a chink in the wall and saw two rascals putting their heads together and he soon made out they were driving a bargain to rob you two one was to do it the other was a egging him on 'i must have fifty pounds first' says this one 'why' says the other 'because he has been and locked my pal up that was to be in it with me' ah cried robinson go on jem there is a clew anyway i have got a thicker one behind says the other 'agreed when will you have it' 'why now' says t'other then this one gave him a note pat couldn't see that it was a fifty but no doubt it was but he saw the man take it and put it in a little tin box and shove it in his bosom that note was the price of blood said robinson oh the black hearted villains tell me who they were that is all tell me but who they were the boy didn't know there it is always so the fools they never know stop a bit captain there is a clew your own word ay and what is the clew as soon as ever the note was safe in his bosom he says 'i sold you blind mate i'd have given fifty sooner than not done this job look here' says he 'i have sworn to have a life for each of these' and captain said jem suddenly lowering his voice with that it seems he held up his right hand well yes yes eh and there were two fingers a missing on it ah now those two fingers are the ones you chopped off with your cutlass the night when the tent was attacked why tom what is this you never told me of this cried george and which are in my pocket in your pocket said george drawing away from him ay farmer wrapped up in silver paper and they shall never leave my pocket till i have fitted them on the man and seen him hung or shot with them two pickers and stealers tied round his bloodthirsty mercenairy aass aassinating neck say that i said it george jacky show us the way out of this wood kalingalunga bowed assent but he expressed a wish to take with him some of the ashes of the wambiloa george helped him robinson drew jem aside you shouldn't have mentioned that before george you have disgusted him properly oh hang him he needn't be so squeamish why i've had 'em salt there there drop it jem do captain are you going to let them take us out of the wood before we have hunted it for that scoundrel yes i am look here jem we are four and he is one but a double barreled gun is an awkward enemy in a dark wood no jem we will outwit him to the last we will clear the wood and get back to the camp he doesn't know we have got a clew to him he will come back without fear and we will nail him with the fifty pound note upon him and then jack ketch the whole party was now on the move led by kalingalunga bearing the sacred ashes what on earth is he going to do with them the chief heard this query and looking back said gravely he take them to 'milmeridien' and the party followed jacky who twisted and zigzagged about the bush till at last he brought them to a fairy spot whose existence in that rugged wood none of them had dreamed possible it was a long open glade meandering like a river between two deep irregular fringes of the drooping acacia and another lovely tree which i only know by its uncouth unmelodious scientiuncular name the eucalyptus this tree as well as the drooping acacia leaned over the ground with long leaves like disheveled hair kalingalunga paused at the brink and said to his companions in a low awestruck voice milmeridien the glade was full of graves some of them fresh glittering with bright red earth under the cool green acacias others richly veiled with golden moss more or less according to their age and in the recesses of the grove peeped smoother traces of mortality mossy mounds a thousand years old and others far more ancient still now mere excrescences of green known to be graves only by the light of that immense gradation of times and dates and epochs the floor of the open glade was laid out as a vast parterre each grave a little flower bed round square oval or rhomboid and all round each bed flowed in fine and graceful curves little paths too narrow for a human foot primeval tradition had placed them there that spirits might have free passage to visit all the mighty dead for here reposed no vulgar corpses here their heads near the surface but their feet deep in earth sat the great hunters and warriors of every age of the race of kalingalunga once a great nation though now a failing tribe they sat there this many a day their weapons in their hands ready to start up whenever the great signal should come and hunt once more but without fatigue in woods boundless as the sea and with bodily frames no longer mortal to knock and be knocked on the head ad infinitum simple and benign creed a cry of delight burst from the white men and they were going to spread themselves over the garden of the dead the savage checked them with horror nobody walk there while him alive said he now you follow me and not speak any words at all or kalingalunga will leave you in the bush hush the savage paused that even the echo of his remonstrance might die well away before he traversed the garden he then bowed his head down upon his breast in a set manner and so remained quiet a few seconds in that same attitude he started and walked slowly by the verge of the glade keeping carefully clear of the graves and never raising his head about half way he stopped and reverently scattered the ashes of the wambiloa upon three graves that lay near the edge then forward silent downcast reverential mors omnibus est communis the white men even down to jem understood and sympathized with kalingalunga in this garden of the dead of all ages they felt their common humanity and followed their black brother silent and awestruck melted too by the sweet and sacred sorrow of this calm scene for here death seemed to relax his frown and the dead but to rest from trouble and toil mourned by gentle tender trees and in truth it was a beautiful thought of these savage men to have given their dead for companions those rare and drooping acacias that bowed themselves and loosed their hair so like fair women abandoned to sorrow over the beloved and dead and night and morning swept with their dewy eyelashes the pillows of the brave requiescant in pace resurgant in pacem for i wish them better than they wished themselves after milmeridien came a thick scrub through which kalingalunga tracked his way and then a loud hurrah burst from all for they were free the net was broken there were the mountains before them and the gaunt wood behind them at last the native camp was visible two miles distant and thither the party ran and found food and fires in abundance black sentinels were set at such distances as to render a surprise impossible and the travelers were invited to sleep and forget all their troubles robinson and jem did sleep and george would have been glad to and tried but was prevented by an unfortunate incident les enfans terribles found out his infirmity viz that nothing they could do would make him hit them so half a dozen little rascals potter bellied than you can conceive climbed up and down george sticking in their twenty claws like squirrels and feeling like cold slippery slugs thus was sleep averted until a merciful gin hearing the man's groans came and cracked two or three of these little black pots with a waddie or club so then george got leave to sleep and just as he was dozing off ting tong ti tong tong tong came a fearful drumming of parchment a corroboree or native dance was beginning no more sleep till that was over so all hands turned out a space was cleared in the wood women stood on both sides with flaming boughs and threw a bright red light upon a particular portion of that space the rest was dark as pitch time midnight when the white men came up the dancing had not begun kalingalunga was singing a preliminary war song george had picked up some of the native language and he explained to the other that jacky was singing about some great battle near the wurra gurra river the wurra gurra why that is where we first found gold why of course it is and yes i thought so thought what it is our battle he is describing which of 'em we live in hot water the one before jem was our friend what is he singing oh come that is overdoing it jacky why jem he is telling them he killed you on the spot i'll punch his head no take it easy said robinson he is a poet this is what they call poetical license lie without sense i call it when here is the man ting tong ting tong tong i slew him he fell by the wurra gurra river i slew him ting tong he fell ting tong by the wurra gurra river ting ting tong this line jacky repeated at least forty times but he evaded monotony by the following simple contrivance i slew him he fell by the wurra gurra river ting tong i slew him he fell by the wurra gurra river i slew him he fell by the wurra gurra river with similar changes and then back again one of our own savages saved a great poet from monotony by similar means very good of him the elder sheridan who used to teach his pupils to tresh dead dryden out thus none but the bravenone but the bravenone but the brave deserve the fair and now the gins took up the tune without the words and the dance began to it first two figures ghastly with white paint came bounding like jacks in the box out of the gloom into the red light and danced gracefully then one more popped out then another at set intervals of time then another all painted differently and swelled the dance by degrees and still as the dance grew in numbers the musicians sang and drummed louder and faster by well planned gradations and the motion rose in intensity till they all warmed into the terrible savage corroboree jump legs striding wide head turned over one shoulder the eyes glaring with fiendish intensity in one direction the arms both raised and grasping waddies and boomerangs till at last they worked up to such a gallop of fierce buck like leaps that there was a jump for each beat of the music now they were in four lines and as the figures in the front line jumped to the right each keeping his distance to a hair the second line jumped to the left the third to the right and the fourth to the left the twinkle and beauty and symmetry of this was admirable and strange as it may appear not only were the savages now wrought up to frenzy at this climax of the dance but the wonderful magnetic influence these children of nature have learned to create and launch in the corroboree so stirred the white men's blood that they went half mad too and laughed and shouted and danced and could hardly help flinging themselves among the mad fiends and jumping and yelling with them and when the jump was at its fiercest and quickest and the great frenzy boiling over these cunning artists brought it to a dead stop sharp upon the climax and all was still in another minute they were all snoring but george and robinson often started in their slumbers dreaming they saw the horrid figures the skeletons lizards snakes tartan shawls and whitened fiends the whole lot blazing at the eyes and mouth like white budelights come bounding one after another out of the black night into the red torchlight and then go striding and jumping and glaring and raging and bucking and prancing and scattering battle and song and joy and rage and inspiration and stark staring frenzy all around they awoke at daylight rather cold and found piles of snow upon their blankets and the lizards and skeletons and imps and tartan shawls deteriorated the snow had melted on their bodies and the colors had all run some of them away quid multa we all know how beauties look when the sun breaks on them after a ball they asked for jacky to their great chagrin he was not to be found they waited getting crosser and crosser till nine o'clock and then out comes my lord from the wood walking toward them with his head down on his bosom the picture of woe the milmeridien movement over again there don't let us scold him said george i am sure he has lost a relation or maybe a dear friend anyway i hope it is not his sweetheart poor jacky well jacky i am glad you have washed your face now i know you again you can't think how much better you look in your own face than painted up in that unreasonable way like like like i dono what all like something between a devil and a rainbow suggested robinson but what is wrong asked george kindly i am almost afraid to ask though encouraged by the tone of sympathy the afflicted chief pointed to his face sighed and said kalingalunga paint war and now kalingalunga wash um face and not kill anybody first kalingalunga jacky again and show your white place in um hill a good deal soon and the amiable heathen cleared up a little at the prospect of serving george whom he loved aboriginally jem remained with the natives upon some frivolous pretense his real hope was to catch the ruffian whom he secretly believed to be still in the wood he is like enough to creep out this way thought jem and then won't i nail him in half an hour they were standing under the spot whose existence robinson had so often doubted well george you painted it true it really is a river of quartz running between those two black rocks and that you think is the home of the gold eh well i do look here tom look at this great large heap of quartz bowlders all of different sizes they have all rolled down here out of that river of quartz why of course they have who doubts that many is the time i have sat on that green mound where jacky is sitting now and eaten my bread and cheese i dare say but what has that to do with it what are we to do are we to go up the rock and peck into that mass of quartz well i think it is worth while why it would be like biting a piece out of the world look here master george we can put your notion about the home of the gold to the test without all that trouble as how you own all these quartz stones rolled out of yon river if so they are samples of it ten thousand quartz stones is quite sample enough so begin and turn them all over examine them break them if you like if we find but a speck of gold in one of them i'll believe that quartz river is gold's home if not it is all humbug george pulled a wry face he found himself pinned to his own theory well said he i own the sample tells us what is in the barn so now i am vexed for bringing you here now we are here give it a fair trial let us set to and break every bowlder in the thundering heap they went to work and picked the quartz bowlders full two hours they worked and by this time they had made a considerable heap of broken quartz it glittered in the sun but it glittered white not a speck of yellow came to light george was vexed robinson grinned expecting nothing he was not disappointed besides he was winning an argument and we all like to turn out prophets presently a little cackle from jacky i find um find what asked robinson without looking up a good deal yellow stone replied jacky with at least equal composure let me see that said george with considerable curiosity and they both went to jacky now the fact is that this heap of quartz stones was in reality much larger than they thought only the greater part of it had been overgrown with moss and patches of grass a few centuries of centuries ago jacky seated on what seemed a grassy mound was in reality perched upon a part of the antique heap his keen eye saw a little bit of yellow protruding through the moss and he was amusing himself clipping it with his tomahawk cutting away the moss and chipping the stone which made the latter glitter more and yellower hallo cried george this looks better robinson went on his knees without a word it is all right said he in a great flutter it is a nugget and a good sized one a pound weight i think now then my lad out you come and he dug his fingers under it to jerk it out but the next moment he gave a screech and looked up amazed why this is the point of the nugget it lies the other way not flat george i can't move it the pick oh lord oh lord the pick the pick stand clear shouted george and he drove the point of the pick down close by the prize then he pressed on the handle why tom it is jammed somehow no it is not jammed it is its own weight why george then tom it is a hundred weight if it is an ounce don't be a fool cried the other trembling all over there is no such thing in nature the nugget now yielded slowly to the pressure and began to come up into the world again inch by inch after so many thousand years of course before it could come all out the soil must open first and when robinson glaring down saw a square foot of earth part and gape as the nugget came majestically up he gave another cry and with trembling hands laid hold of the prize and pulled and tugged and rolled it on the clean moss to lift it was not so easy they fell down on their knees by the side of it like men in a dream such a thing had never been seen or heard of a hundred weight of quartz and gold and beautiful as it was great it was like honeycomb the cells of which had been sliced by a knife the shining metal brimmed over in the delicate quartz cells they lifted it yes full a hundredweight half the mass was quartz but four fifths of the weight they knew must be gold then they jumped up and each put a foot on it and shook hands over it oh you beauty cried george and he went on his knees and kissed it that is not because you are gold but because you take me to susan now tom let us thank heaven for its goodness to us and back to camp this very day ay but stop we must wrap it in our wipes or we shall never get back alive the very honest ones would turn villains at sight of it it is the wonder of the world i see my susan's eyes in it cried george in rapture oh tom good kind honest tom shake hands over it once more in the midst of all this rapture a horrible thought occurred why it's jacky's said george faintly he found it nonsense nonsense cried tom uneasily he added however but i am afraid one third of it is pals share white or black all their eyes now turned uneasily to the aboriginal who lay yawning on the grass jacky give him you george said this worthy savage with superb indifference he added with a yawn what for you dance corroboree when um not dark den you bite yellow stone continued this original den you red den you white den you red again all because we pull up yellow stone all dis a good deal dam ridiculous so 'tis jacky replied robinson hastily don't you have anything to do with yellow stone it would make you as great a fool as we are now show us the shortest cut back home through the bush at the native camp they fell in with jem the monstrous nugget was too heavy to conceal from his shrewd eye so they showed it him the sight of it almost knocked him down robinson told him where they found it and advised jem to go and look for another alas the great nugget already made him wish one friend away but jem said no i will see you safe through the bush first chapter lxxi all this time two persons in the gold mine were upon thorns of expectation and doubt brutus and peter crawley george and robinson did not return but no more did black will what had happened had the parties come into collision and if so with what result if the friends had escaped why had they never been heard of since if on the other hand will had come off conqueror why had he never reappeared at last brutus arrived at a positive conviction that black will had robbed and probably murdered the men and was skulking somewhere with their gold thereby defrauding him his pal however he kept this to himself and told crawley that he feared will had come to grief so he would go well armed and see what was the matter and whether he could help him so he started for the bush well armed now his real object i blush to say was to murder black will and rob him of the spoils of george and robinson wicked as these men of violence had been six months ago gold and crawley had made them worse ay much worse crawley indeed had never openly urged any of them to so deep a crime as murder and it is worthy of note as a psychological fact that this reptile contrived to deceive itself into thinking that it had stopped short of crime's utmost limits to be sure it had tempted and bribed and urged men to robbery under circumstances that were almost sure to lead to murder but still murder might not occur meantime it had openly discountenanced that crime and checked the natural proclivity of brutus and black will toward deeds of blood self deception will probably cease at the first blast of the archangel's trumpet but what human heart will part with it till then the circumstances under which a human being could not excuse or delude or justify himself have never yet occurred in the huge annals of crime prejudice apart crawley's moral position behind brutus and black will seems to bear a strong family likeness to that which holy writ assigns to the great enemy of man that personage knocks out nobody's brains cuts nobody's throat never was guilty of such brutality since the world was but he finds some thorough egotist and whispers how the egotism of his passions or his interest may be gratified by the death of a fellow creature the egotist listens and blood flows brutus and black will had both suffered for their crimes brutus had been nailed by carlo twice gibbeted and the bridge of his nose broken once black will had been mutilated and walker nearly drowned but the close contriver of all harms had kept out of harm's way violence had never recoiled on him who set it moving for all that crawley i must inform the reader was not entirely prosperous he had his little troubles too whether warnings that he was on the wrong path or punishments of his vices or both i can't say thus it was mr crawley had a natural love of spirits without a stomach strong enough to deal with them when he got away from mr meadows he indulged more and more and for some months past he had been subject to an unpleasant phenomenon that arises now and then out of the fumes of liquor at the festive board even as he raised the glass to his lips the face of crawley would often be seen to writhe with a sort of horror and his eyes to become fixed on unseen objects and perspiration to gather on his brow then such as were not in the secret would jump up and say what on earth is the matter and look fearfully round expecting to see some horrid sight to justify that look of horror and anguish but crawley his glassy eyes still fixed would whimper out his teeth chattering and clipping the words oh ne ne never mind it's o o only a trifling ap parition he had got to try and make light of it because at first he used to cry out and point and then the miners ran out and left him alone with his phantoms and this was terrible he dreaded solitude he schemed against it and provided against it and paid fellows to bear him company night and day and at the festive board it was one thing to drink his phantoms neat and another to dilute them with figures of flesh and blood he much preferred the latter at first his supernatural visitors were of a unfavorable but not a ghastly character no was a judge who used to rise through the floor and sit half in and half out of the wall with a tremendous flow of horse hair a furrowed face a vertical chasm between the temples and a strike me off the rolls eye gleaming with diabolical fire from under a gray shaggy eyebrow no was a policeman who came in through the window and stood imperturbable all in blue with a pair of handcuffs and a calm eye and a disagreeable absence of effort or emotion an inevitable looking policeman but as crawley went deeper in crime and brandy blood boltered figures erect corpses with the sickening signs of violence in every conceivable form used to come and blast his sight and arrest the glass on its way to his lips and make his songs and the boisterous attempts at mirth of his withered heart die in a quaver and a shiver of fear and despair and at this period of our tale these horrors had made room for a phantom more horrible still to such a creature as crawley the air would seem to thicken into sulfurous smoke and then to clear and then would come out clearer and clearer more and more awful a black figure with hoof and horns and tail eyes like red hot carbuncles teeth a chevaux de frise of white hot iron and an appalling grin the god pan colored black by the early christians chapter lxxii the party consisting of jacky jem robinson and george had traversed about one half the bush when a great heavy crow came wheeling and cackling over their heads and then joined a number more who were now seen circling over a gum tree some hundred yards distant let us go and see what that is said jem jacky grinned and led the way they had not gone very far when another great black bird rose so near their feet as to make them jump and peering through the bushes they saw a man lying on his back his arm was thrown in an easy natural way round his gun but at a second glance it was plain the man was dead the crows had ripped his clothes to ribbons with their tremendous beaks and lacerated the flesh and picked out the eyes they stepped a few paces from this sight there was no sign of violence on the body poor fellow said jem how did he come by his end i wonder and he stretched forward and peered with pity and curiosity mingled lost in the bush said robinson very solemnly and he and george exchanged a meaning look what is that for said george angrily to jacky grinning in sight of a dead body white fellow stupid fellow was all jacky's reply the men now stepped up to the body to examine it not that they had much hope of discovering who it was but still they knew it was their duty for the sake of his kindred to try and find out george overcoming a natural repugnance examined the pockets he found no papers he found a knife but no name was cut in the handle in the man's bosom he found a small metal box but just as he was taking it out jem gave a halo i think i know him cried jem there is no mistaking that crop of black hair it is my old captain black will you don't say so what could he be doing here without his party anything in the box george asked robinson nothing but a little money here is a sovereign look and here is a bank note a five pound note yes no it is more than that a good deal it is for fifty pounds tom what a fifty pound note i tell you jem captain a most expressive look was exchanged between these two and by one impulse they both seized the stock of the gun that was in the dead man's hand they lifted it and yes two fingers were wanting on the right hand come away from that fellow cried robinson to george let him lie george looked up in some wonder robinson pointed sternly to the dead hand in silence george by the light of the other men's faces saw it all and recoiled with a natural movement of repugnance as from a dead snake there was a breathless silence and every eye bent upon this terrible enemy lying terrible no longer at their feet how did he die asked robinson in a whisper in the great snow storm replied george in a whisper no said jem in the same tone he was alive yesterday i saw his footprint after the snow was melted there was snow again last night tom perhaps he went to sleep in that with his belly empty starvation and fatigue would do it without the snow george we brought a day's provisions out with us george he never thought of that i will be bound not he said jem i'll answer for him he only thought of robbing and killing never thought about dying himself i can't believe he is dead so easy as this said robinson the feeling was natural this man had come into the wood and had followed them burning to work them ill and they to work him ill both were utterly baffled he had never prevailed to hurt them nor they him he was dead but by no mortal hand the immediate cause of his death was unknown and will never be known for certain while the world lasts l'homme propose mais dieu dispose chapter lxxiii don't keep staring at it so farmer it is an ugly sight you will see him in your sleep if you do that here is something better to look at a letter and there i carried it and never once thought of it till the sight of his hand made me feel in my pocket and then my hand ran against it 'tis from mr levi thank you jem tom will you be so kind as read it me while i work yes give it me work why what are we going to work at in the bush i should think you might guess replied george quietly while putting down his pickax and taking off his coat well i am astonished at both of you you ought to know what i am going to do humph under this tree will be as good a place as any jem as i am a sinner he is going to bury him bury what the nugget no jem the christian in berkshire among a certain class this word means a human being a pretty christian sneered robinson you know what i mean tom i know it is very kind of you to take all this trouble to bury my enemy said robinson hurt don't ye say that replied george hurt in his turn he was as much my enemy as yours no such thing he was here after me and has been tormenting me this twelve months you have no enemy a great soft spoon like you keep your temper tom answered george in a mollifying tone let each man act according to his lights i couldn't leave a corpse to the fowls of the air gibbet a murderer i say don't bury him especially when he has just been hunting our very lives tom replied george doggedly death settles all accounts i liked the man as little as you could and it is not to say i am in love with a man because i sprinkle a little earth over his dead bones ugh this is the unkindest soil to work it is full of roots enough to break a fellow's heart while george was picking and grubbing out roots and fighting with the difficult soil robinson opened levi's letter viciously and read out george fielding you have an enemy in the mine a secret cowardly unscrupulous enemy who lies in wait for your return i have seen his face and tremble for you therefore listen to my words the old jew whom twice you have saved from harm and insult is rich his children are dead the wife of his bosom is dead he loves no creature now but you and susannah therefore run no more risks for gold since much gold awaits you without risk come home respect the words of age and experience come home delay not an hour oh say not 'i will sleep yet one more night in my tent and then i will depart' but ride speedily after me on the very instant two horses have i purchased for you and the young man your friend two swift horses with their saddles the voucher is inclosed ride speedily after me this very hour lest evil befall you and yet more sorrow fall upon susannah and upon isaac levi the reading of this letter was followed by a thoughtful silence broken only by the sound of george's pickax and the bursting roots this is a very extraordinary letter mr levi knows more than he tells you george i am of your opinion why captain said jem to go by that letter fielding is the marked man and not you after all so it is his own enemy he is digging that grave for do you think you will stop him by saying that asked robinson with a shrug he was my enemy tom and yours too but now he is nobody's enemy he is dead will you help me lay him in the earth or shall i do it by myself we will help said the others a little sullenly they brought the body to its grave under the tall gum tree not quite so rough tom if you please i didn't mean to be rough that i know of there they laid the dead villain gently and reverently in his grave george took a handful of soil and scattered it over him ashes to ashes dust to dust said he solemnly the other two looked down and sprinkled soil too and their anger and bitterness began to soften by the side of george and over the grave then jem felt in his pocket and produced something wrapped in silver paper this belongs said he with a horrible simplicity the farmer is too good for this world but it is a good fault there farmer said he looking to george for approbation as he dropped the little parcel into the grave after all continued jem good naturedly it would have been very hard upon a poor fellow to wake up in the next world and not have what does belong to him to make an honest living with the grave was filled in and a little mound made at the foot of the tree then george took out his knife and began to cut the smooth bark what now oh i see that is a good idea george read them a lesson say in a few words how he came here to do a deed of violence and died himself by the hand of heaven tom replied george cutting away at the bark he is gone where he is sure to be judged so we have no call to judge him god almighty can do that i do suppose without us putting in our word well have it your own way i never saw the toad so obstinate before jem what is he cutting i wonder the inscription when finished ran thus please don't cut down this tree it is a tombstone a white man lies below now tom for england they set out again with alacrity and battled with the bush about two hours more george and robinson carried the great nugget on a handkerchief stretched double across two sticks jem carried the picks they were all in high spirits and made light of scratches and difficulties at last somewhat suddenly they burst out of the thick part into the mere outskirts frequented by the miners and there they came plump upon brutus with a gun in his hand and pistols peeping out of his pockets come to murder black will and rob him of his spoils they were startled and brutus astounded for he was fully persuaded george and robinson had ceased to exist he was so dumfounded that robinson walked up to him and took the gun out of his hands without any resistance on his part the others came round him and robinson demanded his pistols what for said he now at this very moment his eye fell upon that fabulous mass of gold they carried and both his eyes opened and a sort of shiver passed over him with ready cunning he looked another way but it was too late robinson had caught that furtive glance and a chill came over him that this villain should have seen the prize a thing to excite cupidity to frenzy nothing now would have induced robinson to leave him armed he replied sternly because we are four to one and we will hang you on the nearest tree if you don't give them up and now what are you doing here i was only looking for my pal said brutus well you won't want a gun and pistols to look for your pal which way are you going into the bush then mizzle that is the road brutus moved gloomily away into the bush there said robinson he has turned bushranger i've disarmed him and saved some poor fellow's life and property cover up the nugget george they went on but presently robinson had a thought jacky said he you saw that man should you know him again yes jacky that man is our enemy could you track him by his footsteps without ever letting him see you jacky smiled superior then follow him and see where he goes and whom he joins and come to the mine directly and tell me jacky's eyes gleamed at this intelligence he sat down and in a few turns of the hand painted his face war and glided like a serpent on brutus's trail the rest cleared the wood and brought the nugget safe hidden in their pocket handkerchief to camp they begged jem to accept the fifty pounds if he did not mind handling the price of blood jem assured them he had no such scruples and took it with a burst of thanks then they made him promise faithfully not to mention to a soul about the monster nugget no more he did while he was sober but alas some hours later having a drop in his head he betrayed the secret to one or two say forty robinson pitched their tent and mounted guard over the nugget george was observed to be in a strange flutter he ran hither and thither ran to the post office ran to the stationer got paper drew up a paper found mclaughlan made him sign it went to mr moore showed him isaac's voucher on which moore produced the horses a large black horse with both bone and blood and a good cob george was very much pleased with them and asked what levi had given for them two hundred and fifty pounds for the pair good heavens cried george what a price mr levi was in earnest then he ran out and went to the tent and gave robinson his letters but there were none for me tom sighed george never mind i shall soon now these letters brought joy and triumph to robinson one contained a free pardon the other was a polite missive from the colonial government in answer to the miners' petition he had sent up secretary had the honor to inform mr robinson that police were on the road to the mine and that soldiers would arrive by to morrow to form an escort so that the miners' gold might travel in safety down to sydney hurrah this is good news cried robinson and what a compliment to me do you hear george an escort of soldiers coming to the camp to morrow they will take the nugget safe to sydney not if we are robbed of it to night replied george at this moment in came jacky with news of brutus that wily man had gone but a little way in the bush when he had made a circuit and had slipped back into another part of the mine and jacky had followed him first by trail afterward by sight and had marked him down into a certain tent on which he had straightway put a little red mark come back after our nugget george fools we were to carry it blazing in folks' eyes i dare say we can beat him i am game to try jacky i want to put a question to you while jacky and tom were conferring in animated whispers george was fixing an old spur he had picked up into the heel of his boot that is capital jacky well george we have hit upon a plan and so have i you yes me but tell me yours first tom robinson detailed him his scheme with all its ramifications and a very ingenious stratagem it was for all that when george propounded his plan in less than six words robinson stared with surprise and then gave way to ludicrous admiration well cried he simplicity before cunning look at that now where was my head george this is your day carried nem con and tom you can do yours all the same can i why yes to be sure i can there he saw that too before why george if you don't mind you will be no and i no what makes you so sharp all of a sudden i have to think for susan as well as us said the poor fellow tenderly that is why i am sharp for once in a way and now jacky you are a great anxiety to me and the time is so short come sit by me dear jacky and let me try and make you understand what i have been doing for you that you may be good and happy and comfortable in your old age when your poor old limbs turn stiff and you can hunt no longer in grateful return for the nugget and more than that for all your goodness and kindness to me in times of bitter trouble then george showed jacky how he had given abner one third of all his sheep and cattle and jacky two thirds and how mclaughlan a just man would see the division made and do leave the woods except for a hunt now and then jacky you are too good for them above all george explained with homely earnestness the nature of the sheep her time of lambing etc and showed jacky how the sheep and cattle would always keep him fed and clothed if he would but use them reasonably and not kill the breeders for dinner and jacky listened with glistening eyes for george's glistened and the sweet tones of affection and gratitude pierced through this family talk and it is sad that we must drop the curtain on this green spot in the great camp and go among our villains chapter lxxiv robinson did not overrate the fatal power of the fabulous mass of gold a glimpse of which he had incautiously given to greedy eyes it drew brutus like a magnet after it he came all in a flutter to mephistopheles and told him he had met the two men carrying a lump of solid gold between them so heavy that the sticks bent under it the sweat ran down me at the sight of it but i managed to look another way directly what with the blows and kicks and bruises and defeats he had received and with the gold mass his lawless eye had rested on brutus was now in a state of mind terrible to think of lust and hate terrible twins stung that dark heart to frenzy could he have had his will he would have dispensed with cunning would have gone out and fired bullets from his gun into the tent and if his enemies came out alive have met them hand to hand to slay or be slain but the watchful foe had disarmed him and he was compelled to listen to the more reynard like ferocity of his accomplice bill said the assassin of carlo keep cool and you shall have the swag and yet not lose your revenge neither you tell me how let the bottle alone then you are hot enough without that come nearer me what i have got to say is not the sort of thing for me to bawl about we should not be alive half an hour if it was heard to come from our lips the two heads came close together and crawley leaned over the other side of the table and listened with senses keen as a razor suppose i show you how to make those two run out of their tent like two frightened women and never once think about their swag ah and fall blinded for life or dead or dying while we walk off with the swag blind dead dying give me your hand how how how hush don't shout like that come closer and you smith then a diabolical scheme hissed into the listeners' ears a scheme at once cowardly and savage a scheme of that terrible kind that robs courage strength and even skill of their natural advantages and reduces their owners to the level of the weak and the timid a scheme worthy of the assassin of carlo and the name i have given this wretch whose brain was so fertile and his heart so fiendish its effect on the hearers was great but very different crawley recoiled not violently but like a serpent on which water had been poured but brutus broke into a rapture of admiration exultation gratified hate bless you bless you cried he with a violence more horrible than his curses you warm my heart you are a pal what a head piece you have got you smith have you nothing to say isn't this a dodge out of the common now for the last minute or two crawley's eyes had been fixed with a haggard expression on a distant corner of the room he did not move them he appeared hardly to have the power but he answered dropping the words down on the table anywhere ye yes it is very inge nious ah mephisto we must buy the turpentine directly there is only one store sells it and that shuts at nine brutus do you hear smith hand us out the blunt crawley oh ugh and his eyes seemed fascinated to that spot brutus following crawley's eye uneasily what is the matter crawley lo o o k th e r e no on your right oh his tail is in the fire brutus whose tail don't be a fool crawley and it doesn't burn oh it burns blacker in the fire ah ah now the eyes have caught fire diamonds full of hell they blast ah now the teeth have caught light red hot nails the mouth is as big as the table gaping wider wider wider ah ah ah brutus him i won't stay in the room with such a fellow he makes my blood run cold has he cut his father's throat in a church or what crawley shrieking oh don't go oh my dear friends don't leave me alone with it my dear friends you sit down right upon it that sends it away and crawley hid his face and pointed wildly to whereabouts they were to sit upon the phantom brutus come it is gone now was forced nearly to squash it first though haw haw haw crawley yes it is gone thank heaven i'll give up drinking brutus so now fork out the blunt for the turps crawley no i will give no money toward murder robbery is bad enough where shall we go to and he rose and went out muttering something about a little brandy brutus the sneak to fail us at the pinch i'll wring his neck round what is this five pounds mephisto don't you see the move he won't give it us conscience forbids but if we are such rogues as take it no questions asked the tarnation hypocrite roared brutus with disgust hypocrisy was the one vice he was innocent of out of jail mephistopheles stole crawley's money left for that purpose and went and bought a four gallon cask of turpentine brutus remained and sharpened an old cutlass the only weapon he had got left crawley and mephistopheles returned almost together crawley produced a bottle of brandy now said he to mephistopheles i don't dispute your ingenuity my friend but suppose while we have been talking the men have struck their tent and gone away nugget and all the pair looked terribly blank what fools we were not to think of that crawley kept them in pain a moment or two well they have not said he i have been to look well done cried mephistopheles well done cried brutus gasping for breath there is their tent all right how near did you go to it near enough to hear their voices muttering when does the moon rise to night she is rising now when does she go down soon after two o'clock will you take a share of the work smith heaven forbid chapter lxxv it was a gusty night the moon had gone down the tents gleamed indistinct in form but white as snow robinson's tent stood a little apart among a number of deserted claims some of them dry but most of them with three or four feet of water in them there was however one large tent about twenty yards from robinson's a man crept on his stomach up to this tent and listened he then joined another man who stood at some distance and whose form seemed gigantic in the dim starlight all right said the spy they are all fast as dormice snoring like hogs no fear from them go to work then whispered brutus do your part mephistopheles laid a deep iron dish upon the ground and removed the bung from the turpentine cask and poured confound the wind how it wastes the stuff cried he he now walked on tiptoe past robinson's tent and scattered the turpentine with a bold sweep so that it fell light as rain over a considerable surface a moment of anxiety succeeded would their keen antagonists hear even that slight noise no no one stirred in the tent mephistopheles returned to the cask and emboldened by success brought it nearer the doomed tent six times he walked past the windward side of the tent and scattered the turpentine over it it was at the other side his difficulties began the first time he launched the liquid the wind took it and returned it nearly all in his face and over his clothes scarce a drop reached the tent the next time he went up closer with a beating heart and flung it sharper this time full two thirds went upon the tent and only a small quantity came back like spray by the time the cask was emptied the tent was saturated then this wretch passed the tent yet once more and scattered a small quantity of oil to make the flame more durable and deadly now it is my turn whispered brutus i thought it would never come what is that figure crouching and crawling about a hundred yards to windward it is the caitiff crawley who after peremptorily declining to have anything to do with this hellish act has crept furtively after them partly to play the spy on them for he suspects they will lie to him about the gold partly urged by curiosity he could see nothing at that distance but the dark body of mephistopheles passing at intervals between him and the white tent he shivered with cold and terror at the crime about to be done and quivered with impatience that it was so long a doing the assassins now divided their force mephistopheles took his station to leeward of the tent brutus to windward crawley saw a sudden spark upon the ground it was brutus striking a lucifer match against his heel with this he lighted a piece of tow and running along the tent he left a line of fire behind him and awaited the result his cutlass griped in his hand and his teeth clinched crawley saw that line of fire come and then creep and then rise and then roar and shoot up into a great column of fire thirty feet high roaring and blazing and turning night into day all round simultaneously with this tremendous burst of fire and light which startled crawley by bringing him in a moment into broad daylight he saw rise from the earth a black figure with a fiendish face at this awful sight the conscience stricken wretch fell flat and tried to work into the soil like a worm nor did he recover any portion of his presence of mind till he heard a shrill whoop savage and soul chilling but mortal and looking up saw kalingalunga go bounding down upon brutus with gigantic leaps his tomahawk whirling crawley cowered like a hare and watched brutus surprised but not dismayed wheeled round and faced the savage cutlass in hand he parried a fierce blow of the tomahawk and with his left fist struck kalingalunga on the temple and knocked him backward half a dozen yards the elastic savage recovered himself and danced like a fiend round brutus in the red light of the blazing tent warned by that strange blow straight from the armpit a blow entirely new to him he came on with more deadly caution eyes and teeth budelights and brutus felt a chill for a moment but it speedily turned to rage now as the combatants each prepared to strike again screams suddenly issued from the other side the tent so wild despairing and unnatural as to suspend their arms for a moment they heard but saw nothing only the savage heart of brutus found time to exult his enemies were perishing but crawley saw as well as heard a pillar of flame eight feet high burst out from behind the tent and ran along the ground from that conical flame issued those appalling shrieks it was a man on fire the living flame ran but a few steps then disappeared from the earth and the screams ceased apparently the fire had not only killed but annihilated its prey and so itself crawley sickened with horror and for a moment with remorse but already brutus and kalingalunga were fighting again by the light of the burning tent they closed and this time blood flowed on both sides the savage by a skillful feint cut brutus on the flesh of the left shoulder but not deep and brutus once more surprised the savage by delivering point with his cutlass and inflicted a severe graze on the ribs at the sight of his enemy's blood brutus followed up and aimed a fierce blow at kalingalunga's head he could not have made a more useless attack the savage bore on his left arm a shield so called it was but three inches broad and two feet long but skill and practice had made it an impenetrable defense he received the cutlass on this shield as a matter of course and simultaneously delivered his tomahawk on brutus's unguarded head brutus went down under the blow and rolled over on his face the crouching spectator of this terrible combat by the decaying light of the tent heard the hard blow and saw the white man roll upon the ground then he saw the tomahawk twice lifted and twice descend upon the man's back as he lay the next moment the savage came running from the tent at his utmost speed crawley's first thought was that assistance had come to brutus his next was a terrible one the savage had first risen from the earth at a spot between the tent and him perhaps he had been watching both him and the tent a moment of horrible uncertainty and then crawley yielded to his instinct and ran a terrible whoop behind told him he was indeed to be the next victim he ran for the dear life no one would have believed he could shamble along at the rate he did his tent was half a mile off he would be a dead man long ere he could reach it he turned his yelling head as he ran to see the fleet savage had already diminished the distance between them by half crawley now filled the air with despairing cries for help a large tent was before him he knew not whose but certain death was behind him he made for the tent if he could but reach it before the death stroke was given him yes it is near no it is white and looks closer than it is a whoop sounded in his ears it seemed to ring inside his head it was so near he flung himself yelling with terror at the wall of the tent an aperture gave way a sharp cut as with a whip seemed to sting him and he was on his knees in the middle of the tent howling for mercy first to the savage who he made sure was standing over him with his tomahawk then to a man who got him by the throat and pressed a pistol barrel cold as an icicle to his cheek mercy mercy the savage he is killing me murder murder help who are you roared the man shaking him oh stop him he will kill me shoot him don't shoot me i am a respectable man it is the savage kill him he is at the door please kill him i'll give you a hundred pounds what is to do the critter is mad there there you will see a savage shoot him kill him for pity's sake kill him and i'll tell you all i am respectable i'll give you a hundred pounds to kill him why it is smith that gives us all a treat at times don't i oh my dear good friend he has killed me he came after me with his tomahawk have pity on a respectable man and kill him the man went to the door of the tent and sure enough there was jacky who had retired to some distance the man fired at him with as little ceremony as he would at a glass bottle and as was to be expected missed him but jacky who had a wholesome horror of the make thunders ran off directly and went to hack the last vestiges of life out of brutus crawley remained on his knees howling and whimpering so piteously that the man took pity on this abject personage have a drop mr smith you have often given me one there i'll strike a light the man struck a light and fixed a candle in a socket he fumbled in a corner for the bottle and was about to offer it to crawley when he was arrested by a look of silent horror on his visitor's face why what is wrong now look look look cried crawley trembling from head to foot here it comes there is its tail soon its eyes and teeth will catch light it knows the work we have been at ah ah ah the man looked round very uneasily crawley's way of pointing and glaring over one's head at some object behind one was anything but encouraging what where there there coming through the side of the tent it can come through a wall and crawley shook from head to foot why that is your own shadow said the man why what a faint hearted one to shake at your own shadow my shadow cried crawley heaven forbid have i got a tail screeched crawley reproachfully that you have said the man now i look at you full crawley clapped his hand behind him and to his horror he had a tail chapter lxxvi crawley who what with the habit of cerebral hallucination due to brandy and the present flutter of his spirits and his conscience had for a moment or two lost all the landmarks of probability no sooner felt his hand encounter a tail slight in size but stiff as a pug's and straight as a pointer's than he uttered a dismal howl and it is said that for a single moment he really suspected premature caudation had been inflicted on him for his crimes but such delusions are short lived he slewed himself round after this tail in his efforts to see it and squinting over his shoulder he did see it and a warm liquid which he now felt stealing down his legs and turning cold as it went opened his eyes still farther it was a red spear sticking in his person sticking tight jacky who had never got so near him as he fancied saw him about to get into a tent and unable to tomahawk him did the best he could flung a light javelin with such force and address that it pierced his coat and trousers and buried half its head in his flesh this spear head made of jagged fishbones had to be cut out by the simple and agreeable process of making all round it a hole larger than itself the operation served to occupy crawley for the remaining part of the night and exercised his vocal powers this was the first time he had smarted in his penetrable part the skin and it made him very spiteful away went his compunction and at peep of day he shambled out very stiff no longer dreading but longing to hear which of his enemies it was he had seen wrapped in flame shrieking and annihilated like the snuff of a candle he came to the scene of action just as the sun rose but others were there before him a knot of men stood round a black patch of scorched soil round which were scattered little fragments of canvas burned to tinder talking over a most mysterious affair of the night past it came out that the patrol some of whom were present had been ordered by captain robinson not to go their rounds as usual but to watch in a tent near his own since he expected an attack accustomed to keep awake on the move but not in a recumbent posture they had slept the sleep of infancy till suddenly awakened by the sound of a pistol then they had run out and had found the captain's tent in ashes and a man lying near it sore hacked and insensible but still breathing they had taken him to their tent but he had never spoken and the affair was incomprehensible while each was giving some wild opinion or another a faint voice issued from the bowels of the earth invoking aid several ran to the spot and at the bottom of an old claim full thirty feet deep they discovered on looking intently down the face of a man rising out of the clayey water they lowered ropes and hauled him up how did you come there mate he had come into the camp in the dark and not knowing the ground and having to tell the truth had a drop he had fallen into the claim he was asked with an air of suspicion how long ago this had happened more than an hour replied the wily one crawley looked at him and being unlike the others acquainted with the man's features saw spite of the clay cake he was enveloped in that his whiskers were frizzled to nothing and his fiendish eyebrows gone then a sickening suspicion crept over him he communicated it by a look to mephistopheles acting on it he asked with an artful appearance of friendly interest but the men the poor men that were in the tent what the captain and his mate yes why ye fool they are half way to sydney by now half way to sydney and a ghastly look passed between the speaker and mephistopheles ay lad they rode off on moore's two best nags at midnight the captain had a belt round his waist crammed with dust and bank notes cried another and the farmer a nugget as big as a pumpkin on the pommel of his saddle four hours had not elapsed ere crawley and mephistopheles were on the road to sydney but not on horseback crawley had no longer funds to buy two horses and even if he had he could not have borne the saddle after the barbarous surgery of last night the lance head was cut out with a cheese knife but he and mephistopheles joined a company of successful diggers going down with their swag on the road they constantly passed smaller parties of unfortunate diggers who had left the mine in despair when the weather broke and the claims filled with water and the farther they went the more wretched was the condition of those they overtook ragged shoeless hungry foot sore heart sore poor broken pilgrims from the shrine of mammon now it befell that forty miles on this side sydney they fell in with seven such ragged specters and while they were giving these a little food up came from the city a large joyful party the eagerness of hope and cupidity on their faces hallo are they mad going up to the diggings in the wet weather they were questioned a hundred weight of gold had been found at the diggings and all the town was turning out to find some more such prizes and in fact every mile after this they met a party great or small ardent sanguine on an almost hopeless errand such is the strange and fatal no logic of speculation for us the rare is to turn common and when we have got it be rare as ever mephistopheles and crawley parted at the suburb the former was to go to certain haunts and form a gang to seize the rich prize meantime crawley would enter the town and discover where the men were lodging if in an inn one of the gang must go there as a well dressed traveler and watch his opportunity if in a lodging other means crawley found the whole city ringing with the great nugget crawley put eager questions and received ready answers he was shown the bank up to which the men had ridden in broad daylight the one on the big horse had the nugget on his saddle they had taken it and broken it and weighed it and sold it in the bank parlor for three thousand eight hundred pounds crawley did not like this he had rather they had not converted it into paper his next question was whether it was known where the men lodged known i believe you why they are more thought of than the governor everybody runs to get a word with them gentle or simple you will find them at the 'ship' inn to the ship went crawley he dared not be too direct in his queries so he put them in form of a statement you have got some lucky ones here that found the great nugget well we had but they are gone been gone this two hours do you know them yes said crawley without fear as they were gone where are they gone do you know why home i suppose you chaps make your money out of us but you all run home to spend it what gone to england gasped crawley ay look there is the ship just being towed out of the harbor crawley shambled and tore and ran and was just in time to see the two friends standing with beaming faces on the vessel's deck as she glided out on her voyage home he sat down half stupid mephistopheles went on collecting his gang in the suburbs the steamer cast off and came wheeling back the ship spread her huge white plumage and went proudly off to sea the blue waves breaking white under her bows crawley sat glaring at all this in a state of mental collapse chapter lxxvii thus have i told in long and tedious strains how george fielding went to australia to make a thousand pounds and how by industry sobriety and cattle he did not make a thousand pounds and how aided with the help of a converted thief this honest fellow did by gold digging industry and sobriety make several thousand pounds and take them safe away home spite of many wicked devices and wicked men thus have i told how mr meadows flung out his left hand into australia to keep george from coming back to susan with a thousand pounds and how spite of one stroke of success his left hand eventually failed and failed completely but his right chapter lxxviii joyous as the first burst of summer were the months susan passed after the receipt of george's happy letter many warm feelings combined in one stream of happiness in susan's heart perhaps the keenest of all was pride at george's success nobody could laugh at george now and insult her again there where she was most sensitive by telling her that george was not good enough for her or any woman and even those who set such store upon money making would have to confess that george could do even that for love of her as well as they could do it for love of themselves next to this her joy was greatest at the prospect of his speedy return and now she became joyfully impatient for further news but not disappointed at his silence till two months had passed without another letter then indeed anxiety mingled now and then with her happiness then it was that meadows slowly and hesitatingly to the last raised his hand and struck the first direct blow at her heart he struck in the dark he winced for her both before and after yet he struck one market day a whisper passed through farnborough that george fielding had met with wonderful luck that he had made his fortune by gold and was going to marry a young lady out in australia farmer merton brought the whisper home meadows was sure he would meadows did not come to the house for some days he half feared to look upon his work to see susan's face agonized under his blow at last he came he watched her by stealth he found he might have spared his qualms she chatted as usual in very good spirits and just before he went she told him the report with a smile of ineffable scorn she was simple unsuspicious and every way without a shield against a meadows but the loyal heart by its own virtue had turned the dagger's edge a week after this jefferies brought meadows a letter it was from susan to george meadows read it writhing it breathed kind affection with one or two demi maternal cautions about his health and to be very prudent for her sake not a word of doubt there was however a postscript of which the following is the exact wording p s it is all over farnborough that you are going to be married to some one in australia two months more passed and no letter from george these two months told upon susan she fretted and became restless and irritable and cold misgivings crept over her and the anguish of suspense at last one day she unbosomed herself though with hesitation to a warm and disinterested friend blushing all over with tearful eyes she confessed her grief to mr meadows don't tell father sir i hide my trouble from him as well as i can but what does it mean george not writing to me these four months and three days do pray tell me what does it mean and susan cried so piteously that meadows winced at his success oh mr meadows don't flatter me tell me the truth while he was exulting in her firmness who demanded the truth bitter or not she continued only don't tell me that i am forgotten and she looked so piteously in the oracle's face that he forgot everything in the desire to say something she would like him the better for saying he muttered perhaps he has sailed for home he expected her to say and if he has he would have written to me before sailing but instead of this susan gave a little cry of joy ah how foolish i have been mr meadows you are a friend out of a thousand you are as wise as i am foolish poor george you will never let him know i was so wicked as to doubt him and susan brightened with joy and hope the heart believes so readily the thing it longs should be true she was happy all the rest of the evening meadows went away mad with her for her folly and with himself for his feebleness of purpose and next market day again the whisper went round the market that george fielding was going to marry out there this time a detail was sketched in it was a lady in the town of bathurst old merton brought this home and twitted his daughter she answered haughtily that it was a falsehood she would stake her life on george's fidelity see mr meadows they are all against poor george all except you but what does it mean if he does not write or come soon i think i shall go mad report is a common liar i would not believe anything till i saw it in black and white said meadows doggedly no more i will soon after this william fielding had a talk with susan have you heard a report about george yes i have heard a rumor you don't believe it i hope why should i believe it i'm going to trace it up to the liar that forged it if i can susan suppressed her satisfaction at this resolution of will fielding's is it worth while asked she coldly if i didn't think so i shouldn't take that much trouble not expecting any thanks have i said anything to offend you asked susan with a still more frigid tone the other did not trust himself to answer but two days after he came again and told her he had written a letter to george telling him what reports were about and begging for an answer whether or not there was any truth in them a gleam of satisfaction from susan's eyes but not a word this man who had once been george's rival at heart was the last to whom she would openly acknowledge her doubts then will went on to tell her that he had traced the rumor from one to another up to a stranger whose name nobody knew but i dare say mr meadows has a notion no are you sure yes he would have told me if he had william gave a snort of incredulity and hinted that probably mr meadows himself was at the bottom of the scandal now meadows' artful conduct had fortified susan against such a suspicion and being by nature a warm hearted friend she fired up for him as she would have for mr eden or even for poor will in his absence she did it too in the most womanish way she did not tell the young man that she had consulted mr meadows and that he had constantly discredited the report and set her against believing it had she done this she would have staggered the simple minded will but no she said to herself he has attacked a good friend of mine i won't satisfy him so far as to give him reasons so she merely snubbed him oh i know you are set against poor mr meadows he is a good friend of ours of my father and me and of george too i wish you may not have to alter your mind sneered will i will not without a reason i will give you a reason do you remember that day when you insulted him in his own house and me into the bargain will not you susan leastways i hope not but him i did and am just as like to do it again well when you were gone i took a thought and i said appearances deceive the wisest i may be mistaken he he i don't know what you are laughing at and then says i it is his own house after all so i said 'if i am wrong and you don't mean to undermine my brother take my hand' and i gave it him and he refused it no susan well then but susan said william solemnly his hand lay in mine like a stone really now a lump of ice would be as near the mark well is that the reason you promised me william nodded william you are a fool oh i am a fool now you go and insult a man your superior in every respect and the very next moment he is to give you his hand as warmly as to a friend and an equal you really are too foolish to go without a keeper and if it was in any man's power to set me against poor george altogether you have gone the way to do it this twelve months past and susan closed the conference abruptly it was william's fate to rivet meadows' influence by every blow he aimed at it for all that the prudent meadows thought it worth his while to rid himself of this honest and determined foe and he had already taken steps he had discovered that this last month william fielding returning from market had been seen more than once to stop and chat at one mrs holiday's a retired small tradeswoman in farnborough now mrs holiday was an old acquaintance of meadows' and had given him sugar plums thirty years ago it suited his purpose to remember all of a sudden these old sugar plums and that mrs holiday had lately told him she wanted to get out of the town and end her days upon turf there was a cottage paddock and garden for sale within a hundred yards of the grove meadows bought them a good bargain and offered them to the widow at a very moderate rent the widow was charmed why we can keep a cow mr meadows well there is grass enough the widow took the cottage with enthusiasm mrs holiday had a daughter a handsome a downright handsome girl and a good girl into the bargain meadows had said to himself it is not the old woman will fielding goes there for well she will want some one to teach her how to farm that half acre of grass and buy the cow and milk her friendly offices chat coming and going come in mr fielding and taste your cow's cream and when he has got a lass of his own his eye won't be forever on mine william's letter to george went to the post office and from the post office to a little pile of intercepted letters in meadows' desk chapter lxxix nearly eight months had now elapsed without a letter from george susan could no longer deceive herself with hopes george was either false to her or dead she said as much to her false friend this inspired him with an artifice as subtle as unscrupulous a letter had been brought to him by jefferies which he at once recognized as the planned letter from crawley to another tool of his in farnborough this very day he set about a report that george was dead it did not reach susan so soon as he thought it would for old merton hesitated to tell her but on the sunday evening with considerable reluctance and misgivings he tried in a very clumsy way to prepare her for sad news but her mind had long been prepared for bitter tidings fancy eight weary months spent in passing every possible calamity before her imagination death as often as any she fixed her eyes on the old man father george is dead old merton hung his head and made no reply that was enough susan crept from the room pale as ashes she tottered but she did not fall she reached her room and locked herself in chapter lxxx mr meadows did not visit grassmere for some days the cruel one distrusted his own firmness when he did come he came with a distinct purpose he found merton alone susan sees no one you have heard what her sweetheart he is dead why how can that be and who says so that is the news well it is a falsehood said mr meadows coolly i wish to heaven it might whispered old merton for she won't live long after him mr meadows then told merton that he had spoken with a man who had got news of george fielding not four months old and he was in very good health will you tell susan this certainly susan was called down meadows started at the sight of her she was pale and hollow eyed and in these few days seemed ten years older she was dressed all in black i am a murderer thought he and remorse without one grain of honest repentance pierced his heart speak out john said the father the girl is not a fool she has borne ill news she can bear good can't you susan yes dear father if it is god's will any good news should come to me and she never took her eyes off mr meadows but belied her assumed firmness by quivering like an aspen leaf do you know mr griffin asked meadows yes replied susan still trembling gently but all over he has got a letter from sydney from a little roguish attorney called crawley i heard him say with my own ears that crawley tells him he had just seen george fielding in the streets of sydney well and hearty you are deceiving me out of kindness her eyes fixed on his i am not i wish i may die if the man is not as well as i am her eyes were never off his face and at this moment she read for certain that it was true she uttered a cry of joy so keen it was painful to hear and then she laughed and cried and sank into a chair laughing and crying in strong hysterics that lasted till the poor girl almost fainted from exhaustion her joy was more violent and even terrible than her grief had been the female servants were called to assist her and old merton and meadows left her in their hands feeble but calm and thankful she even smiled her adieu to meadows the next day meadows called upon griffin let me look at that letter said he i want to copy a part of it there has been one here before you said griffin who she did not give her name but i think it must have been miss merton she begged me hard to let her see the letter i told her she might take it home with her poor thing she gave me a look as if she could have eaten me what else asked meadows anxiously his success had run ahead of his plot she put it in her bosom in her bosom ay and pressed her little white hands upon it as if she had got a treasure i doubt it will be more like the asp in the bible story eh sir there i don't want your reflections said meadows fiercely but his voice quavered the myrmidon was silenced susan made her escape into a field called the kynecroft belonging to the citizens and there she read the letter it was a long tiresome one all about matters of business which she did not understand it was only at the last page that she caught sight of the name she longed to see she hurried down to it and when she got to it with beating heart it was the fate of this innocent loving woman to read these words what luck some have there is george fielding of the 'grove farm' has made his fortune at the gold and married yesterday to one of the prettiest girls in sydney i met them walking in the street to day she would not have looked at him but for the gold susan uttered a faint moan and sank down slowly on her knees like some tender tree felled by a rude stroke her eyes seemed to swim in a mist she tried to read the cruel words again but could not she put her hands before her eyes he is alive she said thank god he is alive and at last tears forced their way through her fingers she took her handkerchief and dried her eyes why do i cry for another woman's husband and the hot color of shame and of wounded pride burst even through her tears i will not cry said she proudly he is alive i will not cry he has forgotten me from this moment i will never shed another tear for one that is alive and unworthy of a tear i will go home she went home crying all the way and now a partial success attended the deep meadows' policy it was no common stroke of unscrupulous cunning to plunge her into the very depths of woe in order to take her out of them the effects were manifold and all tended his way first she was less sorrowful than she had been before that deadly blow for now the heart had realized a greater woe and had the miserable comfort of the comparison but above all new and strong passions had risen and battled fiercely with grief anger and wounded pride susan had self respect and pride too perhaps a shade too much though less small vanity than have most persons of her moderate caliber what had she wept and sighed all these months for a man who did not care for her what had she defied sneers and despised affectionate hints and gloried openly in her love to be openly insulted and betrayed what had she shut herself from the world and put on mourning and been seen in mourning for one who was not dead but well and happy and married to another an agony of shame rushed over the wronged insulted humiliated beauty she longed to fly from the world she asked her father to leave grassmere and go to some other farm a hundred miles away she asked him suddenly nervously and so impetuously that the old man looked up in dismay what leave the farm where your mother lived with me and where you were born i should feel strange girl but and he gave a strange sigh mayhap i shall have to leave it whether i will or no susan misunderstood him and colored with self reproach she said hastily no no father you shan't leave it for me forgive me i am a wayward girl and the strung nerves gave way and tears gushed over the hot cheeks as she clung to her father and tried to turn the current of her despised love and bestow it all on that selfish old noodle a great treasure went a begging in grassmere farmhouse mr meadows called but much to his chagrin susan was never visible would he excuse her she was indisposed the next evening he came he found her entertaining four or five other farmers' daughters and a couple of young men she was playing the piano to them and talking and laughing louder and faster than ever he had heard her in his life he sat moody a little while and watched her uneasily but soon took his line and exerting his excellent social powers became the life of the party but as he warmed susan froze as much as to say somebody must play the fool to amuse these triflers if you undertake it i need not for all that the very attempt at society indicated what was passing in susan's mind and the deep meadows invited all present to meet at his house in two days' time meadows was now living in isaac levi's old house he had examined it found it a much nicer house for him than his new one it was like himself full of ins and outs and it was more in the heart of business and yet quiet for though it stood in a row yet it was as good as detached because the houses on each side were unoccupied they belonged to jews probably dependents on isaac for they had left the town about a twelvemonth after his departure and had never returned though a large quantity of goods had been deposited in one of the houses meadows contrived that this little party should lead to another his game was to draw susan into the world and moreover have her seen in his company she made no resistance for her wounded pride said don't let people know you are breaking your heart for one who does not care for you she used to come to these parties radiant and playing her part with consummate resolution and success and go home and spend the night in tears meadows did not see the tears that followed these unusual efforts perhaps he suspected them enough for him that susan's pride and shame and indignation were set against her love and above all against her grief and that she was forming habits whose tendency at least was favorable to his views another four months and susan exhausted by conflicting passions had settled down into a pensive languor broken by gusts of bitter grief which became rarer and rarer her health recovered itself all but its elasticity her pride would not let her pine away but her heart scarcely beat at all and perhaps it was a good thing for her that a trouble of another kind came to gently stir it her father who had for some months been moody and depressed confessed to her that he had been speculating and was on the verge of ruin this dreadful disclosure gave little more pain to susan than if he had told her his head ached but she put down her work and came and kissed him and tried to console him i must work harder that is all father i am often asked to give a lesson on the piano forte i will do that for your sake and don't you fret for me what with the trifle my mother settled on me and my industry i am above poverty and you shall never see me repine in short poor susan took her father for a woman adopted a line of consolation addressed to his affection instead of his selfishness it was not for her he was afflicted it was for himself it was at this conjuncture that meadows spoke out there was no longer anything to be gained by delay in fact he could not but observe that since the fatal letter he appeared to be rather losing ground in his old character there was nothing left him but to attack her in a new one he removed the barrier from his patient impatience he found her alone one evening he begged her to walk in the garden she complied with an unsuspecting smile then he told her all he had suffered for her sake how he had loved her this three years with all his soul how he never thought to tell her this how hard he had struggled against it how he had run away from it and after that how he had subdued it or thought he had subdued it to esteem and how he had been rewarded by seeing that his visits and his talk had done her some good but now said he that you are free i have no longer the force to hide my love now that the man i dared not interfere with has thrown away the jewel it is not in nature that i should not beg to be allowed to take it up and wear it in my heart susan listened first with surprise then with confusion and pain then with terror at the violence of the man's passion for the long restraint removed it overwhelmed him like a flood her bosom heaved with modest agitation and soon the tears streamed down her cheeks at his picture of what he had gone through for her sake she made shift to gasp out my poor friend but she ended almost fiercely let no man ever hope for affection from me for my heart is in the grave oh that i was there too and she ran sobbing away from him in spite of his entreaties another man and not george had made a confession of love to her his voice had trembled his heart quivered with love for her and it was not george so then another link was snapped others saw they had a right to love her now and acted on it meadows was at a loss but he stayed away a week in silence and thought and thought and then he wrote a line begging permission to visit her as usual i have been so long used to hide my feelings because they were unlawful that i can surely hide them if i see they make you more unhappy than you would be without susan replied that her advice to him was to avoid her as he would a pestilence he came as usual and told her he would take her commands but could not take her advice he would run all risks to his own heart he was cheerful chatty and never said a word of love and this relieved susan so that the evening passed pleasantly susan listless and indifferent to present events and never accustomed like meadows to act upon a preconceived plan did not even observe what meadows had gained by this sacrifice of his topic for a single night viz that after declaring himself her lover he was still admitted to the house the next visit he was not quite so forbearing yet still forbearing and so on by sly gradations it was every way an unequal contest a great man against an average woman a man of forty against a woman of twenty two a man all love and selfishness against a woman all affection and unselfishness but i think his chief ally was a firm belief on susan's part that he was the best of men that from first to last of this affair his conduct had been perfection that while george was true all his thought had been to console her grief at his absence that he never would have spoken but for the unexpected treason of george and then seeing her insulted and despised he had taken that moment to show her she was loved and honored oh what an ungrateful girl she was that she could not love such a man then her father was on the same side john meadows seems down like susan do try and cheer him up a bit i am sure he has often cheered thee that he has father susan pitied meadows pitying him she forced herself at times to be gracious and when she did he was so happy that she was alarmed at her power and drew in old merton saw now how the land lay and he clung to a marriage between these two as his only hope john meadows will pull me through if he marries my susan and so the two selfish ones had got the unselfish one between them one pulling gently the other pushing quietly but both without intermission thus days and days rolled on meadows now came four times a week instead of two and courted her openly and beamed so with happiness that she had not always the heart to rob him of this satisfaction and he overwhelmed her with kindness and attention of every sort and if any one else was present she was sure to see how much he was respected and this man whom others courted was her slave this soothed the pride another had wounded one day he poured out his love to her with such passion that he terrified her and the next time he came she avoided him her father remonstrated girl you will break that man's heart if you are so unkind to him he could not say a word because you shunned him like why your heart must be made of stone a burst of tears was all the reply at last two things presented themselves to this poor girl's understanding that for her there was no chance of earthly happiness do what she would and that strangely enough she the wretched one had it in her power to make two other beings happy her father and good mr meadows now a true woman lives to make others happy she rarely takes the self contained views of life men are apt to do it passed through susan's mind if i refuse to make these happy why do i live what am i on the earth for at all it seemed cruel to her to refuse happiness when she could bestow it without making herself two shades more miserable than she was despair and unselfishness are evil counselors in a scheming selfish world the life blood had been drained out of her heart by so many cruel blows by the long waiting the misgivings the deep woe when she believed george dead the bitter grief and mortification and sense of wrong when she found he was married to another many of us male and female treated as susan imagined herself treated have taken another lover out of pique susan did not so she was bitterly piqued but she did not make that use of her pique despair of happiness pity and pure unselfishness these stood john meadows' friends with this unhappy dupe and perhaps my male readers will be incredulous as well as shocked when i relate the manner in which at last this young creature lovely as an angel in the spring of life loving another still and deluding herself to think she hated and despised him was one afternoon surprised into giving her hand to a man for whom she did not really care a button it was as if she had said is it really true your happiness depends on me then take me quick before my courage fails are you happy now my poor soul on the other side there were the passionate pleadings of a lover the deep manly voice broken with supplication the male eyes glistening the diabolical mixture of fraud and cunning with sincerity at the first symptom of yielding the man seized her as the hawk the dove he did not wait for a second hint he poured out gratitude and protestations he thanked her and blessed her and in his manly ardor caught her to his bosom she shut her eyes and submitted to the caress as to an executioner pray let me go to my father she whispered she came to her father and told him what she had done and kissed him and when he kissed her in return that rare embrace seemed to her her reward meadows went home on wings he was in a whirlwind of joy and triumph aha what will not a strong will do he had no fears no misgivings he saw she did not really like him even but he would make her love him let him once get her into his house and into his arms by degrees she should love him ay she should adore him he held that a young and virtuous woman cannot resist the husband who remains a lover unless he is a fool as well as a lover she could resist a man but hardly the hearth the marriage bed the sacred domestic ties and a man whose love should be always present always ardent yet his temper always cool and his determination to be loved unflinching with this conviction meadows had committed crimes of the deepest dye to possess susan villain as he was it may be doubted whether he would have committed these felonies had he doubted for an instant her ultimate happiness the unconquerable dog said to himself the day will come that i will tell her how i have risked my soul for her how i have played the villain for her and she shall throw her arms round my neck and bless me for committing all those crimes to make her so happy against her will it remained to clinch the nail he came to grassmere every day and one night that the old man was telling susan and him how badly things were going with him he said with a cheerful laugh i wonder at you father in law taking on that way do you think susan will let you be uncomfortable for want of a thousand pounds or two now this remark was slyly made while susan was at the other end of the room so that she could hear it but was not supposed to he did not look at her for some time and then her face was scarlet the next day he said privately to old merton the day susan and i go to church together you must let me take your engagements and do the best i can with them ah john you are a friend but it will take a pretty deal to set me straight again how much two thousand more i am afraid and too much too much for me to take out of my pocket for a stranger but not for my wife's father not if it was ten times that from that hour meadows had an ally at grassmere working heart and soul to hasten the wedding day meadows longed for this day for he could not hide from himself that as a lover he made no advances susan's heart was like a globe of ice he could get no hold of it anywhere he burned with rage when the bitter truth was forced on him that with the topic of george fielding he had lost those bright animated looks of affection she used to bestow on him and now could only command her polite attention not always that once he ventured on a remonstrance only once she answered coldly that she could not feign indifferent she was to everything on earth indifferent she always should be but for that indifference she should never have consented to marry him let him pause then and think what he was doing or better still give up this folly and not tie an icicle like her to an honest and warm heart like his the deep meadows never ventured on that ground again he feared she wanted to be off the marriage and he determined to hurry it on he pressed her to name the day she would not would she let him name it no her father came to meadows' assistance i'll name it said he father no no old merton then made a pretense of selecting a day rejected one day for one reason another for another and pitched on a day only six weeks distant the next day meadows bought the license i thought you would like that better than being cried in church susan susan thanked him and said oh yes that evening he had a note from her in which she humbly asked his pardon but she could not marry him he must excuse her she trusted to his generosity to let the matter drop and forgive a poor brokenhearted girl who had behaved ill from weakness of judgment not lightness of heart two days after this which remained unanswered her father came to her in great agitation and said to her have you a mind to have a man's death upon your conscience father i have seen john meadows and he is going to kill himself what sort of a letter was that to write to the poor man says he 'it has come on me like a thunder clap' i saw a pistol on his table and he told me he wouldn't give a button to live you ought to be ashamed of yourself trifling with folks' hearts so i trifle with folks' hearts oh what shall i do cried susan think of others as well as yourself replied the old man in a rage think of me of you dear father does not your susan think of you no what will become of me if the man kills himself he is all i have to look to to save me from ruin what then cried susan coloring scarlet it is not his life you care for it is his means of being useful to us poor mr meadows he has no friend but me i will give you a line to him the line contained these words forgive me half an hour after receipt of it meadows was at the farm susan was going to make some faint apology he stopped her and said i know you like to make folk happy i have got a job for you a gentleman a friend of mine in cheshire wants a bailiff he has written to me a word from me will do the business now is there any one you would like to oblige the place is worth five hundred a year susan was grateful to him for waiving disagreeable topics she reflected and said ah but he is no friend of yours what does that matter if he is yours will fielding with all my heart only my name must not be mentioned you are right he can marry on this they would both have starved in 'the grove' thus he made the benevolent girl taste the sweets of power you will be asked to do many a kind action like this when you are mrs meadows so he bribed father and daughter each after their kind the offer came in form from the gentleman to will fielding he and miss holiday had already been cried in church they were married and went off to cheshire so meadows got rid of will fielding at a crisis when it suited his strategy he made his enemy's fortune with as little compunction as he would have ruined him a man of iron cold iron hot iron whatever iron was wanted mr and mrs fielding gone off to cheshire and mrs holiday after them on a visit of domestic instruction meadows publicly announced his approaching marriage with miss merton the coast being clear he clinched the last nail from this day there were gusts of repugnance but not a shadow of resistance on susan's side it was to be the weather was fine and every evening this man and woman walked together the woman envied by all the women the man by all the men yet they walked side by side like the ghosts of lovers and since he was her betrothed one or two iron gray hairs in the man's head had turned white and lines deepened in his face the victim had unwittingly revenged herself he had stabbed her heart again and again and drained it he had battered this poor heart till it had become more like leather than flesh and blood and now he wanted to nestle in it and be warmed by it to kill the affections and revive them at will no she tried to give happiness and to avoid giving pain but her heart of hearts was inaccessible the town had capitulated but the citadel was empty yet impregnable and there were moments when flashes of hate mingled with the steady flame of this unhappy man's love and he was tempted to kill her and himself but these weaknesses passed like air the iron purpose stood firm this day week they were to be married meadows counted the days and exulted he had faith in the magic ring it was on this monday evening then they walked arm in arm in the field and it so happened that meadows was not speaking of love but of a scheme for making all the poor people in grassmere comfortable especially of keeping the rain out of their roofs and the wind out of what they vulgarly but not unreasonably called their windys and susan's color was rising and her eyes brightening at this the one interesting side marriage offered to make people happy near her and round about her and she cast a look of gratitude upon her companion a look that coming from so lovely a face might very well pass for love while thus pleasantly employed the pair suddenly encountered a form in a long bristling beard who peered into their faces with a singular expression of strange and wild curiosity and anxiety but did not stop he was making toward farnborough susan was a little startled who is that i don't know he looked as if he knew us a traveler i think dearest the folk hereabouts have not got to wear those long beards yet why did you start when he passed us did i start susan your arm twitched me you must have fancied it replied meadows with a sickly smile but come susan the dew is falling you had better make toward home he saw her safe home then instead of waiting to supper as usual got his horse out and rode to the town full gallop any one been here for me yes a stranger with a long beard why yes he had he will come again in half an hour show him into my room when he comes and admit no one else meadows was hardly seated in his study and his candles lighted when the servant ushered in his visitor shut both the doors and you can go to bed i will let mr richards out well well we have done the trick between us eh what made you come home without orders asked meadows somewhat sternly why you know as well as me sir you have seen them who george fielding and his mate meadows started how should i see them sir why they are come home they gave me the slip and got away before me i followed them they are here they must be here crawley not noticing meadows' face went on sir when i found they had slipped out of the camp on horseback and down to sydney and saw them with my own eyes go out of the harbor for england i thought i should have died on the spot i thought i should never have the courage to face you but when i met you arm in arm her eye smiling on you i knew it was all right then when did the event come off what event the marriage sir you and the lady she is worth all the trouble she has given us you fool roared meadows we are not married the wedding is to be this day week crawley started and gasped we are ruined we are undone hold your bawling cried meadows fiercely and let me think he buried his face in his hands when he removed them he was gloomy but self possessed they are not in england crawley or we should have seen them they are on the road you sailed faster than they passed them at night perhaps they will soon be here my own heart tells me they will be here before monday well i will beat them still i will be married thursday next the iron man then turned to crawley and sternly demanded how he had let the man slip crawley related all and as he told his tale the tone of meadows altered he no longer doubted the zeal of his hireling he laid his hand on his brow and more than once he groaned and muttered half articulate expressions of repugnance at the conclusion he said moodily crawley you have served me well too well all the women upon earth were not worth a murder and we have been on the brink of several you went beyond your instructions no i did not replied crawley i have got them in my pocket i will read them to you see there is no discretion allowed me i was to bribe them to rob where do i countenance the use of deadly weapons where is there a word against deadly weapons asked crawley sharply be just to me sir he added in a more whining tone you know you are a man that must and will be obeyed you sent me to australia to do a certain thing and you would have flung me to perdition if i had stuck at anything to do it well sir i tried skill without force look here and he placed a small substance like white sugar on the table what is that put that in a man's glass he will never taste it and in half an hour he will sleep you might take the clothes off his back three of us watched months and months for a chance but it was no go those two were teetotal or next door it i wish i had never sent you out why replied crawley there is no harm done no blood has been spilled except on our own side george fielding is coming home all right give him up the lady and he will never know you were his enemy what cried meadows wade through all these crimes for nothing lie and feign and intercept letters and rob and all but assassinate and fail wade in crime up to my middle and then wade back again without the prize do you see this pistol it has two barrels if she and i are ever parted it shall be this way i'll send her to heaven with one barrel and myself to hell with the other there was a dead silence crawley returned to their old relation and was cowed by the natural ascendency of the greater spirit you need not look like a girl at me said meadows most likely it won't come to that it is not easy to beat me and i shall try every move man's wit can devise this last said he in a voice of iron touching the pistol as it lay on the table there was another pause then meadows rose and said calmly you look tired you shall have a bottle of my old port and my own heart is staggered but it is only for a moment he struck his hand upon his breast and walked slowly from the room and crawley heard his step descend to the hall and then to the cellar and the indomitable character of the man rang in his solid tread crawley was uneasy mr meadows is getting wildish it frightens me to see such a man as him burst out like that he is not to be trusted with a loaded pistol ah and i am in his secrets deep in his secrets great men sweep away little folk that know too much i never saw him with a pistol before all this passing rapidly through his head crawley pounced on the pistol took off the caps whipped out a little bottle and poured some strong stuff into the caps that loosened the detonating powder directly then with a steel pen he picked it all out and replaced the caps their virtue gone before mr meadows returned with two bottles and the confederates sat in close conclave till the gray of morning broke into the room the great man gave but few orders to his subordinate for this simple reason that the game had fallen into his own hands still there was something for crawley to do he was to have an officer watching to arrest will fielding on the old judgment should he which was hardly to be expected come to kick up a row and interrupt the wedding and to morrow he was to take out a writ against his father in law mr meadows played a close game he knew that things are not to be got when they are wanted his plan was to have everything ready that might be wanted long before it was wanted but most of the night passed in relation of what had already taken place and crawley was the chief speaker and magnified his services he related from his own point of view all that i have told and meadows listened with all his soul and intelligence at the attack on mr levi meadows chuckled the old heathen said he contemptuously i have beat him anyway by the way sir have you seen anything of him asked crawley no he is not come home then not that i know of have you any reason to think he has no only he left the mine directly after they pelted him but he would not leave the country any the more for that and money to be made in it by handfuls now crawley go and get some sleep a cold bath for me and then on horseback i must breakfast at grassmere great man sir great man you will beat them yet sir you have beat mr levi here we are in his house and he driven away to lay his sly old bones at the antipodes ha ha ha the sun came in at the window and the long conference broke up and strange to say it broke into three crawley home to sleep meadows to grassmere isaac levi to smoke an eastern pipe and so meditate with more tranquil pulse how to strike with deadliest effect these two his insolent enemies siste viator and guess that riddle chapter lxxxi isaac levi rescued by george fielding reached his tent smarting with pain and bitter insult he sat on the floor pale and dusty and anathematized his adversaries in the hebrew tongue wrath still boiling in his heart he drew out his letters and read them then grief mingled with his anger old cohen his friend and agent and coeval was dead another self dead besides the hint that this gave him to set his house in order a distinct consideration drew isaac now to england he had trusted much larger interests to old cohen than he was at all disposed to leave in the hands of cohen's successors men of another generation progeniem vitiosiorem he sincerely believed another letter gave him some information about meadows that added another uneasiness to those he already felt on george's account hence his bitter disappointment when he found george gone from the mine the date of his return uncertain hence too the purchase of moore's horses and the imploring letter to george measures that proved invaluable to that young man whose primitive simplicity and wise humility led him not to question the advice of his elder but obey it and so it was that although the old jew sailed home upon his own interests yet during the voyage george fielding's assumed a great importance direct and incidental direct because the old man was warm with gratitude to him indirect because he boiled over with hate of george's most dangerous enemy and as he neared the english coast the thought that though he was coming to farnborough he could not come home grew bitterer and bitterer and then that he should find his enemy and his insulter in the very house sacred by the shadows of the beloved and dead finding in nathan a youth of no common fidelity and shrewdness isaac confided in him and nathan proud beyond description of the confidence bestowed on him by one so honored in his tribe enlisted in his cause with all the ardor of youth tempered by jewish address often they sat together on the deck and the young jewish brain and the old jewish brain mingled and digested a course of conduct to meet every imaginable contingency for the facts they at present possessed were only general and vague the first result of all this was that these two crept into the town of farnborough at three o'clock one morning that isaac took out a key and unlocked the house that stood next to meadows' on the left hand that isaac took secret possession of the first floor and nathan open but not ostentatious possession of the ground floor with a tale skillfully concocted to excite no suspicion whatever that isaac was in any way connected with his presence in the town nathan it is to be observed had never been in farnborough before the next morning they worked nathan went out locking the door after him to execute two commissions he was to find out what the young cohens were doing and how far they were likely to prove worthy of the trust reposed in their father and what susan merton was doing and whether meadows was courting her or not the latter part of nathan's task was terribly easy the young man came home late at night locked the door made a concerted signal and was admitted to the senior presence he found him smoking his eastern pipe nathan with dejected air told him that he had good news that the cohens not only thought themselves wiser than their father which was permissible but openly declared it which he though young had observed to be a trait confined to very great fools it is well said my son quoth isaac smoking calmly and the other business oh master said nathan i bring still worse tidings of her she is a true nazarite a creature without faith she is betrothed to the man you hate and whom i for your sake hate even to death they spoke in an eastern dialect which i am paraphrasing here and translating there according to the measure of my humble abilities isaac sucked his pipe very fast this news was a double blow to his feelings if she be indeed a nazarite without faith let her go but judge not the simple hastily first let me know how far woman's frailty is to blame how far man's guile for not for nothing was crawley sent out to the mine by meadows let me consider and he smoked calmly again after a long silence which nathan was too respectful to break the old man gave him his commission for to morrow he was to try and discover why susan merton had written no letters for many months to george and why she had betrothed herself to the foe but reveal nothing in return said isaac neither ask more than three questions of any one person lest they say 'who is this that being a jew asks many questions about a nazarite maiden and why asks he them' at night nathan returned full of intelligence she loved the young man fielding she wrote letters to him and received letters from him until gold was found in australia but after this he wrote to her no more letters wherefore her heart was troubled ah and did she write to him yes but received no answer nor any letter for many months ah puff puff then came a rumor that he was dead and she mourned for him after the manner of her people many days verily master i am vexed for the nazarite maiden for her tale is sad then came a letter from australia that said he is not dead but married to a stranger then the maiden said 'behold now this twelve months he writes not to me this then is true' and she bowed her head and the color left her cheek then this meadows visited her and consoled her day by day and there are those who confidently affirm that her father said often to her 'behold now i am a man stricken in years and the man meadows is rich' so the maiden gave her hand to the man but whether to please the old man her father or out of the folly and weakness of females thou o isaac son of shadrach shalt determine seeing that i am young and little versed in the ways of women knowing this only by universal report that they are fair to the eye but often bitter to the taste aha cried isaac but i am old o nathan son of eli and with the thorns of old age comes one good fruit 'experience' no letters came to him yet she wrote many none came to her yet he wrote many all this is transparent as glass here has been fraud as well as guile nathan's eye sparkled what is the fraud master nay that i know not but i will know but how master by help of thine ears or my own nathan looked puzzled so long as mr levi shut himself up a close prisoner on the first floor what could he hear for himself isaac read the look and smiled he then rose and putting his finger to his lips led the way to his own apartments at the staircase door which even nathan had not yet passed he bade the young man take off his shoes he himself was in slippers he took nathan into a room the floor of which was entirely covered with mattresses a staircase the steps of which were covered with horsehair went by a tolerably easy slope and spiral movement nearly up to the cornice of this cornice a portion about a foot square swung back on a well oiled hinge and isaac drew out from the wall with the utmost caution a piece of gutta percha piping to this he screwed on another piece open at the end and applied it to his ear nathan comprehended it all in a moment his master could overhear every word uttered in meadows' study levi explained to him that ere he left his old house he had put a new cornice in the room he thought meadows would sit in a cornice so deeply ornamented that no one could see the ear he left in it and had taken out bricks in the wall of the adjoining house and made the other arrangements they were inspecting together mr levi further explained that his object was simply to overhear and counteract every scheme meadows should form he added that he never intended to leave farnborough for long his intention had been to establish certain relations in that country buy some land and return immediately but the gold discovery had detained him but master said nathan suppose the man had taken his business to the other side of his house foolish youth replied isaac am i not on both sides of him ah what is there another on the other isaac nodded thus while nathan was collecting facts isaac had been watching patient as a cat keen as a lynx at his ear hole and heard nothing now the next day nathan came in hastily long before the usual hour master another enemy is come the man crawley i saw him from the window he saw not me what shall i do keep the house all day i would not have him see you he would say 'aha the old jew is here too' nathan's countenance fell he was a prisoner now as well as his master the next morning rising early to prepare their food he was surprised to find the old man smoking his pipe down below all is well my son my turn has come i have had great patience and great is the reward he then told him with natural exultation the long conference he had been secretly present at between crawley and meadows a conference in which the enemy had laid bare not his guilt only but the secret crevice in his coat of mail she loves him not cried levi with exultation she is his dupe with a word i can separate them and confound him utterly oh master cried the youth eagerly speak that word to day and let me be there and hear it spoken if i have favor in your eyes speak it to day cried levi with a look of intense surprise at nathan's simplicity go to foolish youth said he what after i have waited months and months for vengeance would you have me fritter it away for want of waiting a day or two longer no i will strike not the empty cup from his hand but the full cup from his lips aha you have seen the jew insulted and despised in many lands have patience now and you shall see how he can give blow for blow ay old and feeble and without a weapon can strike his adversary to the heart nathan's black eye flashed you are the master i the scholar said he all i ask is to be permitted to share the watching for your enemy's words since i may not go abroad while it is day thus the old and young lynx lay in ambush all day and at night the young lynx prowled but warily lest crawley should see him and every night brought home some scrap of intelligence to change the metaphor it was as though while the western spider wove his artful web round the innocent fly the oriental spider wove another web round him the threads of which were so subtle as to be altogether invisible both east and west leaned with sublime faith on their respective gossamers nor remembered that dieu dispose chapter lxxxii meadows rode to grassmere to try and prevail with susan to be married on thursday next instead of monday as he rode he revolved every argument he could think of to gain her compliance he felt sure she was more inclined to postpone the day than to advance it but something told him his fate hung on this these two men will come home on monday i am sure of it ay monday morning before we can wed i will not throw a chance away the game is too close then he remembered with dismay that susan had been irritable and snappish just before parting yester eve a trait she had never exhibited to him before when he arrived his heart almost failed him but after some little circumlocution and excuse he revealed the favor the great favor he was come to ask he asked it she granted it without the shade of a demur he was no less surprised than delighted but the truth is that very irritation and snappishness of yesterday was the cause of her consenting her conscience told her she had been unkind and he had been too wise to snap in return so now he benefited by the reaction and little bit of self reproach for do but abstain from reproaching a good girl who has been unjust or unkind to you and ten to one if she does not make you the amemde by word or deed most likely the latter for so she can soothe her tender conscience without grazing her equally sensitive pride poor susan little knew the importance of the concession she made so easily meadows galloped home triumphant but two whole days now between him and his bliss and that day passed and tuesday passed the man lived three days and nights in a state of tension that would have killed some of us or driven us mad but his intrepid spirit rode the billows of hope and fear like a petrel and the day before the wedding it did seem as if his adverse fate got suddenly alarmed and made a desperate effort and hurled against him every assailant that could be found in the morning came his mother and implored him ere it was too late to give up this marriage i have kept silence yea even from good words said the aged woman but at last i must speak john she does not love you i am a woman and can read a woman's heart and you fancied her long before george fielding was false to her if false he ever was john the old woman said the whole of this last sentence with so much meaning that her son was stung to rage and interrupted her fiercely i looked to find all the world against me but not my own mother no matter so be it the whole world shan't turn me and those i don't care to fight i'll fly and he turned savagely on his heel and left the old woman there shocked and terrified by his vehemence she did not stay there long soon the scarlet cloak and black bonnet might have been seen wending their way slowly back to the little cottage the poor old tidy bonnet drooping lower than it was wont meadows came back to dinner he had a mutton chop in his study for it was a busy day while thus employed there came almost bursting into the room a man struck with remorse jefferies the recreant postmaster mr meadows i can carry on this game no longer and i won't for any man living he then in a wild loud and excited way went on to say how the poor girl had come a hundred times for a letter and looked in his face so wistfully and once she had said oh mr jefferies do have a letter for me and how he saw her pale face in his dreams and little he thought when he became meadows' tool the length the game was to be carried meadows heard him out then simply reminded him of his theft and assured him with an oath that if he dared to confess his villainy my villainy shrieked the astonished postmaster whose else you have intercepted letters not i you have abused the public confidence not i so if you are such a fool and sneak as to cut your throat by peaching on yourself i'll cry louder than you and i'll show you have emptied letters as well as stopped them go home to your wife and keep quiet or i'll smash both you and her oh i know you are without mercy and i dare not open my heart while i live but i will beat you yet you cruel monster i will leave a note for miss merton confessing all and blow out my brains to night in the office the man's manner was wild and despairing meadows eyed him sternly he said with affected coolness jefferies you are not game to take your own life ain't i was the reply at least i think not to night will show i must know that before night cried meadows and with the word he sprang on jefferies and seized him in a grasp of iron and put a pistol to his head ah no mr meadows mercy mercy shrieked the man in an agony of fear all right said meadows coolly putting up the pistol you half imposed on me and that is something for you to brag of you won't kill yourself jefferies you are not the stuff give over shaking like an aspen and look and listen you are in debt i've bought up two drafts of yours here they are come to me to morrow after the wedding and i will give you them to light your pipe with oh mr meadows that would be one load off my mind you are short of cash too come to me after the wedding and i'll give you fifty pounds cash you are very liberal sir i wish it was in a better cause now go home and don't be a sneak and a fool till after the wedding or i will sell the bed from under your wife's back and send you to the stone jug be off jefferies crept away paralyzed in heart and meadows standing up called out in a rage are there any more of you that hope to turn john meadows then come on come a thousand strong with the devil at your back and then i'll beat you and for a moment the respectable man was almost grand a man rock standing braving earth and heaven hist mr meadows he turned and there was crawley a word sir will fielding is in the town in such a passion come to stop the wedding he was taking a glass of ale at the 'toad and pickax' and you might hear him all over the yard what is he going to do sir he has bought an uncommon heavy whip he was showing it in the yard 'this is for john meadows' back' said he 'and i will give it him before the girl he has stolen from my brother if she takes a dog instead of a man it shall be a beaten dog' says he meadows rang the bell harness the mare to the four wheeled chaise you know what to do crawley well i can guess but first get him told that i am always at grassmere at six o'clock but you won't go there this evening of course why not aren't you afraid he afraid of will fielding why you have never looked at me i do notice your eyes are always on the ground crawley when i was eighteen one evening it was harvest home and all the folk had drunk their wit and manners out i found a farmer's wife in a lane hemmed in by three great ignorant brutes that were for kissing her or some nonsense and she crying help and murder and ready to faint with fright it was a decent woman and a neighbor so i interfered as thus i knocked the first fellow senseless on his back with a blow before they knew of me and then the three were two i fought the two giving and taking for full ten minutes and then i got a chance and one went down i put my foot on his neck and kept him down for all he could do and over his body i fought the best man of the lot and thrashed him so that his whole mug was like a ball of beetroot when he was quite sick he ran one way and t'other got up roaring and ran another and they had to send a hurdle for no dame fielding gave me of her own accord what all the row was about and more than one and hearty ones too i assure you and had me in to supper and told her man and he shook my hand a good one why sir you don't mean to say the woman you fought for was mrs fielding but i tell you it was and i had those two boys on my knee two chubby toads pulling at my curly hair why do i talk of these things oh i remember it was to show you i am not a man that can be bullied i am a much better man than i was at eighteen i won't be married in a black eye if i can help it but when i am once married here i stand against all comers and if you hear them grumble or threaten you tell them that any sunday afternoon when there is nothing better to be done i'll throw my cap into the ring and fight all the fieldings that ever were pupped one down another come on then turning quite cool and contemptuous all in a moment he said these are words and we have work on hand and even as he spoke he strode from the room pattered after by crawley at six o'clock meadows and susan were walking arm in arm in the garden presently they saw a man advancing toward them with his right hand behind him why it is will fielding cried susan come to thank you i think not by the look of him replied meadows coolly susan will you be so good as to take your hand from that man's arm i have got a word to say to him susan did more than requested seeing at once that mischief was coming she clung to william's right arm and while he ground his teeth with ineffectual rage for she was strong as her sex are strong for half a minute and to throw her off he must have been much rougher with her than he chose to be three men came behind unobserved by all but meadows and captured him on the old judgment and crawley having represented him as a violent man they literally laid the grasp of the law on him but i have got the money to pay it remonstrated william pay it then but my money is at home give me two days i'll write to my wife and she will send it me the officers with a coarse laugh told him he must come with them meantime meadows whispered susan i'll pay it for him to morrow they took off william fielding in meadows' four wheeled chaise where are they taking him john to the county jail oh don't let them take him there can you not trust him yes then why not pay for him but i don't carry money in my pocket and the bank is closed how unfortunate very but i'll send it over to morrow early and we will have him out oh yes poor fellow the very first thing in the morning yes the first thing after we are married soon after this meadows bade susan affectionately farewell and rode off to newborough to buy his gloves and some presents for his bride on the road he overtook william fielding going to jail leaned over his saddle as he cantered by and said mrs meadows will send the money in to free you in the morning then on again as cool as a cucumber and cantered into the town before sunset put up black rachel at the king's head made his purchases and back to the inn as he sat in the bar parlor drinking a glass of ale and chatting with the landlady two travelers came into the passage they did not stop in it long for one of them knew the house and led his companion into the coffee room but in that moment by a flash of recognition spite of their bronzed color and long beards meadows had seen who they were george fielding and thomas robinson words could not paint in many pages what meadows passed through in a few seconds his very body was one moment cold as ice the next burning the coffee room door was open he dragged himself into the passage though each foot in turn seemed glued to the ground and listened he came back and sat down in the bar are they going to stay said the mistress to the waiter yes to be called at five o'clock the bell rang the waiter went and immediately returned hot with demanded the waiter in a sharp mechanical tone here take my keys for the lump sugar said the landlady and she poured first the brandy and then the hot water into a tumbler then went upstairs to see about the travelers' beds meadows was left alone a few moments with the liquor a sudden flash came to meadows' eye he put his hand hastily to his waistcoat pocket and then his eye brightened still more yes it was there he thought he had had the curiosity to keep it by him he drew out the white lump crawley had left on his table that night and flung it into the glass just as the waiter returned with the sugar the waiter took the brandy and water into the coffee room meadows sat still as a mouse his brain boiling and bubbling awestruck at what he had done yet meditating worse the next time the waiter came in waiter said he one glass among two that is short allowance oh the big one is teetotal replied the waiter mrs white said meadows if you have got a bed for me i'll sleep here for my nag is tired and the night is darkish always a bed for you mr meadows was the gracious reply soon the two friends rang for bed candles robinson staggered with drowsiness meadows eyed them from behind a newspaper half an hour later mr meadows went to bed too but not to sleep chapter lxxxiii at seven o'clock in the morning crawley was at meadows' house by appointment to his great surprise the servant told him master had not slept at home while he was talking to her meadows galloped up to the door jumped off and almost pulled crawley upstairs with him lock the door crawley crawley obeyed but with some reluctance for meadows the iron meadows was ghastly and shaken as he had never been shaken before he sank into a chair perdition seize the hour i first saw her as for crawley he was paralyzed by the terrible agitation of a spirit so much greater than his own crawley said meadows with a sudden unnatural calm when the devil buys a soul for money how much does he give a good lump i hear he values our souls high we don't some of us mr meadows sir now count those yelled meadows bursting out again and he flung a roll of notes furiously on the ground at crawley's feet count and tell me what my soul has gone for oh oh crawley seized them and counted them as fast as his trembling fingers would let him so now an eye all remorse and another eye all greed were bent upon the same thing why they are all hundred pound notes bright as silver from the bank of england oh dear how new and crimp they are where do they come from sir from australia ah oh impossible no nothing is impossible to such a man as you twenty they are at newborough slept at 'king's head' whispered meadows good heavens think of that thirty so did i ah forty four thousand pounds the lump of stuff you left here hocussed one it was a toss up luck was on my side that one carried them slept like death long while hunting found them under his pillow at last well done and we fools were always beat at it sixty one two five seven seven thousand pounds seven thousand pounds who would have thought it this is a dear job to me say a dear job to them and a glorious haul to you but you deserve it all ah why you fool cried meadows do you think i am going to keep the men's money keep it why of course what am i a thief i john meadows that never wronged a man of a penny i take his sweetheart i can't live without her but i can live without his money i have crimes enough on my head but not theft there i say halt then why in the name of heaven did you take them at such a risk crawley put this question roughly for he was losing his respect for his idol you are as blind as a mole crawley was the disdainful answer don't you see that i have made george fielding penniless and that now old merton won't let him have his daughter why should he he said 'if you come back with one thousand pounds' and don't you see that when the writ is served on old merton he will be as strong as fire for me and against him he can't marry her at all now i shall soon or late and the day i marry susan that same afternoon seven thousand pounds will be put in george fielding's hand he won't know by whom but you and i shall know i am a sinner but not a villain crawley gave a dissatisfied grunt meadows struck a lucifer match and lighted a candle he placed the candle in the grate it was warm weather come now said he coolly burn them then they will tell no tales crawley gave a shriek like a mother whose child is falling out of window and threw himself on his knees with the notes in his hand behind his back no no sir oh don't think of it talk of crime what are all the sins we have done together compared with this you would not burn a wheat rick no not your greatest enemy's i know you would not you are too good a man this is as bad the good money that the bountiful heaven has given us for for the good of man come said meadows sternly no more of this folly and he laid his iron grasp on crawley mercy mercy think of me of your faithful servant who has risked his life and stuck at nothing for you how ungrateful great men are ungrateful crawley can you look me in the face and say that never till now but now i can and crawley rose to his feet and faced the great man the prize he was fighting for gave him supernatural courage to whom do you owe them to me you could never have had them but for my drug and yet you would burn them before my eyes a fortune to poor me to you yes what does it matter to you what becomes of them so that he never sees them again but it matters all to me give them to me and in twelve hours i will be in france with them you won't miss me sir i have done my work and it will be more prudent for since i have left you i can't help drinking and i might talk you know sir i might and let out what we should both be sorry for send me away to foreign countries where i can keep traveling and make it always summer i hate the long nights when it is dark i see such cu u rious things pray pray let me go and take these with me and never trouble you again the words though half nonsense were the other half cunning and the tones and looks were piteous meadows hesitated crawley knew too much to get rid of him was a bait and after all to annihilate the thing he had been all his life accumulating went against his heart he rang the bell hide the notes crawley bring me two shirts a razor and a comb crawley these are the terms that you don't go near that woman crawley with a brutal phrase expressed his delight at the idea of getting rid of her forever that you go at once to the railway station opens to day first train starts in an hour up to london over to france this evening i will sir hurrah hurrah then crawley burst into protestations of gratitude which meadows cut short he rang for breakfast fed his accomplice gave him a great coat for his journey and took the precaution of going with him to the station there he shook hands with him and returned to the principal street and entered the bank crawley kept faith he hugged his treasure to his bosom and sat down waiting for the train luck is on our side thought he if this had been open yesterday those two would have come on from newborough he watched the preparations they were decorating the locomotive with bouquets and branches they did not start punctually some soi disant great people had not arrived i will have a dram thought crawley he went and had three then he came back and as he was standing inspecting the carriages a hand was laid on his shoulder he looked round it was mr wood a functionary with whom he had often done business ah wood how d'ye do going to make the first trip no sir i have business detains me in town what a capias eh chuckled crawley something of the sort there is a friend of yours hard by wants to speak a word to you come along then where is he this way sir crawley followed wood to the waiting room and there on a bench sat isaac levi crawley stopped dead short and would have drawn back but levi beckoned to a seat near him crawley came walking like an automaton from whose joints the oil had suddenly dried with infinite repugnance he took the seat not liking to refuse before several persons who saw the invitation mr wood sat on the other side of him what does it all mean thought crawley but his cue was to seem indifferent or flattered you have shaved your beard mr crawley said isaac in a low tone my beard i never had one replied crawley in the same key yes you had when last i saw you in the gold mine you set ruffians to abuse me sir don't you believe that mr levi i saw it and felt it the peculiarity of this situation was that the room being full of people both parties wished each for his own reason not to excite general attention and therefore delivered scarce above a whisper the sort of matter that is generally uttered very loud and excitedly it is my turn now whispered levi an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth you must look sharp then whispered crawley to morrow perhaps you may not have the chance i never postpone vengeance when it is ripe don't you sir dear me you have seven thousand pounds about you mr crawley crawley started and trembled stolen whispered isaac in his very ear give it up to the officer crawley rose instinctively a firm hand was laid on each of his arms he sat down again what what ever money i have is trusted to me by the wealthiest and most respectable man in the cou nty and stolen by him received by you give it to wood unless you prefer a public search you can't search me without a warrant here is a warrant from the mayor take the notes out of your left breast and give them to the officer or we must do it by force and publicity i won't without mr meadows' authority send for mr meadows if you dare isaac reflected well we will take you to mr meadows keep the money till you see him but we must secure you put his coat over his hands first the great coat was put over his hands and the next moment under the coat was heard a little sharp click let us go to the carriage said levi in a brisk cheerful tone those present heard the friendly invitation and saw a little string of acquaintances three in number break up a conversation and go and get into a fly one carried a great coat and bundle before him with both hands chapter lxxxiv mr meadows went to the bank into the parlor and said he must draw seven thousand pounds of cash and securities the partners look blank i know said meadows i should cripple you well i am not going to nor let any one else it would not suit my book just hand me the securities and let me make over that sum to george fielding and thomas robinson there now for some months to come those two men are not to know how rich they are in fact not till i tell them a very ready consent to this was given by both partners i am afraid i might say an eager consent there now i feel another man that is off me anyway and meadows strode home double the man soon his new top boots were on and his new dark blue coat with flat double gilt buttons and his hat broadish in the brim and he looked the model of a british yeoman he reached grassmere before eleven o'clock it was to be a very quiet wedding but the bridesmaids etc were there and susan all in white pale but very lovely father in law cracking jokes susan writhing under them now then is it to be a wedding without bells for i hear none that it shall not cried one of the young men and off they ran to the church meantime meadows was the life and soul of the mirthful scene he was in a violent excitement that passed with the rustics for gayety natural to the occasion they did not notice his anxious glances up the hill that led to newborough his eager and repeated looks at his watch the sigh of relief when the church bells pealed out the tremors of impatience the struggle to appear cool as he sent one to hurry the clerk another to tell the clergyman the bride was ready the stamp of the foot when one of the bridesmaids took ten minutes to tie on a bonnet he walked arm in arm with susan waiting for this girl at last she was ready then came one running to say that the parson was not come home yet what it cost him not to swear at the parson with susan on his arm and the church in sight while he was thus fuming inwardly a handsome dark eyed youth came up and inquired which was the bride she was pointed out to him a letter for you miss merton for me who from she glanced at the handwriting and meadows looked keenly in the boy's face a jew said he to himself susan you have got your gloves on and in a moment he took the letter from her but quietly and opened it as if to return it to her to read he glanced down it saw jefferies postmaster and at the bottom isaac levi with wonderful presence of mind he tore it in pieces an insult susan he cried a mean malignant insult to set you against me a wife against her husband ere the words were out of his mouth he seized the young jew and whirled him like a feather into the hands of his friends duck him cried he and in a moment spite of his remonstrances and attempts at explanation nathan was flung into the horse pond he struggled out on the other side and stood on the bank in a stupor of rage and terror while the bridegroom menaced him with another dose should he venture to return i will tell you all about it to morrow susan calm yourself replied susan i know you have enemies but why punish a messenger for the letter he only carries you are an angel susan boys let him alone do you hear n b he had been ducked and now a loud hurrah was heard from behind the church the parson at last cried meadows exultingly susan lowered her eyes and hated herself for the shiver that passed through her to her the parson was the executioner it was not the parson the next moment two figures came round in sight meadows turned away with a groan george fielding said he the words dropped as it were out of his mouth susan misunderstood this she thought he read her heart and ascribed her repugnance to her lingering attachment to george she was angry with herself for letting this worthy man see her want of pride why do you mention that name to me what do i care for him who has deceived me i wish he stood at the church door that he might see how i would look at him and pass him leaning on your faithful arm susan cried a well known voice behind her she trembled and almost crouched ere she turned but the moment she turned round she gave a scream that brought all the company running and the bride forgot everything at the sight of george's handsome honest face beaming truth and love and threw herself into his arms george kissed the bride oh cried the bridesmaids awaking from their stupor and remembering this was her old lover oh oh oh on an ascending scale these exclamations brought susan to her senses she sprang from george as though an adder had stung her and red as fire her eyes like basilisks' she turned on him at a safe distance how dare you embrace me how dare you come where i am father ask this man why he comes here now to make me expose myself and insult the honest man who honors me with his respect oh father come to me and take me away from here susan what on earth is this what have i done what have you done you are false to me you never wrote me a letter for twelve months and you are married to a lady in bathurst oh george if he is cried robinson he must be slyer than i give him credit for for i have never left his side night nor day and i never saw him say three civil words to a woman mr robinson yes mr robinson somebody has been making a fool of you miss merton why all his cry night and day has been 'susan susan' when we found the great nugget he kisses it and says he 'there that is not because you are gold but because you take me to susan' hold your tongue tom said george sternly who puts me on my defense is there any man here who has been telling her i have ever had a thought of any girl but her if there is let him stand out now and say it to my face if he dares there was a dead silence there is a lie without a backer it seems and he looked round on all the company with his calm superior eye and now susan what were you doing on that man's arm oh miss merton and i are to be married to day said meadows that is why i gave her my arm george gasped for breath but he controlled himself by a mighty effort she thought me false and now she knows i am true susan faltered he i say nothing about the promises that have passed between us two and the ring you gave here it is he has kept my ring i was there before you mr meadows but i won't stand upon that i don't believe there is a man in the world loves a woman in the world better than i love susan but still i would not give a snap of the finger to have her if her will was toward another so please yourself my lass and don't cry like that only this must end i won't live in doubt a moment no nor half a moment speak your pleasure and nothing else choose between john meadows and george fielding that is fair cried one of the bridegrooms the women secretly admired george this is a man thought they won't stand our nonsense susan looked up in mute astonishment what choice can there be the moment i saw your face and truth still shining in it i forgot there was a john meadows in the world with these words susan cast a terrified look all round and losing every other feeling in a paroxysm of shame hid her burning face in her hands and made a sudden bolt into the house and upstairs to her room where she was followed and discovered by one of her bridesmaids tearing off her wedding clothes and laughing and crying all in a breath st bridegroom well josh what d'ye think d bridegroom why i think there won't be a wedding to day st bridegroom no nor to morrow neither sal put on your bonnet and let's you and i go home i came to meadows' wedding mustn't stay to anybody's else's these remarks were delivered openly pro bono and dissolved the wedding party four principal parties remained meadows old merton and the two friends well uncle susan has spoken her mind now you speak yours george i have been an imprudent fool i am on the brink of ruin i owe more than two thousand pounds we heard you had changed your mind and meadows came forward like a man and said he would your word uncle your promise i crossed the seas on the faith of it an upper window was gently opened and a blushing face listened and the hand that they were all discussing and disposing of drew back a little curtain and clutched it convulsively you did george said the old farmer says you 'bring back a thousand pounds to show me you are not a fool and you shall have my daughter' and she was to have your blessing am i right mr meadows you were present those were the words replied meadows well and have you brought back the thousand pounds i have john i must stand to my word and i will it is justice take the girl and be as happy as you can with her and her father in the work house i take her and that is as much as to say that neither her father nor any one she respects shall go to the workhouse how much is my share tom four thousand pounds no not so much yes it is jacky gave you his share of the great nugget and you gave him sheep in return here they are lads and lasses seventy of them varying from one five six naught to one six two nine and all as crimp as a muslin gown new starched why i never put this and he took pieces of newspaper out of his pocketbook and looked stupidly at each as it came out why tom robbed robbed tom robbed oh i put the book under my pillow and there i found it this morning robbed robbed kill me george i have ruined you i can't speak gasped george oh what is the meaning of this but i can speak don't tell me of a london thief being robbed george fielding if you are a man at all go and leave me and my daughter in peace if you had come home with money to keep her i was ready to give you susan to my own ruin now it is your turn to show yourself the right stuff my daughter has given her hand to a man who can make a lady of her and set me on my legs again you can only beggar us don't stand in the poor girl's light for pity's sake george leave us in peace you are right old man my head is confused and george put his hand feebly to his brow but i seem to see it is my duty to go and i'll go george staggered robinson made toward him to support him there don't make a fuss with me there is nothing the matter with me only my heart is dead let me sit on this bench and draw my breath a minute and then i'll go give me your hand tom never heed their jibes i'd trust you with more gold than the best of them was ever worth robinson began to blubber the moment george took his hand spite of the money lost we worked hard for it too good folks and risked our lives as well as our toil and george and robinson sat hand in hand upon the bench and turned their heads away that it was pitiful to see but still the pair held one another by the hand and george said faltering i have got this left me still ay i have heard say that friendship was better than love and i dare say so it is as if to plead against this verdict susan came timidly to her lover in his sorrow and sat on his other side and laid her head gently on his shoulder what signifies money to us two she murmured oh i have been robbed of what was dearer than life this bitter year and now you are down hearted at loss of money how foolish to grieve for such nonsense when i am so hap hap happy and again the lovely face rested light as down on george's shoulder weeping deliciously it is hard tom gasped george it is bitter hard but i shall find a little bit of manhood by and by to do my duty give me breath only give me breath we will go back again where we came from tom only i shall have nothing to work for now where is william if you please has he forgotten me too william is in prison for debt said old merton gravely no he is not put in meadows for i sent the money to let him out an hour ago you sent the money to let my brother out of jail that sounds queer to me i suppose i ought to thank you but i can't i don't ask your thanks young man you see george said old merton ours is a poor family and it will be a great thing for us all to have such a man as mr meadows in it if you will only let us oh father you make me blush cried susan beginning to get her first glimpse of his character he doesn't make me blush cried george but he makes me sick this old man would make me walk out of heaven if he was in it come let us go back to australia ay that is the best thing you can do cried old merton if he does i shall go with him said susan with sudden calmness she added dropping her voice if he thinks me worthy to go anywhere with him you are worthy of better than that and better shall be your luck and george sat down on the bench with one bitter sob that seemed to tear his manly heart in two there was a time meadows would have melted at this sad sight but now it enraged him he whispered fiercely to old merton touch him on his pride get rid of him and your debts shall be all paid that hour if not he then turned to that heart stricken trio touched his hat good day all the company said he and strode away with rage in his heart to set the law in motion against old merton and so drive matters to a point but before he had taken a dozen steps he was met by two men who planted themselves right before him you can't pass sir meadows looked at them with humorous surprise they had hooked noses he did not like that so well why not said he quietly but with a wicked look one of the men whistled a man popped out of the churchyard and joined the two he had a hooked nose another came through the gate from the lane another from behind the house the scene kept quietly filling with hooked noses till it seemed as if the ten tribes were reassembling from the four winds are they going to pitch into me thought meadows and he felt in his pocket to see if his pistol was there meantime george and susan and tom rose to their feet in some astonishment there is a chentleman coming to put a question or two said the first speaker and in fact an old acquaintance of ours mr williams came riding up and hooking his horse to the gate came in saying oh here you are mr meadows there is a ridiculous charge brought against you but i am obliged to hear it before dismissing it give me a seat oh here is a bench it is very hot i am informed that two men belonging to this place have been robbed of seven thousand pounds at the 'king's head' the 'king's heads in newborough it is true sir cried robinson but how did you know i am here to ask questions was the sharp answer who are you thomas robinson which is george fielding i am george fielding sir have you been robbed we have sir of how much seven thousand pounds come that tallies with the old gentleman's account hum where did you sleep last night mr meadows at the 'king's head' in newborough sir replied meadows without any visible hesitation well that is curious but i need not say i don't believe it is more than coincidence where is the old gentleman oh give way there and let him come here now all this was inexplicable to meadows but still it brought a deadly chill of vague apprehension over him he felt as if a huge gossamer net was closing round him another moment the only spider capable of spinning it stood in front of him i thought so dropped from his lips as isaac levi and he stood once more face to face i accuse that man of the theft nathan and i heard him tell crawley that he had drugged the young man's liquor and stolen the notes then we heard crawley beg for the notes and after much entreaty he gave them him it is true cried robinson in violent agitation it must be true you know what a light sleeper i am and how often you had to shake me this morning i was hocussed and no mistake silence yes your worship where were you mr levi to hear all this in the east room of my house and where was he in the west room of his house it is impossible say not so sir i will show you it is true meantime i will explain it he explained his contrivance at full meadows hung his head he saw how terribly the subtle oriental had outwitted him yet his presence of mind never for a moment deserted him sir said he i have had the misfortune to offend mr levi and he is my sworn enemy if you really mean to go into this ridiculous affair allow me to bring witnesses and i will prove to you he has been threatening vengeance against me these two years and you know a lie is not much to a jew does this appear likely i am worth sixty thousand pounds why should i steal why indeed said mr williams i stole these notes to give them away that is your story is it nay you stole them to beggar your rival whose letters to the maiden he loved you had intercepted by fraud at the post office in farnborough susan and george uttered an exclamation at the same moment but having stole them you gave them to crawley how generous sneered meadows well when you find crawley with seven thousand pounds and he says i gave them him mr williams will take your word against mine and not till then i think certainly not the most respectable man for miles round so be it retorted isaac coolly nathan bring crawley at that unexpected word meadows looked round for a way to escape the hooked nosed ones hemmed him in crawley was brought out of the fly quaking with fear sir said levi if in that man's bosom on the left hand side the missing notes are not found let me suffer scorn but if they be found give us justice on the evil doer the constable searched crawley amid the intense anxiety of all present he found a bundle of notes there was a universal cry stop sir said robinson to make sure i will describe our property seventy notes of one hundred pounds each numbers one five six naught to one six two nine mr williams examined the bundle and at once handed them over to robinson who shoved them hastily into george's hands and danced for joy mr williams looked ruefully at meadows then he hesitated then turning sharply to crawley he said where did you get these meadows tried to catch his eye and prevail on him to say nothing but crawley who had not heard levi's evidence made sure of saving himself by means of meadows' reputation i had them from mr meadows he cried and what about it it is not the first time he has trusted me with much larger sums than that oh you had them from mr meadows yes i had mr meadows i am sorry to say i must commit you but i still hope you will clear yourself elsewhere i have not the least uneasiness about that sir thank you you will admit me to bail of course impossible wood here is a warrant i will sign it while the magistrate was signing the warrant meadows' head fell upon his breast he seemed to collapse standing isaac levi eyed him scornfully you had no mercy on the old jew you took his house from him not for your need but for hate so he made that house a trap and caught you in your villainy yes you have caught me cried meadows but you will never cage me and in a moment his pistol was at his own temple and he pulled the trigger the cap failed he pulled the other trigger the other cap failed he gave a yell like a wounded tiger and stood at bay gnashing his teeth with rage and despair half a dozen men threw themselves upon him and a struggle ensued that almost baffles description he dragged those six men about up and down some clinging to his legs some to his body he whirled nearly every one of them to the ground in turn and when by pulling at his legs they got him down he fought like a badger on his back seized two by the throat and putting his feet under another drove him into the air doubled up like a ball and he fell on levi and sent the old man into mr williams' arms who sat down with a jew in his lap to the derangement of his magisterial dignity at last he was mastered and his hands tied behind him with two handkerchiefs take the rascal to jail cried williams in a passion meadows groaned ay take me said he you can't make me live there i've lived respected all these years and now i shall be called a felon take me where i may hide my head and die and the wretched man moved away with feeble steps his strength and spirit crushed now his hands were tied then crawley followed him abusing and reviling him so this is the end of all your maneuvering oh what a fool i was to side with such a bungler as you against mr levi here am i an innocent man ruined through knowing a thief ah you don't like that word but what else are you but a thief and so he followed his late idol and heaped reproaches and insults on him till at last meadows turned round and cast a vague look of mute despair as much as to say how am i fallen when this can trample me one of the company saw this look and understood it yielding to an impulse he took three steps and laid his hand on crawley ye little snake said he let the man alone and he sent crawley spinning like a teetotum then turned on his own heel and came away looking a little red and ashamed of what he had done my reader shall guess which of the company this was half way to the county jail meadows and crawley met william fielding coming back it took hours and hours to realize all the happiness that had fallen on two loving hearts first had to pass away many a spasm of terror at the wrongs they had suffered the danger they had escaped the long misery they had grazed they remained rooted to the narrow spot of ground where such great and strange events had passed in a few minutes and their destinies had fluctuated so violently and all ended in joy unspeakable and everybody put questions to everybody and all compared notes and the hours fled while they unraveled their own strange story and susan and george almost worshipped isaac levi and susan kissed him and called him her father and hung upon his neck all gratitude and he passed his hand over her chestnut hair and said go to foolish child but his deep rich voice trembled a little and wonderful tenderness and benevolence glistened in that fiery eye he would now have left them but nobody there would part with him behooved him to stay and eat fish and pudding with them the meat they would excuse him if he would be good and not talk about going again and after dinner george and tom must tell their whole story and as they told their eventful lives it was observed that the hearers were far more agitated than the narrators the latter had been in a gold mine had supped so full of adventures and crimes and horrors that nothing astonished them and they were made sensible of the tremendous scenes they had been through by the loud ejaculations the pallor the excitement of their hearers as for susan again and again during the men's narratives the tears streamed down her face and once she was taken faint at george's peril and the story had to be interrupted and water sprinkled on her and the men in their innocence were for not going on with their part but she peremptorily insisted and sneered at them for being so foolish as to take any notice of her foolishness she would have every word after all was he not there alive and well sent back to her safe after so many perils never never to leave england again oh giorno felice a day to be imagined or described by a pen a thousand times greater and subtler than mine but of this be sure it was a day such as neither to susan nor george nor to you nor me nor to any man or woman upon earth has ever come twice between the cradle and the grave chapter lxxxv a month of elysium and then one day george asked susan plump when it would be agreeable to her to marry him marry you george replied susan opening her eyes why never i shall never marry any one after you must be well aware of that susan proceeded to inform george that though foolishness was a part of her character selfishness was not recent events had destroyed an agreeable delusion under which she had imagined herself worthy to be mrs george fielding she therefore though with some reluctance intended to resign that situation to some wiser and better woman than she had turned out in this agreeable resolution she persisted varying it occasionally with little showers of tears unaccompanied by the slightest convulsion of the muscles of the face but as i am not like george fielding in love with susan merton or with self deception another's i spare the reader all the pretty things this young lady said and believed and did to postpone her inevitable happiness yes inevitable for this sort of thing never yet kept lovers long apart since the world was except in a novel worse than common i will but relate how that fine fellow george dried these foolish drops on one occasion susan said he if i had found you going to be married to another man with the roses on your cheek i should have turned on my heel and back to australia but a look in your face was enough you were miserable and any old fool could see your heart was dead against it look at you now blooming like a rose so what is the use of us two fighting against human nature we can't be happy apart let us come together ah george if i thought your happiness depended on having a foolish wife why you know it does replied the inadvertent agricola that alters the case sooner than you should be unhappy i think i name the day then in short the bells rang a merry peal and to reconcile susan to her unavoidable happiness mr eden came down and gave an additional weight in her way of viewing things to the marriage ceremony by officiating it must be owned that this favorable circumstance cost her a few tears too how so mr reade marry sir thus mr eden was what they call eccentric among his other deviations from usage he delivered the meaning of sentences in church along with the words this was a thunder clap to poor susan she had often heard a chanting machine utter the marriage service all on one note and heard it with a certain smile of unintelligent complacency her sex wear out of politeness but when the man eden told her at the altar with simple earnestness what a high and deep and solemn contract she was making then and there with god and man she began to cry and wept like april through the ceremony i have not quite done with this pair but leave them a few minutes for some words are due to other characters and to none i think more than to this very mr eden whose zeal and wisdom brought our hero and unheroine happily together through the subtle sequence of causes i have related the prime thread a converted thief mr eden's strength broke down under the prodigious effort to defeat the effect of separate confinement on the bodies and souls of his prisoners dr gulson ordered him abroad having now since the removal of hawes given the separate and silent system a long and impartial trial his last public act was to write at the foot of his report a solemn protest against it as an impious and mad attempt to defy god's will as written on the face of man's nature to crush too those very instincts from which rise communities cities laws prisons churches civilization and to wreck souls and bodies under pretense of curing souls not by knowledge wisdom patience christian love or any great moral effort but by the easy and physical expedient of turning one key on each prisoner instead of on a score these said mr eden are the dreams of selfish lazy heartless dunces and reckless bigots dwarf robespierres with self deceiving hearts that dream philanthropy fluent lips that cant philanthropy and hands swift to shed blood which is not blood to them because they are mere sensual brutes so low in intelligence that although men are murdered and die before their eyes they cannot see it was murder because there was no knocking on the head or cutting of throats the reverend gentleman then formally washed his hands of the bloodshed and reason shed of the separate system and resigned his office earnestly requesting at the same time that as soon as the government should come round to his opinion they would permit him to co operate in any enlightened experiment where god should no longer be defied by a knot of worms as in jail then he went abroad but though professedly hunting health he visited and inspected half the principal prisons in europe after many months events justified his prediction the government started a large prison on common sense and humanity and mr lacy's interest procured mr eden the place of its chaplain this prison was what every prison in the english provinces will be in five years' time a well ordered community an epitome of the world at large for which a prison is to prepare men not unfit them as frenzied dunces would do it was also a self sustaining community like the world the prisoners ate prisoner grown corn and meat wore prisoner made clothes and bedding wire lighted by gas made in the prison etc etc etc etc the agricultural laborers had out door work suited to their future destiny and mechanical trades were zealously ransacked for the city rogues anti theft reigned triumphant no idleness no wicked waste of sweat the members of this community sleep in separate cells as men do in other well ordered communities but they do not pine and wither and die in cells for offenses committee outside the prison walls here if you see a man caged like a wild beast all day you may be sure he is there not so much for his own good as for that of the little community in which he has proved himself unworthy to mix pro tem foul language and contamination are checkmated here not by the lazy selfish cruel expedient of universal solitude but by argus like surveillance officers sufficient in number listen with sharp ears and look with keen eyes the contaminator is sure to be seized and confined till prudence if not virtue ties his tongue thus he is disarmed and the better disposed encourage one another compare this legitimate and necessary use of that most terrible of tortures the cell with the tigro asinine use of it in seven english prisons out of nine at the present date it is just the difference between arsenic as used by a good physician and by a poisoner it is the difference between a razor bladed needle pointed knife in the hands of a christian a philosopher a skilled surgeon and the same knife in the hands of a savage a brute a scoundrel or a fanatical idiot mr eden had returned from abroad but a fortnight when he was called on to unite george and susan i have little more to add than that he was very hard worked and supremely happy in his new situation and that i have failed to do him justice in these pages but he shall have justice one day when pitiless asses will find themselves more foul in the eyes of the all pure than the thieves they crushed under four walls and the just shall shine forth as the sun and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever not crush thomas robinson did not stay long at grassmere things were said in the village that wounded him ill repute will not stop directly ill conduct does he went to see mr eden sent his name in as mr sinclair was received with open arms and gave the good man a glow of happiness such as most of us i fear go to the grave without feeling or earning he presented him a massive gold ring he had hammered out of a nugget mr eden had never worn a ring in his life but he wore this with an innocent pride and showed it people and valued it more than he would the pitt diamond which a french king bought of an english subject and the price was so heavy he paid for it by installments spread over many years robinson very wisely went back to australia and more wisely still married jenny with whom he had corresponded ever since he left her i have no fear he will ever break the eighth commandment again his heart was touched long ago and ever since then his understanding had received conviction upon conviction for oh the blaze of light that enters our souls when our fate puts us in his place in her place in their place whom we used to strike never realizing how it hurt them he is respected for his intelligence and good nature he is sober industrious pushing and punctilious in business one trait of the bohemian remains about every four months a restlessness comes over him then the wise jenny of her own accord proposes a trip poor tom's eyes sparkle directly off they go together a foolish wife would have made him go alone they come back and my lord goes to his duties with fresh zest till the periodical fit comes again no harm ever comes of it servants are at a great premium masters at a discount in the colony hence a domestic phenomenon which my english readers can hardly conceive but i am told my american friends have a faint glimpse of it in the occasional deportment of their helps in out of the way places now tom and especially jenny had looked forward to reigning in their own house and it was therefore a disappointment when they found themselves snubbed and treated with hauteur and jenny revolted against servant after servant who straightway abdicated and left her forlorn at last their advertisement was answered by a male candidate for menial authority who proved to be mr miles their late master tom and jenny colored up and both agreed it was out of the question they should feel too ashamed mr miles answered by offering to bet a crown he should make them the best servant in the street and strange to say the bargain was struck and he did turn out a model servant he was civil and respectful especially in public and never abused his situation comparing his conduct with his predecessors' it really appeared that a gentleman can beat snobs in various relations of life as tom's master and jenny's he had never descended to servility nor was he betrayed into arrogance now that he had risen to be their servant a word about jacky after the meal off the scented rabbit in the bush robinson said slyly to george i thought you promised jacky a hiding well here he is now tom replied the other coloring up is it reasonable and he has just saved our two lives but if you think that i won't take him to task you are much mistaken george then remonstrated with the chief for spoiling abner with his tomahawk jacky opened his eyes with astonishment and admiration here was another instance of the white fellow's wonderful power of seeing things a good way behind him he half closed his eyes and tried in humble imitation to peer back into the past yes he could just manage to see himself very indistinctly giving abner a crack but stop let him see it was impossible to be positive but was not there also some small trifle of insolence ingratitude and above all bungality on the part of this abner when the distance had become too great to see the whole of a transaction why strain the eyes looking at a part finally jacky submitted that these microscopic researches cost a good deal of trouble and on the whole his tribe were wiser than the white fellows in this that they reveled in the present and looked on the past as a period that never had been and the future as one that never would be on this george resigned the moral culture of his friend soil is not altogether bad said agricola but bless your heart it isn't a quarter of an inch deep on george's departure jacky being under the temporary impression of his words collected together a mixed company of blacks and marched them to his possessions arrived he harangued them on the cleverness of the white fellows and invited them to play at europeans behold this ingenious structure said he in australian this is called a house its use is to protect us from the weather at night all you have to do is to notice which way the wind blows and go and lie down on the opposite side of the house and there you are then again when you are cold you will find a number of wooden articles in the house you go in you bring them out and burn them and are warm he then produced what he had always considered the chef d'oeuvre of the white races a box of lucifer matches this too was a present from george see what clever fellows they are said he they carry about fire which is fire or not fire at the fortunate possessor's will and he let off a lucifer these the tribe admired but doubted whether all those little sticks had the same marvelous property and would become fire in the hour of need jacky sneered at their incredulity and let them all off one by one in a series of preliminary experiments this impaired their future usefulness in short they settled there one or two's heads had to be broken for killing the breeders for dinner and that practice stopped but the pot bellied youngsters generally celebrated the birth of a lamb by spearing it they slept on the lee side of the house warmed at night by the chairs and tables etc which they lighted they got on very nicely only one fine morning without the slightest warning whir r r r they all went off to the woods jacky and all and never returned the remaining bullocks strayed devious and the douce mclaughlan blandly absorbed the sheep hasty and imperfect as my sketch of this jacky is give it a place in your notebook of sketches for in a few years the australian savage will breathe only in these pages and the saxon plow will erase his very grave his milmeridien brutus lived but the form and strength he had abused were gone he is the shape of a note of interrogation and by a coincidence is now an asker ie he begs receives alms and sets on a gang of burglars with whom he is in league to rob the good christians that show him pity mephistopheles came suddenly to grief when gold was found in victoria he crossed over to that port and robbed one day he robbed the tent of an old man a native of the colony who was digging there with his son a lad of fifteen now these currency lads are very sharp and determined the youngster caught a glimpse of the retiring thief and followed him and saw him enter a tent he watched at the entrance and when mephistopheles came out again he put a pistol to the man's breast and shot him dead without a word of remonstrance accusation or explanation a few diggers ran out of their claims if our gold is not on him says the youngster i have made a mistake the gold was found on the carcass and the diggers went coolly back to their work the youngster went directly to the commissioner and told him what he had done i don't see that i am called on to interfere replied that functionary he was taken in the act you have buried him of course not i i let him lie for whoever chose to own him you let him lie what when there is a printed order from the government stuck over the whole mine that nobody is to leave carrion about you go off directly and bury your carrion or you will get into trouble young man and the official's manner became harsh and threatening if ever a man was shot like a dog surely the assassin of carlo was mr meadows in the prison refused his food and fell into a deep depression but the third day he revived and fell to scheming again he sent to mr levi and offered to give him a long lease of his old house if he would but be absent from the trial this was a sore temptation to the old man but meantime stronger measures were taken in his defense and without consulting him one evening that susan and george were in the garden at grassmere suddenly an old woman came toward them with slow and hesitating steps susan fled at the sight of her she hated the very name this old woman bore george stood his ground looking sheepish the old woman stood before him trembling violently and fighting against her tears she could not speak but held out a letter to him he took it the ink was rusty it was written twenty years ago it was from his mother to her neighbor mrs meadows then on a visit at newborough telling her how young john had fought for and protected her against a band of drunken ruffians and how grateful she was and i do hope dame he will be as good friends with my lads when they are men as you and i have been this many a day george did not speak for a long time he held the letter and it trembled a little in his hand he looked at the old woman standing a piteous silent supplicant mrs meadows said he scarce above a whisper give me this letter if you will be so good i have not got her handwriting except our names in the bible she gave him the letter half reluctantly and looked fearfully and inquiringly in his face he smiled kindly and a sort of proud curl came for a moment to his lip and the woman read the man this royal rustic would not have taken the letter if he had not granted the mother's unspoken prayer god bless you both said she and went on her way the assizes came and meadows' two plaintiffs both were absent robinson gone to australia and george forfeited his recognizances and had to pay a hundred pound for it the defendants were freed then isaac levi said to himself he will not keep faith with me but he did not know his man meadows had a conscience though an oblique one a promise from him was sacred in his own eyes a man came to grassmere and left a hundred pound in a letter for george fielding then he went on to levi and gave him a parcel and a note the parcel contained the title deeds of the house and the note said take the house and the furniture and pay me what you consider they are worth and old man i think you might take your curse off me for i have never known a heart at rest since you laid it on me and you see now our case is altered you have a home now and john meadows has none then the old man was softened and he wrote a line in reply and said three just men shall value the house and furniture and i will pay etc etc put now adversity to profit repent and prosper isaac levi wishes you no ill from this day but rather good thus died as mortal feelings are apt to die an enmity its owners thought immortal a steam vessel glided down the thames bound for port phillip on the deck were to be seen a little girl crying bitterly this was hannah a stalwart yeoman like figure who stood unmoved as the shores glided by omne solum forti patria and an old woman who held his arm as if she needed to feel him at the moment of leaving her native land this old woman had hated and denounced his sins and there was scarce a point of morality on which she thoroughly agreed with him yet at threescore years and ten she left her native land with two sole objects to comfort this stout man and win him to repentance he shall repent said she to herself even now his eyes are opening his heart is softening three times he has said to me 'that george fielding is a better man than i am' he will repent again he said to me i have thought too little of you and too much where it was a sin for me even to look' he will repent his voice is softer he bears no malice he blames none but himself it is never too late to mend he will repent and i shall see him happy and lay my old bones to rest contented though not where i thought to lay them in grassmere churchyard ah you do well to hold that quaint little old figure with that strong arm closer to you than you have done this many years ay since you were a curly headed boy it is a good sign john on neither side of the equator shall you ever find a friend like her all other love is mockery and deceit 'tis like the mirage of the desert that appears a cool refreshing water and allures the thirsty traveler but flies anon and leaves him disappointed wondering so fair a vision should so futile prove a mother's love is like unto a well sealed and kept secret a deep hidden fount that flows when every other spring is dry sophia woodrooffe peter crawley left to his own resources practices at the county courts in his old neighborhood and drinks with all his clients who are of the lowest imaginable order he complains that he can't peck yet continues the cause of his infirmity living almost entirely upon cock a doodle broth eggs beat up in brandy and a little water like scipio he is never less alone than when alone with this difference that the companions of p c's solitude do not add to the pleasure of his existence unless somebody can make him see that it is never too late to mend this little rogue fool and sot will shut up like a knife some day so says a medical friend and then it will be too late it is nine in the evening a little party is collected of farmers and their wives and daughters mrs george fielding rises and says now i must go home remonstrance of hostess george will be at home by now well wait till he comes for you oh he won't come for fear of shortening my pleasure susan then explains that george is so foolish that he never will go into the house when she is not in it and here is a drizzle come on and there he will be sitting out in it i know if i don't go and drive him in events justify the prediction the good wife finds her husband sitting on the gate kicking his heels quite contented and peaceable only he would not pay the house the compliment of going into it when she was not there he told her once he looked on it as no better than a coal hole when she was not shining up and down it n b they have been some years married a calm but very tender conjugal love sits at this innocent hearth george has made a great concession for an englishman he has solemnly deposited before witnesses his sobriquet of unlucky george not he was careful to explain because he found the great nugget nor because the meadow he bought in bathurst for two hundred pounds has just been sold by robinson for twelve thousand pounds but on account of his being susan's husband and susan is very happy besides the pleasure of loving and being loved she is in her place in creation the class of women a very large one to which she belongs comes into the world to make others happy susan is skillful at this and very successful she makes everybody happy round her and that is so pleasant she makes the man she loves happy and that is delightful my reader shall laugh at her my unfriendly critic shall sneer at her as a heroine of a novel she deserves it but i hope for their own sakes neither will undervalue the original in their passage through life these average women are not the spice of fiction but they are the salt of real life william fielding is godfather to susan's little boy he can stand by his brother's side and look without compunction on anne fielding's grave and think without an unmanly shudder of his own end of it is never too late to mend
