peg woffington by charles reade to t taylor esq my friend and coadjutor in the comedy of masks and faces to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in this tale and to the memory of margaret woffington falsely summed up until today this dramatic story is inscribed by charles reade london dec chapter i about the middle of the last century at eight oclock in the evening in a large but poor apartment a man was slumbering on a rough couch his rusty and worn suit of black was of a piece with his uncarpeted room the deal table of home manufacture and its slim unsnuffed candle the man was triplet scene painter actor and writer of sanguinary plays in which what ought to be viz truth plot situation and dialogue were not and what ought not to be werescilicet small talk big talk fops ruffians and ghosts his three mediocrities fell so short of one talent that he was sometimes impransus he slumbered but uneasily the dramatic author was uppermost and his demon of the hayloft hung upon the thread of popular favor on his uneasy slumber entered from the theater mrs triplet she was a lady who in one respect fell behind her husband she lacked his variety in illdoing but she recovered herself by doing her one thing a shade worse than he did any of his three she was what is called in grim sport an actress she had just cast her mite of discredit on royalty by playing the queen and had trundled home the moment the breath was out of her royal body she came in rotatory with fatigue and fell gristle into a chair she wrenched from her brow a diadem and eyed it with contempt took from her pocket a sausage and contemplated it with respect and affection placed it in a fryingpan on the fire and entered her bedroom meaning to don a loose wrapper and dethrone herself into comfort but the poor woman was shot walking by morpheus and subsided altogether for dramatic performances amusing and exciting to youth seated in the pit convey a certain weariness to those bright beings who sparkle on the stage for bread and cheese royalty disposed of still left its trail of events the sausage began to spit the sound was hardly out of its body when poor triplet writhed like a worm on a hook spitter spittest went the sausage triplet groaned and at last his inarticulate murmurs became words thats right pit now that is so reasonable to condemn a poor fellows play before you have heard it out then with a change of tone tom muttered he they are losing their respect for specters if they do hunger will make a ghost of me next he fancied the clown or somebody had got into his ghosts costume dear said the poor dreamer the clown makes a very pretty specter with his ghastly white face and his bloodboltered cheeks and nose i never saw the fun of a clown before no no no it is not the clown it is worse much worse oh dear ugh and triplet rolled off the couch like richard the third he sat a moment on the floor with a finger in each eye and then finding he was neither daubing ranting nor deluging earth with acts he accused himself of indolence and sat down to write a small tale of blood and bombast he took his seat at the deal table with some alacrity for he had recently made a discovery how to write well rien que cela first think in as homely a way as you can next shove your pen under the thought and lift it by polysyllables to the true level of fiction when done find a publisherif you can this said triplet insures common sense to your ideas which does pretty well for a basis said triplet apologetically and elegance to the dress they wear triplet then casting his eyes round in search of such actual circumstances as could be incorporated on this plan with fiction began to work thus triplets facts triplets fiction a farthing dip is on the table a solitary candle cast its pale gleams around it wants snuffing its elongated wick betrayed an owner steeped in oblivion he jumped up and snuffed it he rose languidly and trimmed it with his fingers burned his with an instrument that he had by his fingers and swore a little side for that purpose and muttered a silent ejaculation before however the mole triplet could undermine literature and level it with the dust various interruptions and divisions broke in upon his design and sic nos servavit apollo as he wrote the last sentence a loud rap came to his door a servant in livery brought him a note from mr vane dated covent garden triplets eyes sparkled he bustled wormed himself into a less rusty coat and started off to the theater royal covent garden in those days the artists of the pen and the brush ferreted patrons instead of aiming to be indispensable to the public the only patron worth a single gesture of the quill mr vane had conversed with triplet that is let triplet talk to him in a coffeehouse and triplet the most sanguine of unfortunate men had already built a series of expectations upon that interview when this note arrived leaving him on his road from lambeth to covent garden we must introduce more important personages mr vane was a wealthy gentleman from shropshire whom business had called to london four months ago and now pleasure detained business still occupied the letters he sent now and then to his native county but it had ceased to occupy the writer he was a man of learning and taste as times went and his love of the arts had taken him some time before our tale to the theaters then the resort of all who pretended to taste and it was thus he had become fascinated by mrs woffington a lady of great beauty and a comedian high in favor with the town the first night he saw her was an epoch in the history of this gentlemans mind he had learning and refinement and he had not great practical experience and such men are most open to impression from the stage he saw a being all grace and bright nature move like a goddess among the stiff puppets of the scene her glee and her pathos were equally catching she held a golden key at which all the doors of the heart flew open her face too was as full of goodness as intelligenceit was like no other farce the heart bounded to meet it he rented a box at her theater he was there every night before the curtain drew up and im sorry to say he at last took half a dislike to sundaysunday which knits up the raveled sleave of care sunday tired natures sweet restorer because on sunday there was no peg woffington at first he regarded her as a being of another sphere an incarnation of poetry and art but by degrees his secret aspirations became bolder she was a woman there were men who knew her some of them inferior to him in position and he flattered himself in mind he had even heard a tale against her character to him her face was its confutation and he knew how loosetongued is calumny but still at last one day he sent her a letter unsigned this letter expressed his admiration of her talent in warm but respectful terms the writer told her it had become necessary to his heart to return her in some way his thanks for the land of enchantment to which she had introduced him soon after this choice flowers found their way to her dressingroom every night and now and then verses and precious stones mingled with her roses and eglantine and oh how he watched the great actresss eye all the night how he tried to discover whether she looked oftener toward his box than the corresponding box on the other side of the house did she notice him or did she not what a point gained if she was conscious of his nightly attendance she would feel he was a friend not a mere auditor he was jealous of the pit on whom mrs woffington lavished her smiles without measure at last one day he sent her a wreath of flowers and implored her if any word he had said to her had pleased or interested her to wear this wreath that night after he had done this he trembled he had courted a decision when perhaps his safety lay in patience and time she made her entree he turned cold as she glided into sight from the prompters side he raised his eyes slowly and fearfully from her feet to her head her head was bare wreathed only by its own rich glossy honors fool thought he to think she would hang frivolities upon that glorious head for me yet his disappointment told him he had really hoped it he would not have sat out the play but for a leaden incapacity of motion that seized him the curtain drew up for the fifth act andcould he believe his eyesmrs woffington stood upon the stage with his wreath upon her graceful head she took away his breath she spoke the epilogue and as the curtain fell she lifted her eyes he thought to his box and made him a distinct queenlike courtesy his heart fluttered to his mouth and he walked home on wings and tiptoe in short mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wildair like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized now it very very rarely happens that a woman of her age is high enough in art and knowledge to do these things in players vanity cripples art at every step the young actress who is not a woffington aims to display herself by means of her part which is vanity not to raise her part by sinking herself in it which is art it has been my misfortune to see and and et ceteras play the man nature forgive them if you can for art never will they never reached any idea more manly than a steady resolve to exhibit the points of a woman with greater ferocity than they could in a gown but consider ladies a man is not the meanest of the brute creation so how can he be an unwomanly female this sort of actress aims not to give her authors creation to the public but to trot out the person instead of the creation and shows sots what a calf it hasand is vanity vanity all is vanity mesdames les charlatanes margaret woffington was of another mold she played the ladies of high comedy with grace distinction and delicacy but in sir harry wildair she parted with a womans mincing foot and tongue and played the man in a style large spirited and elance as mrs day committee she painted wrinkles on her lovely face so honestly that she was taken for threescore and she carried out the design with voice and person and did a vulgar old woman to the life she disfigured her own beauties to show the beauty of her art in a word she was an artist it does not follow she was the greatest artist that ever breathed far from it mr vane was carried to this notion by passion and ignorance on the evening of our tale he was at his post patiently sitting out one of those sanguinary discourses our rude forefathers thought were tragic plays sedet aeternumque sedebit infelix theseus because mrs woffington is to speak the epilogue these epilogues were curiosities of the human mind they whom just to ourselves and them we call our forbears had an idea their blood and bombast were not ridiculous enough in themselves so when the curtain had fallen on the debris of the dramatis personae and of common sense they sent on an actress to turn all the sentiment so laboriously acquired into a jest to insist that nothing good or beautiful shall be carried safe from a play out into the street was the bigotry of english horseplay was a lucretia the heroine of the tragedy she was careful in the epilogue to speak like messalina did a kings mistress come to hunger and repentance she disinfected all the petites maitresses in the house of the moral by assuring them that sin is a joke repentance a greater and that she individually was ready for either if they would but cry laugh and pay then the audience used to laugh and if they did not lo the manager actor and author of heroic tragedy were exceeding sorrowful while sitting attendance on the epilogue mr vane had nothing to distract him from the congregation but a sanguinary sermon in five heads so his eyes roved over the pews and presently he became aware of a familiar face watching him closely the gentleman to whom it belonged finding himself recognized left his seat and a minute later sir charles pomander entered mr vanes box this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals a few nights ago unseen by mr vane he had observed him in the theater an ordinary man would have gone at once and shaken hands with him but this was not an ordinary man this was a diplomatist first of all he said to himself what is this man doing here then he soon discovered this man must be in love with some actress then it became his business to know who she was this too soon betrayed itself then it became more than ever sir charless business to know whether mrs woffington returned the sentiment and here his penetration was at fault for the moment he determined however to discover mr vane then received his friend all unsuspicious how that friend had been skinning him with his eyes for some time past after the usual compliments had passed between two gentlemen who had been hand and glove for a month and forgotten each others existence for two years sir charles still keeping in view his design said let us go upon the stage the fourth act had just concluded go upon the stage said mr vane what where shei mean among the actors yes come into the greenroom there are one or two people of reputation there i will introduce you to them if you please go upon the stage why if it had been proposed to him to go to heaven he would not have been more astonished he was too astonished at first to realize the full beauty of the arrangement by means of which he might be within a yard of mrs woffington might feel her dress rustle past him might speak to her might drink her voice fresh from her lips almost before it mingled with meaner air silence gives consent and mr vane though he thought a great deal said nothing so pomander rose and they left the boxes together he led the way to the stage door which was opened obsequiously to him they then passed through a dismal passage and suddenly emerged upon that scene of enchantment the stagea dirty platform encumbered on all sides with piles of scenery in flats they threaded their way through rusty velvet actors and fustian carpenters and entered the greenroom at the door of this magic chamber vane trembled and half wished he could retire they entered his apprehension gave way to disappointment she was not there collecting himself he was presently introduced to a smart jaunty and to do him justice distingue old beau this was colley cibber esq poet laureate and retired actor and dramatist a gentleman who is entitled to a word or two this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of his day he also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvelously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand forever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highly powdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mademoiselle dumenil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the whole mr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some half dozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way here pomander soothed the veterans dudgeon by explaining in dulcet tones that his friend was not long from shropshire andthe critic interrupted him and bade him not dilute the excuse now mr vane had as much to say as either of them but he had not the habit which dramatic folks have of carrying his whole bank in his cheekpocket so they quenched him for two minutes but lovers are not silenced he soon returned to the attack he dwelt on the grace the ease the freshness the intelligence the universal beauty of mrs woffington pomander sneered to draw him out cibber smiled with goodnatured superiority this nettled the young gentleman he fired up his handsome countenance glowed he turned demosthenes for her he loved one advantage he had over both cibber and pomander a fair stock of classical learning on this he now drew other actors and actresses said he are monotonous in voice monotonous in action but mrs woffingtons delivery has the compass and variety of nature and her movements are free from the stale uniformity that distinguishes artifice from art the others seem to me to have but two dreams of grace a sort of crawling on stilts is their motion and an angular stiffness their repose he then cited the most famous statues of antiquity and quoted situations in plays where by her fine dramatic instinct mrs woffington he said threw her person into postures similar to these and of equal beauty not that she strikes attitudes like the rest but she melts from one beautiful statue into another and if sculptors could gather from her immortal graces painters too might take from her face the beauties that belong of right to passion and thought and orators might revive their withered art and learn from those golden lips the music of old athens that quelled tempestuous mobs and princes drunk with victory much as this was he was going to say more ever so much more but he became conscious of a singular sort of grin upon every face this grin made him turn rapidly round to look for its cause it explained itself at once at his very elbow was a lady whom his heart recognized though her back was turned to him she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvelous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors feature they were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness at another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will it must be confessed that a sort of halo of personal grandeur surrounds a great actress a scene is set half a dozen nobodies are there lost in it because they are and seem lumps of nothing the great artist steps upon that scene and how she fills it in a moment mind and majesty wait upon her in the air her person is lost in the greatness of her personal presence she dilates with thought and a stupid giantess looks a dwarf beside her no wonder then that mr vane felt overpowered by this torch in a closet to vary the metaphor it seemed to him as she swept up and down as if the greenroom was a shell and this glorious creature must burst it and be free meantime the others saw a pretty actress studying her business and cibber saw a dramatic schoolgirl learning what he presumed to be a very silly set of words sir c pomanders eye had been on her the moment she entered and he watched keenly the effect of vanes eloquent eulogy but apparently the actress was too deep in her epilogue for anything else she came in saying mum mum mum over her task and she went on doing so the experienced mr cibber who had divined vane in an instant drew him into a corner and complimented him on his welltimed eulogy you acted that mighty well sir said he stop my vitals if i did not think you were in earnest till i saw the jade had slipped in among us it told sirit told up fired vane what do you mean sir said he do you suppose my admiration of that lady is feigned no need to speak so loud sir replied the old gentleman she hears you these hussies have ears like hawks he then dispensed a private wink and a public bow with which he strolled away from mr vane and walked feebly and jauntily up the room whistling fair hebe fixing his eye upon the past and somewhat ostentatiously overlooking the existence of the present company there is no great harm in an old gentleman whistling but there are two ways of doing it and as this old beau did it it seemed not unlike a small cockadoodledoo of general defiance and the denizens of the greenroom swelled now to a considerable number by the addition of all the ladies and gentlemen who had been killed in the fourth act or whom the butteryfingered author could not keep in hand until the fall of the curtain felt it as such and so they were not sorry when mrs woffington looking up from her epilogue cast a glance upon the old beau waited for him and walked parallel with him on the other side of the room giving an absurdly exact imitation of his carriage and deportment to make this more striking she pulled out of her pocket after a mock search a huge paste ring gazed on it with a ludicrous affectation of simple wonder stuck it like cibbers diamond on her little finger and pursing up her mouth proceeded to whistle a quick movement which by some devilish cantrip sleight played round the old beaus slow movement without being at variance with it as for the character of this ladylike performance it was clear brilliant and loud as blacksmith the folk laughed vane was shocked she profanes herself by whistling thought he mr cibber was confounded he appeared to have no idea whence came this sparkling adagio he looked round placed his hands to his ears and left off whistling so did his musical accomplice gentlemen said cibber with pathetic gravity the wind howls most dismally this evening i took it for a drunken shoemaker at this there was a roar of laughter except from mr vane peg woffington laughed as merrily as the others and showed a set of teeth that were really dazzling but all in one moment without the preliminaries an ordinary countenance requires this laughing venus pulled a face gloomy beyond conception down came her black brows straight as a line and she cast a look of bitter reproach on all present resuming her study as who should say are ye not ashamed to divert a poor girl from her epilogue and then she went on mum mum mum casting off ever and anon resentful glances and this made the fools laugh again the laureate was now respectfully addressed by one of his admirers james quin the falstaff of the day and the rival at this time of garrick in tragic characters though the general opinion was that he could not long maintain a standing against the younger genius and his rising school of art off the stage james quin was a character his eccentricities were threea humorist a glutton and an honest man traits that often caused astonishment and ridicule especially the last may we not hope for something from mr cibbers pen after so long a silence no was the considerate reply who have ye got to play it plenty said quin theres your humble servant theres humility at the head of the list cried she of the epilogue mum mum mum vane thought this so sharp garrick barry macklin kitty clive here at my side mrs cibber the best tragic actress i ever saw and woffington who is as good a comedian as you ever saw sir and quin turned as red as fire keep your temper jemmy said mrs woffington with a severe accent mum mum mum you misunderstand my question replied cibber calmly i know your dramatis personae but where the devil are your actors here was a blow the public said quin in some agitation would snore if we acted as they did in your time how do you know that sir was the supercilious rejoinder you never tried mr quin was silenced peg woffington looked off her epilogue bad as we are said she coolly we might be worse mr cibber turned round slightly raised his eyebrows indeed said he madam added he with a courteous smile will you be kind enough to explain to me how you could be worse if like a crab we could go backward at this the auditors tittered and mr cibber had recourse to his spyglass this gentleman was satirical or insolent as the case might demand in three degrees of which the snuffbox was the comparative and the spyglass the superlative he had learned this on the stage in annihilating quin he had just used the snuff weapon and now he drew his spyglass upon poor peggy whom have we here said he then he looked with his spyglass to see oh the little irish orangegirl whose basket outweighed colley cibbers salary for the first twenty years of his dramatic career was the delicate reply to the above delicate remark it staggered him for a moment however he affected a most puzzled air then gradually allowed a light to steal into his features eh ah oh how stupid i am i understand you sold something besides oranges oh said mr vane and colored up to the temples and cast a look on cibber as much as to say if you were not seventythree his ejaculation was something so different from any tone any other person there present could have uttered that the actresss eye dwelt on him for a single moment and in that moment he felt himself looked through and through i sold the young fops a bargain you mean was her calm reply and now i am come down to the old ones a truce mr cibber what do you understand by an actor tell me for i am foolish enough to respect your opinion on these matters an actor young lady said he gravely is an artist who has gone deep enough in his art to make dunces critics and greenhorns take it for nature moreover he really personates which your mere man of the stage never does he has learned the true art of selfmultiplication he drops betterton booth wilkes or ahem cibber inserted sir charles pomander cibber bowed in his dressingroom and comes out young or old a fop a valet a lover or a hero with voice mien and every gesture to match a grain less than this may be good speaking fine preaching deep grunting high ranting eloquent reciting but ill be hanged if it is acting then colley cibber never acted whispered quin to mrs clive then margaret woffington is an actress said m w the fine ladies take my lady betty for their sister in mrs day i pass for a woman of seventy and in sir harry wildair i have been taken for a man i would have told you that before but i didnt know it was to my credit said she slyly till mr cibber laid down the law proof said cibber a warm letter from one lady diamond buckles from another and an offer of her hand and fortune from a third rien que cela mr cibber conveyed behind her back a look of absolute incredulity she divined it i will not show you the letters continued she because sir harry though a rake was a gentleman but here are the buckles and she fished them out of her pocket capacious of such things the buckles were gravely inspected they made more than one eye water they were undeniable well let us see what we can do for her said the laureate he tapped his box and without a moments hesitation produced the most execrable distich in the language now who is like peggy with talent at will a maid loved her harry for want of a bill well child continued he after the applause which follows extemporary verses had subsided take me in play something to make me lose sight of saucy peg woffington and ill give the world five acts more before the curtain falls on colley cibber if you could be deceived put in mr vane somewhat timidly i think there is no disguise through which grace and beauty such as mrs woffingtons would not shine to my eyes that is to praise my person at the expense of my wit sir is it not was her reply this was the first word she had ever addressed to him the tones appeared so sweet to him that he could not find anything to reply for listening to them and cibber resumed meantime i will show you a real actress she is coming here tonight to meet me did ever you children hear of ann bracegirdle bracegirdle said mrs clive why she has been dead this thirty years at least i thought so dead to the stage there is more heat in her ashes than in your fire kate clive ah here comes her messenger continued he as an ancient man appeared with a letter in his hand this letter mrs woffington snatched and read and at the same instant in bounced the callboy epilogue called said this urchin in the tone of command which these small fry of parnassus adopt and obedient to his high behest mrs woffington moved to the door with the bracegirdle missive in her hand but not before she had delivered its general contents the great actress will be here in a few minutes said she and she glided swiftly out of the room chapter ii people whose mind or manners possess any feature and are not as devoid of all eccentricity as half pounds of butter bought of metropolitan grocers are recommended not to leave a roomful of their acquaintances until the last but one yes they should always be penultimate perhaps mrs woffington knew this but epilogues are stubborn things and callboys undeniable did you ever hear a woman whistle before never but i saw one sit astride on an ass in germany the saddle was not on her husband i hope madam no sir the husband walked by his kinsfolks side and made the best of a bad bargain as peggys husband will have to wait till some one ventures on the gay lothariailli aes triplex that means he must have triple brass kitty i deny that sir since his wife will always have enough for both i have not observed the ladys brass said vane trembling with passion but i observed her talent and i noticed that whoever attacks her to her face comes badly off well said sir answered quin and i wish kitty here would tell us why she hates mrs woffington the bestnatured woman in the theater i dont hate her i dont trouble my head about her yes you hate her for you never miss a cut at her do you hate a haunch of venison quin said the lady no you little unnatural monster replied quin for all that you never miss a cut at one so hold your tongue le beau raisonnement said mr cibber james quin dont interfere with natures laws let our ladies hate one another it eases their minds try to make them christians and you will not convert their tempers but spoil your own peggy there hates george anne bellamy because she has gaudy silk dresses from paris by paying for them as she could if not too stingy kitty here hates peggy because rich has breeched her whereas kitty who now sets up for a prude wanted to put delicacy off and smallclothes on in pegs stead that is where the kate and peg shoe pinches near the femoral artery james shrimps have the souls of shrimps resumed this censor castigatorque minorum listen to me and learn that really great actors are great in soul and do not blubber like a great schoolgirl because anne bellamy has two yellow silk dresses from paris as i saw woffington blubber in this room and would not be comforted nor fume like kitty clive because woffington has a pair of breeches and a little boys rapier to go a playing at acting with when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queens of art themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgment in favor of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would or stab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theater farewell that night and wrote to statira thus i give you word for word madam the best judge we have has decided in your favor i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honor me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than before and what did statira answer sir said mr vane eagerly she answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but this much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honored and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion of your good opinion what a couple of stiff old things said mrs clive nay madam say not so cried vane warmly surely this was the lofty courtesy of two great minds not to be overbalanced by strife defeat or victory what were their names sir statira was the great mrs oldfield roxana you will see here tonight this caused a sensation colleys reminiscences were interrupted by loud applause from the theater the present seldom gives the past a long hearing the old warhorse cocked his ears it is woffington speaking the epilogue said quin oh she has got the length of their foot somehow said a small actress and the breadth of their hands too said pomander waking from a nap it is the depth of their hearts she has sounded said vane in those days if a metaphor started up the poor thing was coursed up hill and down dale and torn limb from jacket even in parliament a trope was sometimes hunted from one session into another you were asking me about mrs oldfield sir resumed cibber rather peevishly i will own to you i lack words to convey a just idea of her double and complete supremacy but the comedians of this day are weakstrained farceurs compared with her and her tragic tone was thunder set to music i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singingbirds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything in all the crowded theater care and pain and poverty were banished from the memory while oldfields face spoke and her tongue flashed melodies the lawyer forgot his quillets the polemic the mote in his brothers eye the old maid her grudge against the two sexes the old man his gray hairs and his lost hours and can it be that all this which should have been immortal is quitequite lost is as though it had never been he sighed can it be that its fame is now sustained by me who twang with my poor lute cracked and old these feeble praises of a broken lyre whose wires were golden and its heavenly air more tunable than lark to shepherds ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear he paused and his eye looked back over many years then with a very different tone he added and that jack falstaff there must have seen her now i think ont only once sir said quin and i was but ten years old he saw her once and he was ten years old yet he calls woffington a great comedian and my son thes wife with her hatchet face the greatest tragedian he ever saw jemmy what an ass you must be mrs cibber always makes me cry and tother always makes me laugh said quin stoutly thats why ce beau raisonnement met no answer but a look of sovereign contempt a very trifling incident saved the ladies of the british stage from further criticism there were two candles in this room one on each side the callboy had entered and poking about for something knocked down and broke one of these awkward imp cried a velvet page ill go to the treasury for another maam said the boy pertly and vanished with the fractured wax i take advantage of the interruption to open mr vanes mind to the reader first he had been astonished at the freedom of sarcasm these people indulged in without quarreling next at the nonrespect of sex so sex is not recognized in this community thought he then the glibness and merit of some of their answers surprised and amused him he like me had seldom met an imaginative repartee except in a play or a book societys repartees were then as they are now the good old tree in various dresses and veils tu quoque tu mentiris vos damnemini but he was sick and dispirited on the whole such very bright illusions had been dimmed in these few minutes she was brilliant but her manners if not masculine were very daring and yet when she spoke to him a stranger how sweet and gentle her voice was then it was clear nothing but his ignorance could have placed her at the summit of her art still he clung to his enthusiasm for her he drew pomander aside what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said he the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber falling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapor his manner is little like his person it is all fuss and bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a little fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh but in the midst of their merriment mrs woffingtons voice was heard at the door this way madam a clear and somewhat shrill voice replied i know the way better than you child and a stately old lady appeared on the threshold bracegirdle said mr cibber it may well be supposed that every eye was turned on this newcomerthat roxana for whom mr cibbers story had prepared a peculiar interest she was dressed in a rich green velvet gown with gold fringe cibber remembered it she had played the eastern queen in it heaven forgive all concerned it was fearfully pinched in at the waist and ribs so as to give the idea of wood inside not woman her hair and eyebrows were irongray and she had lost a front tooth or she would still have been eminently handsome she was tall and straight as a dart and her noble port betrayed none of the weakness of age only it was to be seen that her hands were a little weak and the goldheaded crutch struck the ground rather sharply as if it did a little limbsduty such was the lady who marched into the middle of the room with a how do colley and looking over the companys heads as if she did not see them regarded the four walls with some interest like a cat she seemed to think more of places than of folk the page obsequiously offered her a chair not so clean as it used to be said mrs bracegirdle unfortunately in making this remark the old lady graciously patted the pages head for offering her the chair and this action gave with some of the illconstituted minds that are ever on the titter a ridiculous direction to a remark intended i believe for the paint and wanscots etc nothing is as it used to be remarked mr cibber all the better for everything said mrs clive we were laughing at this mighty little david first actor of this mighty little age now if mr cibber thought to find in the newcomer an ally of the past in its indiscriminate attack upon the present he was much mistaken for the old actress made onslaught on this nonsense at once ay ay said she and not the first time by many hundreds tis a disease you have cure yourself colley davy garrick pleases the public and in trifles like acting that take nobody to heaven to please all the world is to be great some pretend to higher aims but none have em you may hide this from young fools mayhap but not from an old oman like me he he he no no nonot from an old oman like me she then turned round in her chair and with that sudden unaccountable snappishness of tone to which the brisk old are subject she snarled gie me a pinch of snuff some of ye do tobacco dust was instantly at her disposal she took it with the points of her fingers delicately and divested the crime of half its uncleanness and vulgaritymore an angel couldnt monstrous sensible woman though whispered quin to clive hey sir what do you say sir for im a little deaf not very to praise it seems that your judgment madam is equal to the reputation of your talent the words were hardly spoken before the old lady rose upright as a tower she then made an oblique preliminary sweep and came down with such a courtesy as the young had never seen james quin not to disgrace his generation attempted a corresponding bow for which his figure and apoplectic tendency rendered him unfit and while he was transacting it the graceful cibber stepped gravely up and looked down and up the process with his glass like a naturalist inspecting some strange capriccio of an orangoutang the gymnastics of courtesy ended without backfallscibber lowered his tone you are right bracy it is nonsense denying the young fellows talent but his othello now bracy be justhis othello oh dear oh dear cried she i thought it was desdemonas little black boy come in without the teakettle quin laughed uproariously it made me laugh a deal more than mr quins falstaff oh dear oh dear falstaff indeed snuff in the tone of a trumpet quin secretly revoked his good opinion of this womans sense madam said the page timidly if you would but favor us with a specimen of the old style well child why not only what makes you mumble like that but they all do it now i see bless my soul our words used to come out like brandycherries but now a sentence is like raspberryjam on the stage and off cibber chuckled and why dont you men carry yourself like cibber here dont press that question said colley dryly a monstrous poor actor though said the merciless old woman in a mock aside to the others only twenty shillings a week for half his life and her shoulders went up to her earsthen she fell into a half reverie yes we were distinct said she but i must own children we were slow once in the midst of a beautiful tirade my lover went to sleep and fell against me a mighty pretty epigram twenty lines was writ ont by one of my gallants have ye as many of them as we used in that respect said the page we are not behind our greatgrandmothers i call that pert said mrs bracegirdle with the air of one drawing scientific distinctions now is that a boy or a lady that spoke to me last by its dress i should say a boy said cibber with his glass by its assurance a lady theres one clever woman among ye peg something plays lothario lady betty modish and what not what admire woffington screamed mrs clive why she is the greatest gabbler on the stage i dont care was the reply theres nature about the jade dont contradict me added she with sudden fury a parcel of children no madam said clive humbly mr cibber will you try and prevail on mrs bracegirdle to favor us with a recitation cibber handed his cane with pomp to a small actor bracegirdle did the same and striking the attitudes that had passed for heroic in their day they declaimed out of the rival queens two or three tirades which i graciously spare the reader of this tale their elocution was neat and silvery but not one bit like the way people speak in streets palaces fields roads and rooms they had not made the grand discovery which mr a wigan on the stage and every man of sense off it has made in our day and nation namely that the stage is a representation not of stage but of life and that an actor ought to speak and act in imitation of human beings not of speaking machines that have run and creaked in a stage groove with their eyes shut upon the world at large upon nature upon truth upon man upon woman and upon child this is slow cried cibber let us show these young people how ladies and gentlemen moved fifty years ago dansons a fiddler was caught a beautiful slow minuet played and a bit of solemn dancing done certainly it was not gay but it must be owned it was beautiful it was the dance of kings the poetry of the courtly saloon the retired actress however had frisker notions left in her this is slow cried she and bade the fiddler play the wind that shakes the barley an ancient jig tune this she danced to in a style that utterly astounded the spectators she showed them what fun was her feet and her stick were all echoes to the mad strain out went her heel behind and returning drove her four yards forward she made unaccountable slants and cut them all over in turn if they did not jump for it roars of inextinguishable laughter arose it would have made an oyster merry suddenly she stopped and put her hands to her sides and soon after she gave a vehement cry of pain the laughter ceased she gave another cry of such agony that they were all round her in a moment oh help me ladies screamed the poor woman in tones as feminine as they were heartrending and piteous oh my back my loins i suffer gentlemen said the poor thing faintly what was to be done mr vane offered his penknife to cut her laces you shall cut my head off sooner cried she with sudden energy dont pity me said she sadly i dont deserve it then lifting her eyes she exclaimed with a sad air of selfreproach o vanity do you never leave a woman nay madam whimpered the page who was a goodhearted girl twas your great complaisance for us not vanity oh oh oh and she began to blubber to make matters better no my children said the old lady twas vanity i wanted to show you what an old oman could do and i have humiliated myself trying to outshine younger folk i am justly humiliated as you see and she began to cry a little this is very painful said cibber mrs bracegirdle now raised her eyes they had set her in a chair and looking sweetly tenderly and earnestly on her old companion she said to him slowly gently but impressively colley at threescore years and ten this was ill done of us you and i are here nowfor what to cheer the young up the hill we mounted years ago and old friend if we detract from them we discourage them a great sin in the old every dog his day we have had ours here she smiled then laying her hand tenderly in the old mans she added with calm solemnity and now we must go quietly toward our rest and strut and fret no more the few last minutes of lifes fleeting hour how tame my cacotype of these words compared with what they were i am ashamed of them and myself and the human craft of writing which though commoner far is so miserably behind the godlike art of speech si ipsam audivisses these ink scratches which in the imperfection of language we have called words till the unthinking actually dream they are words but which are the shadows of the corpses of words these wordshadows then were living powers on her lips and subdued as eloquence always does every heart within reach of the imperial tongue the young loved her and the old man softened and vanquished and mindful of his failing life was silent and pressed his handkerchief to his eyes a moment then he said no bracy no be composed i pray you she is right young people forgive me that i love the dead too well and the days when i was what you are now drat the woman continued he half ashamed of his emotion she makes us laugh and makes us cry just as she used what does he say young woman said the old lady dryly to mrs clive he says you make us laugh and make us cry madam and so you do me im sure and thats peg woffingtons notion of an actress better it cibber and bracegirdle if you can said the other rising up like lightning she then threw colley cibber a note and walked coolly and rapidly out of the room without looking once behind her the rest stood transfixed looking at one another and at the empty chair then cibber opened and read the note aloud it was from mrs bracegirdle playing at trictrac so cant play the fool in your greenroom tonight b on this a musical ringing laugh was heard from outside the door where the pseudo bracegirdle was washing the gray from her hair and the wrinkles from her faceah i wish i could do it as easilyand the little bit of stickingplaster from her front tooth why it is the irish jade roared cibber divil a less rang back a rich brogue and its not the furst time we put the comether upon ye england my jewal one more mutual glance and then the mortal cleverness of all this began to dawn on their minds and they broke forth into clapping of hands and gave this accomplished mime three rounds of applause mr vane and sir charles pomander leading with bravo woffington its effect on mr vane may be imagined who but she could have done this this was as if a painter should so paint a man as to deceive his species this was acting but not like the acting of the stage he was in transports and selfsatisfaction at his own judgment mingled pleasantly with his admiration in this cheerful exhibition one joined notmr cibber his theories had received a shock and we all love our theories he himself had received a rapand we dont hate ourselves great is the syllogism but there is a class of arguments less vulnerable if a says to b you cant hit me as i prove by this syllogism here followeth the syllogism and b pour toute reponse knocks a down such a whack that he rebounds into a sitting posture and to him the man the tree the lamppost and the fireescape become not clearly distinguishable this barbarous logic prevails against the logic in barbara and the syllogism is in the predicament of humpty dumpty in this predicament was the poet laureate the miscreant proteus could not escape these chains so the miscreant proteusno bad name for an old actortook his little cocked hat and marched a smaller if not a wiser man some disjointed words fell from him mimicry is not acting etc and with one bitter mowing glance at the applauders circumferens acriter oculos he vanished in the largest pinch of snuff on record the rest dispersed more slowly mr vane waited eagerly and watched the door for mrs woffington but she did not come he then made acquaintance with goodnatured mr quin who took him upon the stage and showed him by what vulgar appliances that majestic rise of the curtain he so admired was effected returning to the greenroom for his friend he found him in animated conversation with mrs woffington this made vane uneasy sir charles up to the present moment of the evening had been unwontedly silent and now he was talking nineteen to the dozen and mrs woffington was listening with an appearance of interest that sent a pang to poor vanes heart he begged mr quin to introduce him mr quin introduced him the lady received his advances with polite composure mr vane stammered his admiration of her bracegirdle but all he could find words to say was mere general praise and somewhat coldly received sir charles on the contrary spoke more like a critic had you given us the stage cackle or any of those traditionary symptoms of old age we should have instantly detected you said he but this was art copying nature and it may be years before such a triumph of illusion is again effected under so many adverse circumstances you are very good sir charles was the reply you flatter me it was one of those things which look greater than they are nobody here knew bracegirdle but mr cibber mr cibber cannot see well without his glasses and i got rid of one of the candles i sent one of the imps of the theater to knock it down i know mrs bracegirdle by heart i drink tea with her every sunday i had her dress on and i gave the old boy her words and her way of thinking it was mere mimicry it was nothing compared with what i once did but ahem pray tell us i am afraid i shall shock your friend i see he is not a wicked man like you and perhaps does not know what goodfornothing creatures actresses are he is not so ignorant as he looks replied sir charles that is not quite the answer i expected sir charles replied this lively lady but it serves me right for fishing on dry land well then you must know a young gentleman courted me i forget whether i liked him or not but you will fancy i hated him for i promised to marry him you must understand gentlemen that i was sent into the world not to act which i abominate but to chronicle small beer and teach an army of little brats their letters so this word wife and that word chimneycorner took possession of my mind and a vision of darning stockings for a large party all my own filled my heart and really i felt quite grateful to the little brute that was to give me all this and he would have had such a wife as men never do have still less deserve but one fine day that the theater left me time to examine his manner toward me i instantly discovered he was deceiving me so i had him watched and the little brute was going to marry another woman and break it to me by degrees afterward etc you know sir charles ah i see you do i found her out got an introduction to her father went down to his house three days before the marriage with a little coalblack mustache regimentals and what not made up in short with the art of my sex gentlemenand the impudence of yours the first day i flirted and danced with the bride the second i made love to her and at night i let her know that her intended was a villain i showed her letters of his protestations oaths of eternal fidelity to one peg woffington who will die drawled i if he betrays her and here gentlemen mark the justice of heaven i received a backhanded slap peg woffington an actress oh the villain cried she let him marry the little vagabond how dare he insult me with his hand that had been offered in such a quarter so in a fit of virtuous indignation the little hypocrite dismissed the little brute in other words she had fallen in love with me i have not had many happy hours but i remember it was delicious to look out of my window and at the same moment smell the honeysuckles and see my perfide dismissed under a heap of scorn and a pile of luggage he had brought down for his wedding tour i scampered up to london laughing all the way and when i got home if i remember right i cried for two hours how do you account for that i hope madam said vane gravely it was remorse for having trifled with that poor young ladys heart she had never injured you but sir the husband i robbed her of was a brute and a villain in his little way and wicked and goodfornothing etc he would have deceived that poor little hypocrite as he had this one pointing to herself that is not what i mean you inspired her with an attachment never to be forgotten poor lady how many sleepless nights has she passed since then how many times has she strained her eyes to see her angel lover returning to her she will not forget in two years the love it cost you but two days to inspire the powerful should be merciful ah i fear you have no heart these words had no sooner burst from mr vane than he was conscious of the strange liberty he had taken and indeed the bad taste he had been guilty of and this feeling was not lessened when he saw mrs woffington color up to the temples her eyes too glittered like basilisks but she said nothing which was remarkable in her whose tongue was the sword of a maitre darmes sir charles eyed his friend in a sly satirical manner he then said laughingly in two months she married a third dont waste your sympathy and turned the talk into another channel and soon after mrs woffingtons maid appearing at the door she courtesied to both gentlemen and left the theater sir charles pomander accompanied mr vane a little way what becomes of her innocence was his first word one loses sight of it in her immense talent said the lover she certainly is clever in all that bears upon her business was the reply but i noticed you were a little shocked with her indelicacy in telling us that story and still more in having it to tell indelicacy no said vane the little brute deserved it good heavens to think that a little brute might have married that angel and actually broke faith to lose her it is incredible the crime is diluted by the absurdity have you heard him tell the story no then take my word for it you have not heard the facts of the case ah you are prejudiced against her on the contrary i like her but i know that with all women the present lover is an angel and the past a demon and so on in turn and i know that if satan were to enter the women of the stage with the wild idea of impairing their veracity he would come out of their minds a greater liar than he went in and the innocent darlings would never know their spiritual father had been at them doubtful whether this sentiment and period could be improved sir charles parted with his friend leaving his sting in him like a friend the others reflections as he sauntered home were not strictly those of a wise wellbalanced mind they ran in this style when she said is not that to praise my person at the expense of my wit i ought to have said nay madam could your wit disguise your person it would betray itself so you would still shine confessed and instead of that i said nothing he then ran over in his mind all the opportunities he had had for putting in something smart and bitterly regretted those lost opportunities and made the smart things and beat the air with them then his cheeks tingled when he remembered that he had almost scolded her and he concocted a very different speech and straightway repeated it in imagination this is lovers pastime i own it funny but it is open to one objection this single practice of sitting upon eggs no longer chickenable carried to a habit is capable of turning a solid intellect into a liquid one and ruining a minds career we leave mr vane therefore with a hope that he will not do it every night and we follow his friend to the close of our chapter hey for a definition what is diplomacy is it folly in a coat that looks like sagacity had sir charles pomander instead of watching mr vane and mrs woffington asked the former whether he admired the latter and whether the latter responded straightforward vane would have told him the whole truth in a minute diplomacy therefore was as it often is a waste of time but diplomacy did more in this case it sapienter descendebat in fossam it fell on its nose with gymnastic dexterity as it generally does upon my word to watch mrs woffingtons face visavis mr vane pomander introduced vane to the greenroom of the theater royal covent garden by this pomander learned nothing because mrs woffington had with a wonderful appearance of openness the closest face in europe when she chose on the other hand by introducing this country gentleman to this greenroom he gave a mighty impulse and opportunity to vanes love an opportunity which he forgot the timid inexperienced damon might otherwise never have found here diplomacy was not policy for as my sagacious reader has perhaps divined sir charles pomander was after her himself chapter iii yes sir charles was after mrs woffington i use that phrase because it is a fine generic one suitable to different kinds of lovemaking mr vanes sentiments were an inexplicable compound but respect enthusiasm and deep admiration were the uppermost the good sir charles was no enigma he had a vacancy in his establishmenta very high situation too for those who like that sort of thingthe head of his table his left hand when he drove in the park etc to this he proposed to promote mrs woffington she was handsome and witty and he liked her but that was not what caused him to pursue her slow sagacious inevitable as a beagle she was celebrated and would confer great eclat on him the scandal of possessing her was a burning temptation women admire celebrity in a man but men adore it in a woman the world says philip is a famous man what will not women love so taught i will try to answer this question the women will more readily forgive disgusting physical deformity for fames sake than we they would embrace with more rapture a famous orangoutang than we an illustrious chimpanzee but when it comes to moral deformity the tables are turned had the queen pardoned mr greenacre and mrs manning would the great rush have been on the hero or the heroine why on mrs macbeth to her would the blackguards have brought honorable proposals and the gentry liberal ones greenacre would have found more female admirers than i ever shall but the grand stream of sexual admiration would have set mariaward this fact is as dark as night but it is as sure as the sun the next day the friends most laughable of human substantives met in the theater and again visited the greenroom and this time vane determined to do himself more justice he was again disappointed the actresss manner was ceremoniously polite she was almost constantly on the stage and in a hurry when off it and when there was a word to be got with her the ready glib sir charles was sure to get it vane could not help thinking it hard that a man who professed no respect for her should thus keep the light from him and he could hardly conceal his satisfaction when pomander at night bade him farewell for a fortnight pressing business took sir charles into the country the good sir charles however could not go without leaving his sting behind as a companion to his friend he called on mr vane and after a short preface containing the words our friendship old kindness my greater experience he gravely warned him against mrs woffington not that i would say this if you could take her for what she is and amuse yourself with her as she will with you if she thinks it worth her while but i see you have a heart and she will make a football of it and torment you beyond all you have ever conceived of human anguish mr vane colored high and was about to interrupt the speaker but he continued there i am in a hurry but ask quin or anybody who knows her history you will find she has had scores of lovers and no one remains her friend after they part men are such villains very likely was the reply but twenty men dont illuse one good woman those are not the proportions adieu this last hit frightened mr vane he began to look into himself he could not but feel that he was a mere child in this womans hands and more than that his conscience told him that if his heart should be made a football of it would be only a just and probable punishment for there were particular reasons why he of all men had no business to look twice at any woman whose name was woffington that night he avoided the greenroom though he could not forego the play but the next night he determined to stay at home altogether accordingly at five oclock the astounded boxkeeper wore a visage of dismaythere was no shilling for him and mr vanes nightly shilling had assumed the sanctity of salary in his mind mr vane strolled disconsolate he strolled by the thames he strolled up and down the strand and finally having often admired the wisdom of moths in their gradual approach to what is not good for them he strolled into the greenroom covent garden and sat down when there he did not feel happy besides she had always been cold to him and had given no sign of desiring his acquaintance still less of recognition mr vane had often seen a weathercock at work and he had heard a woman compared to it but he had never realized the simplicity beauty and justice of the simile he was therefore surprised as well as thrilled when mrs woffington so cool ceremonious and distant hitherto walked up to him in the greenroom with a face quite wreathed in smiles and without preliminary thanked him for all the beautiful flowers he had sent her what mrs woffingtonwhat you recognize me of course and have been foolish enough to feel quite supported by the thought i had at least one friend in the house but said she looking down now you must not be angry here are some stones that have fallen somehow among the flowers i am going to give you them back because i value flowers so i cannot have them mixed with anything else but dont ask me for a flower back added she seeing the color mount on his face for i would not give one of them to you or anybody imagine the effect of this on a romantic disposition like mr vanes he told her how glad he was that she could distinguish his features amid the crowd of her admirers he confessed he had been mortified when he found himself as he thought entirely a stranger to her she interrupted him do you know your friend sir charles pomander no i am almost sure you do well he is a man i do not like he is deceitful besides he is a wicked man there to be plain with you he was watching me all that night the first time you came here and because i saw he was watching me i would not know who you were nor anything about you but you looked as if you had never seen me before of course i did when i had made up my mind to said the actress naively sir charles has left london for a fortnight so if he is the only obstacle i hope you will know me every night why you sent me no flowers yesterday or today but i will tomorrow then i am sure i shall know your face again goodby wont you see me in the last act and tell me how ill i do it oh yes and he hurried to his box and so the actress secured one pair of hands for her last act he returned to the greenroom but she did not revisit that verdant bower the next night after the usual compliments she said to him looking down with a sweet engaging air i sent a messenger into the country to know about that lady what lady said vane scarcely believing his senses that you were so unkind to me about i unkind to you what a brute i must be my meaning is you justly rebuked me only you should not tell an actress she has no heartthat is always understood well sir charles pomander said she married a third in two months and did she no it was in six weeks that man never tells the truth and since then she has married a fourth i am glad of it so am i since you awakened my conscience delicious flattery and of all flattery the sweetest when a sweet creature does flattery not merely utters it after this vane made no more struggles he surrendered himself to the charming seduction and as his advances were respectful but ardent and incessant he found himself at the end of a fortnight mrs woffingtons professed lover they wrote letters to each other every day on sunday they went to church together in the morning and spent the afternoon in the suburbs wherever grass was and dust was not in the next fortnight poor vane thought he had pretty well fathomed this extraordinary womans character plumb the atlantic with an eightyfathom line sir she is religious said he she loves a church much better than a playhouse and she never laughs nor goes to sleep in church as i do and she is breaking me of swearingby degrees she says that no fashion can justify what is profane and that it must be vulgar as well as wicked and she is frankness and simplicity itself another thing that charmed him was her disinterestedness she ordered him to buy her a present every day but it was never to cost above a shilling if an article could be found that cost exactly tenpence a favorite sum of hers she was particularly pleased and these shilling presents were received with a flush of pleasure and brightening eyes but when one day he appeared with a diamond necklace it was taken very coldly he was not even thanked for it and he was made to feel once for all that the tenpenny ones were the best investments toward her favor then he found out that she was very prudent and rather stingy of spartan simplicity in her diet and a scorner of dress off the stage to redeem this she was charitable and her charity and her economy sometimes had a sore fight during which she was peevish poor little soul one day she made him a request i cant bear you should think me worse than i am and i dont want you to think me better than i am vane trembled but dont speak to others about me promise and i will promise to tell you my whole story whenever you are entitled to such a confidence when shall i be entitled to it when i am sure you love me do you doubt that now yes i think you love me but i am not sure margaret remember i have known you much longer than you have known me no yes two months before we ever spoke i lived upon your face and voice that is to say you looked from your box at me upon the stage and did not i look from the stage at you never you always looked at the pit and my heart used to sink on the th of may you first came into that box i noticed you a little the next day i noticed you a little more i saw you fancied you liked me after a while i could not have played without you here was delicious flattery again and poor vane believed every word of it as for her request and her promise she showed her wisdom in both these as sir charles observed it is a wonderful point gained if you allow a woman to tell her story her own way how the few facts that are allowed to remain get molded and twisted out of ugly forms into pretty shapes by those supple dexterous fingers this present story cannot give the life of mrs woffington but only one great passage therein as do the epic and dramatic writers but since there was often great point in any sentences spoken on important occasions by this lady i will just quote her defense of herself the reader may be sure she did not play her weakest card let us give her the benefit one day she and kitty clive were at it dingdong the greenroom was full of actors male and female but there were no strangers and the ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only think at last mrs woffington finding herself roughly and as she thought unjustly handled turned upon the assembly and said what man did ever i ruin in all my life speak who can and there was a dead silence what woman is there here at as much as three pounds per week even that hasnt ruined two at the very least report says there was a dead silence again until mrs clive perked up and said she had only ruined one and that was his own fault mrs woffington declined to attach weight to this example kitty clive is the hook without the bait said she and the laugh turned as it always did against peggys antagonist thus much was speedily shown to mr vane that whatever were mrs woffingtons intentions toward him interest had at present nothing to do with them indeed it was made clear that even were she to surrender her liberty to him it would only be as a princess forging golden chains for herself with her own royal hand another fortnight passed to the mutual satisfaction of the lovers to vane it was a dream of rapture to be near this great creature whom thousands admired at such a distance to watch over her to take her to the theater in a warm shawl to stand at the wing and receive her as she came radiant from her dressingroom to watch her from her rear as she stood like some power about to descend on the stage to see her falconlike stoop upon the said stage and hear the burst of applause that followed as the report does the flash to compare this with the spiritless crawl with which common artists went on tame from their first note to their last to take her hand when she came off feel how her nerves were strung like a greyhounds after a race and her whole frame in a high even glow with the great pythoness excitement of art and to have the same great creature leaning her head on his shoulder and listening with a charming complacency while he purred to her of love and calm delights alternate with still greater triumphs for he was to turn dramatic writer for her sake was to write plays a woman the hero and love was to inspire him and passion supply the want of pencraft you make me laugh mr vane all this was heavenly and then with all her dash and fire and bravado she was a thorough woman margaret ernest i want to ask you a question did you really cry because that miss bellamy had dresses from paris it does not seem very likely no but tell me did you who said i did mr cibber old fool yes but did you did i what cry ernest the minxs dresses were beautiful no doubt but did you cry and mine were dirty i dont care about gilt rags but dirty dresses ugh tell me then tell you what did you cry or not ah he wants to find out whether i am a fool and despise me no i think i should love you better for hitherto i have seen no weakness in you and it makes me uncomfortable be comforted is it not a weakness to like you you are free from that weakness or you would gratify my curiosity be pleased to state in plain intelligible english what you require of me i want to know in one word did you cry or not promise to tease me no more then and ill tell you i promise you wont despise me despise you of course not well theni dont remember on another occasion they were seated in the dusk by the side of the canal in the park when a little animal began to potter about on an adjacent bank mrs woffington contemplated it with curiosity and delight oh you pretty creature said she now you are a rabbit at least i think so no said vane innocently that is a rat ah ah ah screamed mrs woffington and pinched his arm this frightened the rat who disappeared she burst out laughing theres a fool the thing did not frighten me and the name did depend upon it its true what they saythat off the stage i am the greatest fool there is ill never be so absurd again ah ah ah here it is again scream and pinch as before do take me from this horrid place where monsters come from the great deep and she flounced away looking daggers askant at the place the rat had vacated in equal terror all this was silly but it pleases us men and contrast is so charming this same fool was brimful of talentand cunning too for that matter she played late that night and mr vane saw the same creature who dared not stay where she was liable to a distant rat spring upon the stage as a gay rake and flash out her rapier and act valors king to the life and seem ready to eat up everybody king fear included and then after her brilliant sally upon the public sir harry wildair came and stood beside mr vane her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but that little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder we indent it with our eleven undisguised stone such was sir harry wildair who stood by mr vane glittering with diamond buckles gorgeous with rich satin breeches velvet coat ruffles pictcae vestis et auri and as she bent her long eyefringes down on him he was seated all her fiery charms gradually softened and quivered down to womanhood the first time i was here said vane my admiration of you broke out to mr cibber and what do you think he said that you praised me for me to hear you did you acquit me of such meanness forgive me it is just what i should have done had i been courting an actress i think you have not met many ingenuous spirits dear friend not one my child this was a phrase she often applied to him now the old fellow pretended to hear what i said too and i am sure you did notdid you guess i guess not i am afraid i must plead guilty an actresss ears are so quick to hear praise to tell you the truth i did catch a word or two and it told sirit told you alarm me at this rate i shall never know what you see hear or think by your face when you want to know anything ask me and i will tell you but nobody else shall learn anything nor even you any other way did you hear the feeble tribute of praise i was paying you when you came in inquired vane no you did not say that my voice had the compass and variety of nature and my movements were free and beautiful while the others when in motion were stilts and coffeepots when in repose did you something of the sort i believe cried vane laughing i melted from one fine statue into another i restored the antinous to his true sexgoosepainters might learn their art from me in my dressingroom no doubt and orators revive at my lips the music of athens that quelled mad mobs and princes drunk with victorysilly fellowpraise was never so sweet to me murmured she inclining like a goddess of love toward him and he fastened on two velvet lips that did not shun the sweet attack but gently parted with a heavenly sigh while her heaving bosom and yielding frame and swimming eyes confessed her conqueror that morning mr vane had been dispirited and apparently selfdiscontented but at night he went home in a state of mental intoxication his poetic enthusiasm his love his vanity were all gratified at once and all these singly have conquered prudence and virtue a million times she had confessed to him that she was disposed to risk her happiness on him she had begged him to submit to a short probation and she had promised if her confidence and esteem remained unimpaired at the close of that periodwhich was not to be an unhappy oneto take advantage of the summer holidays and cross the water with him and forget everything in the world with him but love how was it that the very next morning clouds chased one another across his face was it that men are happy but while the chase is doubtful was it the letter from pomander announcing his return and sneeringly inquiring whether he was still the dupe of peg woffington or was it that same mysterious disquiet which attacked him periodically and then gave way for a while to pleasure and her golden dreams the next day was to be a day of delight he was to entertain her at his own house and to do her honor he had asked mr cibber mr quin and other actors critics etc our friend sir charles pomander had been guilty of two ingenuities first he had written three or four letters full of respectful admiration to mrs woffington of whom he spoke slightingly to vane second he had made a disingenuous purchase this purchase was pompey mrs woffingtons little black slave it is a horrid fact but pompey did not love his mistress he was a little enamored of her as small boys are apt to be but on the whole a sentiment of hatred slightly predominated in his little black bosom it was not without excuse this lady was subject to two unpleasant companionssorrow and bitterness about twice a week she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or sick proteges she had and returned smiling and cheerful but other twice a week she might be seen to sit upon her chair contracted into half her size and looking daggers at the universe in general the world in particular and on these occasions it must be owned she stayed at home and sometimes whipped pompey pompey had not the sense to reflect that he ought to have been whipped every day or the esprit de corps to be consoled by observing that this sort of thing did his mistress good what he felt was that his mistress who did everything well whipped him with energy and skill it did not take ten seconds but still in that brief period pompey found himself dusted and polished off the sacred principle of justice was as strong in mrs woffington as in the rest of her sex she had not one grain of it when she was not in her tantrums the mischievous imp was as sacred from check or remonstrance as a monkey or a lapdog and several female servants left the house on his account but nemesis overtook him in the way we have hinted and it put his little black pipe out the lady had taken him out of great humanity he was fed like a gamecock and dressed like a barbaric prince and once when he was ill his mistress watched him and nursed him and tended him with the same white hand that plied the obnoxious whip and when he died she alone withheld her consent from his burial and this gave him a chance black boys never get and he came to again but still these tarnation lickings stuck in him gizzard so when sir charless agent proposed to him certain silver coins cheap at a little treachery the ebony ape grinned till he turned half ivory and became a spy in the house of his mistress the reader will have gathered that the good sir charles had been quietly in london some hours before he announced himself as paulo post futurum diamond cut diamond a diplomat stole this march upon an actress and took her black pawn one for pomander gun chapter iv triplet the cerberus of art who had the first bark in this legend and has since been out of hearing ran from lambeth to covent garden on receipt of mr vanes note but ran he never so quick he had built a fullsized castle in the air before he reached bow street the letter hinted at an order upon his muse for amatory verse delightful task cheering prospect bid a man whose usual lot it is to break stones for the parish at tenpence the cubic yardbid such an one play at marbles with some stone taws for half an hour per day and pocket one pound onebid a poor horse who has drawn those stones about and browsed short grass by the waysidebid him canter a few times round a grassy ring and then go to his cornin short bid rosinante change with pegasus and you do no more than mr vanes letter held out to triplet the amatory verse of that day was not uphill work there was a beaten track on a dead level and you followed it you told the tender creature with a world of circumlocution that without joking now she was a leper ditto a tigress item marble you next feigned a lucid interval and to be on the point of detesting your monster but in twenty more verses love became as usual stronger than reason and you wound up your rotten yarn thus you hugged a golden chain you drew deeper into your wound a barbed shaft likeany wild animal will do no one of them is such an ass so you had an equal title to all and on looking back you saw with horrible complacency that you had inflicted one hundred locusts five feet long upon oppressed humanity wont to travel over acres of canvas for a few shillings and roods of paper on bare speculation triplet knew he could make a thousand a year at the above work without thinking he came therefore to the boxkeeper with his eyes glittering mr vane just gone out with a gentleman ill wait then now mr vane we know was in the greenroom and went home by the stagedoor the last thing he thought of was poor triplet the rich do not dream how they disappoint the poor triplets castle fell as many a predecessor had when the lights were put out he left the theater with a bitter sigh if this gentleman knew how many sweet children i have and what a good patient suffering wife sure he would not have chosen me to make a fool of said the poor fellow to himself in bow street he turned and looked back upon the theater how gloomy and grand it loomed ah thought he if i could but conquer you and why not all history shows that nothing is unconquerable except perseverance hannibal conquered the alps and ill conquer you cried triplet firmly yes this visit is not lost here i register a vow i will force my way into that mountain of masonry or perish in the attempt triplets most unpremeditated thoughts and actions often savored ridiculously of the sublime then and there gazing with folded arms on this fortress of thespis the polytechnic man organized his first assault the next evening he made it five months previously he had sent the manager three great large tragedies he knew the aversion a theatrical manager has to read a manuscript play not recommended by influential folk an aversion which always has been carried to superstition so he hit on the following scheme he wrote mr rich a letter in this he told mr rich that he triplet was aware what a quantity of trash is offered every week to a manager how disheartening it must be to read it at all and how natural after a while to read none therefore he triplet had provided that mr rich might economize his time and yet not remain in ignorance of the dramatic treasure that lay ready to his hand the soul of a play continued triplet is the plot or fable a gentleman of your experience can decide at once whether a plot or story is one to take the public so then he drew out in full the three plots he wrote these plots in verse heaven forgive us all he really did there were also two margins left on one which was narrow he jotted down the locale per page of the most brilliant passages on the other margin which was as wide as the column of the plot he made careful drawings of the personages in the principal dramatic situations scrolls issued from their mouths on which were written the words of fire that were flowing from each in these eruptions of the dramatic action all was referred to pages in the manuscripts by this means sir resumed the latter you will gut my fish in a jiffy permit me to recall that expression with apologies for my freedom i would say you will in a few minutes of your valuable existence skim the cream of triplet this authors respect for the managers time carried him into further and unusual details breakfast said he is a quiet meal let me respectfully suggest that by placing one of my plots on the table with say the sugarbasin upon it this again is a mere suggestion and the play it appertains to on your other side you can readily judge my work without disturbing the avocations of the day and master a play in the twinkling of a teacup forgive my facetiousness this day month at ten of the clock i shall expect said triplet with sudden severity sir your decision then gliding back to the courtier he formally disowned all special title to the consideration he expected from mr richs wellknown courtesy still he begged permission to remind that gentleman that he had six years ago painted for him a large scene illuminated by two great poetical incidents a red sun of dimensions never seen out of doors in this or any country and an ocean of sand yellower than up to that time had been attained in art or nature and that once when the audience late in the evening had suddenly demanded a popular song from mr nokes he triplet seeing the orchestra thinned by desertion and nugatory by intoxication had started from the pit resuscitated with the whole contents of his snuffbox the bass fiddle snatched the leaders violin and carried mr nokes triumphantly through that thunders of applause had followed and mr nokes had kindly returned thanks for both but that he triplet had hastily retired to evade the managers acknowledgments preferring to wait an opportunity like the present when both interests could be conciliated etc this letter he posted at its destination to save time and returned triumphant home he had now forgiven and almost forgotten vane and had reflected that after all the drama was his proper walk my dear said he to mrs triplet this family is on the eve of a great triumph then inverting that order of the grandiloquent and the homely which he invented in our first chapter he proceeded to say i have reared in a single day a new avenue by which histrionic greatness hitherto obstructed may become accessible wife i think i have done the trick at last lysimachus added he let a libation be poured out on so smiling an occasion and a burntoffering rise to propitiate the celestial powers run to the sun you dog three pennyworth of ale and a haporth o tobacco ere the month was out i am sorry to say the triplets were reduced to a state of beggary mrs triplets health had long been failing and although her duties at her little theater were light and occasional the manager was obliged to discharge her since she could not be depended upon the family had not enough to eat think of that they were not warm at night and they felt gnawing and faintness often by day think of that fortune was unjust here the man was laughable and a goose and had no genius either for writing painting or acting but in that he resembled most writers painters and actors of his own day and ours he was not beneath the average of what men call art and it is arts antipodestreadmill artifice other fluent ninnies shared gain and even fame and were called penmen in triplets day other ranters were quietly getting rich by noise other liars and humbugs were painting out o doors indoors and eating mutton instead of thistles for drenched stingingnettles yclept trees for blocktin clouds for butlers pantry seas and garretconceived lakes for molten sugarcandy rivers for airless atmosphere and sunless air for carpet nature and cold dead fragments of an earth all soul and living glory to every cultivated eye but a routine painters yet the man of many such mediocrities could not keep the pot boiling we suspect that to those who would rise in life even strong versatility is a very doubtful good and weak versatility ruination at last the bitter weary month was gone and triplets eye brightened gloriously he donned his best suit and while tying his cravat lectured his family first he complimented them upon their deportment in adversity hinted that moralists not experience had informed him prosperity was far more trying to the character put them all solemnly on their guard down to lucy aetat five that they were morituri and ae and must be pleased to abstain from insolent gladness upon his return sweet are the uses of adversity continued this cheerful monitor if we had not been hard up this while we should not come with a full relish to meat three times a week which unless i am an ass and i dont see myself in that light said triplet dryly will i apprehend be after this day the primary condition of our future existence james take the picture with you said mrs triplet in one of those calm little desponding voices that fall upon the soul so agreeably when one is a cockahoop and desires with permission so to remain what on earth am i to take mrs woffingtons portrait for we have nothing in the house said the wife blushing triplets eye glittered like a rattlesnakes the intimation is eccentric said he are you mad jane pray continued he veiling his wrath in scornful words is it requisite heroic or judicious on the eve or more correctly the morn of affluence to deposit an unfinished work of art with a mercenary relation hang it jane would you really have me pawn mrs woffington today james said jane steadily the manager may disappoint you we have often been disappointed so take the picture with you they will give you ten shillings on it triplet was one of those who see things roseate mrs triplet lurid madam said the poet for the first time in our conjugal career your commands deviate so entirely from reason that i respectfully withdraw that implicit obedience which has hitherto constituted my principal reputation im hanged if i do it jane dear james to oblige me that alters the case you confess it is unreasonable oh yes it is only to oblige me enough said triplet whose tongue was often a flail that fell on friend foe and self indiscriminately allow it to be unreasonable and i do it as a matter of courseto please you jane accordingly the good soul wrapped it in green baize but to relieve his mind he was obliged to get behind his wife and shrug his shoulders to lysimachus and the eldest girl as who should say voila bien une femme votre mere a vous at last he was off in high spirits he reached covent garden at halfpast ten and there the poor fellow was sucked into our narrative whirlpool we must however leave him for a few minutes chapter v sir charles pomander was detained in the country much longer than he expected he was rewarded by a little adventure as he cantered up to london with two servants and a postboy all riding on horses ordered in relays beforehand he came up with an antediluvian coach stuck fast by the roadside looking into the window with the humane design of quizzing the elders who should be there he saw a young lady of surpassing beauty this altered the case sir charles instantly drew bridle and offered his services the lady thanked him and being an innocent country lady she opened those sluices her eyes and two tears gently trickled down while she told him how eager she was to reach london and how mortified at this delay the good sir charles was touched he leaped his horse over a hedge galloped to a farmhouse in sight and returned with ropes and rustics these and sir charless horses soon drew the coach out of some stiffish clay the lady thanked him and thanked him and thanked him with heightening color and beaming eyes and he rode away like a hero before he had gone five miles he became thoughtful and selfdissatisfied finally his remorse came to a head he called to him the keenest of his servants hunsdon and ordered him to ride back past the carriage then follow and put up at the same inn to learn who the lady was and whither going and this knowledge gained to ride into town full speed and tell his master all about it sir charles then resumed his complacency and cantered into london that same evening arrived there he set himself in earnest to cut out his friend with mrs woffington he had already caused his correspondence with that lady to grow warm and more tender by degrees keeping a copy of his last he always knew where he was cupids barometer rose by rule and so he arrived by just gradations at an artful climax and made her in terms of chivalrous affection an offer of a house etc three hundred a year etc not forgetting his heart etc he knew that the ladies of the stage have an ear for flattery and an eye to the main chance the good sir charles felt sure that however she might flirt with vane or others she would not forego a position for any disinterested penchant still as he was a close player he determined to throw a little cold water on that flame his plan like everything truly scientific was simple ill run her down to him and ridicule him to her resolved this faithful friend and lover dear he began with vane he found him just leaving his own house after the usual compliments some such dialogue as this took place between telemachus and pseudo mentor i trust you are not really in the power of this actress you are the slave of a word replied vane would you confound black and white because both are colors she is like that sisterhood in nothing but a name even on the stage they have nothing in common they are puppetsall attitude and trick she is all ease grace and nature nature cried pomander laissezmoi tranquille they have artificenatures libel she has artnatures counterfeit her voice is truth told by music cried the poetical lover theirs are jingling instruments of falsehood they are all instruments said the satirist she is rather the best tuned and played her face speaks in every lineament theirs are rouged and wrinkled masks her mask is the best made mounted and moved that is all she is a fountain of true feeling no a pipe that conveys it without spilling or holding a drop she is an angel of talent sir shes a devil of deception she is a divinity to worship shes a woman to fight shy of there is not a woman in london better known continued sir charles she is a fair actress on the boards and a great actress off them but i can tell you how to add a new charm to her heaven can only do that said vane hastily yes you can make her blush ask her for the list of your predecessors vane winced visibly he quickened his step as if to get rid of this gadfly i spoke to mr quin said he at last and he who has no prejudice paid her character the highest compliment you have paid it the highest it admits was the reply you have let it deceive you sir charles continued in a more solemn tone pray be warned why is it every man of intellect loves an actress once in his life and no man of sense ever did it twice this last hit coming after the carte and tierce we have described brought an expression of pain to mr vanes face he said abruptly excuse me i desire to be alone for half an hour machiavel bowed and instead of taking offense said in a tone full of feeling ah i give you pain but you are right think it calmly over a while and you will see i advise you well he then made for the theater and the weakish personage he had been playing upon walked down to the river almost ran in fact he wanted to be out of sight he got behind some houses and then his face seemed literally to break loose from confinement so anxious sad fearful and bitter were the expressions that coursed each other over that handsome countenance what is the meaning of these hot and cold fits it is not sir charles who has the power to shake mr vane so without some help from within there is something wrong about this man chapter vi machiavel entered the greenroom intending to wait for mrs woffington and carry out the second part of his plan he knew that weak minds cannot make head against ridicule and with this pickax he proposed to clear the way before he came to grave sensible business love with the lady machiavel was a man of talent if he has been a silent personage hitherto it is merely because it was not his cue to talk but listen otherwise he was rather a master of the art of speech he could be insinuating eloquent sensible or satirical at will this personage sat in the greenroom in one hand was his diamond snuffbox in the other a richly laced handkerchief his clouded cane reposed by his side there was an air of success about this personage the gentle reader however conceited a dog could not see how he was to defeat sir charles who was tall stout handsome rich witty selfsufficient cool majestic courageous and in whom were united the advantages of a hard head a tough stomach and no heart at all this great creature sat expecting mrs woffington like olympian jove awaiting juno but he was mortal after all for suddenly the serenity of that adamantine countenance was disturbed his eye dilated his grace and dignity were shaken he huddled his handkerchief into one pocket his snuffbox into another and forgot his cane he ran to the door in unaffected terror where are all his fine airs before a real danger love intrigue diplomacy were all driven from his mind for he beheld that approaching which is the greatest peril and disaster known to social man he saw a bore coming into the room in a wild thirst for novelty pomander had once penetrated to goodmans fields theater there he had unguardedly put a question to a carpenter behind the scene a seedyblack poet instantly pushed the carpenter away down a trap it is thought and answered it in seven pages and in continuation was so vaguely communicative that he drove sir charles back into the far west sir charles knew him again in a moment and at sight of him bolted they met at the door ah mr triplet said the fugitive enchantedto wish you goodmorning and he plunged into the hidingplaces of the theater that is a very polite gentleman thought triplet he was followed by the callboy to whom he was explaining that his avocations though numerous would not prevent his paying mr rich the compliment of waiting all day in his greenroom sooner than go without an answer to three important propositions in which the town and the arts were concerned what is your name said the boy of business to the man of words mr triplet said triplet triplet there is something for you in the hall said the urchin and went off to fetch it i knew it said triplet to himself they are accepted theres a note in the hall to fix the reading he then derided his own absurdity in having ever for a moment desponded master of three arts by each of which men grow fat how was it possible he should starve all his days he enjoyed a natural vanity for a few moments and then came more generous feelings what sparkling eyes there would be in lambeth today the butcher at sight of mr richs handwriting would give him credit jane should have a new gown but when his tragedies were played and he paid el dorado his children should be the neatest in the street lysimachus and roxalana should learn the english language cost what it might sausages should be diurnal and he himself would not be puffed up fat lazy no he would work all the harder be affable as ever and above all never swamp the father husband and honest man in the poet and the blackguard of sentiment next his reflections took a business turn these tragediesthe scenery oh i shall have to paint it myself the heroes well they have nobody who will play them as i should this was true it will be hard work all this but then i shall be paid for it it cannot go on this way i must and will be paid separately for my branches just as he came to this resolution the boy returned with a brownpaper parcel addressed to mr james triplet triplet weighed it in his hand it was heavy how is this cried he oh i see said he these are the tragedies he sends them to me for some trifling alterations managers always do triplet then determined to adopt these alterations if judicious for argued he sensibly enough managers are practical men and we in the heat of composition sometimes sic say more than is necessary and become tedious with that he opened the parcel and looked for mr richs communication it was not in sight he had to look between the leaves of the manuscripts for it it was not there he shook them it did not fall out he shook them as a dog shakes a rabbit nothing the tragedies were returned without a word it took him some time to realize the full weight of the blow but at last he saw that the manager of the theater royal covent garden declined to take a tragedy by triplet into consideration or bare examination he turned dizzy for a moment something between a sigh and a cry escaped him and he sank upon a covered bench that ran along the wall his poor tragedies fell here and there upon the ground and his head went down upon his hands which rested on mrs woffingtons picture his anguish was so sharp it choked his breath when he recovered it his eye bent down upon the picture ah jane he groaned you know this villainous world better than i he placed the picture gently on the seat that picture must now be turned into bread and slowly stooped for his tragedies they had fallen hither and thither he had to crawl about for them he was an emblem of all the humiliations letters endure as he went after them on allfours more than one tear pattered on the dusty floor poor fellow he was triplet and could not have died without tingeing the deathrattle with some absurdity but after all he was a father driven to despair a castlebuilder with his work rudely scattered an artist brutally crushed and insulted by a greater dunce than himself faint sick and dark he sat a moment on the seat before he could find strength to go home and destroy all the hopes he had raised while triplet sat collapsed on the bench fate sent into the room all in one moment as if to insult his sorrow a creature that seemed the goddess of gayety impervious to a care she swept in with a bold free step for she was rehearsing a mans part and thundered without rant but with a spirit and fire and pace beyond the conception of our poor tame actresses of these lines now by the joys which my soul still has uncontrolled pursued i would not turn aside from my least pleasure though all thy force were armed to bar my way but like the birds great natures happy commoners rifle the sweets i begyour pardon sir holding the book on a level with her eye she had nearly run over two poets instead of one nay madam said triplet admiring though sad wretched but polite pray continue happy the hearer and still happier the author of verses so spoken ah yes replied the lady if you could persuade authors what we do for them when we coax good music to grow on barren words are you an author sir added she slyly in a small way madam i have here three triflestragedies mrs woffington looked askant at them like a shy mare ah madam said triplet in one of his insane fits if i might but submit them to such a judgment as yours he laid his hand on them it was as when a strange dog sees us go to take up a stone the actress recoiled i am no judge of such things cried she hastily triplet bit his lip he could have killed her it was provoking people would rather be hanged than read a manuscript yet what hopeless trash they will read in crowds which was manuscript a day ago les imbeciles no more is the manager of this theater a judge of such things cried the outraged quilldriver bitterly what has he accepted them said needletongue no madam he has had them six months and see madam he has returned them me without a word triplets lip trembled patience my good sir was the merry reply tragic authors should possess that for they teach it to their audiences managers sir are like eastern monarchs inaccessible but to slaves and sultanas do you know i called upon mr rich fifteen times before i could see him you madam impossible oh it was years ago and he has paid a hundred pounds for each of those little visits well now let me see fifteen times you must write twelve more tragedies and then he will read one and when he has read it he will favor you with his judgment upon it and when you have got that you will have what all the world knows is not worth a farthing he he he and like the birds gay natures happy commoners rifle the sweetsmummummum her high spirits made triplet sadder to think that one word from this laughing lady would secure his work a hearing and that he dared not ask her she was up in the world he was down she was great he was nobody he felt a sort of chill at this womanall brains and no heart he took his picture and his plays under his arms and crept sorrowfully away the actresss eye fell on him as he went off like a fifth act his don quixote face struck her she had seen it before sir said she madam said triplet at the door we have met before there dont speak ill tell you who you are yours is a face that has been good to me and i never forget them me madam said triplet taken aback i trust i know what is due to you better than to be good to you madam said he in his confused way to be sure cried she it is mr triplet good mr triplet and this vivacious dame putting her book down seized both triplets hands and shook them he shook hers warmly in return out of excess of timidity and dropped tragedies and kicked at them convulsively when they were down for fear they should be in her way and his mouth opened and his eyes glared mr triplet said the lady do you remember an irish orangegirl you used to give sixpence to at goodmans fields and pat her on the head and give her good advice like a good old soul as you were she took the sixpence madam said trip recovering a grain of pomp singular as it may appear i remember the young person she was very engaging i trust no harm hath befallen her for methought i discovered in spite of her brogue a beautiful nature in her go along wid yer blarney answered a rich brogue an is it the comanther yed be putting on poor little peggy oh oh gracious gasped triplet yes was the reply but into that yes she threw a whole sentence of meaning fine chaney oranges chanted she to put the matter beyond dispute am i really so honored as to have patted you on that queenlike head and he glared at it on the same head which now i wear replied she pompously i kept it for the convaynience hintirely only theres more in it well mr triplet you see what time has done for me now tell me whether he has been as kind to you are you going to speak to me mr triplet as a decayed hunter stands lean and disconsolate head poked forward like a gooses but if hounds sweep by his paddock in full cry followed by horses who are what he was not he does by reason of the good blood that is and will be in his heart dum spiritus hoss regit artus cock his ears erect his tail and trot fiery to his extremest hedge and look over it nostril distended mane flowing and neigh the hunt onward like a trumpet so triplet who had manhood at bottom instead of whining out his troubles in the ear of encouraging beauty as a sneaking spirit would perked up and resolved to put the best face upon it all before so charming a creature of the other sex yes madam cried he with the air of one who could have smacked his lips providence has blessed me with an excellent wife and four charming children my wife was miss chatterton you remember her yes where is she playing now why madam her health is too weak for it ohyou were scenepainter do you still paint scenes with the pen madam not the brush as the wags said i transferred the distemper from my canvas to my imagination and triplet laughed uproariously when he had done mrs woffington who had joined the laugh inquired quietly whether his pieces had met with success eminentin the closet the stage is to come and he smiled absurdly again the lady smiled back in short said triplet recapitulating being blessed with health and more tastes in the arts than most and a cheerful spirit i should be wrong madam to repine and this day in particular is a happy one added the rose colorist since the great mrs woffington has deigned to remember me and call me friend such was triplets summary mrs woffington drew out her memorandumbook and took down her summary of the crafty triplets facts so easy is it for us triplets to draw the wool over the eyes of women and woffingtons triplet discharged from scenepainting wife no engagement four children supported by his penthat is to say starving lose no time she closed her book and smiled and said i wish these things were comedies instead of trashedies as the french call them we would cut one in half and slice away the finest passages and then i would act in it and you would see how the stagedoor would fly open at sight of the author o heaven said poor trip excited by this picture ill go home and write a comedy this moment stay said she you had better leave the tragedies with me my dear madam you will read them ahem i will make poor rich read them but madam he has rejected them that is the first step reading them comes after when it comes at all what have you got in that green baize in this green baize well in this green baize then oh madam nothingnothing to tell the truth it is an adventurous attempt from memory i saw you play silvia madam i was so charmed that i came every night i took your face home with meforgive my presumption madamand i produced this faint adumbration which i expose with diffidence so then he took the green baize off the color rushed into her face she was evidently gratified poor silly mrs triplet was doomed to be right about this portrait i will give you a sitting said she you will find painting dull faces a better trade than writing dull tragedies work for other peoples vanity not your own that is the art of art and now i want mr triplets address on the flyleaf of each work madam replied that florid author and also at the foot of every page which contains a particularly brilliant passage i have been careful to insert the address of james triplet painter actor and dramatist and mrs woffingtons humble devoted servant he bowed ridiculously low and moved toward the door but something gushed across his heart and he returned with long strides to her madam cried he with a jaunty manner you have inspired a son of thespis with dreams of eloquence you have tuned in a higher key a poets lyre you have tinged a painters existence with brighter colors andand his mouth worked still but no more artificial words would come he sobbed out and god in heaven bless you mrs woffington and ran out of the room mrs woffington looked after him with interest for this confirmed her suspicions but suddenly her expression changed she wore a look we have not yet seen upon herit was a halfcunning halfspiteful look it was suppressed in a moment she gave herself to her book and presently sir charles pomander sauntered into the room ah what mrs woffington here said the diplomat sir charles pomander i declare said the actress i have just parted with an admirer of yours i wish i could part with them all was the reply a pastoral youth who means to win la woffington by agricultural courtshipas shepherds woo in sylvan shades with oaten pipe the rustic maids quoth the woffington improvising the diplomat laughed the actress laughed and said laughingly tell me what he says word for word it will only make you laugh well and am i never to laugh who provide so many laughs for you all cest juste you shall share the general merriment imagine a romantic soul who adores you for your simplicity my simplicity am i so very simple no said sir charles monstrous dryly he says you are out of place on the stage and wants to take the star from its firmament and put it in a cottage i am not a star replied the woffington i am only a meteor and what does the man think i am to do without this here she imitated applause from my dear publics thousand hands you are to have this he mimicked a kiss from a single mouth instead he is mad tell me what more he says oh dont stop to invent i should detect you and you would only spoil this man he laughed conceitedly i should spoil him well then he proposes to be your friend rather than your lover and keep you from being talked of he he instead of adding to your eclat and if he is your friend why dont you tell him my real character and send him into the country she said this rapidly and with an appearance of earnest the diplomatist fell into the trap i do said he but he snaps his fingers at me and common sense and the world i really think there is only one way to get rid of him and with him of every annoyance ah that would be nice delicious i had the honor madam of laying certain proposals at your feet oh yesyour letter sir charles i have only just had time to run my eye down it let us examine it together she took out the letter with a wonderful appearance of interest and the diplomat allowed himself to fall into the absurd position to which she invited him they put their two heads together over the letter a coach a countryhouse pinmoneyand im so tired of houses and coaches and pins oh yes heres something what is this you offer me up in this corner sir charles inspected the place carefully and announced that it was his heart and he cant even write it said she that word is earth ah well you know best there is your letter sir charles she courtesied returned him the letter and resumed her study of lothario favor me with your answer madam said her suitor you have it was the reply madam i dont understand your answer said sir charles stiffly i cant find you answers and understandings too was the ladylike reply you must beat my answer into your understanding while i beat this mans verse into mine and like the birds etc pomander recovered himself a little he laughed with quiet insolence tell me said he do you really refuse my good soul said mrs woffington why this surprise are you so ignorant of the stage and the world as not to know that i refuse such offers as yours every week of my life i know better was the cool reply she left it unnoticed i have so many of these continued she that i have begun to forget they are insults at this word the button broke off sir charless foil insults madam they are the highest compliments you have left it in our power to pay you the other took the button off her foil indeed cried she with wellfeigned surprise oh i understand to be your mistress could be but a temporary disgrace to be your wife would be a lasting discredit she continued and now sir having played your rivals game and showed me your whole hand a light broke in upon our diplomat do something to recover the reputation of a man of the world a gentleman is somewhere about in whom you have interested me by your lame satire pray tell him i am in the greenroom with no better companion than this bad poet sir charles clinched his teeth i accept the delicate commission replied he that you may see how easily the man of the world drops what the rustic is eager to pick up that is better said the actress with a provoking appearance of goodhumor you have a womans tongue if not her wit but my good soul added she with cool hauteur remember you have something to do of more importance than anything you can say i accept your courteous dismissal madam said pomander grinding his teeth i will send a carpenter for your swain and i leave you he bowed to the ground thanks for the double favor good sir charles she courtesied to the floor feminine vengeance he had come between her and her love all very clever mrs actress but was it wise i am revenged thought mrs woffington with a little feminine smirk i will be revenged vowed pomander clinching his teeth chapter vii compare a november day with a may day they are not more unlike than a beautiful woman in company with a man she is indifferent to or averse and the same woman with the man of her heart by her side at sight of mr vane all her coldness and nonchalance gave way to a gentle complacency and when she spoke to him her voice so clear and cutting in the late assaut darmes sank of its own accord into the most tender delicious tone imaginable mr vane and she made love he pleased her and she desired to please him my reader knows her wit her finesse her fluency but he cannot conceive how godlike was her way of making love i can put a few of the corpses of her words upon paper but where are the heavenly tonesnow calm and convincing now soft and melancholy now thrilling with tenderness now glowing with the fiery eloquence of passion she told him that she knew the map of his face that for some days past he had been subject to an influence adverse to her she begged him calmly for his own sake to distrust false friends and judge her by his own heart eyes and judgment he promised her he would and i do trust you in spite of them all said he for your face is the shrine of sincerity and candor i alone know you then she prayed him to observe the heartlessness of his sex and to say whether she had done ill to hide the riches of her heart from the cold and shallow and to keep them all for one honest man who will be my friend i hope said she as well as my lover ah said vane that is my ambition we actresses said she make good the old proverb many lovers but few friends and oh tis we who need a friend will you be mine while he lived he would in turn he begged her to be generous and tell him the way for him ernest vane inferior in wit and address to many of her admirers to win her heart from them all this singular womans answer is i think worth attention never act in my presence never try to be eloquent or clever never force a sentiment or turn a phrase remember i am the goddess of tricks do not descend to competition with me and the pomanders of the world at all littlenesses you will ever be awkward in my eyes and i am a woman i must have a superior to lovelie open to my eye light itself is not more beautiful than the upright man whose bosom is open to the day oh yes fear not you will be my superior dear for in me honesty has to struggle against the habits of my art and life be simple and sincere and i shall love you and bless the hour you shone upon my cold artificial life ah ernest said she fixing on his eye her own the fire of which melted into tenderness as she spoke be my friend come between me and the temptations of an unprotected lifethe recklessness of a vacant heart he threw himself at her feet he called her an angel he told her he was unworthy of her but that he would try and deserve her then he hesitated and trembling he said i will be frank and loyal had i not better tell you everything you will not hate me for a confession i make myself i shall like you betteroh so much better then i will own to you oh do not tell me you have ever loved before me i could not bear to hear it cried this inconsistent personage the other weak creature needed no more i see plainly i never loved but you said he let me hear that only cried she i am jealous even of the past say you never loved but me never mind whether it is true my child you do not even yet know love ernest shall i make you loveas none of your sex ever lovedwith heart and brain and breath and life and soul with these rapturous words she poured the soul of love into his eyes he forgot everything in the world but her he dissolved in present happiness and vowed himself hers forever and she for her part bade him but retain her esteem and no woman ever went further in love than she would she was a true epicure she had learned that passion vulgar in itself is godlike when based upon esteem this tender scene was interrupted by the callboy who brought mrs woffington a note from the manager informing her there would be no rehearsal this left her at liberty and she proceeded to take a somewhat abrupt leave of mr vane he was endeavoring to persuade her to let him be her companion until dinnertime she was to be his quest when pomander entered the room mrs woffington however was not to be persuaded she excused herself on the score of a duty which she said she had to perform and whispering as she passed pomander keep your own counsel she went out rather precipitately vane looked slightly disappointed sir charles who had returned to see whether as he fully expected she had told vane everythingand who at that moment perhaps would not have been sorry had mrs woffingtons lover called him to serious accountfinding it was not her intention to make mischief and not choosing to publish his own defeat dropped quietly into his old line and determined to keep the lovers in sight and play for revenge he smiled and said my good sir nobody can hope to monopolize mrs woffington she has others to do justice to besides you to his surprise mr vane turned instantly round upon him and looking him haughtily in the face said sir charles pomander the settled malignity with which you pursue that lady is unmanly and offensive to me who love her let our acquaintance cease here if you please or let her be sacred from your venomous tongue sir charles bowed stiffly and replied that it was only due to himself to withdraw a protection so little appreciated the two friends were in the very act of separating forever when who should run in but pompey the renegade he darted up to sir charles and said massa pomannah she in a coach going to hercules buildings im in a hurry massa pomannah where cried pomander say that again hercules buildings lambeth me in a hurry massa pomannah faithful child theres a guinea for thee fly the slave flew and taking a short cut caught and fastened on to the slow vehicle in the strand it is a house of rendezvous said sir charles half to himself half to mr vane he repeated in triumph it is a house of rendezvous he then recovering his sangfroid and treating it all as a matter of course explained that at hercules buildings was a fashionable shop with entrances from two streets that the best indian scarfs and shawls were sold there and that ladies kept their carriages waiting an immense time in the principal street while they were supposed to be in the shop or the showroom he then went on to say that he had only this morning heard that the intimacy between mrs woffington and a colonel murthwaite although publicly broken off for prudential reasons was still clandestinely carried on she had doubtless slipped away to meet the colonel mr vane turned pale no i will not suspect i will not dog her like a bloodhound cried he i will said pomander you by what right the right of curiosity i will know whether it is you who are imposed on or whether you are right and all the world is deceived in this woman he ran out but for all his speed when he got into the street there was the jealous lover at his elbow they darted with all speed into the strand got a coach sir charles on the box gave jehu a guinea and took the reinsand by a niagara of whipcord they attained lambeth and at length to his delight pomander saw another coach before him with a goldlaced black slave behind it the coach stopped and the slave came to the door the shop in question was a few hundred yards distant the adroit sir charles not only stopped but turned his coach and let the horses crawl back toward london he also flogged the side panels to draw the attention of mr vane that gentleman looked through the little circular window at the back of the vehicle and saw a lady paying the coachman there was no mistaking her figure this lady then followed at a distance by her slave walked on toward hercules buildings and it was his miserable fate to see her look uneasily round and at last glide in at a side door close to the silkmercers shop the carriage stopped sir charles came himself to the door now vane said he before i consent to go any further in this business you must promise me to be cool and reasonable i abhor absurdity and there must be no swords drawn for this little hypocrite i submit to no dictation said vane white as a sheet you have benefited so far by my knowledge said the other politely let me who am selfpossessed claim some influence with you forgive me said poor vane my angmy sorrow that such an angel should be a monster of deceit he could say no more they walked to the shop how she peeped this way and that said pomander sly little woffy no on second thoughts said he it is the other street we must reconnoiter and if we dont see her there we will enter the shop and by dint of this purse we shall soon untie the knot of the woffington riddle vane leaned heavily on his tormentor i am faint said he lean on me my dear friend said sir charles your weakness will leave you in the next street in the next street they discoverednothing in the shop they foundno mrs woffington they returned to the principal street vane began to hope there was no positive evidence suddenly three stories up a fiddle was heard pomander took no notice but vane turned red this put sir charles upon the scent stay said he is not that an irish tune vane groaned he covered his face with his hands and hissed out it is her favorite tune aha said pomander follow me they crept up the stairs pomander in advance they heard the signs of an irish orgiea rattling jig played and danced with the inspiriting interjections of that frolicsome nation these sounds ceased after a while and pomander laid his hand on his friends shoulder i prepare you said he for what you are sure to see this woman was an irish bricklayers daughter and what is bred in the bone never comes out of the flesh you will find her sitting on some irishmans knee whose limbs are ever so much stouter than yours you are the man of her head and this is the man of her heart these things would be monstrous if they were not common incredible if we did not see them every day but this poor fellow whom probably she deceives as well as you is not to be sacrificed like a dog to your unjust wrath he is as superior to her as you are to him i will commit no violence said vane i still hope she is innocent pomander smiled and said he hoped so too and if she is what you think i will but show her she is known and blaming myself as much as heroh yes more than heri will go down this night to shropshire and never speak word to her again in this world or the next good said sir charles le bruit est pour le fat la plainte est pour le sot lhonndete homine trompe seloigne et ne dit mot are you ready yes then follow me turning the handle gently he opened the door like lightning and was in the room vanes head peered over his shoulder she was actually there for once in her life the cautious artful woman was taken by surprise she gave a little scream and turned as red as fire but sir charles surprised somebody else even more than he did poor mrs woffington it would be impertinent to tantalize my reader but i flatter myself this history is not written with power enough to do that and i may venture to leave him to guess whom sir charles pomander surprised more than he did the actress while i go back for the lagging sheep chapter viii james triplet water in his eye but fire in his heart went home on wings arrived there he anticipated curiosity by informing all hands he should answer no questions only in the intervals of a work which was to take the family out of all its troubles he should gradually unfold a tale verging on the marvelousa tale whose only fault was that fiction by which alone the family could hope to be great paled beside it he then seized some sheets of paper fished out some old dramatic sketches and a list of dramatis personae prepared years ago and plunged into a comedy as he wrote true to his promise he painted tripletwise that story which we have coldly related and made it appear to all but mrs triplet that he was under the tutela or express protection of mrs woffington who would push his fortunes until the only difficulty would be to keep arrogance out of the family heart mrs triplet groaned aloud you have brought the picture home i see said she of course i have she is going to give me a sitting at what hour of what day said mrs triplet with a world of meaning she did not say replied triplet avoiding his wifes eye i know she did not was the answer i would rather you had brought me the ten shillings than this fine story said she wife said triplet dont put me into a frame of mind in which successful comedies are not written he scribbled away but his wifes despondency told upon the man of disappointments then he stuck fast then he became fidgety do keep those children quiet said the father hush my dears said the mother let your father write comedy seems to give you more trouble than tragedy james added she soothingly yes was his answer sorrow comes somehow more natural to me but for all that i have got a bright thought mrs triplet listen all of you you see jane they are all at a sumptuous banquet all the dramatis personae except the poet triplet went on writing and reading his work out music sparkling wine massive plate rosewater in the handglasses soup fishshall i have three sorts of fish i will they are cheap in this market ah fortune you wretch here at least i am your master and ill make you know itvenison wrote triplet with a malicious grin game pickles and provocatives in the center of the table then up jumps one of the guests and says he oh dear i am so hungry this was not from the comedy but from one of the boys and so am i cried a girl that is an absurd remark lysimachus said triplet with a suspicious calmness how can a boy be hungry three hours after breakfast but father there was no breakfast for breakfast now i ask you mrs triplet appealed the author how i am to write comic scenes if you let lysimachus and roxalana here put the heavy business in every five minutes forgive them the poor things are hungry then let them be hungry in another room said the irritated scribe they shant cling round my pen and paralyze it just when it is going to make all our fortunes but you women snapped triplet the just have no consideration for peoples feelings send them all to bed every man jack of them finding the conversation taking this turn the brats raised a unanimous howl triplet darted a fierce glance at them hungry hungry cried he is that a proper expression to use before a father who is sitting down here all gayety scratching wildly with his pen and hilarity scratch to write a comcom he choked a moment then in a very different voice all sadness and tenderness he said wheres the youngestwheres lucy as if i didnt know you are hungry lucy came to him directly he took her on his knee pressed her gently to his side and wrote silently the others were still father said lucy aged five the germ of a woman i am not very hungry and i am not hungry at all said bluff lysimachus taking his sisters cue then going upon his own tact he added i had a great piece of bread and butter yesterday wife they will drive me mad and he dashed at the paper the second boy explained to his mother sotto voce mother he made us hungry out of his book it is a beautiful book said lucy is it a cookery book triplet roared do you hear that inquired he all trace of illhumor gone wife he resumed after a gallant scribble i took that sermon i wrote and beautiful it was james im sure it quite cheered me up with thinking that we shall all be dead before so very long well the reverend gentleman would not have it he said it was too hard upon sin you run at the devil like a mad bull said he sell it in lambeth sir here calmness and decency are before everything says he my congregation expect to go to heaven down hill perhaps the chaplain of newgate might give you a crown for it said he and triplet dashed viciously at the paper ah sighed he if my friend mrs woffington would but drop these stupid comedies and take to tragedy this house would soon be all smiles oh james replied mrs triplet almost peevishly how can you expect anything but fine words from that woman you wont believe what all the world says you will trust to your own good heart i havent a good heart said the poor honest fellow i spoke like a brute to you just now never mind james said the woman i wonder how you put up with me at alla sick useless creature i often wish to die for your sake i know you would do better i am such a weight round your neck the man made no answer but he put lucy gently down and went to the woman and took her forehead to his bosom and held it there and after a while returned with silent energy to his comedy play us a tune on the fiddle father ay do husband that helps you often in your writing lysimachus brought him the fiddle and triplet essayed a merry tune but it came out so doleful that he shook his head and laid the instrument down music must be in the heart or it will come out of the fingersnotes not music no said he let us be serious and finish this comedy slap off perhaps it hitches because i forgot to invoke the comic muse she must be a blackhearted jade if she doesnt come with merry notions to a poor devil starving in the midst of his hungry little ones we are past help from heathen goddesses said the woman we must pray to heaven to look down upon us and our children the man looked up with a very bad expression on his countenance you forget said he sullenly our street is very narrow and the opposite houses are very high james how can heaven be expected to see what honest folk endure in so dark a hole as this cried the man fiercely james said the woman with fear and sorrow what words are these the man rose and flung his pen upon the floor have we given honesty a fair trialyes or no no said the woman without a moments hesitation not till we die as we have lived heaven is higher than the sky children said she lest perchance her husbands words should have harmed their young souls the sky is above the earth and heaven is higher than the sky and heaven is just i suppose it is so said the man a little cowed by her everybody says so i think so at bottom myself but i cant see it i want to see it but i cant cried he fiercely have my children offended heaven they will starvethey will die if i was heaven id be just and send an angel to take these childrens part they cried to me for breadi had no bread so i gave them hard words the moment i had done that i knew it was all over god knows it took a long while to break my heart but it is broken at last quite quite broken broken broken and the poor thing laid his head upon the table and sobbed beyond all power of restraint the children cried round him scarce knowing why and mrs triplet could only say my poor husband and prayed and wept upon the couch where she lay it was at this juncture that a lady who had knocked gently and unheard opened the door and with a light step entered the apartment but no sooner had she caught sight of triplets anguish than saying hastily stay i forgot something she made as hasty an exit this gave triplet a moment to recover himself and mrs woffington whose lynx eye had comprehended all at a glance and who had determined at once what line to take came flying in again saying wasnt somebody inquiring for an angel here i am see mr triplet and she showed him a note which said madam you are an angel from a perfect stranger explained she so it must be true mrs woffington said mr triplet to his wife mrs woffington planted herself in the middle of the floor and with a comical glance setting her arms akimbo uttered a shrill whistle now you will see another angelthere are two sorts of them pompey came in with a basket she took it from him lucifer avaunt cried she in a terrible tone that drove him to the wall and wait outside the door added she conversationally i heard you were ill maam and i have brought you some physicblack draughts from burgundy and she smiled and recovered from their first surprise young and old began to thaw beneath that witching irresistible smile mrs triplet i have come to give your husband a sitting will you allow me to eat my little luncheon with you i am so hungry then she clapped her hands and in ran pompey she sent him for a pie she professed to have fallen in love with at the corner of the street mother said alcibiades will the lady give me a bit of her pie hush you rude boy cried the mother she is not much of a lady if she does not cried mrs woffington now children first let us look atahema comedy nineteen dramatis personae what do you say children shall we cut out seven or nine that is the question you cant bring your armies into our drawingrooms mr daggerandbowl are you the marlborough of comedy can you marshal battalions on a turkey carpet and make gentlefolks witty in platoons what is this in the first act a duel and both wounded you butcher they are not to die maam cried triplet deprecatingly upon my honor said he solemnly spreading his bands on his bosom do you think ill trust their lives with you no give me a pen this is the way we run people through the body then she wrote business araminta looks out of the garret window combatants drop their swords put their hands to their hearts and stagger off o p and p s now children who helps me to lay the cloth i and i the children run to the cupboard mrs triplet half rising madam icant think of allowing you mrs woffington replied sit down madam or i must use brute force if you are ill be illtill i make you well twelve plates quick twentyfour knives quicker fortyeight forks quickest she met the children with the cloth and laid it then she met them again and laid knives and forks all at full gallop which mightily excited the bairns pompey came in with the pie mrs woffington took it and set it before triplet mrs woffington your coat mr triplet if you please mr triplet my coat madam mrs woffington yes off with ittheres a hole in itand carve then she whipped to the other end of the table and stitched like wildfire be pleased to cast your eyes on that mrs triplet pass it to the lady young gentleman fire away mr triplet never mind us women woffingtons housewife maam fearful to the eye only it holds everything in the world and there is a small space for everything elseto be returned by the bearer thank you sir stitches away like lightning at the coat eat away children now is your time when once i begin the pie will soon end i do everything so quick roxalana the lady sews quicker than you mother woffington bless the child dont come so near my swordarm the needle will go into your eye and out at the back of your head this nonsense made the children giggle the needle will be lostthe child no moreenter undertakerhouse turned topsyturvyfather shows woffington to the dooroff she goes with a face as long and dismal as some peoples comediesno namescrying fine chaney oranges the children all but lucy screeched with laughter lucy said gravely mother the lady is very funny you will be as funny when you are as well paid for it this just hit poor trips notion of humor and he began to choke with his mouth full of pie james take care said mrs triplet sad and solemn james looked up my wife is a good woman madam said he but deficient in an important particular oh james yes my dear i regret to say you have no sense of humor nummore than a cat jane what because the poor thing cant laugh at your comedy no maam but she laughs at nothing try her with one of your tragedies my lad i am sure james said the poor good lackadaisical woman if i dont laugh it is not for want of the will i used to be a very hearty laugher whined she but i havent laughed this two years oh indeed said the woffington then the next two years you shall do nothing else ah madam said triplet that passes the art even of the great comedian does it said the actress coolly lucy she is not a comedy lady you dont ever cry pretty lady woffington ironically oh of course not lucy confidentially comedy is crying father cried all the time he was writing his one triplet turned red as fire hold your tongue said he i was bursting with merriment wife our children talk too much they put their noses into everything and criticise their own father unnatural offspring laughed the visitor and when they take up a notion socrates couldnt convince them to the contrary for instance madam all this morning they thought fit to assume that they were starving so we were said lysimachus until the angel came and the devil went for the pie theretherethere now you mark my words we shall never get that idea out of their heads until said mrs woffington lumping a huge cut of pie into roxalanas plate we put a very different idea into their stomachs this and the look she cast on mrs triplet fairly caught that good though somber personage she giggled put her hand to her face and said im sure i ask your pardon maam it was no use the comedian had determined they should all laugh and they were made to laugh then she rose and showed them how to drink healths a la francaise and keen were her little admirers to touch her glass with theirs and the pure wine she had brought did mrs triplet much good too though not so much as the music and sunshine of her face and voice then when their stomachs were full of good food and the soul of the grape tingled in their veins and their souls glowed under her great magnetic power she suddenly seized the fiddle and showed them another of her enchantments she put it on her knee and played a tune that would have made gout cholic and phthisic dance upon their last legs she played to the eye as well as to the ear with such a smart gesture of the bow and such a radiance of face as she looked at them that whether the music came out of her wooden shell or her horsehair wand or her bright self seemed doubtful they pranced on their chairs they could not keep still she jumped up so did they she gave a wild irish horroo she put the fiddle in triplets hand the wind that shakes the barley ye divil cried she triplet went hors de lui he played like paganini or an intoxicated demon woffington covered the buckle in gallant style she danced the children danced triplet fiddled and danced and flung his limbs in wild dislocation the wineglasses danced and last mrs triplet was observed to be bobbing about on her sofa in a monstrous absurd way droning out the tune and playing her hands with mild enjoyment all to herself woffington pointed out this pantomimic soliloquy to the two boys with a glance full of fiery meaning this was enough with a fiendish yell they fell upon her and tore her shrieking off the sofa and lo when she was once launched she danced up to her husband and set to him with a meek deliberation that was as funny as any part of the scene so then the mover of all this slipped on one side and let the stone of merrimentrolland roll it did there was no swimming sprawling or irrelevant frisking their feet struck the ground for every note of the fiddle pat as its echo their faces shone their hearts leaped and their poor frozen natures came out and warmed themselves at the glowing melody a great sunbeam had come into their abode and these human motes danced in it the elder ones recovered their gravity first they sat down breathless and put their hands to their hearts they looked at one another and then at the goddess who had revived them their first feeling was wonder were they the same who ten minutes ago were weeping together yes ten minutes ago they were rayless joyless hopeless now the sun was in their hearts and sorrow and sighing were fled as fogs disperse before the god of day it was magical could a mortal play upon the soul of man woman and child like this happy woffington and suppose this was more than half acting but such acting as triplet never dreamed of and to tell the honest simple truth i myself should not have suspected it but children are sharper than one would think and alcibiades triplet told in after years that when they were all dancing except the lady he caught sight of her faceand it was quite quite grave and even sad but as often as she saw him look at her she smiled at him so gaylyhe couldnt believe it was the same face if it was art glory be to such art so worthily applied and honor to such creatures as this that come like sunshine into poor mens houses and tune drooping hearts to daylight and hope the wonder of these worthy people soon changed to gratitude mrs woffington stopped their mouths at once no no cried she if you really love me no scenes i hate them tell these brats to kiss me and let me go i must sit for my picture after dinner it is a long way to bloomsbury square the children needed no bidding they clustered round her and poured out their innocent hearts as children only do i shall pray for you after father and mother said one i shall pray for you after daily bread said lucy because we were tho hungry till you came my poor children cried woffington and hard to grownup actors as she called us but sensitive to children she fairly melted as she embraced them it was at this precise juncture that the door was unceremoniously opened and the two gentlemen burst upon the scene my reader now guesses whom sir charles pomander surprised more than he did mrs woffington he could not for the life of him comprehend what she was doing and what was her ulterior object the nil admirari of the fine gentleman deserted him and he gazed openmouthed like the veriest chawbacon the actress unable to extricate herself in a moment from the children stood there like charity in new college chapel while the mother kissed her hand and the father quietly dropped tears like some leaden water god in the middle of a fountain vane turned hot and cold by turns with joy and shame pomanders genius came to the aid of their embarrassment follow my lead whispered he what mrs woffington here cried he then he advanced businesslike to triplet we are aware sir of your various talents and are come to make a demand on them i sir am the unfortunate possessor of frescoes time has impaired their indelicacy no man can restore it as you can augh sir sir said the gratified goose my cupids bows are walkingsticks and my venuss noses are snubbed you must set all that straight on your own terms mr triplet in a single morning all shall bloom again sir whom would you wish them to resemble in feature i have lately been praised for my skill in portraiture glancing at mrs woffington oh said pomander carelessly you need not go far for venuses and cupids i suppose i see sir my wife and children thank you sir thank you pomander stared mrs woffington laughed now it was vanes turn let me have a copy of verses from your pen i shall have five pounds at your disposal for them the world has found me out thought triplet blinded by his vanity the subject sir no matter said vaneno matter oh of course it does not matter to me said triplet with some hauteur and assuming poetic omnipotence only when one knows the subject one can sometimes make the verses apply better write then since you are so confident upon mrs woffington ah that is a subject they shall be ready in an hour cried trip in whose imagination parnassus was a raised counter he had in a teacup some lines on venus and mars which he could not but feel would fit thalia and croesus or genius and envy equally well in one hour sir said triplet the article shall be executed and delivered at your house mrs woffington called vane to her with an engaging smile a month ago he would have hoped she would not have penetrated him and sir charles but he knew her better now he came trembling look me in the face mr vane said she gently but firmly i cannot said he how can i ever look you in the face again ah you disarm me but i must strike you or this will never end did i not promise that when you had earned my if esteem i would tell youwhat no mortal knowsernest my whole story i delay the confession it will cost me so many blushes so many tears and yet i hope if you knew all you would pity and forgive me meantime did i ever tell you a falsehood oh no why doubt me then when i tell you that i hold all your sex cheap but you why suspect me of heaven knows what at the dictation of a heartless brainless fopon the word of a known liar like the world black lightning flashed from her glorious eyes as she administered this royal rebuke vane felt what a poor creature he was and his face showed such burning shame and contrition that he obtained his pardon without speaking there said she kindly do not let us torment one another i forgive you let me make you happy ernest is that a great favor to ask i can make you happier than your brightest dream of happiness if you will let yourself be happy they rejoined the others but vane turned his back on pomander and would not look at him sir charles said mrs woffington gayly for she scorned to admit the fine gentleman to the rank of a permanent enemy you will be of our party i trust at dinner why no madam i fear i cannot give myself that pleasure today sir charles did not choose to swell the triumph mr vane good day said he rather dryly mr tripletmadamyour most obedient and selfpossessed at top but at bottom crestfallen he bowed himself away sir charles however on descending the stair and gaining the street caught sight of a horseman riding uncertainly about and making his horse curvet to attract attention he soon recognized one of his own horses and upon it the servant he had left behind to dog that poor innocent country lady the servant sprang off his horse and touched his hat he informed his master that he had kept with the carriage until ten oclock this morning when he had ridden away from it at barnet having duly pumped the servants as opportunity offered who is she cried sir charles wife of a cheshire squire sir charles was the reply his name whither goes she in town her name is mrs vane sir charles she is going to her husband curious cried sir charles i wish she had no husband no i wish she came from shropshire and he chuckled at the notion if you please sir charles said the man is not willoughby in cheshire no cried his master it is in shropshire what eh five guineas for you if that lady comes from willoughby in shropshire that is where she comes from then sir charles and she is going to bloomsbury square how long have they been married not more than twelve months sir charles pomander gave the man ten guineas instead of five on the spot reader it was too true mr vanethe good the decent the churchgoermr vane whom mrs woffington had selected to improve her moralsmr vane was a married man chapter ix as soon as pomander had drawn his breath and realized this discovery he darted upstairs and with all the demure calmness he could assume told mr vane whom he met descending that he was happy to find his engagements permitted him to join the party in bloomsbury square he then flung himself upon his servants horse like iago he saw the indistinct outline of a glorious and a most malicious plot it lay crude in his head and heart at present thus much he saw clearly that if he could time mrs vanes arrival so that she should pounce upon the woffington at her husbands table he might be present at and enjoy the public discomfiture of a man and woman who had wounded his vanity bidding his servant make the best of his way to bloomsbury square sir charles galloped in that direction himself intending first to inquire whether mrs vane was arrived and if not to ride toward islington and meet her his plan was frustrated by an accident galloping round a corner his horse did not change his leg cleverly and the pavement being also loose slipped and fell on his side throwing his rider upon the trottoir the horse got up and trembled violently but was unhurt the rider lay motionless except that his legs quivered on the pavement they took him up and conveyed him into a druggists shop the master of which practiced chirurgery he had to be sent for and before he could be found sir charles recovered his reason so much so that when the chirurgeon approached with his fleam to bleed him according to the practice of the day the patient drew his sword and assured the other he would let out every drop of blood in his body if he touched him he of the shorter but more lethal weapon hastily retreated sir charles flung a guinea on the counter and mounting his horse rode him off rather faster than before this accident there was a dead silence i believe that gentleman to be the devil said a thoughtful bystander the crowd it was a century ago assented nem con sir charles arrived in bloomsbury square found that the whole party was assembled he therefore ordered his servant to parade before the door and if he saw mrs vanes carriage enter the square to let him know if possible before she should reach the house on entering he learned that mr vane and his guests were in the garden a very fine one and joined them there mrs vane demands another chapter in which i will tell the reader who she was and what excuse her husband had for his liaison with margaret woffington chapter x mabel chester was the beauty and toast of south shropshire she had refused the hand of half the country squires in a circle of some dozen miles till at last mr vane became her suitor besides a handsome face and person mr vane had accomplishments his rivals did not possess he read poetry to her on mossy banks an hour before sunset and awakened sensibilities which her other suitors shocked and they them the lovely mabel had a taste for beautiful things without any excess of that severe quality called judgment i will explain if you or i reader had read to her in the afternoon amid the smell of roses and eglantine the chirp of the mavis the hum of bees the twinkling of butterflies and the tinkle of distant sheep something that combined all these sights and sounds and smellssay miltons musical picture of eden p l lib and after that triplet on kew she would have instantly pronounced in favor of eden but if we had read her milton and mr vane had read her triplet she would have as unhesitatingly preferred kew to paradise she was a true daughter of eve the lady who when an angel was telling her and her husband the truths of heaven in heavens own music slipped away into the kitchen because she preferred hearing the story at secondhand encumbered with digressions and in mortal but marital accents when her mother who guarded mabel like a dragon told her mr vane was not rich enough and she really must not give him so many opportunities mabel cried and embraced the dragon and said oh mother the dragon finding her ferocity dissolving tried to shake her off but the goose would cry and embrace the dragon till it melted by and by mr vanes uncle died suddenly and left him the great stoken church estate and a trunk full of jacobuses and queen annes guineashis own hoard and his fathersthen the dragon spake comfortably and said my child he is now the richest man in shropshire he will not think of you now so steel your heart then mabel contrary to all expectations did not cry but with flushing cheek pledged her life upon ernests love and honor and ernest as soon as the funeral etc left him free galloped to mabel to talk of our good fortune the dragon had done him injustice that was not his weak point so they were married and they were very very happy but one month after the dragon died and that was their first grief but they bore it together and vane was not like the other shropshire squires his idea of pleasure was something his wife could share he still rode walked and sat with her and read to her and composed songs for her and about her which she played and sang prettily enough in her quiet ladylike way and in a voice of honey dropping from the comb then she kept a keen eye upon him and when she discovered what dishes he liked she superintended those herself and observing that he never failed to eat of a certain lemonpudding the dragon had originated she always made this pudding herself and she never told her husband she made it the first seven months of their marriage was more like blue sky than brown earth and if any one had told mabel that her husband was a mortal and not an angel sent to her that her days and nights might be unmixed uninterrupted heaven she could hardly have realized the information when a vexatious litigant began to contest the will by which mr vane was lord of stoken church and mr vane went up to london to concert the proper means of defeating this attack mrs vane would gladly have compounded by giving the man two or three thousand acres or the whole estate if he wouldnt take less not to rob her of her husband for a month but she was docile as she was amorous so she cried out of sight a week and let her darling go with every misgiving a loving heart could have but one and that one her own heart told her was impossible the month rolled awayno symptom of a return for this mr vane was not in fact to blame but toward the end of the next month business became a convenient excuse when three months had passed mrs vane became unhappy she thought he too must feel the separation she offered to come to him he answered uncandidly he urged the length the fatigue of the journey she was silenced but some time later she began to take a new view of his objections he is so selfdenying said she dear ernest he longs for me but he thinks it selfish to let me travel so far alone to see him full of this idea she yielded to her love she made her preparations and wrote to him that if he did not forbid her peremptorily he must expect to see her at his breakfasttable in a very few days mr vane concluded this was a jest and did not answer this letter at all mrs vane started she traveled with all speed but coming to a halt at she wrote to her husband that she counted on being with him at four of the clock on thursday this letter preceded her arrival by a few hours it was put into his hand at the same time with a note from mrs woffington telling him she should be at a rehearsal at covent garden thinking his wifes letter would keep he threw it on one side into a sort of a tray and after a hurried breakfast went out of his house to the theater he returned as we are aware with mrs woffington and also at her request with mr cibber for whom they had called on their way he had forgotten his wifes letter and was entirely occupied with his guests sir charles pomander joined them and found mr colander the head domestic of the london establishment cutting with a pair of scissors every flower mrs woffington fancied that lady having a passion for flowers colander during his temporary absence from the interior had appointed james burdock to keep the house and receive the two remaining guests should they arrive this james burdock was a faithful old country servant who had come up with mr vane but left his heart at willoughby james burdock had for some time been ruminating and his conclusion was that his mistress miss mabel as by force of habit he called her was not treated as she deserved burdock had been imported into mr vanes family by mabel he had carried her in his arms when she was a child he had held her upon a donkey when she was a little girl and when she became a woman it was he who taught her to stand close to her horse and give him her foot and spring while he lifted her steadily but strongly into her saddle and when there it was he who had instructed her that a horse was not a machine that galloping tires it in time and that galloping it on the hard road hammers it to pieces i taught the girl thought james within himself this honest silverhaired old fellow seemed so ridiculous to colander the smooth supercilious londoner that he deigned sometimes to converse with james in order to quiz him this very morning they had had a conversation poor miss mabel dear heart a twelvemonth married and nigh six months of it a widow or next door we write to her james and entertain her replies which are at considerable length ay but we dont read em said james with an uneasy glance at the tray invariably at our leisure meantime we make ourselves happy among the wits and the sirens and she do make others happy among the poor and the ailing which shows said colander superciliously the difference of tastes burdock whose eye had never been off his mistresss handwriting at last took it up and said master colander do if ye please sir take this into masters dressingroom do now colander looked down on the missive with dilating eye not a bill james burdock said he reproachfully a bill bless ye no a letter from missus no the dog would not take it in to his master and poor james with a sigh replaced it in the tray this james burdock then was left in charge of the hall by colander and it so happened that the change was hardly effected before a hurried knocking came to the street door ay ay grumbled burdock i thought it would not be long london for knocking and ringing all day and ringing and knocking all night he opened the door reluctantly and suspiciously and in darted a lady whose features were concealed by a hood she glided across the hall as if she was making for some point and old james shuffled after her crying stop stop young woman what is your name young woman why james burdock cried the lady removing her hood have you forgotten your mistress mistress why miss mabel i ask your pardon madamhere john margery hush cried mrs vane but where are your trunks miss and wheres the coach and darby and joan to think of their drawing you all the way here ill have em into your room directly maam miss youve come just in time what a dear good stupid old thing you are james where is ernestmr vane james is he well and happy i want to surprise him yes maam said james looking down i left the old stupid coach at islington james the somethingpin was loose or i dont know what could i wait two hours there so i came on by myself you wicked old man you let me talk and dont tell me how he is master is main well maam and thank you said old burdock confused and uneasy but is he happy of course he is are we not to meet today after six months ah but never mind they are gone by lord bless her thought the faithful old fellow if sitting down and crying could help her i wouldnt be long by this time they were in the banquetingroom and at the preparations there mabel gave a start she then colored oh he has invited his friends to make acquaintance i had rather we had been alone all this day and tomorrow but he must not know that no his friends are my friends and shall be too thought the country wife she then glanced with some misgiving at her traveling attire and wished she had brought one trunk with her james said she where is my room and mind i forbid you to tell a soul i am come your room miss mabel well any room where there is lookingglass and water she then went to a door which opened in fact on a short passage leading to a room occupied by mr vane himself no no cried james that is masters room well is not masters room mistresss room old man but stay is he there no maam he is in the garden with a power of fine folks they shall not see me till i have made myself a little more decent said the young beauty who knew at bottom how little comparatively the color of her dress could affect her appearance and she opened mr vanes door and glided in burdocks first determination was in spite of her injunction to tell colander but on reflection he argued and then what will they do they will put their heads together and deceive us some other way no thought james with a touch of spite we shall see how they will all look he argued also that at sight of his beautiful wife his master must come to his senses and the colander faction be defeated and perhaps by the mercy of providence colander himself turned off while thus ruminating a thundering knock at the door almost knocked him off his legs there ye go again said he and he went angrily to the door this time it was hunsdon who was in a desperate hurry to see his master where is sir charles pomander my honest fellow said he in the garden my jackadandy said burdock furiously honest fellow among servants implies some moral inferiority in the garden went hunsdon his masterall whose senses were playing sentinelsaw him and left the company to meet him she is in the house sir good govanish sir charles looked into the banquetroom the haunch was being placed on the table he returned with the information he burned to bring husband and wife together he counted each second lost that postponed this to him thrilling joy oh how happy he washappier than the serpent when he saw eves white teeth really strike into the apple shall we pay respect to this haunch mr quin said vane gayly if you please sir said quin gravely colander ran down a bypath with an immense bouquet which he arranged for mrs woffington in a vase at mr vanes left hand he then threw open the windows which were on the french plan and shut within a foot of the lawn the musicians in the arbor struck up and the company led by mr vane and mrs woffington entered the room and a charming room it waslight lofty and largeadorned in the french way with white and gold the table was an exact oval and at it everybody could hear what any one said an excellent arrangement where ideaed guests only are admittedwhich is another excellent arrangement though i see people dont think so the repast was luxurious and elegant there was no profusion of unmeaning dishes each was a bonnebouchean undeniable delicacy the glass was beautiful the plates silver the flowers rose like walls from the table the plate massive and glorious rosewater in the handglasses music crept in from the garden deliciously subdued into what seemed a natural sound a broad stream of southern sun gushed in fiery gold through the open window and like a redhot rainbow danced through the stained glass above it existence was a thing to bask inin such a place and so happy an hour the guests were quin mrs clive mr cibber sir charles pomander mrs woffington and messrs soaper and snarl critics of the day this pair with wonderful sagacity had arrived from the street as the haunch came from the kitchen goodhumor reigned some cuts passed but as the parties professed wit they gave and took quin carved the haunch and was happy soaper and snarl eating the same and drinking toquay were mellowed and mitigated into human flesh mr vane and mrs woffington were happy he because his conscience was asleep and she because she felt nothing now could shake her hold of him sir charles was in a sort of mental chuckle his head burned his bones ached but he was in a sort of nervous delight where is she thought he what will she do will she send her maid with a note how blue he will look or will she come herself she is a country wife there must be a scene oh why doesnt she come into this room she must know we are here is she watching somewhere his brain became puzzled and his senses were sharpened to a point he was all eye ear and expectation and this was why he was the only one to hear a very slight sound behind the door we have mentioned and next to perceive a ladys glove lying close to that door mabel had dropped it in her retreat putting this and that together he was led to hope and believe she was there making her toilet perhaps and her arrival at present unknown do you expect no one else said he with feigned carelessness to mr vane no said mr vane with real carelessness it must be so what fortune thought pomander soaper mr cibber looks no older than he did five years ago snarl there was no room on his face for a fresh wrinkle soaper he he nay mr snarl mr cibber is like old port the more ancient he grows the more delicious his perfume snarl and the crustier he gets clive mr vane you should always separate those two snarl by himself is just supportable but when soaper paves the way with his hypocritical praise the pair are too much they are a twoedged sword woffington wanting nothing but polish and point vane gentlemen we abandon your neighbor mr quin to you quin they know better if they dont keep a civil tongue in their heads no fat goes from here to them cibber ah mr vane this room is delightful but it makes me sad i knew this house in lord longuevilles time an unrivaled gallant peggy you may just remember him sir charles pomander with his eye on a certain door yes yes a gouty old fellow cibber fired up i wish you may ever be like him oh the beauty the wit the petitssoupers that used to be here longueville was a great creature mr vane i have known him entertain a fine lady in this room while her rival was fretting and fuming on the other side of that door ah indeed said sir charles more shame for him said mr vane here was luck pomander seized this opportunity of turning the conversation to his object with a malicious twinkle in his eye he inquired of mr cibber what made him fancy the house had lost its virtue in mr vanes hands because said cibber peevishly you all want the true savoir faire nowadays because there is no juste milieu young gentlemen the young dogs of the day are all either unprincipled heathen like yourself or amadisses like our worthy host the old gentlemans face and manners were like those of a patriarch regretting the general decay of virtue not the imaginary diminution of a single vice he concluded with a sigh that the true preux des dames went out with the full periwig stab my vitals a bit of fat mr cibber said quin whose jokes were not polished jemmy thou art a brute was the reply you refuse sir said quin sternly no sir said cibber with dignity i accept pomanders eye was ever on the door the old are so unjust to the young said he you pretend that the deluge washed away iniquity and that a rake is a fossil what said he leaning as it were on every word if i bet you a cool hundred that vane has a petticoat in that room and that mrs woffington shall unearth her the malicious dog thought this was the surest way to effect a dramatic exposure because if peggy found mabel to all appearances concealed peggy would scold her and betray herself pomander cried vane in great heat then checking himself he said coolly but you all know pomander none of you replied that gentleman bring a chair sir said he authoritatively to a servant who of course obeyed mrs clive looked at him and thought there is something in this it is for the lady said he coolly then leaning over the table he said to mrs woffington with an impudent affectation of friendly understanding i ran her to earth in this house not ten minutes ago of course i dont know who she is but smacking his lips a rustic amaryllis breathing all maybuds and meadowsweet have her out peggy shouted cibber i know the runtheres the covert hark forward ha ha ha mr vane rose and with a sternness that brought the old beau up with a run he said mr cibber age and infirmity are privileged but for you sir charles dont be angry interposed mrs woffington whose terror was lest he should quarrel with so practiced a swordsman dont you see it is a jest and as might be expected from poor sir charles a very sorry one a jest said vane white with rage let it go no further or it will be earnest mrs woffington placed her hand on his shoulder and at that touch he instantly yielded and sat down it was at this moment when sir charles found himself for the present baffledfor he could no longer press his point and search that room when the attention of all was drawn to a dispute which for a moment had looked like a quarrel while mrs woffingtons hand still lingered as only a womans hand can linger in leaving the shoulder of the man she loves it was at this moment the door opened of its own accord and a most beautiful woman stood with a light step upon the threshold nobodys back was to her except mr vanes every eye but his was spellbound upon her mrs woffington withdrew her hand as if a scorpion had touched her a stupor of astonishment fell on them all mr vane seeing the direction of all their eyes slewed himself round in his chair into a most awkward position and when he saw the lady he was utterly dumfounded but she as soon as he turned his face her way glided up to him with a little halfsigh halfcry of joy and taking him round the neck kissed him deliciously while every eye at the table met every other eye in turn one or two of the men rose for the ladys beauty was as worthy of homage as her appearing was marvelous mrs woffington too astonished for emotion to take any definite shape said in what seemed an ordinary tone who is this lady i am his wife madam said mabel in the voice of a skylark and smiling friendly on the questioner it is my wife said vane like a speakingmachine he was scarcely in a conscious state it is my wife he repeated mechanically the words were no sooner out of mabels mouth than two servants who had never heard of mrs vane before hastened to place on mr vanes right hand the chair pomander had provided a plate and napkin were there in a twinkling and the wife modestly but as a matter of course courtesied low with an air of welcome to all her guests and then glided into the seat her servants obsequiously placed before her the whole thing did not take half a minute chapter xi mr vane besides being a rich was a magnificent man when his features were in repose their beauty had a wise and stately character soaper and snarl had admired and bitterly envied him at the present moment no one of his guests envied himthey began to realize his position and he a huge wheel of shame and remorse began to turn and whir before his eyes he sat between two european beauties and pale and red by turns shunned the eyes of both and looked down at his plate in a cold sweat of humiliation mortification and shame the iron passed through mrs woffingtons soul so this was a villain too the greatest villain of alla hypocrite she turned very faint but she was under an enemys eye and under a rivals the thought drove the blood back from her heart and with a mighty effort she was woffington again hitherto her liaison with mr vane had called up the better part of her nature and perhaps our reader has been taking her for a good woman but now all her dregs were stirred to the surface the mortified actress gulled by a novice the wronged and insulted woman had but two thoughts to defeat her rivalto be revenged on her false lover more than one sharp spasm passed over her features before she could master them and then she became smiles above wormwood and redhot steel belowall in less than half a minute as for the others looks of keen intelligence passed between them and they watched with burning interest for the denouement that interest was stronger than their sense of the comicality of all this for the humorous view of what passes before our eyes comes upon cool reflection not often at the time sir charles indeed who had foreseen some of this wore a demure look belied by his glittering eye he offered cibber snuff and the two satirical animals grinned over the snuffbox like a malicious old ape and a mischievous young monkey the newcomer was charming she was above the middle height of a full though graceful figure her abundant glossy bright brown hair glittered here and there like gold in the light she had a snowy brow eyes of the profoundest blue a cheek like a peach and a face beaming candor and goodness the character of her countenance resembled the queen of the may in mr leslies famous picture more than any face of our day i can call to mind you are not angry with me for this silly trick said she with some misgiving after all i am only two hours before my time you know dearest i said four in my letterdid i not vane stammered what could he say and you have had three days to prepare you for i wrote like a good wife to ask leave before starting but he never so much as answered my letter madam this she addressed to mrs woffington who smiled by main force why stammered vane could you doubt ii no silence was consent was it not but i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw himso you understandi warrant me you did not look for me so soon ladies some of us did not look for you at all madam said mrs woffington what ernest did not tell you he expected me no he told us this banquet was in honor of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady to be his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whose point hitherto had ever been turned away from him he intended to steal a march on us said pomander dryly and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily she is about to retire and change her travelingdress yes dear but you forget i am a stranger to your friends will you not introduce me to them first no no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselves rejoined mrs woffington she rose slowly with her eye on vane he cast a look of abject entreaty on her but there was no pity in that curling lip and awful eye he closed his own eyes and waited for the blow sir charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion mrs woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while at length the honorable mrs quickly madam said she indicating mrs clive this turn took them all by surprise pomander bit his lip sir john brute falstaff cried quin hang it sir john brute falstaff resumed mrs woffington we call him for brevity brute vane drew a long breath your neighbor is lord foppington a butterfly of some standing and a little gouty sir charles pomander oh cried mrs vane it is the good gentleman who helped us out of the slough near huntingdon ernest if it had not been for this gentleman i should not have had the pleasure of being here now and she beamed on the good pomander mr vane did not rise and embrace sir charles all the company thanks the good sir charles said cibber bowing i see it in all their faces said the good sir charles dryly mrs woffington continued mr soaper mr snarl gentlemen who would butter and slice up their own fathers bless me cried mrs vane faintly critics and she dropped as it were the word dryly with a sweet smile into mabels plate mrs vane was relieved she had apprehended cannibals london they had told her was full of curiosities but yourself madam i am the lady betty modish at your service a fourinch grin went round the table the dramatical old rascal cibber began now to look at it as a bit of genteel comedy and slipped out his notebook under the table pomander cursed her ready wit which had disappointed him of his catastrophe vane wrote on a slip of paper pity and respect the innocent and passed it to mrs woffington he could not have done a more superfluous or injudicious thing and now ernest cried mabel for the news from willoughby vane stopped her in dismay he felt how many satirical eyes and ears were upon him and his wife pray go and change your dress first mabel cried he fully determined that on her return she should not find the present party there mrs vane cast an imploring look on mrs woffington my things are not come said she and lady betty i had so much to tell him and to be sent away and the deep blue eyes began to fill now mrs woffington was determined that this lady who she saw was simple should disgust her husband by talking twaddle before a band of satirists so she said warmly it is not fair on us pray madam your budget of country news clouted cream so seldom comes to london quite fresh there you see ernest said the unsuspicious soul first you must know that gray gillian is turned out for a brood mare so old george wont let me ride her old servants are such tyrants my lady and my barbary hen has laid two eggs heaven knows the trouble we had to bring her to it and dame best that is my husbands old nurse mrs quickly has had soup and pudding from the hall everyday and once she went so far as to say it wasnt altogether a bad pudding she is not a very grateful woman in a general way poor thing i made it with these hands vane writhed happy pudding observed mr cibber is this mockery sir cried vane with a sudden burst of irritation no sir it is gallantry replied cibber with perfect coolness will you hear a little music in the garden said vane to mrs woffington poohpoohing his wifes news not till i hear the end of dame bess best my lady dame best interests me mr vane ay and ernest is very fond of her too when he is at home she is in her nice new cottage dear but she misses the draughts that were in her old onethey were like old friends the only ones i have im thinking said the dear cross old thing and there stood i on her floor with a flannel petticoat in both hands that i had made for her and ruined my finger look else my lord foppington she extended a hand the color of cream permit me madam taking out his glasses with which he inspected her finger and gravely announced to the company the laceration is in fact discernible may i be permitted madam added he to kiss this fair hand which i should never have suspected of having ever made itself half so useful ay my lord said she coloring slightly you shall because you are so old but i dont say for a young gentleman unless it was the one that belongs to me and he does not ask me my dear mabel pray remember we are not at willoughby i see we are not ernest and the dovelike eyes filled brimful and all her innocent prattle was put an end to what brutes men are thought mrs woffington they are not worthy even of a fool like this mr vane once more pressed her to hear a little music in the garden and this time she consented mr vane was far from being unmoved by his wifes arrival and her true affection but she worried him he was anxious above all things to escape from his present position and separate the rival queens and this was the only way he could see to do it he whispered mabel and bade her somewhat peremptorily rest herself for an hour after her journey and he entered the garden with mrs woffington now the other gentlemen admired mrs vane the most she was new she was as lovely in her way as peggy and it was the young maymorn beauty of the country they forgave her simplicity and even her goodness on account of her beauty men are not severe judges of beautiful women they all solicited her to come with them and be the queen of the garden but the good wife was obedient her lord had told her she was fatigued so she said she was tired mr vanes garden will lack its sweetest and fairest flower madam cried cibber if we leave you here nay my lord there are fairer than i poor quin cried kitty clive to have to leave the aldermans walk for the gardenwalk all i regret said the honest glutton stoutly is that i go without carving for mrs vane you are very good sir john i will be more troublesome to you at suppertime when they were all gone she couldnt help sighing it almost seemed as if everybody was kinder to her than he whose kindness alone she valued and he must take lady bettys hand instead of mine thought she but that is good breeding i suppose i wish there was no such thing we are very happy without it in shropshire then this poor little soul was ashamed of herself and took herself to task poor ernest said she pitying the wrongdoer like a woman he was not pleased to be so taken by surprise no wonder they are so ceremonious in london how good of him not to be angry then she sighed her heart had received a damp his voice seemed changed and he did not meet her eyes with the look he wore at willoughby she looked timidly into the garden she saw the gay colors of beaux as well as of bellesfor in these days broadcloth had not displaced silk and velvetglancing and shining among the trees and she sighed but presently brightening up a little she said i will go and see that the coffee is hot and clear and the chocolate well mixed for them the poor child wanted to do something to please her husband before she could carry out this act of domestic virtue her attention was drawn to a strife of tongues in the hall she opened the foldingdoors and there was a fine gentleman obstructing the entrance of a somber rusty figure with a portfolio and a manuscript under each arm the fine gentleman was colander the seedy personage was the eternal triplet come to make hay with his fivefoot rule while the sun shone colander had opened the door to him and he had shot into the hall the majordomo obstructed the farther entrance of such a coat i tell you my master is not at home remonstrated the majordomo how can you say so cried mrs vane in surprise when you know he is in the garden simpleton thought colander show the gentleman in gentleman muttered colander triplet thanked her for her condescension he would wait for mr vane in the hall i came by appointment madam this is the only excuse for the importunity you have just witnessed hearing this mrs vane dismissed colander to inform his master colander bowed loftily and walked into the servants hall without deigning to take the last proposition into consideration come in here sir said mabel mr vane will come as soon as he can leave his company triplet entered in a series of obsequious jerks sit down and rest you sir and mrs vane seated herself at the table and motioned with her white hand to triplet to sit beside her triplet bowed and sat on the edge of a chair and smirked and dropped his portfolio and instantly begged mrs vanes pardon in taking it up he let fall his manuscript and was again confused but in the middle of some superfluous and absurd excuse his eye fell on the haunch it straightway dilated to an enormous size and he became suddenly silent and absorbed in contemplation you look sadly tired sir why yes madam it is a long way from lambeth walk and it is passing hot madam he took his handkerchief out and was about to wipe his brow but returned it hastily to his pocket i beg your pardon madam said triplet whose ideas of breeding though speculative were severe i forgot myself mabel looked at him and colored and slightly hesitated at last she said ill be bound you came in such a hurry you forgotyou mustnt be angry with meto have your dinner first for triplet looked like an absurd wolfall benevolence and starvation what divine intelligence thought trip how strange madam cried he you have hit it this accounts at once for a craving i feel now you remind me i recollect carving for others i did forget to remember myself not that i need have forgot it today madam but being used to forget it i did not remember not to forget it today madam that was all and the author of this intelligent account smiled very very very absurdly she poured him out a glass of wine he rose and bowed but peremptorily refused it with his tonguehis eye drank it but you must persisted this hospitable lady but madam consider i am not entitled tonectar as i am a man the white hand was filling his plate with partridge pie but madam you dont consider how you overwhelm me with yourambrosia as i am a poet i am sorry mr vane should keep you waiting by no means madam it is fortunatei mean it procures me the pleasure of here articulation became obstructed your society madam besides the servants of the muse are used to waiting what we are not used to is here the white hand filled his glass being waited upon by hebe and the twelve graces whose health i have the honor deglutition a poet cried mabel oh i am so glad little did i think ever to see a living poet dear heart i should not have known if you had not told me sir i love poetry it is in your face madam triplet instantly whipped out his manuscript put a plate on one corner of it and a decanter on the other and begged her opinion of this trifle composed said he in honor of a lady mr vane entertains today oh said mrs vane and colored with pleasure how ungrateful she had been here was an attentionfor of course she never doubted that the verses were in honor of her arrival bright being sang out triplet nay sir said mabel i think i know the lady and it would be hardly proper of me oh madam said triplet solemnly strictly correct madam and he spread his hand out over his bosom strictlyblunderbuss my poetical name madam never stooped to the taste of the town bright being thou but you must have another glass of wine first and a slice of the haunch with alacrity madam he laid in a fresh stock of provisions strange it was to see them side by side he a don quixote with cordage instead of lines in his mahogany face and clothes hanging upon him she smooth ducklike delicious and bright as an opening rose fresh with dew she watched him kindly archly and demurely and still plied him countrywise with every mortal thing on the table but the poet was not a boaconstrictor and even a boaconstrictor has an end hunger satisfied his next strongest feeling simple vanity remained to be contented as the last morsel went in out came bright being thou whose ra no no said she who fancied herself and not without reason the bright being mr vane intended them for a surprise as you please madam and the disappointed bore sighed but you would have liked them for the theme inspired me the kindest the most generous of women dont you agree with me madam mabel vane opened her eyes hardly sir laughed she if you knew her as i do i ought to know her better sir ay indeed well madam now her kindness to me for instancea poor devil like me the expression i trust is not disagreeable to you madam if so forgive me and consider it withdrawn la sir civility is so cheap if you go to that civility maam why she has saved me from despairfrom starvation perhaps poor thing well indeed sir you lookedyou lookedwhat a shame and you a poet from an epitaph to an epic madam at this moment a figure looked in upon them from the garden but retreated unobserved it was sir charles pomander who had slipped away with the heartless and malicious intention of exposing the husband to the wife and profiting by her indignation and despair seeing triplet he made an extemporaneous calculation that so infernal a chatterbox could not be ten minutes in her company without telling her everything and this would serve his turn very well he therefore postponed his purpose and strolled away to a short distance triplet justified the baronets opinion without any sort of sequency he now informed mrs vane that the benevolent lady was to sit to him for her portrait here was a new attention of ernests how good he was and how wicked and ungrateful she what are you a painter too she inquired from a house front to an historical composition madam oh what a clever man and so ernest commissioned you to paint a portrait no madam for that i am indebted to the lady herself the lady herself yes madam and i expected to find her here will you add to your kindness by informing me whether she has arrived or she is gone who sir oh dear not my portrait oh ernest who madam cried triplet why mrs woffington she is not here said mrs vane who remembered all the names perfectly well there is one charming lady among our guests her face took me in a moment but she is a titled lady there is no mrs woffington among them strange replied triplet she was to be here and in fact that is why i expedited these lines in her honor in her honor sir yes madam allow me brights being thou whose radiant brow no no i dont care to hear them now for i dont know the lady well madam but at least you have seen her act act you dont mean all this is for an actress an actress the actress and you have never seen her act what a pleasure you have to come to see her act is a privilege but to act with her as i once did but she does not remember that nor shall i remind her madam said triplet sternly on that occasion i was hissed owing to circumstances which for the credit of our common nature i suppress what are you an actor too you are everything and it was in a farce of my own madam which by the strangest combination of accidents was damned a playwriter oh what clever men there are in the worldin london at least he is a playwriter too i wonder my husband comes not does mr vanedoes mr vane admire this actress said she suddenly mr vane madam is a gentleman of taste said he pompously well sir said the lady languidly she is not here triplet took the hint and rose goodby said she sweetly and thank you kindly for your company triplet madamjames triplet of hercules buildings lambeth occasional verses odes epithalamia elegies dedications squibs impromptus and hymns executed with spirit punctuality and secrecy portraits painted and instruction in declamation sacred profane and dramatic the card madam and he drew it as doth a theatrical fop his rapier of him who to all these qualifications adds a prouder stillthat of being madam your humble devoted and grateful servant james triplet he bowed in a line from his right shoulder to his left toe and moved off but triplet could not go all at one time out of such company he was given to return in real life he had played this trick so often on the stage he came back exuberant with gratitude the fact is madam said he strange as it may appear to you a kind hand has not so often been held out to me that i should forget it especially when that hand is so fair and gracious may i be permitted madamyou will impute it to gratitude rather than audacityii whimper madam with sudden severity i am gone these last words he pronounced with the right arm at an angle of fortyfive degrees and the fingers pointing horizontally the stage had taught him this grace also in his day an actor who had three words to say such as my lords carriage is waiting came on the stage with the right arm thus elevated delivered his message in the tones of a falling dynasty wheeled like a soldier and retired with the left arm pointing to the sky and the right hand extended behind him like a setters tail left to herself mabel was uneasy ernest is so warmhearted this was the way she put it even to herself he admired her acting and wished to pay her a compliment what if i carried him the verses she thought she should surely please him by showing she was not the least jealous or doubtful of him the poor child wanted so to win a kind look from her husband but ere she could reach the window sir charles pomander had entered it now sir charles was naturally welcome to mrs vane for all she knew of him was that he had helped her on the road to her husband pomander what madam all alone here as in shropshire mabel for the moment sir pomander force of habit a husband with a wife in shropshire is so like a bachelor mabel sir pomander and our excellent ernest is such a favorite mabel no wonder sir pomander few can so pass from the larva state of country squire to the butterfly nature of beau mabel yes sadly i find him changed pomander changed transformed he is now the prop of the cocoatree the star of ranelagh the lauzun of the greenroom mabel the greenroom where is that you mean kindly sir but you make me unhappy pomander the greenroom my dear madam is the bower where houris put off their wings and goddesses become dowdies where lady macbeth weeps over her lapdog dead from repletion and belvidera soothes her broken heart with a dozen of oysters in a word it is the place where actors and actresses become men and women and act their own parts with skill instead of a poets clumsily mabel actors actresses does mr vane frequent such pomander he has earned in six months a reputation many a fine gentleman would give his ears for not a scandalous journal his initials have not figured in not an actress of reputation gossip has not given him for a conquest how dare you say this to me cried mrs vane with a sudden flash of indignation and then the tears streamed over her lovely cheeks and even a pomander might have forborne to torture her so but sir charles had no mercy you would be sure to learn it said he and with malicious additions it is better to hear the truth from a friend a friend he is no friend to a house who calumniates the husband to the wife is it the part of a friend to distort dear ernests kindliness and gayety into ill morals to pervert his love of poetry and plays into an unworthy attachment to actors andoh and the tears would come but she dried them for now she hated this man with all the little power of hatred she had she detested him do you suppose i did not know mrs woffington was to come to us today cried she struggling passionately against her own fears and sir charless innuendoes what cried he you recognized her you detected the actress of all work under the airs of lady betty modish lady betty modish cried mabel that good beautiful face ah cried sir charles i see you did not well lady betty was mrs woffington whom my husband i know had invited here to present her with these verses which i shall take him for her and her poor little lip trembled had the visit been in any other character as you are so base so cruel as to insinuate what have i done to you that you kill me so you wicked gentleman would he have chosen the day of my arrival not if he knew you were coming was the cool reply and he did knowi wrote to him indeed said pomander fairly puzzled mrs vane caught sight of her handwriting on the tray and darted to it and seized her letter and said triumphantly my last letter written upon the roadsee sir charles took it with surprise but turning it in his hand a cool satirical smile came to his face he handed it back and said coldly read me the passage madam on which you argue poor mrs vane turned the letter in her hand and her eye became instantly glazed the seal was unbroken she gave a sharp cry of agony like a wounded deer she saw pomander no longer she was alone with her great anguish i had but my husband and my god in the world cried she my mother is gone my god have pity on me my husband does not love me the cold villain was startled at the mighty storm his mean hand had raised this creature had not only more feeling but more passion than a hundred libertines he muttered some villains commonplaces while this unhappy young lady raised her hands to heaven and sobbed in a way very terrible to any manly heart he is unworthy you muttered pomander he has forfeited your love he has left you nothing but revenge be comforted let me who have learned already to adore you so cried she turning on him in a moment for on some points womans instinct is the lightning of wisdom this sir was your object i may no longer hold a place in my husbands heart but i am mistress of his house leave it sir and never return to it while i live sir charles again discomfited bowed reverentially your wish shall ever be respected by me madam but here they come use the right of a wife conceal yourself in that high chair see i turn it so that they cannot see you at least you will find i have but told you the truth no cried mabel violently i will not spy upon my husband at the dictation of his treacherous friend sir charles vanished he was no sooner gone than mrs vane crouched trembling and writhing with jealousy in the large highbacked chair she heard her husband and the soidisant lady betty modish enter during their absence mrs woffington had doubtless been playing her cards with art for it appeared that a reconciliation was now taking place the lady however was still cool and distant it was poor mabels fate to hear these words you must permit me to go alone mr vane i insist upon leaving this house alone on this he whispered to her she answered you are not justified i can explain all was his reply i am ready to renounce credit character all the world for you they passed out of the room before the unhappy listener could recover the numbing influence of these deadly words but the next moment she started wildly up and cried as one drowning cries vaguely for help ernest oh nono you cannot use me so ernesthusband oh mother mother she rose and would have made for the door but nature had been too cruelly tried at the first step she could no longer see anything and the next moment swooning dead away she fell back insensible with her head and shoulders resting on the chair chapter xii mr vane was putting mrs woffington into her chair when he thought he heard his name cried he bade that lady a mournful farewell and stepped back into his own hall he had no sooner done so than he heard a voice the accent of which alarmed him though he distinguished no word he hastily crossed the hall and flew into the banquetroom coming rapidly in at the foldingdoors he almost fell over his wife lying insensible half upon the floor and half upon the chair when he saw her pale and motionless a terrible misgiving seized him he fell on his knees mabel mabel cried he my love my innocent wife oh god what have i done perhaps it is the fatigueperhaps she has fainted no it is not the fatigue screamed a voice near him it was old james burdock who with his white hair streaming and his eye gleaming with fire shook his fist in his masters faceno it is not the fatigue you villain it is you who have killed her with your jezebels and harlots you scoundrel send the women here james for gods sake cried mr vane not even noticing the insult he had received from a servant he stamped furiously and cried for help the whole household was round her in a moment they carried her to bed the remorsestricken man his own knees trembling under him flew in an agony of fear and selfreproach for a doctor a doctor chapter xiii during the garden scene mr vane had begged mrs woffington to let him accompany her she peremptorily refused and said in the same breath she was going to triplet in hercules buildings to have her portrait finished had mr vane understood the sex he would not have interpreted her refusal to the letter when there was a postscript the meaning of which was so little enigmatical some three hours after the scene we have described mrs woffington sat in triplets apartment and triplet palette in hand painted away upon her portrait mrs woffington was in that languid state which comes to women after their hearts have received a blow she felt as if life was ended and but the dregs of existence remained but at times a flood of bitterness rolled over her and she resigned all hope of perfect happiness in this worldall hope of loving and respecting the same creature and at these moments she had but one ideato use her own power and bind her lover to her by chains never to be broken and to close her eyes and glide down the precipice of the future i think you are master of this art said she very languidly to triplet you paint so rapidly yes madam said triplet gloomily and painted on confound this shadow added he and painted on his soul too was clouded mrs woffington yawning in his face had told him she had invited all mr vanes company to come and praise his work and ever since that he had been morne et silencieux you are fortunate continued mrs woffington not caring what she said it is so difficult to make execution keep pace with conception yes maam and he painted on you are satisfied with it anything but maam and he painted on cheerful soulthen i presume it is like not a bit maam and he painted on mrs woffington stretched you cant yawn maamyou cant yawn oh yes i can you are such good company and she stretched again i was just about to catch the turn of the lip remonstrated triplet well catch itit wont run away ill try maam a pleasant halfhour it will be for me when they all come here like cits at a shilling ordinaryeach for his cut at a sensitive goose that is as may be madam those critics flay us alive you should not hold so many doors open to censure no maam head a little more that way i suppose you cant sit quiet maamthen never mind this resignation was intended as a stinging reproach mr cibber with his sneering snuffbox mr quin with his humorous bludgeon mrs clive with her tongue mr snarl with his abuse and mr soaper with his praisearsenic in treacle i call it but there i deserve it all for look on this picture and on this meaning i am painted as well as my picture oh no no no but to turn from your face madamon which the lightning of expression plays continuallyto this stony detestable dead daubi couldand i will too imposture dead caricature of life and beauty take that and he dashed his paletteknife through the canvas libelous lie against nature and mrs woffington take that and he stabbed the canvas again then with sudden humility i beg your pardon maam said he for this apparent outrage which i trust you will set down to the excitement attendant upon failure the fact is i am an incapable ass and no painter others have often hinted as much but i never observed it myself till now right through my pet dimple said mrs woffington with perfect nonchalance well now i suppose i may yawn or do what i like you may madam said triplet gravely i have forfeited what little control i had over you madam so they sat opposite each other in mournful silence at length the actress suddenly rose she struggled fiercely against her depression and vowed that melancholy should not benumb her spirits and her power he ought to have been here by this time said she to herself well i will not mope for him i must do something triplet said she madam nothing no madam she sat gently down again and leaned her head on her hand and thought she was beautiful as she thoughther body seemed bristling with mind at last her thoughtful gravity was illumined by a smile she had thought out something excogitaverat triplet the picture is quite ruined yes madam and a coachload of criticism coming triplet we actors and actresses have often bright ideas yes ma am when we take other peoples he he went triplet those are our best madam well sir i have got a bright idea you dont say so maam dont be a brute dear said the lady gravely triplet stared when i was in france taking lessons of dumesnil one of the actors of the theatre francais had his portrait painted by a rising artist the others were to come and see it they determined beforehand to mortify the painter and the sitter by abusing the work in good set terms but somehow this got wind and the patients resolved to be the physicians they put their heads together and contrived that the living face should be in the canvas surrounded by the accessories these of course were painted enter the actors who played their little prearranged farce and when they had each given the picture a slap the picture rose and laughed in their faces and discomfited them by the by the painter did not stop there he was not content with a short laugh he laughed at them five hundred years good gracious mrs woffington he painted a picture of the whole thing and as his work is immortal ours an april snowflake he has got tremendously the better of those rash little satirists well trip what is sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose so give me the sharpest knife in the house triplet gave her a knife and looked confused while she cut away the face of the picture and by dint of scraping cutting and measuring got her face two parts through the canvas she then made him take his brush and paint all round her face so that the transition might not be too abrupt several yards of green baize were also produced this was to be disposed behind the easel so as to conceal her triplet painted here and touched and retouched there while thus occupied he said in his calm resigned way it wont do madam i suppose you know that i know nothing was the reply life is a guess i dont think we could deceive roxalana and lucy this way because their eyes are without colored spectacles but when people have once begun to see by prejudices and judge by jargon what cant be done with them who knows do you i dont so let us try i beg your pardon madam my brush touched your face no offense sir i am used to that and i beg if you cant tone the rest of the picture up to me that you will instantly tone me down to the rest let us be in tune whatever it costs sir i will avail myself of the privilege madam but sparingly failure which is certain madam will cover us with disgrace nothing is certain in this life sir except that you are a goose it succeeded in france and england can match all europe for fools besides it will be well done they say davy garrick can turn his eyes into bottled gooseberries well peg woffington will turn hers into black currants havent you done i wonder they have not come make haste they will know by its beauty i never did it that is a sensible remark trip but i think they will rather argue backward that as you did it it cannot be beautiful and so cannot be me your reputation will be our shield well madam now you mention it they are like enough to take that ground they despise all i do if they did not you would despise them at this moment the pair were startled by the sound of a coach triplet turned as pale as ashes mrs woffington had her misgivings but not choosing to increase the difficulty she would not let triplet whose selfpossession she doubted see any sign of emotion in her lock the door said she firmly and dont be silly now hold up my green baize petticoat and let me be in a halflight now put that table and those chairs before me so that they cant come right up to me and triplet dont let them come within six yards if you can help it say it is unfinished and so must be seen from a focus a focus i dont know what you mean no more do i no more will they perhaps and if they dont they will swallow it directly unlock the door are they coming they are only at the first stair mr triplet your face is a book where one may read strange matters for heavens sake compose yourself let all the risk lie in one countenance look at me sir make your face like the book of daniel in a jews back parlor volto sciolto is your cue madam madam how your tongue goes i hear them on the stairs pray dont speak do you know what we are going to do continued the tormenting peggy we are going to weigh gooses feathers to criticise criticism trip hush hush a grampus was heard outside the door and triplet opened it there was quin leading the band have a care sir cried triplet there is a hiatus the third step from the door a gradus ad parnassum a wanting said mr cibber triplets heart sank the hole had been there six months and he had found nothing witty to say about it and at first sight mr cibber had done its business and on such men he and his portrait were to attempt a preposterous delusion then there was snarl who wrote critiques on painting and guided the national taste the unlucky exhibitor was in a cold sweat he led the way like a thief going to the gallows the picture being unfinished gentlemen said he must if you would do me justice be seen from aa focus must be judged from here i mean where sir said mr cibber about here sir if you please said poor triplet faintly it looks like a finished picture from here said mrs clive yes madam groaned triplet they all took up a position and triplet timidly raised his eyes along with the rest he was a little surprised the actress had flattened her face she had done all that could be done and more than he had conceived possible in the way of extracting life and the atmosphere of expression from her countenance she was dead still there was a pause triplet fluttered at last some of them spoke as follows soaper ah quin ho clive eh cibber humph these interjections are small on paper but as the good creatures uttered them they were eloquent there was a cheerful variety of dispraise skillfully thrown into each of them well continued soaper with his everlasting smile then the fun began may i be permitted to ask whose portrait this is said mr cibber slyly i distinctly told you it was to be peg woffingtons said mrs clive i think you might take my word do you act as truly as you paint said quin your fame runs no risk from me sir replied triplet it is not like peggys beauty eh rejoined quin i cant agree with you cried kitty clive i think it a very pretty face and not at all like peg woffingtons compare paint with paint said quin are you sure you ever saw down to peggys real face triplet had seen with alarm that mr snarl spoke not many satirical expressions crossed his face but he said nothing triplet gathered from this that he had at once detected the trick ah thought triplet he means to quiz them as well as expose me he is hanging back and in point of fact a mighty satirist like snarl would naturally choose to quiz six people rather than two now i call it beautiful said the traitor soaper so calm and reposeful no particular expression none whatever said snarl gentlemen said triplet does it never occur to you that the fine arts are tender violets and cannot blow when the north winds blow inserted quin are so cursed cutting continued triplet my good sir i am never cutting smirked soaper my dear snarl whined he give us the benefit of your practiced judgment do justice to this admirable work of art drawled the traitor i will said mr snarl and placed himself before the picture what on earth will he say thought triplet i can see by his face he has found us out mr snarl delivered a short critique mr snarls intelligence was not confined to his phrases all critics use intelligent phrases and philosophical truths but this gentlemans manner was very intelligent it was pleasant quiet assured and very convincing had the reader or i been there he would have carried us with him as he did his hearers and as his successors carry the public with them now your brush is by no means destitute of talent mr triplet said mr snarl but you are somewhat deficient at present in the great principles of your art the first of which is a loyal adherence to truth beauty itself is but one of the forms of truth and nature is our finite exponent of infinite truth his auditors gave him a marked attention they could not but acknowledge that men who go to the bottom of things like this should be the best instructors now in nature a womans face at this distanceay even at this short distancemelts into the air there is none of that sharpness but on the contrary a softness of outline he made a lorgnette of his two hands the others did so too and found they saw much betteroh ever so much better whereas yours resumed snarl is hard and forgive me rather teaboard like then your chiaro scuro my good sir is very defective for instance in nature the nose intercepting the light on one side the face throws of necessity a shadow under the eye caravaggio venetians generally and the bolognese masters do particular justice to this no such shade appears in this portrait tis so stop my vitals observed colley cibber and they all looked and having looked wagged their heads in assentas the fat white lords at christies waggle fifty pounds more out for a copy of rembrandt a brown levitical dutchman visible in the pitchdark by some sleight of sun newton had not wit to discover soaper dissented from the mass but my dear snarl if there are no shades there are lights loads of lights there are replied snarl only they are impossible that is all you have however concluded he with a manner slightly supercilious succeeded in the mechanical parts the hair and the dress are well mr triplet but your woffington is not a woman not nature they all nodded and waggled assent but this sagacious motion was arrested as by an earthquake the picture rang out in the voice of a clarion an answer that outlived the speaker shes a woman for she has taken four men in shes nature for a fluent dunce doesnt know her when he sees her imagine the tableau it was charming such opening of eyes and mouths cibber fell by second nature into an attitude of the old comedy and all were rooted where they stood with surprise and incipient mortification except quin who slapped his knee and took the trick at its value peg woffington slipped out of the green baize and coming round from the back of the late picture stood in person before them while they looked alternately at her and at the hole in the canvas she then came at each of them in turn more dramatico a pretty face and not like woffington i owe you two kate clive who ever saw peggys real face look at it now if you can without blushing mr quin quin a goodhumored fellow took the wisest view of his predicament and burst into a hearty laugh for all this said mr snarl peevishly i maintain upon the unalterable principles of art at this they all burst into a roar not sorry to shift the ridicule goths cried snarl fiercely goodmorning ladies and gentlemen cried mr snarl avec intention i have a criticism to write of last nights performance the laugh died away to a quaver i shall sit on your pictures one day mr brush dont sit on them with your head downward or youll addle them said mr brush fiercely this was the first time triplet had ever answered a foe mrs woffington gave him an eloquent glance of encouragement he nodded his head in infantine exultation at what he had done come soaper said mr snarl mr soaper lingered one moment to say you shall always have my good word mr triplet i will tryand not deserve it mr soaper was the prompt reply serve em right said mr cibber as soon as the door had closed upon them for a couple of serpents or rather one boaconstrictor soaper slavers for snarl to crush but we were all a little too hard on triplet here and if he will accept my apology why sir said triplet half trembling but driven on by looks from mrs woffington cibbers apology is found to be a trifle wearisome confound his impertinence cried the astounded laureate come along jemmy oh sir said quin goodhumoredly we must give a joke and take a joke and when he paints my portraitwhich he shall do the bear from hockley hole shall sit for the head curse his impudence roared quin im at your service mr cibber added he in huge dudgeon away went the two old boys mighty well said waspish mrs clive i did intend you should have painted mrs clive but after this impertinence you will continue to do it yourself maam this was triplets hour of triumph his exultation was undignified and such as is said to precede a fall he inquired gravely of mrs woffington whether he had or had not shown a spirit whether he had or had not fired into each a parting shot as they sheered off to repair which it might be advisable for them to put into friendly ports tremendous was the reply and when snarl and soaper sit on your next play they wont forget the lesson you have given them ill be sworn they wont chuckled triplet but reconsidering her words he looked blank and muttered then perhaps it would have been more prudent to let them alone incalculably more prudent was the reply then why did you set me on madam said triplet reproachfully because i wanted amusement and my head ached was the cool answer somewhat languidly given i defy the coxcombs cried triplet with reviving spirit but real criticism i respect honor and bow to such as yours madam or such as that sweet ladys at mr vanes would have been or in fact anybodys who appreciates me oh madam i wanted to ask you was it not strange your not being at mr vanes after all today i was at mr vanes triplet you were why i came with my verses and she said you were not there i will go fetch the verses no no who said i was not there did i not tell you the charming young lady who helped me with her own hand to everything on the table what wine that gentleman possesses was it a young lady triplet not more than twoandtwenty i should say in a travelingdress i could not see her dress madam for her beautybrown hair blue eyes charming in conversation ah what did she tell you she told me madamahem well what did you tell her and what did she answer i told her that i came with verses for you ordered by mr vane that he admired you i descanted madam on your virtues which had made him your slave go on said mrs woffington encouraging him with a deceitful smile tell me all you told her that you were sitting to me for your portrait the destination of which was not doubtful that i lived at hercules buildings you told that lady all this i give my honor she was so kind i opened my heart to her but tell me now madam said triplet joyously dancing round the woffington volcano do you know this charming lady yes i congratulate you madam an acquaintance worthy even of you and there are not many such who is she madam continued triplet lively with curiosity mrs vane was the quiet grim answer mrs vane his mother noam i mad his sister oh i see his his wife his wife why then mr vanes married yes oh look thereoh look here now well but good heavens she wasnt to know you were there perhaps no but then i let the cat out of the bag yes but good gracious there will be some serious mischief no doubt of it and it is all my fault yes ive played the deuce with their married happiness probably and ten to one if you are not incensed against me too mrs woffington replied by looking him in the face and turning her back upon him she walked hastily to the window threw it open and looked out of it leaving poor triplet to very unpleasant reflections she was so angry with him she dared not trust herself to speak just my luck thought he i had a patron and a benefactress i have betrayed them both suddenly an idea struck him madam said he timorously see what these fine gentlemen are what business had he with a wife at home to come and fall in love with you i do it forever in my playsi am obligedthey would be so dull else but in real life to do it is abominable you forget sir replied mrs woffington without moving that i am an actressa plaything for the impertinence of puppies and the treachery of hypocrites fool to think there was an honest man in the world and that he had shone on me with these words she turned and triplet was shocked to see the change in her face she was pale and her black lowering brows were gloomy and terrible she walked like a tigress to and fro and triplet dared not speak to her indeed she seemed but half conscious of his presence he went for nobody with her how little we know the people we eat and go to church and flirt with triplet had imagined this creature an incarnation of gayety a sportive being the daughter of smiles the bride of mirth needed but a look at her now to see that her heart was a volcano her bosom a boiling gulf of fiery lava she walked like some wild creature she flung her hands up to heaven with a passionate despair before which the feeble spirit of her companion shrank and cowered and with quivering lips and blazing eyes she burst into a torrent of passionate bitterness but who is margaret woffington she cried that she should pretend to honest love or feel insulted by the proffer of a stolen regard and what have we to do with homes or hearts or firesides have we not the playhouse its paste diamonds its paste feelings and the loud applause of fops and sotsheartsbeneath loads of tinsel and paint nonsense the love that can go with souls to heavensuch love for us nonsense these men applaud us cajole us swear to us flatter us and yet forsooth we would have them respect us too my dear benefactress said triplet they are not worthy of you i thought this man was not all dross from the first i never felt his passion an insult oh triplet i could have loved this manreally loved him and i longed so to be good oh god oh god thank heaven you dont love him cried triplet hastily thank heaven for that love him love a man who comes to me with a silly secondhand affection from his insipid babyface and offers me half or twothirds or a third of his worthless heart i hate him and her and all the world that is what i call a very proper feeling said poor triplet with a weak attempt to soothe her then break with him at once and all will be well break with him are you mad no since he plays with the tools of my trade i shall fool him worse than he has me i will feed his passion full tempt him torture him play with him as the angler plays a fish upon his hook and when his very life depends on me then by degrees he shall see me cool and cool and freeze into bitter aversion then he shall rue the hour he fought with the devil against my soul and played false with a brain and heart like mine but his poor wife you will have pity on her his wife are wives hearts the only hearts that throb and burn and break his wife must defend herself it is not from me that mercy can come to her nor from her to me i loathe her and i shall not forget that you took her part only if you are her friend take my advice dont you assist her i shall defeat her without that let her fight her battle and i mine ah madam she cannot fight she is a dove you are a fool what do you know about women you were with her five minutes and she turned you inside out my life on it while i have been fooling my time here she is in the field with all the arts of our sex simplicity at the head of them triplet was making a futile endeavor to convert her to his view of her rival when a knock suddenly came to his door a slovenly girl one of his own neighbors brought him a bit of paper with a line written in pencil tis from a lady who waits below said the girl mrs woffington went again to the window and there she saw getting out of a coach and attended by james burdock mabel vane who had sent up her name on the back of an old letter what shall i do said triplet as soon as he recovered the first stunning effects of this contretemps to his astonishment mrs woffington bade the girl show the lady upstairs the girl went down on this errand but you are here remonstrated triplet oh to be sure you can go into the other room there is plenty of time to avoid her said triplet in a very natural tremor this way madam mrs woffington stood in the middle of the room like a statue what does she come here for said she sternly you have not told me all i dont know cried poor triplet in dismay and i think the devil brings her here to confound me for heavens sake retire what will become of us all there will be murder i know there will to his horror mrs woffington would not move you are on her side said she slowly with a concentration of spite and suspicion she looked frightful at this moment all the better for me added she with a world of female malignity triplet could not make head against this blow he gasped and pointed piteously to the inner door no i will know two things the course she means to take and the terms you two are upon by this time mrs vanes light foot was heard on the stair and triplet sank into a chair they will tear one another to pieces said he a tap came to the door he looked fearfully round for the woman whom jealousy had so speedily turned from an angel to a fiend and saw with dismay that she had actually had the hardihood to slip round and enter the picture again she had not quite arranged herself when her rival knocked triplet dragged himself to the door before he opened it he looked fearfully over his shoulder and received a glance of cool bitter deadly hostility that boded ill both for him and his visitor triplets apprehensions were not unreasonable his benefactress and this sweet lady were rivals jealousy is a dreadful passion it makes us tigers the jealous always thirst for blood at any moment when reason is a little weaker than usual they are ready to kill the thing they hate or the thing they love any open collision between these ladies would scatter ill consequences all round under such circumstances we are pretty sure to say or do something wicked silly or unreasonable but what tortured triplet more than anything was his own particular notion that fate doomed him to witness a formal encounter between these two women and of course an encounter of such a nature as we in our day illustrate by kilkenny cats to be sure mrs vane had appeared a dove but doves can peck on certain occasions and no doubt she had a spirit at bottom her coming to him proved it and had not the other been a dove all the morning and afternoon yet jealousy had turned her to a fiend before his eyes then if which was not probable no collision took place what a situation was his mrs woffington his buckler from starvation suspected him and would distort every word that came from mrs vanes lips triplets situation was in fact that of aeneas in the storm olim et haec meminisse juvabit but while present such things dont please any one a bit it was the sort of situation we can laugh at and see the fun of it six months after if not shipwrecked on it at the time with a ghastly smile the poor quaking hypocrite welcomed mrs vane and professed a world of innocent delight that she had so honored his humble roof she interrupted his compliments and begged him to see whether she was followed by a gentleman in a cloak triplet looked out of the window sir charles pomander gasped he sir charles was at the very door if however he had intended to mount the stairs he changed his mind for he suddenly went off round the corner with a businesslike air real or fictitious he is gone madam said triplet mrs vane the better to escape detection or observation wore a thick mantle and a hood that concealed her features of these triplet debarrassed her sit down madam and he hastily drew a chair so that her back was to the picture she was pale and trembled a little she hid her face in her hands a moment then recovering her courage she begged mr triplet to pardon her for coming to him he had inspired her with confidence she said he had offered her his services and so she had come to him for she had no other friend to aid her in her sore distress she might have added that with the tact of her sex she had read triplet to the bottom and came to him as she would to a benevolent muscular old woman triplets natural impulse was to repeat most warmly his offers of service he did so and then conscious of the picture had a misgiving dear mr triplet began mrs vane you know this person mrs woffington yes madam replied triplet lowering his eyes i am honored by her acquaintance you will take me to the theater where she acts yes madam to the boxes i presume no oh no how could i bear that to the place where the actors and actresses are triplet demurred this would be courting that very collision the dread of which even now oppressed him at the first faint sign of resistance she began to supplicate him as if he was some great stern tyrant oh you must not you cannot refuse me you do not know what i risk to obtain this i have risen from my bed to come to you i have a fire here she pressed her hand to her brow oh take me to her madam i will do anything for you but be advised trust to my knowledge of human nature what you require is madness gracious heavens you two are rivals and when rivals meet theres murder or deadly mischief ah if you knew my sorrow you would not thwart me oh mr triplet little did i think you were as cruel as the rest so then this cruel monster whimpered out that he should do any folly she insisted upon good kind mr triplet said mrs vane let me look in your face yes i see you are honest and true i will tell you all then she poured in his ear her simple tale unadorned and touching as judahs speech to joseph she told him how she loved her husband how he had loved her how happy they were for the first six months how her heart sank when he left her how he had promised she should join him and on that hope she lived but for two months he had ceased to speak of this and i grew heartsick waiting for the summons that never came at last i felt i should die if i did not see him so i plucked up courage and wrote that i must come to him he did not forbid me so i left our country home oh sir i cannot make you know how my heart burned to be by his side i counted the hours of the journey i counted the miles at last i reached his house i found a gay company there i was a little sorry but i said his friends shall be welcome right welcome he has asked them to welcome his wife poor thing muttered triplet oh mr triplet they were there to do honor to and the wife was neither expected nor desired there lay my letters with their seals unbroken i know all his letters by heart mr triplet the seals unbrokenunbroken mr triplet it is abominable cried triplet fiercely and she who sat in my seatin his house and in his heartwas this lady the actress you so praised to me that lady maam said triplet has been deceived as well as you i am convinced of it said mabel and it is my painful duty to tell you madam that with all her talents and sweetness she has a fiery temper yes a very fiery temper continued triplet stoutly though with an uneasy glance in a certain direction and i have reason to believe she is angry and thinks more of her own illusage than yours dont you go near her trust to my knowledge of the sex madam i am a dramatic writer did you ever read the rival queens no i thought not well madam one stabs the other and the one that is stabbed says things to the other that are more biting than steel the prudent course for you is to keep apart and be always cheerful and welcome him with a smileandhave you read the way to keep him no mr triplet said mabel firmly i cannot feign were i to attempt talent and deceit i should be weaker than i am now honesty and right are all my strength i will cry to her for justice and mercy and if i cry in vain i shall die mr triplet that is all dont cry dear lady said triplet in a broken voice it is impossible cried she suddenly i am not learned but i can read faces i always could and so could my aunt deborah before me i read you right mr triplet and i have read her too did not my heart warm to her among them all there is a heart at the bottom of all her acting and that heart is good and noble she is madam she is and charitable too i know a family she saved from starvation and despair oh yes she has a heartto feel for the poor at all events and am i not the poorest of the poor cried mrs vane i have no father nor mother mr triplet my husband is all i have in the worldall i had i mean triplet deeply affected himself stole a look at mrs woffington she was pale but her face was composed into a sort of dogged obstinacy he was disgusted with her madam said he sternly there is a wild beast more cruel and savage than wolves and bears it is called a rival and dont you get in its way at this moment in spite of triplets precaution mrs vane casting her eye accidentally round caught sight of the picture and instantly started up crying she is there triplet was thunderstruck what likeness cried she and moved toward the supposed picture dont go to it cried triplet aghast the color is wet she stopped but her eye and her very soul dwelt upon the supposed picture and triplet stood quaking how like it seems to breathe you are a great painter sir a glass is not truer triplet hardly knowing what he said muttered something about critics and lights and shades then they are blind cried mabel never for a moment removing her eye from the object tell me not of lights and shades the pictures i see have a look of paint but yours looks like life oh that she were here as this wonderful image of hers is i would speak to her i am not wise or learned but orators never pleaded as i would plead to her for my ernests heart still her eye glanced upon the picture and i suppose her heart realized an actual presence though her judgment did not for by some irresistible impulse she sank slowly down and stretched her clasped hands toward it while sobs and words seemed to break direct from her bursting heart oh yes you are beautiful you are gifted and the eyes of thousands wait upon your very word and look what wonder that he ardent refined and genial should lay his heart at your feet and i have nothing but my love to make him love me i cannot take him from you oh be generous to the weak oh give him back to me what is one heart more to you you are so rich and i am so poor that without his love i have nothing and can do nothing but sit me down and cry till my heart breaks give him back to me beautiful terrible woman for with all your gifts you cannot love him as his poor mabel does and i will love you longer perhaps than men can love i will kiss your feet and heaven above will bless you and i will bless you and pray for you to my dying day ah it is alive i am frightened i am frightened she ran to triplet and seized his arm no cried she quivering close to him im not frightened for it was for me sheoh mrs woffington and hiding her face on mr triplets shoulder she blushed and wept and trembled what was it had betrayed mrs woffington a tear during the whole of this interview which had taken a turn so unlooked for by the listener she might have said with beatrice what fire is in mine ears and what selfreproach and chill misgiving in her heart too she had passed through a hundred emotions as the young innocent wife told her sad and simple story but anxious now above all things to escape without being recognizedfor she had long repented having listened at all or placed herself in her present positionshe fiercely mastered her countenance but though she ruled her features she could not rule her heart and when the young wife instead of inveighing against her came to her as a supplicant with faith in her goodness and sobbed to her for pity a big tear rolled down her cheek and proved her something more than a picture or an actress mrs vane as we have related screamed and ran to triplet mrs woffington came instantly from her frame and stood before them in a despairing attitude with one hand upon her brow for a single moment her impulse was to fly from the apartment so ashamed was she of having listened and of meeting her rival in this way but she conquered this feeling and as soon as she saw mrs vane too had recovered some composure she said to triplet in a low but firm voice leave us sir no living creature must hear what i say to this lady triplet remonstrated but mrs vane said faintly oh yes good mr triplet i would rather you left me triplet full of misgivings was obliged to retire be composed ladies said he piteously neither of you could help it and so he entered his inner room where he sat and listened nervously for he could not shake off all apprehension of a personal encounter in the room he had left there was a long uneasy silence both ladies were greatly embarrassed it was the actress who spoke first all trace of emotion except a certain pallor was driven from her face she spoke with very marked courtesy but in tones that seemed to freeze as they dropped one by one from her mouth i trust madam you will do me the justice to believe i did not know mr vane was married i am sure of it said mabel warmly i feel you are as good as you are gifted mrs vane i am not said the other almost sternly you are deceived then heaven have mercy on me no i am not deceived you pitied me you speak coldly now but i know your face and your heartyou pity me i do respect admire and pity you said mrs woffington sadly and i could consent nevermore to communicate with yourwith mr vane ah cried mabel heaven will bless you but will you give me back his heart how can i do that said mrs woffington uneasily she had not bargained for this the magnet can repel as well as attract can you not break your own spell what will his presence be to me if his heart remain behind you ask much of me alas i do but i could do even this she paused for breath and perhaps if you who have not only touched my heart but won my respect were to say to me do so i should do it again she paused and spoke with difficulty for the bitter struggle took away her breath mr vane thinks better of me than i deserve i haveonlyto make him believe meworthlessworse than i amand he will drop me like an adderand love you better far betterfor having knownadmiredand despised margaret woffington oh cried mabel i shall bless you every hour of my life her countenance brightened into rapture at the picture and mrs woffingtons darkened with bitterness as she watched her but mabel reflected rob you of your good name said this pure creature ah mabel vane you think but of yourself i thank you madam said mrs woffington a little touched by this unexpected trait but some one must suffer here and mabel vane interrupted her this would be cruel and base said she firmly no womans forehead shall be soiled by me oh madam beauty is admired talent is adored but virtue is a womans crown with it the poor are rich without it the rich are poor it walks through life upright and never hides its head for high or low her face was as the face of an angel now and the actress conquered by her beauty and her goodness actually bowed her head and gently kissed the hand of the country wife whom she had quizzed a few hours ago frailty paid this homage to virtue mabel vane hardly noticed it her eye was lifted to heaven and her heart was gone there for help in a sore struggle this would be to assassinate you no less and so madam she sighed with gods help i do refuse your offer choosing rather if needs be to live desolate but innocentmany a better than i hath lived soay if god wills it to die with my hopes and my heart crushed but my hands unstained for so my humble life has passed how beautiful great and pure goodness is it paints heaven on the face that has it it wakens the sleeping souls that meet it at the bottom of margaret woffingtons heart lay a soul unknown to the world scarce known to herselfa heavenly harp on which ill airs of passion had been playedbut still it was there in tune with all that is true pure really great and good and now the flush that a great heart sends to the brow to herald great actions came to her cheek and brow humble she cried such as you are the diamonds of our race you angel of truth and goodness you have conquered oh yes yes thank god yes what a fiend i must be could i injure you the poor heart we have both overrated shall be yours again and yours for ever in my hands it is painted glass in the luster of a love like yours it may become a priceless jewel she turned her head away and pondered a moment then suddenly offered to mrs vane her hand with nobleness and majesty can you trust me the actress too was divinely beautiful now for her good angel shone through her i could trust you with my life was the reply ah if i might call you friend dear lady what would i not dosufferresignto be worthy that title no not friend cried the warm innocent mabel sister i will call you sister i have no sister sister said mrs woffington oh do not mock me alas you do not know what you say that sacred name to me from lips so pure as yours mrs vane said she timidly would you think me presumptuous if i begged you toto let me kiss you the words were scarce spoken before mrs vanes arms were wreathed round her neck and that innocent cheek laid sweetly to hers mrs woffington strained her to her bosom and two great hearts whose grandeur the world worshiper of charlatans never discovered had found each other out and beat against each other a great heart is as quick to find another out as the world is slow mrs woffington burst into a passion of tears and clasped mabel tighter and tighter in a halfdespairing way mabel mistook the cause but she kissed her tears away dear sister said she be comforted i love you my heart warmed to you the first moment i saw you a womans love and gratitude are something ah you will never find me change this is for life look you god grant it cried the other poor woman oh it is not that it is not that it is because i am so little worthy of this it is a sin to deceive you i am not good like you you do not know me you do not know yourself if you say so cried mabel and to her hearer the words seemed to come from heaven i read faces said mabel i read yours at sight and you are what i set you down and nobody must breathe a word against you not even yourself do you think i am blind you are beautiful you are good you are my sister and i love you heaven forgive me thought the other how can i resign this angels good opinion surely heaven sends this blessed dew to my parched heart and now she burned to make good her promise and earn this virtuous wifes love she folded her once more in her arms and then taking her by the hand led her tenderly into triplets inner room she made her lie down on the bed and placed pillows high for her like a mother and leaned over her as she lay and pressed her lips gently to her forehead her fertile brain had already digested a plan but she had resolved that this pure and candid soul should take no lessons of deceit lie there said she till i open the door then join us do you know what i am going to do i am not going to restore you your husbands heart but to show you it never really left you you read faces well i read circumstances matters are not as you thought said she with all a womans tact i cannot explain but you will see she then gave mrs triplet peremptory orders not to let her charge rise from the bed until the preconcerted signal mrs vane was in fact so exhausted by all she had gone through that she was in no condition to resist she cast a look of childlike confidence upon her rival and then closed her eyes and tried not to tremble all over and listen like a frightened hare it is one great characteristic of genius to do great things with little things paxton could see that so small a matter as a greenhouse could be dilated into a crystal palace and with two common materialsglass and ironhe raised the palace of the genii the brightest idea and the noblest ornament added to europe in this centurythe kohinoor of the west livys definition of archimedes goes on the same ground peg woffington was a genius in her way on entering triplets studio her eye fell upon three triflesmrs vanes hood and mantle the back of an old letter and mr triplet it will be seen how she worked these slight materials on the letter was written in pencil simply these two words mabel vane mrs woffington wrote above these words two more alone and unprotected she put this into mr triplets hand and bade him take it down stairs and give it sir charles pomander whose retreat she knew must have been fictitious you will find him round the corner said she or in some shop that looks this way while uttering these words she had put on mrs vanes hood and mantle no answer was returned and no triplet went out of the door she turned and there he was kneeling on both knees close under her bid me jump out of that window madam bid me kill those two gentlemen and i will not rebel you are a great lady a talented lady you have been insulted and no doubt blood will flow it oughtit is your due but that innocent lady do not compromise her oh mr triplet you need not kneel to me i do not wish to force you to render me a service i have no right to dictate to you oh dear cried triplet dont talk in that way i owe you my life but i think of your own peace of mind for you are not one to be happy if you injure the innocent he rose suddenly and cried madam promise me not to stir till i come back where are you going to bring the husband to his wifes feet and so save one angel from despair and another angel from a great crime well i suppose you are wiser than i said she but if you are in earnest you had better be quick for somehow i am rather changeable about these people you cant help that madam it is your sex you are an angel may i be permitted to kiss your hand you are all goodness and gentleness at bottom i fly to mr vane and we will be back before you have time to repent and give the devil the upper hand again my dear good sweet lady away flew triplet all unconscious that he was not mrs woffingtons opponent but puppet he ran he tore animated by a good action and spurred by the notion that he was in direct competition with the fiend for the possession of his benefactress he had no sooner turned the corner than mrs woffington looking out of the window observed sir charles pomander on the watch as she had expected she remained at the window with mrs vanes hood on until sir charless eye in its wanderings lighted on her and then dropping mrs vanes letter from the window she hastily withdrew sir charles eagerly picked it up his eye brightened when he read the short contents with a selfsatisfied smile he mounted the stair he found in triplets house a lady who seemed startled at her late hardihood she sat with her back to the door her hood drawn tightly down and wore an air of trembling consciousness sir charles smiled again he knew the sex at least he said so it is an assertion often ventured upon accordingly sir charles determined to come down from his height and court nature and innocence in their own tones this he rightly judged must be the proper course to take with mrs vane he fell down with mock ardor upon one knee the supposed mrs vane gave a little squeak dear mrs vane cried he be not alarmed loveliness neglected and simplicity deceived insure respect as well as adoration ah a sigh oh get up sir do please ah a sigh you sigh sweetest of human creatures ah why did not a nature like yours fall into hands that would have cherished it as it deserves had heaven bestowed on me this hand which i take oh please sir with the profoundest respect would i have abandoned such a treasure for an actressa woffington as artificial and hollow a jade as ever winked at a side box is she sir notorious madam your husband is the only man in london who does not see through her how different are you even i who have no taste for actresses found myself revived refreshed ameliorated by that engaging picture of innocence and virtue you drew this morning yourself the bright and central figure ah dear angel i remember all your favorites and envy them their place in your recollections your barbary mare hen sir of course i meant hen and gray gillian his old nurse no no no she is the mare sir he he he so she is and damedame best ah i knew it you see how i remember them all and all carry me back to those innocent days which fleet too soondays when an angel like you might have weaned me from the wicked pleasures of the town to the placid delights of a rural existence alas sir you sigh it is not yet too late i am a convert to you i swear it on this white hand ah how can i relinquish it pretty fluttering prisoner oh please stay a while no please sir while i fetter thee with a worthy manacle sir charles slipped a diamond ring of great value upon his pretty prisoner la sir how pretty cried innocence sir charles then undertook to prove that the luster of the ring was faint compared with that of the present wearers eyes this did not suit innocence she hung her head and fluttered and showed a bashful repugnance to look her admirer in the face sir charles playfully insisted and mrs woffington was beginning to be a little at a loss when suddenly voices were heard upon the stairs my husband cried the false mrs vane and in a moment she rose and darted into triplets inner apartment mr vane and mr triplet were talking earnestly as they came up the stair it seems the wise triplet had prepared a little dramatic scene for his own refreshment as well as for the ultimate benefit of all parties he had persuaded mr vane to accompany him by warm mysterious promises of a happy denouement and now having conducted that gentleman as far as his door he was heard to say and now sir you shall see one who waits to forget grief suspicionall in your arms behold and here he flung the door open the devil you flatter me said pomander who had had time to recover his aplomb somewhat shaken at first by mr vanes inopportune arrival now it is to be observed that mr vane had not long ago seen his wife lying on her bed to all appearance incapable of motion mr vane before triplet could recover his surprise inquired of pomander why he had sent for him and what added he is the grief suspicion i am according to mr triplet to forget in your arms mr vane added this last sentence in rather a testy manner why the fact is began sir charles without the remotest idea of what the fact was going to be that sir charles pomander interrupted triplet but mr triplet is going to explain said sir charles keenly nay sir be yours the pleasing duty but now i think of it resumed triplet why not tell the simple truth it is not a play she i brought you here to see was not sir charles pomander but i forbid you to complete the name cried pomander i command you to complete the name cried vane gentlemen gentlemen how can i do both remonstrated triplet enough sir cried pomander it is a ladys secret i am the guardian of that ladys honor she has chosen a strange guardian of her honor said vane bitterly gentlemen cried poor triplet who did not at all like the turn things were taking i give you my word she does not even know of sir chariess presence here who cried vane furiously man alive who are you speaking of mrs vane my wife cried vane trembling with anger and jealousy she here and with this man no cried triplet with me with me not with him of course boaster cried vane contemptuously but that is a part of your profession pomander irritated scornfully drew from his pocket the ladies joint production which had fallen at his feet from mrs woffingtons hand he presented this to mr vane who took it very uneasily a mist swam before his eyes as he read the words alone and unprotectedmabel vane he had no sooner read these words than he found he loved his wife when he tampered with his treasure he did not calculate on another seeking it this was pomanders hour of triumph he proceeded coolly to explain to mr vane that mrs woffington having deserted him for mr vane and mr vane his wife for mrs woffington the bereaved parties had according to custom agreed to console each other this soothing little speech was interrupted by mr vanes sword flashing suddenly out of its sheath while that gentleman white with rage and jealousy bade him instantly take to his guard or be run through the body like some noxious animal sir charles drew his sword and in spite of triplets weak interference half a dozen passes were rapidly exchanged when suddenly the door of the inner room opened and a lady in a hood pronounced in a voice which was an excellent imitation of mrs vanes the word false the combatants lowered their points you hear sir cried triplet you see sir said pomander mabelwife cried mr vane in agony oh say this is not true oh say that letter is a forgery say at least it was by some treachery you were lured to this den of iniquity oh speak the lady silently beckoned to some person inside you know i loved youyou know how bitterly i repent the infatuation that brought me to the feet of another the lady replied not though vanes soul appeared to hang upon her answer but she threw the door open and there appeared another lady the real mrs vane mrs woffington then threw off her hood and to sir charles pomanders consternation revealed the features of that ingenious person who seemed born to outwit him you heard that fervent declaration madam said she to mrs vane i present to you madam a gentleman who regrets that he mistook the real direction of his feelings and to you sir continued she with great dignity i present a lady who will never mistake either her feelings or her duty ernest dear ernest cried mrs vane blushing as if she was the culprit and she came forward all love and tenderness her truant husband kneeled at her feet of course no he said rather sternly how came you here mabel mrs vane said the actress fancied you had mislaid that weathercock your heart in covent garden and that an actress had seen in it a fit companion for her own and had feloniously appropriated it she came to me to inquire after it but this letter signed by you said vane still addressing mabel was written by me on a paper which accidentally contained mrs vanes name the fact is mr vanei can hardly look you in the facei had a little wager with sir charles here his diamond ringwhich you may see has become my diamond ringa horrible wry face from sir charlesagainst my left glove that i could bewitch a country gentlemans imagination and make him think me an angel unfortunately the owner of his heart appeared and like poor mr vane took our play for earnest it became necessary to disabuse her and to open your eyes have i done so you have madam said vane wincing at each word she said but at last by a mighty effort he mastered himself and coming to mrs woffington with a quivering lip he held out his hand suddenly in a very manly way i have been the dupe of my own vanity said he and i thank you for this lesson poor mrs woffingtons fortitude had wellnigh left her at this mabel he cried is this humiliation any punishment for my folly any guaranty for my repentance can you forgive me it is all forgiven ernest but oh you are mistaken she glided to mrs woffington what do we not owe you sister whispered she nothing that word pays all was the reply she then slipped her address into mrs vanes hand and courtesying to all the company she hastily left the room sir charles pomander followed but he was not quick enough she got a start and purposely avoided him and for three days neither the public nor private friends saw this poor womans face mr and mrs vane prepared to go also but mrs vane would thank good mr triplet and mrs triplet for their kindness to her triplet the benevolent blushed was confused and delighted but suddenly turning somewhat sorrowful he said mr vane madam made use of an expression which caused a momentary pang he called this a den of iniquity now this is my studio but never mind mr vane asked his pardon for so absurd an error and the pair left triplet in all the enjoyment which does come now and then to an honest man whether this dirty little world will or not a coach was called and they went home to bloomsbury few words were said but the repentant husband often silently pressed this angel to his bosom and the tears which found their way to her beautiful eyelashes were tears of joy this weakish and consequently villainous though not illdisposed person would have gone down to willoughby that night but his wife had great good sense she would not take her husband off like a schoolboy caught out of bounds she begged him to stay while she made certain purchases but for all that her heart burned to be at home so in less than a week after the events we have related they left london meantime every day mrs vane paid a quiet visit to mrs woffington for some days the actress admitted no other visitor and was with her but two hours before she left london on that occasion she found her very sad i shall never see you again in this world said she but i beg of you to write to me that my mind may be in contact with yours she then asked mabel in her halfsorrowful halfbitter way how many months it would be ere she was forgotten mabel answered by quietly crying so then they embraced and mabel assured her friend she was not one of those who change their minds it is for life dear sister it is for life cried she swear this to me said the other almost sternly but no i have more confidence in that candid face and pure nature than in a human beings oath if you are happy remember you owe me something if you are unhappy come to me and i will love you as men cannot love then vows passed between them for a singular tie bound these two women and then the actress showed a part at least of her sore heart to her new sister and that sister was surprised and grieved and pitied her truly and deeply and they wept on each others neck and at last they were fain to part they parted and true it was they never met again in this world they parted in sorrow but when they meet again it shall be with joy women are generally such faithless unscrupulous and pitiless humbugs in their dealings with their own sexwhich whatever they may say they despise at heartthat i am happy to be able to say mrs vane proved true as steel she was a nobleminded simpleminded creature she was also a constant creature constancy is a rare a beautiful a godlike virtue four times every year she wrote a long letter to mrs woffington and twice a year in the cold weather she sent her a hamper of country delicacies that would have victualed a small garrison and when her sister left this earthly scenea humble pious longrepentant christianmrs vane wore mourning for her and sorrowed over her but not as those who cannot hope to meet again my story as a work of artgood bad or indifferentends with that last sentence if a reader accompanies me further i shall feel flattered and he does so at his own risk my reader knows that all this befell long ago that woffington is gay and triplet sad no more that mabels and all the bright eyes of that day have long been dim and all its cunning voices hushed judge then whether i am one of those happy storytellers who can end with a wedding no this story must wind up as yours and mine musttomorrowor tomorrowor tomorrow when our little sand is run sir charles pomander lived a man of pleasure until sixty he then became a man of pain he dragged the chain about eight years and died miserably mr cibber not so much died as slipped his winda nautical expression that conveys the idea of an easy exit he went off quiet and genteel he was past eighty and had lived fast his servant called him at seven in the morning i will shave at eight said mr cibber john brought the hot water at eight but his master had taken advantage of this interval in his toilet to dieto avoid shaving snarl and soaper conducted the criticism of their day with credit and respectability until a good old age and died placidly a natural death like twaddle sweet or sour the triplets while their patroness lived did pretty well she got a tragedy of his accepted at her theater she made him send her a copy and with her scissors cut out about half sometimes thinning sometimes cutting bodily away but lo the inherent vanity of mr triplet came out strong submissively but obstinately he fought for the discarded beauties unluckily he did this one day that his patroness was in one of her bitter humors so she instantly gave him back his manuscript with a sweet smile owned herself inferior in judgment to him and left him unmolested triplet breathed freely a weight was taken off him the savage steel he applied this title to the actresss scissors had spared his purpurei panni he was played pure and intact a calamity the rest of us grumbling escape but it did so happen that the audience were of the actresss mind and found the words too exuberant and the business of the play too scanty in proportion at last their patience was so sorely tried that they supplied one striking incident to a piece deficient in facts they gave the manager the usual broad hint and in the middle of triplets third act a huge veil of green baize descended upon the jealous spaniard failing here mrs woffington contrived often to befriend him in his other arts and moreover she often sent mr triplet what she called a snug investment a loan of ten pounds to be repaid at doomsday with interest and compound interest according to the scriptures and although she laughed she secretly believed she was to get her ten pounds back double and treble and i believe so too some years later mrs triplet became eventful she fell ill and lay a dying but one fine morning after all hope had been given up she suddenly rose and dressed herself she was quite well in body now but insane she continued in this state a month and then by gods mercy she recovered her reason but now the disease fell another step and lighted upon her tempera more athletic vixen was not to be found she had spoiled triplet for this by being too tame so when the dispensation came they sparred daily they were now thoroughly unhappy they were poor as ever and their benefactress was dead and they had learned to snap a speculative tour had taken this pair to bristol then the second city in england they sojourned in the suburbs one morning the postman brought a letter for triplet who was showing his landlords boy how to plant onions n btriplet had never planted an onion but he was one of your a priori gentlemen and could show anybody how to do anything triplet held out his hand for the letter but the postman held out his hand for a half crown first trips profession had transpired and his clothes inspired diffidence triplet appealed to his good feeling he replied with exultation that he had none left a middleaged postman no doubt triplet then suddenly started from entreaty to king cambyses vein in vain mrs triplet came down and essayed the blandishments of the softer sex in vain and as there were no assets the postman marched off down the road mrs triplet glided after him like an assassin beckoning on triplet who followed doubtful of her designs suddenly truth compels me to relate this she seized the obdurate official from behind pinned both his arms to his side and with her nose furiously telegraphed her husband he animated by her example plunged upon the man and tore the letter from his hand and opened it before his eyes it happened to be a very windy morning and when he opened the letter an inclosure printed on much finer paper was caught into the air and went down the wind triplet followed in kangaroo leaps like a dancer making a flying exit the postman cried on all good citizens for help some collected and laughed at him mrs triplet explaining that they were poor and could not pay half a crown for the freight of half an ounce of paper she held him convulsively until triplet reappeared that gentleman on his return was ostentatiously calm and dignified you are or were in perturbation about half a crown said he there sir is a twentypound note oblige me with nineteen pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence should your resources be unequal to such a demand meet me at the green cat and brown frogs after dinner when you shall receive your halfcrown and drink another upon the occasion of my sudden accession to unbounded affluence the postman was staggered by the sentence and overawed by the note and chose the cat and frogs and liquid halfcrown triplet took his wife down the road and showed her the letter and inclosure the letter ran thus sirwe beg respectfully to inform you that our late friend and client james triplet merchant of the minories died last august without a will and that you are his heir his property amounts to about twenty thousand pounds besides some reversions having possessed the confidence of your late uncle we should feel honored and gratified if you should think us worthy to act professionally for yourself we inclose twenty pounds and beg you will draw upon us as far as five thousand pounds should you have immediate occasion we are sir your humble servants james and john allmitt it was some time before these children of misfortune could realize this enormous stroke of compensation but at last it worked its way into their spirits and they began to sing to triumph and dance upon the kings highway mrs triplet was the first to pause and take better views oh james she cried we have suffered much we have been poor but honest and the almighty has looked upon us at last then they began to reproach themselves oh james i have been a peevish womanan ill wife to you this many years no no cried triplet with tears in his eyes it is i who have been rough and brutal poverty tried us too hard but we were not like the rest of themwe were always faithful to the altar and the almighty has seen us though we often doubted it i never doubted that james so then the poor things fell on their knees upon the public road and thanked god if any man had seen them he would have said they were mad yet madder things are done every day by gentlemen with faces as grave as the parish bulls and then they rose and formed their little plans triplet was for devoting fourfifths to charity and living like a prince on the remainder but mrs triplet thought the poor were entitled to no more than twothirds and they themselves ought to bask in a third to make up for what they had gone through and then suddenly she sighed and burst into tears lucy lucy sobbed she yes reader god had taken little lucy and her mother cried to think all this wealth and comfort had come too late for her darling child do not cry lucy is richer a thousand times than you are with your twenty thousand pounds their good resolutions were carried out for a wonder triplet lived for years the benefactor of all the loose fish that swim in and round theaters and indeed the unfortunate seldom appealed to him in vain he now predominated over the arts instead of climbing them in his latter day he became an oracle as far as the science of acting was concerned and what is far more rare he really got to know something about it this was owing to two circumstances first he ceased to run blindfold in a groove behind the scenes second he became a frequenter of the first row of the pit and that is where the whole critic and twothirds of the true actor is made on one point to his dying day his feelings guided his judgment he never could see an actress equal to his woffington mrs abington was grace personified but so was woffington said the old man and abingtons voice is thin woffingtons was sweet and mellow when jordan rose with her voice of honey her dewy freshness and her heavenly laugh that melted in along with her words like the gold in the quartz triplet was obliged to own her the goddess of beautiful gayety but still he had the last word woffington was all she is except her figure woffington was a hebe your nell jordan is little better than a dowdy triplet almost reached the present century he passed through great events but they did not excite him his eye was upon the arts when napoleon drew his conquering sword on england triplets remark was now we shall be driven upon native talent thank heaven the storms of europe shook not triplet the fact is nothing that happened on the great stage of the world seemed real to him he believed in nothing where there was no curtain visible but even the grotesque are not good in vain many an eye was wet round his dying bed and many a tear fell upon his grave he made his final exit in the year of grace and i who laugh at him would leave this world today to be with him for i am tossing at seahe is in port a straightforward character like mabels becomes a firm character with years long ere she was forty her hand gently but steadily ruled willoughby house and all in it she and mr vane lived very happily he gave her no fresh cause for uneasiness six months after their return she told him what burned in that honest heart of hers the truth about mrs woffington the water rushed to his eyes but his heart was now wholly his wifes and gratitude to mrs woffington for her noble conduct was the only sentiment awakened you must repay her dearest said he i know you love her and until today it gave me pain now it gives me pleasure we owe her much the happy innocent life of mabel vane is soon summed up frank as the day constant as the sun pure as the dew she passed the golden years preparing herself and others for a still brighter eternity at home it was she who warmed and cheered the house and the hearth more than all christmas fires abroad she shone upon the poor like the sun she led her beloved husband by the hand to heaven she led her children the same road and she was leading her grandchildren when the angel of death came for her and she slept in peace many remember her for she alone of all our tale lived in this present century but they speak of her as old madam vaneher whom we knew so young and fresh she lies in willoughby churchher mortal part her spirit is with the spirits of our mothers and sisters reader that are gone before us with the tender mothers the chaste wives the loyal friends and the just women of all ages resurget i come to her last who went first but i could not have stayed by the others when once i had laid my darling asleep it seemed for a while as if the events of our tale did her harm but it was not so in the end not many years afterward she was engaged by mr sheridan at a very heavy salary and went to dublin here the little girl who had often carried a pitcher on her head down to the liffey and had played polly peachum in a booth became a lion dramatic political and literary and the center of the wit of that wittiest of cities but the dublin ladies and she did not coalesce they said she was a naughty woman and not fit for them morally she said they had but two topics silks and scandal and were unfit for her intellectually this was the saddest part of her history but it is darkest just before sunrise she returned to london not long after it so happened that she went to a small church in the city one sunday afternoon the preacher was such as we have often heard but not so this poor woman in her day of sapless theology ere john wesley waked the snoring church instead of sending a dry clatter of morality about their ears or evaporating the bible in the thin generalities of the pulpit this man drove gods truths home to the hearts of men and women in his hands the divine virtues were thunderbolts not swans down with good sense plain speaking and a heart yearning for the souls of his brethren and his sisters he stormed the bosoms of many and this afternoon as he reasoned like paul of righteousness temperance and judgment to come sinners trembledand margaret woffington was of those who trembled after this day she came ever to the narrow street where shone this house of god and still new light burst upon her heart and conscience here she learned why she was unhappy here she learned how alone she could be happy here she learned to know herself and the moment she knew herself she abhorred herself and repented in dust and ashes this strong and straightforward character made no attempt to reconcile two things that an average christian would have continued to reconcile her interest fell in a moment before her new sense of right she flung her profession from her like a poisonous weed long before this mrs vane had begged her to leave the stage she had replied that it was to her what wine is to weak stomachs but added she do not fear that i will ever crawl down hill and unravel my own reputation nor will i ever do as i have seen othersstand groaning at the wing to go on giggling and come off gasping no the first night the boards do not spring beneath my feet and the pulse of the public beat under my hand i am gone next day at rehearsal instead of woffington a note will come to tell the manager that henceforth woffington is herselfat twickenham or richmond or harrowonthehill far from his dust his din and his glarequiet till god takes her amid grass and flowers and charitable deeds this day had not come it was in the zenith of her charms and her fame that she went home one night after a play and never entered a theater by the front door or back door again she declined all leavetaking and ceremony when a publican shuts up shop and ceases to diffuse liquid poison he does not invite the world to put up the shutters neither will i actors overrate themselves ridiculously added she i am not of that importance to the world nor the world to me i fling away a dirty old glove instead of soiling my fingers filling it with more guineas and the world loses in me what another old glove full of words half of them idle the rest wicked untrue silly or impure rougissons taisonsnous et partons she now changed her residence and withdrew politely from her old associates courting two classes only the good and the poor she had always supported her mother and sister but now charity became her system the following is characteristic a gentleman who had greatly admired this dashing actress met one day in the suburbs a lady in an old black silk gown and a gray shawl with a large basket on her arm she showed him its contentsworsted stockings of prodigious thicknesswhich she was carrying to some of her proteges but surely that is a waste of your valuable time remonstrated her admirer much better buy them but my good soul replied the representative of sir harry wildair you cant buy them nobody in this wretched town can knit worsted hose except woffington conversions like this are open to just suspicion and some did not fail to confound her with certain great sinners who have turned austere selfdeceivers when sin smiled no more but this was mere conjecture the facts were clear and speaking to the contrary this woman left folly at its brightest and did not become austere on the contrary though she laughed less she was observed to smile far oftener than before she was a humble and penitent but cheerful hopeful christian another class of detractors took a somewhat opposite ground they accused her of bigotry for advising a young female friend against the stage as a business but let us hear herself this is what she said to the girl at the bottom of my heart i always loved and honored virtue yet the tendencies of the stage so completely overcame my good sentiments that i was for years a worthless woman it is a situation of uncommon and incessant temptation ask yourself my child whether there is nothing else you can do but this it is i think our duty and our wisdom to fly temptation whenever we can as it is to resist it when we cannot escape it was this the tone of bigotry easy in fortune penitent but cheerful mrs woffington had now but one careto efface the memory of her former self and to give as many years to purity and piety as had gone to folly and frailty this was not to be the almighty did not permit or perhaps i should say did not require this some unpleasant symptoms had long attracted her notice but in the bustle of her profession had received little attention she was now persuaded by her own medical attendant to consult dr bowdler who had a great reputation and had been years ago an acquaintance and an admirer he visited her he examined her by means little used in that day and he saw at once that her days were numbered dr bowdlers profession and experience had not steeled his heart as they generally do and must do he could not tell her this sad news so he asked her for pen and paper and said i will write a prescription to mr he then wrote not a prescription but a few lines begging mr to convey the cruel intelligence by degrees and with care and tenderness it is all we can do for her said he he looked so grave while writing the supposed prescription that it unluckily occurred to mrs woffington to look over him she stole archly behind him and with a smile on her faceread her death warrant it was a cruel stroke a gasping sigh broke from her at this dr bowdler looked up and to his horror saw the sweet face he had doomed to the tomb looking earnestly and anxiously at him and very pale and grave he was shocked and strange to say she whose deathwarrant he had signed ran and brought him a glass of wine for he was quite overcome then she gave him her hand in her own sweet way and bade him not grieve for her for she was not afraid to die and had long learned that life is a walking shadow a poor poor player who frets and struts his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more but no sooner was the doctor gone than she wept bitterly poor soul she had set her heart upon living as many years to god as she had to the world and she had hoped to wipe out her former self alas she said to her sister i have done more harm than i can ever hope to good now and my long life of folly and wickedness will be rememberedwill be what they call famous my short life of repentance who will know or heed or take to profit but she soon ceased to repine she bowed to the will of heaven and set her house in order and awaited her summons the tranquillity of her life and her courageous spirit were unfavorable to the progress of disease and i am glad to say she was permitted to live nearly three years after this and these three years were the happiest period of her whole life works of piety and love made the days eventful she was at home nowshe had never been at home in folly and loose living all her bitterness was gone now with its cause reader it was with her as it is with many an autumn day clouds darken the sun rain and wind sweep over alltill day declines but then comes one heavenly hour when all ill things seem spent there is no more wind no more rain the great sun comes forthnot fiery bright indeed but full of tranquil glory and warms the sky with ruby waves and the hearts of men with hope as parting with us for a little space he glides slowly and peacefully to rest so fared it with this humble penitent and now happy christian a part of her desire was given her she lived long enough to read a firm recantation of her former self to show the world a great repentance and to leave upon indelible record one more proof what alone is true wisdom and where alone true joys are to be found she endured some physical pain as all must who die in their prime but this never wrung a sigh from her great heart and within she had the peace of god which passes all understanding i am not strong enough to follow her to her last hour nor is it needed enough that her own words came true when the great summons came it found her full of hope and peace and joy sojourning not dwelling upon earth far from dust and din and vice the bible in her hand the cross in her heart quiet amid grass and flowers and charitable deeds non omnem morituram
