a womanhater by charles reade italics are indicated by the underscore character accent marks are indicated by a single quote after the vowel for acute accents and before the vowel for grave accents other accent marks are ignored chapter i the golden star homburg was a humble hotel not used by gay gamblers but by modest travelers at two oclock one fine day in june there were two strangers in the salle a manger seated at small tables a long way apart and wholly absorbed in their own business one was a lady about twentyfour years old who in the present repose of her features looked comely sedate and womanly but not the remarkable person she really was her forehead high and white but a little broader than sculptors affect her long hair coiled tight in a great many smooth snakes upon her snowy nape was almost flaxen yet her eyebrows and long lashes not pale but a reddish brown her gray eyes large and profound her mouth rather large beautifully shaped amiable and expressive but full of resolution her chin a little broad her neck and hands admirably white and polished she was an anglodaneher father english if you ask me what she was doing whyhunting and had been for some days in all the inns of homburg she had the visitors book and was going through the names of the whole year and studying each to see whether it looked real or assumed interspersed were flippant comments and verses adapted to draw a smile of amusement or contempt but this hunter passed them all over as nullities the steady pose of her head the glint of her deep eye and the set of her fine lips showed a soul not to be diverted from its object the traveler at her back had a map of the district and blank telegrams one of which he filled in every now and then and scribbled a hasty letter to the same address he was a sharpfaced middleaged man of business joseph ashmead operatic and theatrical agentat his wits end a female singer at the homburg opera had fallen really ill he was commissioned to replace her and had only thirty hours to do it in so he was hunting a singer what the lady was hunting can never be known unless she should choose to reveal it karl the waiter felt bound to rouse these abstracted guests and stimulate their appetites he affected therefore to look on them as people who had not yet breakfasted and tripped up to mr ashmead with a bill of fare rather scanty the busiest englishman can eat and ashmead had no objection to snatch a mouthful he gave his order in german with an english accent but the lady when appealed to said softly in pure german i will wait for the tabledhote the tabledhote it wants four hours to that the lady looked karl full in the face and said slowly and very distinctly then iwillwaitfourhours these simple words articulated firmly and in a contralto voice of singular volume and sweetness sent karl skipping but their effect on mr ashmead was more remarkable he started up from his chair with an exclamation and bent his eyes eagerly on the melodious speaker he could only see her back hair and her figure but apparently this quickeared gentleman had also quick eyes for he said aloud in english her hair tooit must be and he came hurriedly toward her she caught a word or two and turned and saw him ah said she and rose but the points of her fingers still rested on the book it is cried ashmead it is yes mr ashmead said the lady coloring a little but in pure english and with a composure not easily disturbed it is ina klosking what a pleasure cried ashmead and what a surprise ah madam i never hoped to see you again when i heard you had left the munich opera so sudden i said there goes one more bright star quenched forever and you to desert usyou the risingest singer in germany mr ashmead you cant deny it you know you were the lady thus made her own judge seemed to reflect a moment and said i was a wellgrounded musician thanks to my parents i was a very hardworking singer and i had the advantage of being supported in my early career by a gentleman of judgment and spirit who was a manager at first and brought me forward afterward a popular agent and talked managers into a good opinion of me ah madam said ashmead tenderly it is a great pleasure to hear this from you and spoken with that mellow voice which would charm a rattlesnake but what would my zeal and devotion have availed if you had not been a born singer whyyes said ina thoughtfully i was a singer but she seemed to say this not as a thing to be proud of but only because it happened to be true and indeed it was a peculiarity of this woman that she appeared nearly always to thinkif but for half a momentbefore she spoke and to say things whether about herself or others only because they were the truth the reader who shall condescend to bear this in mind will possess some little clew to the color and effect of her words as spoken often where they seem simple and commonplaceon paper they were weighty by their extraordinary air of truthfulness as well as by the deep music of her mellow belllike voice oh you do admit that said mr ashmead with a chuckle then why jump off the ladder so near the top oh of course i knowthe old storybut you might give twentytwo hours to love and still spare a couple to music that seems a reasonable division said ina naively but apologetically he was jealous jealousmore shame for him im sure no lady in public life was ever more discreet no no he was only jealous of the public and what had the poor public done absorbed me he said why he could take you to the opera and take you home from the opera and during the opera he could make one of the public and applaud you as loud as the best yes but rehearsalsandembracing the tenor well but only on the stage oh mr ashmead where else does one embrace the tenor and was that a grievance why id embrace fifty tenorsif i was paid proportionable yes but he said i embraced one poor stick with a fervoran abandonwell i dare say i did for if they had put a gatepost in the middle of the stage and it was in my part to embrace the thing i should have done it honestly for love of my art and not of a post the next time i had to embrace the poor stick it was all i could do not to pinch him savagely and turn him to a countertenormake him squeak ina klosking smiled for the first time ashmead too chuckled at his own wit but turned suddenly grave the next moment and moralized he pronounced it desirable for the interests of mankind that a great and rising singer should not love out of the business outsiders were wrongheaded and absurd and did not understand the true artist however having discoursed for some time in this strain he began to fear it might be unpalatable to her so he stopped abruptly and said but therewhat is done is done we must make the best of it and you mustnt think i meant to run him down he loves you in his way he must be a noble fellow or he never could have won such a heart as yours he wont be jealous of an old fellow like me though i love you too in my humdrum way and always did you must do me the honor to present me to him at once ina stared at him but said nothing oh continued ashmead i shall be busy till evening but i will ask him and you to dine with me at the kursaal and then adjourn to the royal box you are a queen of song and that is where you and he shall sit and nowhere else ina klosking was changing color all this time and cast a grateful but troubled look on him my kind old faithful friend said she then shook her head no we are not to dine with you nor sit together at the opera in homburg ashmead looked a little chagrined so be it he said dryly but at least introduce me to him ill try and overcome his prejudices it is not even in my power to do that oh i see im not good enough for him said ashmead bitterly you do yourself injustice and him too said ina courteously well then my friend said she deprecatingly he is not here not here that is odd well then you will be dull till he comes back come without him at all events to the opera she turned her tortured eyes away i have not the heart this made ashmead look at her more attentively why what is the matter said he you are in trouble i declare you are trembling and your eyes are filling my poor ladyin heavens name what is the matter hush said ina not so loud then she looked him in the face a little while blushed hesitated faltered and at last laid one white hand upon her bosom that was beginning to heave and said with patient dignity my old friendiamdeserted ashmead looked at her with amazement and incredulity deserted said he faintly youdeserted yes said she deserted but perhaps not forever her noble eyes filled to the brim and two tears stood ready to run over why the man must be an idiot shouted ashmead hush not so loud that waiter is listening let me come to your table she came and sat down at his table and he sat opposite her they looked at each other he waited for her to speak with all her fortitude her voice faltered under the eye of sympathy you are my old friend she said ill try and tell you all but she could not all in a moment and the two tears trickled over and ran down her cheeks ashmead saw them and burst out the villainthe villain no no said she do not call him that i could not bear it believe me he is no villain then she dried her eyes and said resolutely if i am to tell you you must not apply harsh words to him they would close my mouth at once and close my heart i wont say a word said ashmead submissively so tell me all ina reflected a moment and then told her tale dealing now with longer sentences she betrayed her foreign half being alone so long said she has made me reflect more than in all my life before and i now understand many things that at the time i could not he to whom i have given my love and resigned the art in which i was advancingwith your assistanceis by nature impetuous and inconstant he was born so and i the opposite his love for me was too violent to last forever in any man and it soon cooled in him because he is inconstant by nature he was jealous of the public he must have all my heart and all my time and so he wore his own passion out then his great restlessness having now no chain became too strong for our happiness he pined for change as some wanderers pine for a fixed home is it not strange i a child of the theater am at heart domestic he a gentleman and a scholar born bred and fitted to adorn the best society is by nature a bohemian one word is there another woman no not that i know of heaven forbid said ina but there is something very dreadful there is gambling he has a passion for it and i fear i wearied him by my remonstrances he dragged me about from one gamblingplace to another and i saw that if i resisted he would go without me he lost a fortune while we were together and i do really believe he is ruined poor dear ashmead suppressed all signs of illtemper and asked grimly did he quarrel with you then oh no he never said an unkind word to me and i was not always so forbearing for i passed months of torment i saw that affection which was my all gliding gradually away from me and the tortured will cry out i am not an ungoverned woman but sometimes the agony was intolerable and i complained well that agony i long for it back for now i am desolate poor soul how could a man have the heart to leave you how could he have the face oh he did not do it shamelessly he left me for a week to visit friends in england but he wrote to me from london he had left me at berlin he said that he did not like to tell me before parting but i must not expect to see him for six weeks and he desired me to go to my mother in denmark he would send his next letter to me there ah he knew i should need my mother when his second letter came he had planned it all that the blow might not kill me he wrote to tell me he was a ruined man and he was too proud to let me support him he begged my pardon for his love for his desertion for ever having crossed my brilliant path like a dark cloud he praised me he thanked me he blessed me but he left me it was a beautiful letter but it was the deathwarrant of my heart i was abandoned ashmead started up and walked very briskly with a great appearance of business requiring vast dispatch to the other end of the salle and there being out of inas hearing he spoke his mind to a candlestick with three branches dn him heartless sentimental scoundrel dn him dn him having relieved his mind with this pious ejaculation he returned to ina at a reasonable pace and much relieved and was now enabled to say cheerfully let us take a business view of it he is gonegone of his own accord give him your blessingi have given him mineand forget him forget him never while i live is that your advice oh mr ashmead and the moment i saw your friendly face i said to myself i am no longer alone here is one that will help me and so i will you may be sure of that said ashmead eagerly what is the business the business is to find him that is the first thing but he is in england oh no that was eight months ago he could not stay eight months in any country besides there are no gamblinghouses there and have you been eight months searching europe for this madman no at first pride and anger were strong and i said here i stay till he comes back to me and to his senses brava yes but month after month went by carrying away my pride and my anger and leaving my affection undiminished at last i could bear it no longer so as he would not come to his senses you took leave of yours and came out on a wildgoose chase said ashmead but too regretfully to affront her it was said ina i feel it but it is not one now because i have you to assist me with your experience and ability you will find him for me somehow or other i know you will let a woman have ever so little guile she must have tact if she is a true woman now tact if its etymology is to be trusted implies a fine sense and power of touch so in virtue of her sex she pats a horse before she rides him and a man before she drives him there ladies there is an indictment in two counts traverse either of them if you can joseph ashmead thus delicately but effectually manipulated swelled with gratified vanity and said you are quite right you cant do this sort of thing yourself you want an agent of course i do well you have got one now let me seefifty to one he is not at homburg at all if he is he most likely stays at frankfort he is a swell is he not swell said the anglodane puzzled not that i am aware of she was strictly on her guard against vituperation of her beloved scamp pooh pooh said ashmead of course he is and not the sort to lodge in homburg then behold my incompetence said ina but the place to look for him is the gamblingsaloon been there oh no then you must what me alone no with your agent oh my friend i said you would find him what a woman she will have it he is in homburg and suppose we do find him and you should not be welcome i shall not be unwelcome i shall be a change shall i tell you how to draw him to homburg wherever he is said ashmead very demurely yes tell me that and do me a good turn into the bargain is it possible can i be so fortunate yes and as you say it is a slice of luck to be able to kill two birds with one stone why considerthe way to recover a man is not to run after him but to make him run to you it is like catching moths you dont run out into the garden after them you light the candle and open the window and they do the restas he will yes yes but what am i to do for you asked ina getting a little uneasy and suspicious what didnt i tell you said ashmead with cool effrontery why only to sing for me in this little opera that is all and he put his hands in his pockets and awaited thunderclaps oh that is all is it said ina panting a little and turning two great reproachful eyes on him that is all said he stoutly why what attracted him at first wasnt it your singing the admiration of the public the bouquets and bravas what caught the moth once will catch it again moping wont and surely you will not refuse to draw him merely because you can pull me out of a fix into the bargain look here i have undertaken to find a singer by tomorrow night and what chance is there of my getting even a thirdrate one why the very hour i have spent so agreeably talking to you has diminished my chance oh said ina this is driving me into your net i own it said joseph cheerfully im quite unscrupulous because i know you will thank me afterward the very idea of going back to the stage makes me tremble said ina of course it does and those who tremble succeed in a long experience i never knew an instance to the contrary it is the conceited fools who feel safe that are in danger what is the part one you knowsiebel in faust with two new songs excuse me i do not know it why everybody knows it you mean everybody has heard it sung i know neither the music nor the words and i cannot sing incorrectly even for you oh you can master the airs in a day and the cackle in half an hour i am not so expeditious if you are serious get me the bookoh he calls the poets words the cackleand the music of the part directly and borrow me the score borrow you the score ah that shows the school you were bred in i gaze at you with admiration then please dont for we have not a moment to waste you have terrified me out of my senses fly yes but before i fly there is something to be settledsalary as much as they will give of course but give me a hint no no you will get me some money for i am poor i gave all my savings to my dear mother and settled her on a farm in dear old denmark but i really sing for you more than for homburg so make no difficulties above all do not discuss salary with me settle it and draw it for me and let me hear no more about that i am on thorns he soon found the director and told him excitedly there was a way out of his present difficulty ina klosking was in the town he had implored her to return to the opera she had refused at first but he had used all his influence with her and at last had obtained a half promise on conditionsa two months engagement certain parts which he specified out of his own head salary a hundred thalers per night and a half clear benefit on her last appearance the director demurred to the salary ashmead said he was mad she was the german alboni her low notes like a trumpet and the compass of a mezzosoprano besides the director yielded and drew up the engagement in duplicate ashmead then borrowed the music and came back to the inn triumphant he waved the agreement over his head then submitted it to her she glanced at it made a wry face and said two months i never dreamed of such a thing not worth your while to do it for less said ashmead come said he authoritatively you have got a good bargain every way so sign she lifted her head high and looked at him like a lioness at being ordered ashmead replied by putting the paper before her and giving her the pen she cast one more reproachful glance then signed like a lamb now said she turning fretful i want a piano you shall have one said he coaxingly he went to the landlord and inquired if there was a piano in the house yes there is one said he and it is mine said a sharp female voice may i beg the use of it no said the lady a tall bony spinster i cannot have it strummed on and put out of tune by everybody but this is not everybody the lady i want it for is a professional musician top of the tree the hardest strummers going but mademoiselle this lady is going to sing at the opera she must study she must have a piano but grimly she need not have mine then she must leave the hotel oh haughtily that is as she pleases ashmead went to ina klosking in a rage and told her all this and said he would take her to another hotel kept by a frenchman these germans were bears but ina klosking just shrugged her shoulders and said take me to her he did so and she said in german madam i can quite understand your reluctance to have your piano strummed but as your hotel is quiet and respectable and i am unwilling to leave it will you permit me to play to you and then you shall decide whether i am worthy to stay or not the spinster drank those mellow accents colored a little looked keenly at the speaker and after a moments reflection said half sullenly no madam you are polite i must risk my poor piano be pleased to come with me she then conducted them to a large unoccupied room on the firstfloor and unlocked the piano a very fine one and in perfect tune ina sat down and performed a composition then in vogue you play correctly madam said the spinster but your musicwhat stuff such things are null they vex the ear a little but they never reach the mind ashmead was wroth and could hardly contain himself but the klosking was amused and rather pleased mademoiselle has positive tastes in music said she all the better yes said the spinster most music is mere noise i hate and despise fortynine compositions out of fifty but the fiftieth i adore give me something simple with a little soul in itif you can ina klosking looked at her and observed her age and her dress the latter oldfashioned she said quietly will mademoiselle do me the honor to stand before me i will sing her a trifle my mother taught me the spinster complied and stood erect and stiff with her arms folded ina fixed her deep eyes on her playing a liquid prelude all the time then swelled her chest and sung the old venetian cauzonet il pescatore dell onda it is a small thing but there is no limit to the genius of song the klosking sung this trifle with a voice so grand sonorous and sweet and above all with such feeling taste and purity that somehow she transported her hearers to venetian waters moonlit and thrilled them to the heart while the great glass chandelier kept ringing very audibly so true massive and vibrating were her tones in that large empty room at the first verse that crossgrained spinster with real likes and dislikes put a bony hand quietly before her eyes at the last she made three strides as a soldier marches and fell all of a piece like a wooden mannequin on the singers neck take my piano she sobbed for you have taken the heart out of my body ina returned her embrace and did not conceal her pleasure i am very proud of such a conquest said she from that hour ina was the landladys pet the room and piano were made over to her and being in a great fright at what she had undertaken she studied and practiced her part night and day she made ashmead call a rehearsal next day and she came home from it wretched and almost hysterical she summoned her slave ashmead he stood before her with an air of hypocritical submission the flute was not at rehearsal sir said she severely nor the oboe nor the violoncello just like em said ashmead tranquilly the tenor is a quavering stick he is one of those who think that an unmanly trembling of the voice represents every manly passion their name is legion the soprano is insipid and they are all imperfectcontentedly imperfect how can people sing incorrectly it is like lying that is what makes it so commonhe he i do not desire wit but consolation i believe you are mephistopheles himself in disguise for ever since i signed that diabolical compact you made me i have been in a state of terror agitation misgiving and miseryand i thank and bless you for it for these thorns and nettles they lacerate me and make me live they break the dull lethargic agony of utter desolation then as her nerves were female nerves and her fortitude female fortitude she gave way for once and began to cry patiently ashmead the practical went softly away and left her as we must leave her for a time to battle her business with one hand and her sorrow with the other chapter ii in the hotel russie at frankfort there was a grand apartment lofty spacious and richly furnished with a broad balcony overlooking the platz and roofed so to speak with colored sunblinds which softened the glare of the rhineland sun to a rosy and mellow light in the veranda a tall english gentleman was leaning over the balcony smoking a cigar and being courted by a fair young lady her lightgray eyes dwelt on him in a way to magnetize a man and she purred pretty nothings at his ear in a soft tone she reserved for males her voice was clear loud and rather highpitched whenever she spoke to a person of her own sex a comely english blonde with pale eyelashes a keen sensible girl and not a downright wicked one only born artful this was fanny dover and the tall gentlemanwhose relation she was and whose wife she resolved to be in one year three years or ten according to his power of resistancewas harrington vizard a barfordshire squire with twelve thousand acres and a library as for fanny she had only two thousand pounds in all the world so compensating nature endowed her with a fair complexion gray mesmeric eyes art and resolutionqualities that often enable a poor girl to conquer landed estates with their male incumbrances beautiful and delicateon the surfaceas was miss dovers courtship of her first cousin once removed it did not strike fire it neither pleased nor annoyed him it fell as dead as a lantern firing on an iceberg not that he disliked her by any means but he was thirtytwo had seen the world and had been unlucky with women so he was now a divorce and a declared womanhater railed on them and kept them at armslength fanny dover included it was really comical to see with what perfect coolness and cynical apathy he parried the stealthy advances of this catlike girl a mistress in the art of pleasingwhen she chose inside the room on a couch of crimson velvet sat a young lady of rare and dazzling beauty her face was a long but perfect oval pure forehead straight nose with exquisite nostrils coral lips and ivory teeth but what first struck the beholder were her glorious dark eyes and magnificent eyebrows as black as jet her hair was really like a ravens darkpurple wing these beauties in a stern character might have inspired awe the more so as her form and limbs were grand and statuesque for her age but all was softened down to sweet womanhood by long silken lashes often lowered and a gracious face that blushed at a word blushed little blushed much blushed pinky blushed pink blushed roseate blushed rosy and i am sorry to say blushed crimson and even scarlet in the course of those events i am about to record as unblushing as turnip and cool as cucumber this scale of blushes arose not out of modesty alone but out of the wide range of her sensibility on hearing of a noble deed she blushed warm approbation at a worthy sentiment she blushed heartfelt sympathy if you said a thing at the fire that might hurt some person at the furthest window she would blush for fear it should be overheard and cause pain in short it was her peculiarity to blush readily for matters quite outside herself and to show the male observer if any the amazing sensibility apart from egotism that sometimes adorns a young highminded woman not yet hardened by the world this young lady was zoe vizard daughter of harringtons father by a greek mother who died when she was twelve years of age her mixed origin showed itself curiously in her figure and face she was all greek even to her hand which was molded divinely but as long and large as befitted her long grand antique arm but her mind was northernnot a grain of greek subtlety in it indeed she would have made a poor hand at dark deceit with a transparent face and eloquent blood that kept coursing from her heart to her cheeks and back again and painting her thoughts upon her countenance having installed herself with feminine instinct in a crimson couch that framed her to perfection zoe vizard was at work embroidering she had some flowers and their leaves lying near her on a little table and with colored silks chenille etc she imitated each flower and its leaf very adroitly without a pattern this was clever and indeed rather a rare talent but she lowered her head over this work with a demure beaming complacency embroidery alone never yet excited without external assistance accordingly on a large stool or little ottoman at her feet but at a respectful distance sat a young man almost her match in beauty though in quite another style in height about five feet ten broadshouldered cleanbuilt a model of strength agility and grace his face fair fresh and healthylooking his large eyes hazel the crisp curling hair on his shapely head a wonderful brown in the mass but with one thin streak of gold above the forehead and all the loose hairs glittering golden a short clipped mustache saved him from looking too feminine yet did not hide his expressive mouth he had white hands as soft and supple as a womans a mellow voice and a winning tongue this dangerous young gentleman was gazing softly on zoe vizard and purring in her ear and she was conscious of his gaze without looking at him and was sipping the honey and showed it by seeming more absorbed in her work than girls ever really are matters however had not gone openly very far she was still on her defense so after imbibing his flatteries demurely a long time she discovered all in one moment that they were objectionable dear me mr severne said she you do nothing but pay compliments how can i help it sitting here inquired he therethere said she then quietly does it never occur to you that only foolish people are pleased with flatteries i have heard that but i dont believe it i know it makes me awfully happy whenever you say a kind word of me that is far from proving your wisdom said zoe and instead of dwelling on my perfections which do not exist i wish you would tell me things what things how can i tell till i hear them well then things about yourself that is a poor subject let me be the judge oh there are lots of fellows who are always talking about themselves let me be an exception this answer puzzled zoe and she was silent and put on a cold look she was not accustomed to be refused anything reasonable severne examined her closely and saw he was expected to obey her he then resolved to prepare in a day or two an autobiography full of details that should satisfy zoes curiosity and win her admiration and her love but he could not do it all in a moment because his memory of his real life obstructed his fancy meantime he operated a diversion he said set a poor fellow an example tell me something about yourselfsince i have the bad taste and the presumption to be interested in you and cant help it did you spring from the foam of the archipelago or are you descended from bacchus and ariadne if you want sensible answers ask sensible questions said zoe trying to frown him down with her black brows but her sweet cheek would tint itself and her sweet mouth smile and expose much intercoral ivory well then said he i will ask you a prosaic question and i only hope you wont think it impertinent howeverdid such a strangely assorted party as yours come to travel together and if vizard has turned womanhater as he pretends how comes he to be at the head of a female party who are not all of them he hesitated go on mr severne not all of them what said zoe prepared to stand up for her sex not perfect that is a very cautious statement andthereyou are as slippery as an eel there is no getting hold of you well never mind i will set you an example of communicativeness and reveal this mystery hidden as yet from mankind speak dread queen thy servant heareth ha ha ha mr severne you amuse me you only interest me was the soft reply zoe blushed pink but turned it off then why do you not attend to my interesting narrative instead ofwell then it began with my asking the dear fellow to take me a tour especially to rome you wanted to see the statues of your ancestors and shame them much obliged i was not quite such a goose i wanted to see the tiber and the colosseum and trajans pillar and the tarpeian rock and the one everlasting city that binds ancient and modern history together she flashed her great eyes on him and he was dumb she had risen above the region of his ideas having silenced her commentator she returned to her story well dear harrington said yes directly so then i told fanny and she said oh do take me with you now of course i was only too glad to have fanny she is my relation and my friend happy girl be quiet please so i asked harrington to let me have fanny with us and you should have seen his face what he travel with a couple of us hei dont see why i should tell you what the monster said oh yes please do you wont go telling anybody else then not a living soul upon my honor well then he saidshe began to blush like a rosethat he looked on me as a mere female in embryo i had not yet developed the vices of my sex but fanny dover was a ripe flirt and she would set me flirting and how could he manage the pair in short sir he refused to take us and gave his reasons such as they were poor dear then i had to tell fanny then she began to cry and told me to go without her but i would not do that when i had once asked her then she clung round my neck and kissed me and begged me to be cross and sullen and tire out dear harrington that is like her how do you know said zoe sharply oh i have studied her character when pray said zoe ironically yet blushing a little because her secret meaning was you are always at my apron strings and have no time to fathom fanny when i have nothing better to dowhen you are out of the room well i shall be out of the room very soon if you say another word and serve me right too i am a fool to talk when you allow me to listen he is incorrigible said zoe pathetically well then i refused to pout at harrington it is not as if he had no reason to distrust women poor dear darling i invited fanny to stay a month with us and when once she was in the house she soon got over me and persuaded me to play sad and showed me how to do it so we wore long faces and sweet resignation and were never cross but kept turning tearful eyes upon our victim ha ha how absurd of vizard to tell you that two women would be too much for one man no it was the truth and girls are artful creatures especially when they put their heads together but hear the end of all our cunning one day after dinner harrington asked us to sit opposite him so we did and felt guilty he surveyed us in silence a little while and then he said my young friends you have played your little game pretty well especially you zoe that are a novice in the fine arts compared with miss dover histrionic talent ought to be rewarded he would relent and take us abroad on one condition there must be a chaperone all the better said we hypocrites eagerly and who oh a person equal to the occasionan old maid as bitter against men as ever grapes were sour she would follow us upstairs downstairs and into my ladys chamber she would have an eye at the keyhole by day and an ear by night when we went up to bed and talked over the events of our frivolous day in short he enumerated our duennas perfections till our blood ran cold and it was ever so long before he would tell us who it wasaunt maitland we screamed with surprise they are like cat and dog and never agree except to differ we sought an explanation of this strange choice he obliged us it was not for his gratification he took the old cat it was for us she would relieve him of a vast responsibility the vices of her character would prove too strong for the little faults of ours which were only volatility frivolity flirtationi will not tell you what he said i seem to hear harrington talking said severne what on earth makes him so hard upon women would you mind telling me that never ask me that question again said zoe with sudden gravity well i wont ill get it out of him if you say a word to him about it i shall be shocked and offended she was pale and red by turns but severne bowed his head with a respectful submission that disarmed her directly she turned her head away and severne watching her saw her eyes fill how is it said she thoughtfully and looking away from him that men leave out their sisters when they sum up womankind are not we women too my poor brother quite forgets he has one woman who will never never desert nor deceive him dear darling fellow and with these three last words she rose and kissed the tips of her fingers and waved the kiss to vizard with that free magnitude of gesture which belonged to antiquity it struck the anglosaxon flirt at her feet with amazement not having good enough under his skin to sympathize with that pious impulse he first stagnated a little while and then not to be silent altogether made his little stale commonplace comment on what she had told him why it is like a novel a very unromantic one replied zoe i dont know that i have read very interesting novels with fewer new characters than this theres a dark beauty and a fair and a duenna with an eagle eye and an aquiline nose hush said zoe that is her room and pointed to a chamber door that opened into the apartment oh marvelous female instinct the duenna in charge was at that moment behind that very door and her eye and her ear at the keyhole turn about severne continued his remarks but in a lower voice then theres a womanhater and a manhater good for dialogue now this banter did not please zoe so she fixed her eyes upon severne and said you forget the principal figurea mysterious young gentleman who looks nineteen and is twentynine and was lost sight of in england nine years ago he has been traveling ever since and whereever he went he flirted we gather so much from his accomplishment in the art fluent not to say voluble at times but no egotist for he never tells you anything about himself nor even about his family still less about the numerous affaires de coeur in which he has been engaged perhaps he is reserving it all for the third volume the attack was strong and sudden but it failed severne within the limits of his experience was a consummate artist and this situation was not new to him he cast one gently reproachful glance on her then lowered his eyes to the carpet and kept them there do you think said he in a low dejected voice it can be any pleasure to a man to relate the follies of an idle aimless life and to you who have given me higher aspirations and made me awfully sorry i cannot live my whole life over again i cant bear to think of the years i have wasted said he and how can i talk to you whom i reverence of the past follies i despise no pray dont ask me to risk your esteem it is so dear to me then this artist put in practice a little maneuver he had learned of compressing his muscles and forcing a little unwilling water into his eyes so at the end of his pretty little speech he raised two gentle imploring eyes with half a tear in each of them to be sure nature assisted his art for once he did bitterly regret but out of pure egotism the years he had wasted and wished with all his heart he had never known any woman but zoe vizard the combination of art and sincerity was too much for the guileless and inexperienced zoe she was grieved at the pain she had given and rose to retire for she felt they were both on dangerous ground but as she turned away she made a little deprecating gesture and said softly forgive me that soft tone gave severne courage and that gesture gave him an opportunity he seized her hand murmured angel of goodness and bestowed a long loving kiss on her hand that made it quiver under his lips oh cried miss maitland bursting into the room at the nick of time yet feigning amazement fanny heard the ejaculations and whipped away from harrington into the window zoe with no motive but her own coyness had already snatched her hand away from severne but both young ladies were one moment too late the eagle eye of a terrible old maid had embraced the entire situation and they saw it had harrington vizard esq smoked on with his back to the group but the rest were a picturethe mutinous face and keen eyes of fanny dover bristling with defense at the window zoe blushing crimson and newly started away from her tooenterprising wooer and the tall thin grim old maid standing stiff as sentinel at the bedroom door and gimleting both her charges alternately with steelgray orbs she seemed like an owl all eyes and beak when the chaperon had fixed the situation thoroughly she stalked erect into the room and said very expressively i am afraid i disturb you zoe from crimson blushed scarlet and hung her head but fanny was ready la aunt said she ironically and with pertness infinite you know you are always welcome where ever have you been all this time we were afraid we had lost you aunt fired her pistol in reply i was not far offmost fortunately zoe finding that even under crushing circumstances fanny had fight in her glided instantly to her side and aunt maitland opened battle all round may i ask sir said she to severne with a horrible smile what you were doing when i came in zoe clutched fanny and both awaited mr severnes reply for one moment with keen anxiety my dear miss maitland said that able young man very respectfully yet with a sort of cheerful readiness as if he were delighted at her deigning to question him to tell you the truth i was admiring miss vizards diamond ring fanny tittered zoe blushed again at such a fib and such aplomb oh indeed said miss maitland you were admiring it very close sir it is like herselfit will bear inspection this was wormwood to miss maitland even in our ashes live their wonted fires and though she was sixty she disliked to hear a young woman praised she bridled then returned to the attack next time you wish to inspect it you had better ask her to take it off and show you may i miss maitland inquired the ingenuous youth she would not think that a liberty his mild effrontery staggered her for a moment and she glared at him speechless but soon recovered and said bitterly evidently not with this she turned her back on him rather ungraciously and opened fire on her own sex zoe sharply yes aunt faintly tell your brotherif he can leave off smokingi wish to speak to him zoe hung her head and was in no hurry to bring about the proposed conference while she deliberated says fanny with vast alacrity ill tell him aunt oh fanny murmured zoe in a reproachful whisper all right whispered fanny in reply and whipped out on to the balcony heres aunt maitland wants to know if you ever leave off smoking and she threw a most aggressive manner into the query the big man replied composedly tell her i doat meals and prayers but i always sleep with a pipe in my mouthheavily insured well then you mustnt for she has something very particular to say to you when youve done smoking something particular that means something disagreeable tell her i shall be smoking all day today fanny danced into the room and said he says he shall be smoking all day under the circumstances miss maitland gave this faithful messenger the look of a basilisk and flounced to her own room the young ladies instantly stepped out on the balcony and got one on each side of harrington with the feminine instinct of propitiation for they felt sure the enemy would tell soon or late what does the old cat want to talk to me about said harrington lazily to fanny it was zoe who replied cant you guess dear said she tenderlyour misconduct then she put her head on his shoulder as much as to say but we have a more lenient judge here as if i could not see that without her assistance said harrington vizard puff at which comfortable reply zoe looked very rueful and fanny burst out laughing soon after this fanny gave zoe a look and they retired to their rooms and zoe said she would never come out again and fanny must stay with her fanny felt sure ennui would thaw that resolve in a few hours so she submitted but declared it was absurd and the very way to give a perfect trifle importance kiss your hand said she disdainfullythat is nothing if i was the man id have kissed both your cheeks long before this and i should have boxed your ears and made you cry said zoe with calm superiority so she had her way and the deserted severne felt dull but was too good a general to show it he bestowed his welcome company on mr vizard walked with him talked with him and made himself so agreeable that vizard who admired him greatly said to him what a good fellow you are to bestow your sunshine on me i began to be afraid those girls had got you and tied you to their apronstrings altogether oh no said severne they are charming but after all one cant do without a male friend there are so few things that interest ladies unless you can talk redhot religion you are bound to flirt with them a little to be sure they look shy if you do but if you dont they are bored whereas they only looked shy i know em call another subject please well i will but perhaps it may not be so agreeable a one that is very unlikely said the womanhater dryly well it is tin im rather short you see when i fell in with you at monaco i had no idea of coming this way but meeting with an old college friendwhat a tie college is isnt it there is nothing like it when you have been at college with a man you seem never to wear him out as you do the acquaintances you make afterward that is very true said vizard warmly isnt it now for instance if i had only known you of late years i should feel awfully shy of borrowing a few hundreds of youfor a month or two i dont know why you should old fellow i should though but having been at college together makes all the difference i dont mind telling you that i have never been at homburg without taking a turn at the table and i am grizzling awfully now at not having sent to my man of business for funds how much do you want that is the only question glad to hear it thought severne well let me see you cant back your luck with less than five hundred well but we have been out two months i am afraid i havent so much left just let me see he took out his pocketbook and examined his letter of credit do you want it today why yes i do well then i am afraid you can only have three hundred but i will telegraph herries and funds will be here tomorrow afternoon all right said severne vizard took him to the bank and exhausted his letter of credit then to the telegraphoffice and telegraphed herries to enlarge his credit at once he handed severne the three hundred pounds the young mans eye flashed and it cost him an effort not to snatch them and wave them over his head with joy but he controlled himself and took them like twopencehalfpenny thank you old fellow said he then still more carelessly like my i o u as you please said vizard with similar indifference only real after he had got the money severnes conversational powers relaxedshort answerslong reveries vizard observed stopped short and eyed him i remember something at oxford and i am afraid you are a gambler if you are you wont be good for much till you have lost that three hundred it will be a dull evening for me without you i know what ill doill take my henparty to the opera at homburg there are stalls to be got here ill get one for you on the chance of your dropping in the stalls were purchased and the friends returned at once to the hotel to give the ladies timely intimation they found fanny and zoe seated rather disconsolate in the apartment zoe had formally renounced at sight of the stall tickets the pair uttered joyful cries looked at each other and vanished you wont see them any more till dinnertime said vizard they will be discussing dress selecting dress trying dresses and changing dresses for the next three hours he turned round while speaking and there was severne slipping away to his own bedroom thus deserted on all sides he stepped into the balcony and lighted a cigar while he was smoking it he observed an english gentleman with a stalwart figure and a beautiful brown beard standing on the steps of the hotel halloo said he and hailed him hi uxmoor is that you lord uxmoor looked up and knew him he entered the hotel and the next minute the waiter ushered him into vizards sittingroom lord uxmoor like mr vizard was a landed proprietor in barfordshire the county is large and they lived too many miles apart to visit but they met and agreed at elections and county business and had a respect for each other meeting at frankfort these two found plenty to say to each other about home and as lord uxmoor was alone vizard asked him to dine you will balance us said he we are terribly overpetticoated and one of them is an old maid we generally dine at the tabledhote but i have ordered dinner here today we are going to the opera at homburg you are not obliged to do that you know you are in for a bad dinner that is all to tell the truth said lord uxmoor i dont care for music then you deserve a statue for not pretending to love it i adore it for my part and i wish i was going alone for my hens will be sure to cackle mal a propos and spoil some famous melody with talking about it and who sung it in london instead of listening to it and thanking god for it in deep silence lord uxmoor stared a little at this sudden sally for he was unacquainted with vizards one eccentricity having met him only on county business at which he was extra rational and passed for a great scholar he really did suck good books as well as cigars after a few more words they parted till dinnertime lord uxmoor came to his appointment and found his host and miss maitland whom he knew and he was in languid conversation with them when a sidedoor opened and in walked fanny dover fair and bright in cambridge blue her hair well dressed by zoes maid in the style of the day lord uxmoor rose and received his fair countrywoman with respectful zeal he had met her once before she too sparkled with pleasure at meeting a barfordshire squire with a long pedigree purse and beardthree things she admired greatly in the midst of this in glided zoe and seemed to extinguish everybody and even to pale the lights with her dark yet sunlike beauty she was dressed in a creamywhite satin that glinted like motherofpearl its sheen and glory unfrittered with a single idiotic trimming on her breast a large diamond cross her head was an athenian sculptureno chignon but the tight coils of antiquity at their side one diamond star sparkled vivid flame by its contrast with those polished ebon snakes lord uxmoor was dazzled transfixed at the vision and bowed very low when vizard introduced him in an offhand way saying my sister miss vizard but i dare say you have met her at the county balls i have never been so fortunate said uxmoor humbly i have said zoe that is i saw you waltzing with lady betty gore at the race ball two years ago what said vizard alarmed uxmoor were you waltzing with lady betty gore you have it on too high an authority for me to contradict finding zoe was to be trusted as a county chronicle vizard turned sharply to her and said and was he flirting with her zoe colored a little and said now harrington how can i tell you little hypocrite said vizard who can tell better at this retort zoe blushed high and the water came into her eyes nobody minded that but uxmoor and vizard went on to explain that lady betty gore is as heartless a coquette as any in the county and dont you flirt with her or you will get entangled you disapprove her said uxmoor coolly then i give her up forever he looked at zoe while he said this and felt how easy it would be to resign lady betty and a great many more for this peerless creature he did not mean her to understand what was passing in his mind he did not know how subtle and observant the most innocent girl is in such matters zoe blushed and drew away from him just then ned severne came in and vizard introduced him to uxmoor with great geniality and pride the charming young man was in a black surtout with a blue scarf the very tint for his complexion the girls looked at one another and in a moment fanny was elected zoes agent she signaled severne and when he came to her she said for zoe dont you know we are going to the opera at homburg yes i know said he and i hope you will have a pleasanter evening than i shall you are not coming with us no said he sorrowfully you had better said fanny with a deal of quiet point more indeed than zoes pride approved not if mr severne has something more attractive said she turning palish and pinkish by turns all this went on sotto voce and uxmoor out of goodbreeding entered into conversation with miss maitland and vizard severne availed himself of this diversion and fixed his eyes on zoe with an air of gentle reproach then took a letter out of his pocket and handed it to fanny she read it and gave it to zoe it was dated from the golden star homburg dear nedi am worse today and all alone now and then i almost fear i may not pull through but perhaps that is through being so hipped do come and spend this evening with me like a good kind fellow telegraph reply s t poor fellow said ned my heart bleeds for him zoe was affected by this and turned liquid and loving eyes on dear ned but fanny stood her ground go to s t tomorrow morning but dont desert z v and f d tonight zoe smiled but i have telegraphed objected ned then telegraph againnot said fanny firmly now this was unexpected severne had set his heart upon rouge et noir but still he was afraid of offending zoe and besides he saw uxmoor with his noble beard and brown eyes casting rapturous glances at her let miss vizard decide said he dont let me be so unhappy as to offend her twice in one day zoes pride and goodness dictated her answer in spite of her wishes she said in a low voice go to your sick friend there said severne i hear said fanny she means go but you shall repent it i mean what i say said zoe with real dignity it is my habit and the next moment she quietly left the room she sat down in her bedroom mortified and alarmed what had it come to this that she felt her heart turn cold just because that young man said he could not accompany heron a single evening then first she discovered that it was for him she had dressed and had for once beautified her beautyfor him that with fanny she had dwelt upon the delights of the music but had secretly thought of appearing publicly on his arm and dazzling people by their united and contrasted beauty she rose all of a sudden and looked keenly at herself in the glass to see if she had not somehow overrated her attractions but the glass was reassuring it told her not one man in a million could go to a sick friend that night when he might pass the evening by her side and visit his friend early in the morning best loved is best served tears of mortified vanity were in her eyes but she smiled through them at the glass then dried them carefully and went back to the diningroom radiant to all appearance dinner was just served and her brother to do honor to the newcomer waved his sister to a seat by lord uxmoor he looked charmed at the arrangement and showed a great desire to please her but at first was unable to find good topics after several timid overtures on his part she assisted him out of goodnature she knew by report that he was a very benevolent young man bent on improving the home habits wages and comforts of the agricultural poor she led him to this and his eyes sparkled with pleasure and his homely but manly face lighted and was elevated by the sympathy she expressed in these worthy objects he could not help thinking what a lady uxmoor this would make she and i and her brother might leaven the county and all this time she would not even bestow a glance on severne she was not an angel she had said go to your sick friend but she had not said i will smart alone if you do severne sat by fanny and seemed dejected but as usual polite and charming she was smilingly cruel regaled him with lord uxmoors wealth and virtues and said he was an excellent match and all shebarfordshire pulling caps for him severne only sighed he offered no resistance and at last she could not go on nagging a handsome fellow who only sighed so she said well there i advise you to join us before the opera is over that is all i will i will said he eagerly oh thank you dinner was dispatched rather rapidly because of the opera when the ladies got their cloaks and lace scarfs to put over their heads coming home the party proved to be only three and the tickets five for miss maitland pleaded headache on this lord uxmoor said rather timidly he should like to go why you said you hated music said vizard lord uxmoor colored i recant said he bluntly and everybody saw what had operated his conversion that is a pun it is half an hour by rail from frankfort to homburg and the party could not be seated together vizard bestowed zoe and lord uxmoor in one carriage fanny and severne in another and himself and a cigar in the third severne sat gazing piteously on fanny dover but never said a word she sat and eyed him satirically for a good while and then she said cheerfully well mr severne how do you like the turn things are taking miss dover i am very unhappy serves you right oh pray dont say that it is on you i depend on me sir what have i to do with your flirtations no but you are so clever and so good if for once you will take a poor fellows part with miss vizard behind my back oh please dopray do and in the ardor of entreaty he caught fannys white hand and kissed it with warm but respectful devotion indeed he held it and kissed it again and again till fanny though she minded it no more than marble was going to ask him satirically whether he had not almost done with it when at last he contrived to squeeze out one of his little hysterical tears and drop it on her hand now the girl was not butter like some of her sex far from it but neither was she woodindeed she was not old enough for thatso this crocodile tear won her for the time being therethere said she dont be a baby ill be on your side tonight only if you care for her come and look after her yourself beautiful women with money wont stand neglect mr severne and why should they they are not like poor me they have got the game in their hands the train stopped vizards party drove to the opera and severne ordered a cab to the golden star meaning to stop it and get out but looking at his watch he found it wanted half an hour to gambling time so he settled to have a cup of coffee first and a cigar with this view he let the man drive him to the golden star chapter iii ina klosking worked night and day upon siebel in gounods faust and upon the songs that had been added to give weight to the part she came early to the theater at night and sat half dressed fatigued and nervous in her dressingroom crashthe first coup darchet announced the overture and roused her energy as if ithuriels spear had pricked her she came down dressed to listen at one of the upper entrances to fill herself with the musical theme before taking her part in it and also to gauge the audience and the singers the man faust was a german but the musical part faust seems better suited to an italian or a frenchman indeed some say that as a rule the german genius excels in creation and the italian in representation or interpretation for my part i am unable to judge nations in the lump as some fine fellows do because nations are composed of very different individuals and i know only one to the million but i do take on me to say that the individual herr who executed doctor faustus at homburg that night had everything to learn except what he had to unlearn his person was obese his delivery of the words was mouthing chewing and gurgling and he uttered the notes in tune but without point pathos or passion a steady layclerk from york or durham cathedral would have done a little better because he would have been no colder at heart and more exact in time and would have sung clean whereas this gentleman set his windpipe trembling all through the business as if palsy were passion by what system of leverage such a man came to be hoisted on to such a pinnacle of song as faust puzzled our english friends in front as much as it did the anglodanish artist at the wing for english girls know what is what in opera the marguerite had a voice of sufficient compass and rather sweet though thin the part demands a better actress than patti and this fraulein was not half as good she put on the painful grin of a prizefighter who has received a staggerer and grinned all through the part though there is little in it to grin at she also suffered by having to play to a faust milked of his poetry and selfsmitten with a tremolo which as i said before is the voice of palsy and is not nor ever was nor ever will be the voice of passion bless your heart passion is a manly thing a womanly thing a grand thing not a feeble quavering palsied anile senile thing learn that ye trembling quavering idiots of song they let me down whispered ina klosking to her faithful ashmead i feel all out of tune i shall never be able and the audience so cold it will be like singing in a sepulcher what would you think of them if they applauded said ashmead i should say they were good charitable souls and the very audience i shall want in five minutes no no said ashmead all you want is a discriminating audience and this is one remember they have all seen patti in marguerite is it likely they would applaud this tin stick ina turned the conversation with feminine quickness mr ashmead have you kept your promise my name is not in the programme it is not and a great mistake too i have not been announced by name in any way no but of course i have nursed you a bit nursed me what is that oh what have you been doing no charlatanerie i hope nothing of the kind said ashmead stoutly only the regular business and pray what is the regular business inquired ina distrustfully why of course i sent on the manager to say that mademoiselle schwaub had been taken seriously ill that we had been fearing we must break faith with the public for the first time but that a cantatrice who had left the stage appreciating our difficulty had with rare kindness come to our aid for this one night we felt sure a humbug audiencewhat am i sayinga homburg audience would appreciate this and make due allowance for a performance undertaken in such a spirit and with imperfect rehearsals etcin short the usual patter and the usual effect great applause indeed the only applause that i have heard in this theater tonight ashmead ahead of gounod so far ina klosking put both hands before her face and uttered a little moan she had really a soul above these artifices so then said she if they do receive me it will be out of charity no no but on your first night you must have two strings to your bow but i have only one these cajoling speeches are a waste of breath a singer can sing or she can not sing and they find out which it is as soon as she opens her mouth well then you open your mouththat is just what half the singers cant doand they will soon find out you can sing i hope they may i do not know i am discouraged im terrified i think it is stagefright and she began to tremble visibly for the time drew near ashmead ran off and brought her some brandyandwater she put up her hand against it with royal scorn no sir if the theater and the lights and the people the mind of goethe and the music of gounod cant excite me without that put me at the counter of a cafe for i have no business here the power without violence and the grandeur with which she said this would have brought down the house had she spoken it in a play without a note of music and ashmead drew back respectfully but chuckled internally at the idea of this minerva giving change in a cafe and now her cue was coming she ordered everybody out of the entrance not very ceremoniously and drew well back then at her cue she made a stately rush and so being in full swing before she cleared the wing she swept into the center of the stage with great rapidity and resolution no trace either of her sorrowful heart or her quaking limbs was visible from the front there was a little applause all due to ashmeads preliminary apology but there was no real reception for germany is large and musical and she was not immediately recognized at homburg but there was that indescribable flutter which marks a good impression and keen expectation suddenly aroused she was beautiful on the stage for one thing her figure rather tall and stately and her face full of power and then the very way she came on showed the step and carriage of an artist at home upon the boards she cast a rapid glance round the house observed its size and felt her way she sung her first song evenly but not tamely yet with restrained power but the tones were so full and flexible the expression so easy yet exact that the judges saw there was no effort and suspected something big might be yet in store tonight at the end of her song she did let out for a moment and at this welltimed foretaste of her power there was applause but nothing extravagant she was quite content however she met ashmead as she came off and said all is well my friend so far they are sitting in judgment on me like sensible people and not in a hurry i rather like that your own fault said joseph you should have been announced prejudice is a surer card than judgment the public is an ass it must come to the same thing in the end said the klosking firmly one can sing or one cannot her next song was encored and she came off flushed with art and gratified pride i have no fears now said she to her achates firmly i have my barometer a young lady in the stalls oh such a beautiful creature with black hair and eyes she applauds me fearlessly her glorious eyes speak to mine and inspire me she is happy she is i drink sunbeams at her i shall act and sing le parlate damor for herand you will see between the acts who should come in but ned severne and glided into the vacant stall by zoes side she quivered at his coming near her he saw it and felt a thrill of pleasure himself how is s t said she kindly s t said he forgetting why your sick friend to be sure oh not half so bad as he thought i was a fool to lose an hour of you for him he was hipped had lost all his money at rouge et noir so i lent him fifty pounds and that did him more good than the doctor you forgive me forgive you i approve are you going back to him said she demurely no thank you i have made sacrifices enough and so indeed he had having got cleaned out of three hundred pounds through preferring gambling to beauty singers good he inquired wretched all but one and she is divine indeed who is she i dont know a gentleman in black came out mephistopheles nohow dare youand said a singer that had retired would perform the part of siebel to oblige and she has obliged me for one she is oh so superior to the others such a heavenly contralto and her upper notes honey dropping from the comb and then she is so modest so dignified and so beautiful she is fair as a lily and such a queenlike brow and deep gray eyes full of sadness and soul im afraid she is not happy once or twice she fixed them on me and they magnetized me and drew me to her so i magnetized her in return i should know her anywhere fifty years hence now if i were a man i should love that woman and make her love me then i am very glad you are not a man said severne tenderly so am i whispered zoe and blushed the curtain rose listen now mr chatterbox said zoe ned severne composed himself to listen but fraulein graas had not sung many bars before he revolted listen to what said he and look at what the only marguerite in the place is by my side zoe colored with pleasure but her good sense was not to be blinded the only good black mephistopheless you mean said she to be marguerite one must be great and sweet and tender yes and far more lovely than ever woman was that lady is a better color for the part than i am but neither she nor i shall ever be marguerite he murmured in her ear you are marguerite for you could fire a mans heart so that he would sell his soul to gain you it was the accent of passion and the sensitive girl quivered yet she defended herselfin words hush said she that is wickedout of an opera fanny would laugh at you if she heard here were two reasons for not making such hot love in the stalls of an opera which of the two weighed most with the fair reasoner shall be left to her own sex the brief scene ended with the declaration of the evil spirit that marguerite is lost there said zoe naively that is over thank goodness now you will hear my singer siebel and marta came on from opposite sides of the stage see said zoe isnt she lovely and she turned her beaming face full on severne to share her pleasure with him to her amazement the man seemed transformed a dark cloud had come over his sunny countenance he sat pale and seemed to stare at the tall majestic dreamy singer who stood immovable dressed like a velvet youth yet looking like no earthly boy but a draped statue of mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill the blood left his lips and zoe thought he was faint but the next moment he put his handkerchief hastily to his nose and wriggled his way out with a rush and a crawl strangely combined at the very moment when the singer delivered her first commanding note of recitative everybody about looked surprised and disgusted at so illtimed an exit but zoe who had seen his white face was seriously alarmed and made a movement to rise too and watch or even follow him but when he got to the side he looked back to her and made her a signal that his nose was bleeding but it was of no great consequence he even pointed with his finger out and then back again indicating he should not be long gone this reassured her greatly for she had always been told a little bleeding of that sort was good for hotheaded young people then the singer took complete hold of her the composer to balance the delightful part of marguerite has given siebel a melody with which wonders can be done and the klosking had made a considerable reserve of her powers for this crowning effort after a recitative that rivaled the silver trumpet she flung herself with immediate and electrifying ardor into the melody the orchestra taken by surprise fought feebly for the old ripple but the klosking resolute by nature was now mighty as neptune and would have her big waves the momentary struggle in which she was loyally seconded by the conductor evoked her grand powers catgut had to yield to brains and the whole orchestra composed after all of good musicians soon caught the divine afflatus and the little theater seemed on fire with music the air sung with a large rhythm swelled and rose and thrilled every breast with amazement and delight the house hung breathless byandby there were pale cheeks panting bosoms and wet eyes the true rare triumphs of the sovereigns of song and when the last note had pealed and ceased to vibrate the pentup feelings broke forth in a roar of applause which shook the dome followed by a clapping of hands like a salvo that never stopped till ina klosking who had retired came forward again she courtesied with admirable dignity modesty and respectful gravity and the applause thundered and people rose at her in clusters about the house and waved their hats and handkerchiefs at her and a little italian recognized her and cried out as loud as he could viva la klosking viva and she heard that and it gave her a thrill and zoe vizard being out of england and therefore brave as a lioness stood boldly up at her full height and taking her bouquet in her right hand carried it swiftly to her left ear and so flung it with a free backhanded sweep more oriental than english into the air and it lighted beside the singer and she saw the noble motion and the bouquet fly and when she made her last courtesy at the wing she fixed her eyes on zoe and then put her hand to her heart with a most touching gesture that said most of all i value your bouquet and your praise then the house buzzed and ranks were leveled little people spoke to big people and big to little in mutual congratulation for at such rare moments except in anglosaxony instinct seems to tell men that true art is a sunshine of the soul and blesses the rich and the poor alike one person was affected in another way harrington vizard sat rapt in attention and never took his eyes off her yet said not a word several russian and prussian grandees sought an introduction to the new singer but she pleaded fatigue the manager entreated her to sup with him and meet the grand duke of hesse she said she had a prior engagement she went quietly home and supped with her faithful ashmead and very heartily too for nature was exhausted and agitation had quite spoiled her dinner joseph ashmead in the pride of his heart proposed a bottle of champagne the queen of song with triumph flushed looked rather blue at that my friend said she in a meek deprecating way we are workingpeople is not bordeaux good enough for us yes but it is not good enough for the occasion said joseph a little testily well never mind and he muttered to himself that is the worst of good women they are so terribly stingy the queen of song with triumph flushed did not catch these words but only a little growling however as supper proceeded she got uneasy so she rang the bell and ordered a pint of this she drank one spoonful the remainder cooperating with triumph and claret kept ashmead in a great flow of spirits he traced her a brilliant career to be photographed tomorrow morning as siebel and in plain dress paragraphs in era figaro galignani independance belge and the leading dailies large woodcuts before leaving homburg for paris london vienna st petersburg and new york im in your hands said she and smiled languidly to please him but byandby he looked at her and found she was taking a little cry all to herself dear me said he what is the matter my friend forgive me he was not there to share my triumph chapter iv as the opera drew to an end zoe began to look round more and more for severne but he did not come and lord uxmoor offered his arm earnestly she took it but hung back a moment on his very arm to tell harrington mr severne had been taken ill at the railway station the truant emerged suddenly just as the train was leaving but lord uxmoor had secured three seats and the defaulter had to go with harrington on reaching the hotel the ladies took their bedcandles but uxmoor found time to propose an excursion next day sunday to a lovely little lakeopen carriage four horses the young ladies accepted but mr severne declined he thanked lord uxmoor politely but he had arrears of correspondence zoe cast a mortified and rather a haughty glance on him and fanny shrugged her shoulders incredulously these two ladies brushed hair together in zoes room that is a soothing operation my masters and famous for stimulating females to friendly gossip but this time there was for once a guarded reserve zoe was irritated puzzled mortified and even grieved by severnes conduct fanny was gnawed by jealousy and out of temper she had forgiven zoe ned severne but that young lady was insatiable lord uxmoor too had fallen openly in love with heropenly to a female eye so then a blonde had no chance with a dark girl by thus reasoned she and it was intolerable it was some time before either spoke an atom of what was uppermost in her mind they each doled out a hundred sentences that missed the mind and mingled readily with the atmosphere being in fact mere preliminary and idle air so two deer in duel go about and about and even affect to look another way till they are ripe for collision there be writers would give the reader all the preliminary puffs of articulated wind and everybody would say how clever that is just the way girls really talk but i leave the glory of photographing nullities to the geniuses of the age and run to the first words which could without impiety be called dialogue dont you think his conduct a little mysterious said zoe mal a propos of anything that had been said hitherto well yes rather said fanny with marked carelessness first a sick friend then a bleeding at the nose and now he wont drive to the lake with us arrears of correspondence pooh now fannys suspicions were deeper than zoes she had observed severne keenly but it was not her cue to speak she yawned and said what does it matter dont be unkind fanny it matters to me not it you have another ready what other there is no one that ifanny oh nonsense the man is evidently smitten and you keep encouraging him no i dont i am barely civil and dont be illnatured what can i do why be content with one at a time it is very rude to talk so besides i havent got one much less two i begin to doubt him and lord uxmoor you know i cannot possibly care for himan acquaintance of yesterday but you know all about himthat he is an excellent parti said fanny with a provoking sneer this was not to be borne oh said zoe i see you want him for yourself it is you that are not content with one you forget how poor harrington would miss your attentions he would begin to appreciate themwhen he had lost them this stung and fanny turned white and red by turns i deserve this said she for wasting advice on a coquette that is not true im no coquette and here i am asking your advice and you only snub me you are a jealous cross unreasonable thing well im not a hypocrite i never was called so before said zoe nobly and gently then you were not found out that is all you look so simple and ingenuous and blush if a man says half a word to you and all the time you are a greater flirt than i am oh fanny screamed zoe with horror it seems a repartee may be conveyed in a scream for fanny now lost her temper altogether your conduct with those two men is abominable said she i wont speak to you any more i beg you will not in your present temper said zoe with unaffected dignity and rising like a greek column fanny flounced out of the room zoe sat down and sighed and her glorious eyes were dimmed mysterydoubtand now a quarrel what a day at her age a little cloud seems to darken the whole sky next morning the little party met at breakfast lord uxmoor anticipating a delightful day was in high spirits and he and fanny kept up the ball she had resolved in the silent watches of the night to contest him with zoe and make every possible use of severne in the conflict zoe was silent and distraite and did not even try to compete with her sparkling rival but lord uxmoors eyes often wandered from his sprightly companion to zoe and it was plain he longed for a word from her mouth fanny observed bit her lip and tacked internally bout ship as the sailors say her game now conceived in a moment and at once put in execution was to encourage uxmoors attentions to zoe she began by openly courting mr severne to make zoe talk to uxmoor and also make him think that severne and she were the lovers her intentions were to utilize the coming excursion she would attach herself to harrington and so drive zoe and uxmoor together and then lord uxmoor at his present rate of amorous advance would probably lead zoe to a detached rock and make her a serious declaration this good artful girl felt sure such a declaration made a few months hence in barfordshire would be accepted and herself left in the cold therefore she resolved it should be made prematurely and in prussia with severne at hand and so in all probability come to nothing she even glimpsed a vista of consequences and in that little avenue discerned the figure of fanny dover playing the part of consoler friend and ultimately spouse to a wealthy noble chapter v the letters were brought in one was to vizard from herries announcing a remittance one to lord uxmoor on reading it he was surprised into an exclamation and his face expressed great concern oh said zoeharrington harringtons attention being thus drawn he said no bad news i hope yes said uxmoor in a low voice very bad my oldest truest dearest friend has been seized with smallpox and his life is in danger he has asked for me poor fellow this is from his sister i must start by the twelve oclock train smallpox why it is contagious cried fanny and so disfiguring i cant help that said the honest fellow and instantly rang the bell for his servant and gave the requisite orders zoe whose eye had never left him all the time said softly it is brave and good of you we poor emotional cowardly girls should sit down and cry you would not miss vizard said he firmly looking full at her if you think you would you dont know yourself zoe colored high and was silent then lord uxmoor showed the true english gentleman i do hope said he earnestly though in a somewhat broken voice that you will not let this spoil the pleasure we had planned together harrington will be my deputy well i dont know said harrington sympathizingly mr severne remarked such an occurrence puts pleasure out of ones head this he said with his eyes on his plate like one repeating a lesson vizard i entreat you said uxmoor almost vexed it will only make me more unhappy if you dont we will go cried zoe earnestly we promise to go what does it matter we shall think of you and your poor friend wherever we are and i shall pray for him but ah i know how little prayers avail to avert these cruel bereavements she was young but old enough to have prayed hard for her sick mothers life and like the rest of us prayed in vain at this remembrance the tears ran undisguised down her cheeks the open sympathy of one so young and beautiful and withal rather reserved made lord uxmoor gulp and not to break down before them all he blurted out that he must go and pack with this he hurried away he was unhappy besides the calamity he dreaded it was grievous to be torn away from a woman he loved at first sight and just when she had come out so worthy of his love she was a highminded creature she had been silent and reserved so long as the conversation was trivial but when trouble came she was the one to speak to him bravely and kindly well what must be must all this ran through his mind and made him sigh but it never occurred to him to shirkto telegraph instead of goingnor yet to value himself on his selfdenial they did not see him again till he was on the point of going and then he took leave of them all zoe last when he came to her he ignored the others except that he lowered his voice in speaking to her god bless you for your kindness miss vizard it is a little hard upon a fellow to have to run away from such an acquaintance just when i have been so fortunate as to make it oh lord uxmoor said zoe innocently never mind that why we live in the same county and we are on the way home all i think of is your poor friend and do please telegraphto harrington he promised he would and went away disappointed somehow at her last words when he was gone severne went out on the balcony to smoke and harrington held a council with the young ladies well now said he about this trip to the lake i shall not go for one said zoe resolutely la said fanny looking carefully away from her to harrington and she was the one that insisted zoe ignored the speaker and set her face stiffly toward harrington she only said that to him fanny but unfortunately ears are not confined to the noble zoe nor tongues to the discreet both these remarks were addressed pointedly to harrington halloo said he looking from one flaming girl to the other am i to be a shuttlecock and your discreet tongues the battledoors what is up we dont speak said the frank zoe that is up why what is the row no matter stiffly no great matter ill be bound toll toll the bell here goes one more immortal friendshipquenched in eternal silence both ladies bridled neither spoke and dead silence as ladies understand it consists in speaking at one another instead of to no reply that is wellbred taciturnity no answer the dignified reserve that distinguishes an estrangement from a squabble no reply well i admire permanent sentiments good or bad constant resolves etc your friendship has not proved immortal so now let us see how long you can hold spitesieves then he affected to start what is this i spy a rational creature out on yonder balcony i hasten to join him birds of a feather you know and with that he went out to his favorite and never looked behind him the young ladies indignant at the contempt the big man had presumed to cast upon the constant soul of woman turned two red faces and four sparkling eyes to each other with the instinctive sympathy of the jointly injured but remembering in time turned sharply round again and presented napes and so sat sullen byandby a chilling thought fell upon them both at the same moment of time the men were good friends as usual safe by sex from tiffs and could do without them and a dull day impended over the hostile fair thereupon the ingenious fanny resolved to make a splash of some sort and disturb stagnation she suddenly cried out la and the man is gone away so what is the use this remark she was careful to level at bare space zoe addressing the same personspace to witinquired of him if anybody in his parts knew to whom this young lady was addressing herself to a girl that is too sensible not to see the folly of quarreling about a manwhen he is gone said fanny if it is me you mean said zoe stiffly really i am surprised you forget we are at daggers drawn no i dont dear and parted forever zoe smiled at that against her will zoe penitentially frances archly come cuddle me quick zoe was all round her neck in a moment like a lace scarf and there was violent kissing with a tear or two then they put an arm round each others waist and went all about the premises intertwined like snakes and zoe gave fanny her cameo brooch the one with the pearls round it the person to whom vizard fled from the tongue of beauty was a delightful talker he read two or three newspapers every day and recollected the best things now it is not everybody can remember a thousand disconnected facts and recall them apropos he was various fluent and above all superficial and such are your best conversers they have something good and strictly ephemeral to say on everything and dont know enough of anything to impale their hearers in my youth there talked in pall mall a gentleman known as conversation sharpe he eclipsed everybody even macaulay paled sharpe talked all the blessed afternoon and grave men listened enchanted and of all he said nothing stuck where be now your sharpiana the learned may be compared to mines these desultory charmers are more like the ornamental cottage near staines forty or fifty rooms and the whole structure one story high the mine teems with solid wealth but you must grope and trouble to come to it it is easier and pleasanter to run about the cottage with a lot of rooms all on the groundfloor the mind and body both get into habitssometimes apart sometimes in conjunction nowadays we seat the body to work the intellect even in its lower form of mechanical labor it is your clod that toddles about laboring the peripatetics did not endure their method was not suited to mans microcosm bodily movements fritter mental attention we sit at the feet of gamaliel or as some call him tyndal and we sit to bacon and adam smith but when we are standing or walking we love to take brains easy if this delightful chatterbox had been taken down shorthand and printed and vizard had been set down to severni opuscula ten volumesand mind you severne had talked all ten by this timethe barfordshire squire and old oxonian would have cried out for more matter with less art and perhaps have even fled for relief to some shorter treatisebacons essays brownes religio medici or buckles civilization but lounging in a balcony and lazily breathing a cloud he could have listened all day to his desultory delightful friend overflowing with little questions little answers little queries little epigrams little maxims a la rochefoucauld little histories little anecdotes little gossip and little snapshots at every feather flying quicquid agunt homines votum timor ira voluptas gaudia discursus nostri farrago severni but alas after an hour of touchandgo of superficiality and soft delight the desultory charmer fell on a subject he had studied so then he bored his companion for the first time in all the tour but to tell the honest truth mr severne had hitherto been pleasing his friend with a coldblooded purpose his preliminary gossip that made the time fly so agreeably was intended to oil the way to lubricate the passage of a premeditated pill as soon as he had got vizard into perfect good humor he said apropos of nothing that had passed bytheby old fellow that five hundred pounds you promised to lend me vizard was startled by this sudden turn of a conversation hitherto agreeable why you have had three hundred and lost it said he now take my advice and dont lose any more i dont mean to but i am determined to win back the three hundred and a great deal more before i leave this i have discovered a system an infallible one i am sorry to hear it said harrington gravely that is the second step on the road to ruin the gambler with a system is the confirmed maniac what because other systems have been tried and proved to be false mine is untried and it is mere prejudice to condemn it unheard propound it then said vizard only please observe the bank has got its system you forget that and the banks system is to take a positive advantage which must win in the long run therefore all countersystems must lose in the long run but the bank is tied to a long run the individual player is not this reply checked vizard for a moment and the other followed up his advantage now vizard be reasonable what would the trifling advantage the bank derives from an incident which occurs only once in twentyeight deals avail against a player who could foresee at any given deal whether the card that was going to come up the nearest thirty would be on the red or black no avail at all god almighty could break the bank every afternoon apres as we say in france do you pretend to omniscience not exactly well but prescience of isolated events preceded by no indicia belongs only to omniscience did they not teach you that much at oxford they taught me very little at oxford fault of the place eh you taught them something though and the present conversation reminds me of it in your second term when every other man is still quizzed and kept down as a freshman you were already a leader a chief of misrule you founded a whistclub in trinity the primmest college of all the dons rooted you out in college but you did not succumb you fulfilled the saying of sydney smith that cribbage should be played in caverns and sixpennywhist in the howling wilderness ha ha how well i remember riding across bullington green one fine afternoon and finding four oxford hacks haltered in a row and the four undergraduates that had hired them on long tick sitting crosslegged under the hedge like turks or tailors round a rude table with the legs sawed down to stumps you had two packs and a portable inkstand and were so hard at it that i put my mares nose right over the quartet before you saw either her or me that hedge was like a drift of odoriferous snow the hawthorn bloom and primroses sparkled on its bank like topazes the birds chirruped the sky smiled the sun burned perfumes and there sat my lord and his fellowmaniacs snicksnackpitpatcutting dealing playing revoking scoring and exchanging i o u s not worth the paper all true but the revoking said severne merrily monster by the memory of those youthful days i demand a fair hearing then gravely hang it all vizard i am not a fellow that is always intruding his affairs and his theories upon other men no no no said vizard hastily and half apologetically go on well then of course i dont pretend to foreknowledge but i do to experience and you know experience teaches the wise not to fling five hundred after three therei beg pardon proceed instructor of youth do listen then experience teaches us that luck has its laws and i build my system on one of them if two opposite accidents are sure to happen equally often in a total of fifty times people who have not observed expect them to happen turn about and bet accordingly but they dont happen turn about they make short runs and sometimes long ones they positively avoid alternation have you not observed this at trente et quarante no then you have not watched the cards not much the faces of the gamblers were always my study they are instructive well then ill give you an example outsidefor the principle runs through all equal chancestake the university boatrace you have kept your eye on that rather never missed one yet come all the way from barfordshire to see it well theres an example of chance no thank you that goes by strength skill wind endurance chaste living selfdenial and judicious training every winning boat is manned by virtues his eye flashed and he was as earnest all in a moment as he had been listless a continental cynic had dubbed this insular cynic mad the professor of chances smiled superior those things decide each individual race and the best men win because it happens to be the only race that is never sold but go further back and you find it is chance it is pure chance that sends the best men up to cambridge two or three years running and then to oxford with this key take the facts my system rests on there are two the first is that in thirty and odd races and matches the university luck has come out equal on the river and at lords the second is the luck has seldom alternated i dont say never but look at the list of events it is published every march you may see there the great truth that even chances shun direct alternation in this properly worked lies a fortune at homburg where the play is square red gains once you back red next time and stop you are on black and win you double this is the game if you have only a few pounds but with five hundred pounds you can double more courageously and work the short run hard and that is how losses are averted and gains secured once at wiesbaden i caught a croupier out on a holiday it was goodfriday you know i gave him a stunning dinner he was close as wax at firstthat might be the salt fish but after the rognons a la brochette and a bottle of champagne he let out i remember one thing he said monsieur ce que fait la fortune de la banque ce nest pas le petit avantage quelle tire du refaitquoique cela y est pour quelquechosecest la temerite de ceux qui perdent et la timidite de ceux qui gagnent and says vizard there is a french proverb founded on experience cest encore rouge qui perd et encore noir mais toujours blanc qui gagne severne for the first time looked angry and mortified he turned his back and was silent vizard looked at him uneasily hesitated a moment then flung the remainder of his cigar away and seemed to rouse himself body and soul he squared his shoulders as if he were going to box the demon of play for his friend and he let out good sense right and left and indeed was almost betrayed into eloquence what he cried you who are so bright and keen and knowing in everything else are you really so blinded by egotism and credulity as to believe that you can invent any method of betting at rouge et noir that has not been tried before you were born do you remember the first word in la bruyeres famous work no said ned sulkily read nothing but newspapers good lad saves a deal of trouble well he begins tout est diteverything has been said and i say that in your business tout est faiteverything has been done every move has been tried before you existed and the result of all is that to bet against the bank wildly or systematically is to gamble against a rock si monumenta quoeris circumspice use your eyes man look at the kursaal its luxuries its gardens its gilding its attractions all of them cheap except the one that pays for all all these delights and the rents and the croupiers and the servants and the income and liveries of an unprincipled prince who would otherwise be a poor but honest gentleman with one bonne instead of thirty blazing lackeys all come from the gains of the bank which are the losses of the players especially of those that have got a system severne shot in a bank was broken last week was it then all it lost has returned to it or will return to it tonight for gamblers know no day of rest oh yes they do it is shut on goodfriday you surprise me only three hundred and sixtyfour days in the year brainless avarice is more reasonable than i thought severne yours is a very serious case you have reduced your income that is clear for an english gentleman does not stay years and years abroad unless he has out run the constable and i feel sure gambling has done it you had the fever from a boy bullington green as the twigs bent the trees inclined come come make a stand we are friends let us help one another against our besetting foibles let us practice antique wisdom let us know ourselves and leave homburg tomorrow instead of tuesday severne looked sullen but said nothing then vizard gave him too hastily credit for some of that sterling friendship bordering on love which warmed his own faithful breast under this delusion he made an extraordinary effort he used an argument which with himself would have been irresistible look here said he illwont you have a cigarthere now ill tell you something i have a mania as bad as yours only mine is intermittent thank heaven im told a million women are as good or better than a million men it may be so but when i an individual stake my heart on lovely woman she always turns out unworthy with me the sex avoids alternation therefore i rail on it wholesale it is not philosophical but i dont do it to instruct mankind it is to soothe my spleen wellwould you believe itonce in every three years in spite of my experience i am always bitten again after my lucid interval has expired i fall in with some woman who seems not like the rest but an angel then i though im averse to the sex fall an easy an immediate victim to the individual love at first sight not a bit of it if she is as beautiful as an angel with the voice of a peacock or a guineahenand luckily for me that is a frequent arrangementshe is no more to me than the fireshovel if she has a sweet voice and pale eyes im safe indeed i am safe against juno venus and minerva for two years and several months after the last but when two events coincide when my time is up and the lovely melodious female comes then i am lost before i have seen her and heard her five minutes i know my fate and i never resist it i never can that is a curious part of the mania then commences a little drama all the acts of which are stale copies yet each time they take me by surprise as if they were new in spite of past experience i begin all confidence and trust byandby come the subtle but wellknown signs of deceit so doubt is forced on me and then i am all suspicion and so darkly vigilant that soon all is certainty for les fourberies des femmes are diabolically subtle but monotonous they seem to vary only on the surface one looks too gentle and sweet to give any creature pain i cherish her like a tender plant she deceives me for the coarsest fellow she can find another comes the frank and candid dodge she is so offhanded she shows me it is not worth her while to betray she deceives me like the other and with as little discrimination the next has a face of beaming innocence and a limpid eye that looks like transparent candor she gazes long and calmly in my face as if her eye loved to dwell on me gazes with the eye of a gazelle or a young hare and the baby lips below outlie the hoariest male fox in the old jewry but to complete the delusion all my sweethearts and wives are romantic and poetical skindeepor they would not attract meand all turn out vulgar to the core by their lovers alone can you ever know them by the men they cant love and the men they do love you find these creatures that imitate sentiment so divinely are hard prosaic vulgar little things thinly gilt and double varnished they are much better than we are but you dont know how to take them said severne with the calm superiority of success no replied vizard dryly curse me if i do well i did hope i had outgrown my mania as i have done the toothache for this time i had passed the fatal period the three years it is nearly four years now since i went through the established processas fixed beforehand as the dyers or the cottonweaversadored her trusted her blindly suspected her watched her detected her left her bytheby she was my wife the last but that made no difference she was neither better nor worse than the rest and her methods and idiotic motives of deceit identical well ned i was mistaken yesterday night i met my fate once more where in frankfort no at homburg at the opera you must give me your word not to tell a soul i pledge you my word of honor well the lady who sung the part of siebel siebel muttered severne yes said vizard dejectedly severne fixed his eyes on his friend with a strange expression of confusion and curiosity as if he could not take it all in but he said nothing only looked very hard all the time vizard burst out o miserae hominum mentes o pectora caeca there i sat in the stalls a happy man comparatively because my heart though full of scars was at peace and my reason after periodical abdications had resumed its throne for good so i weak mortal fancied siebel appeared tall easy dignified and walking like a wave modest fair noble great dreamy and above all divinely sad the soul of womanhood and music poured from her honey lips she conquered all my senses i felt something like a bolt of ice run down my back i ought to have jumped up and fled the theater i wish i had but i never do i am incurable the charm deepened and when she had sung le parlate damor as no mortal ever sung and looked it she left the stage and carried my heart and soul away with her what chance had i here shone all the beauties that adorn the body all the virtues and graces that embellish the soul they were wedded to poetry and ravishing music and gave and took enchantment i saw my paragon glide away like a goddess past the scenery and i did not see her meet her lover at the next stepa fellow with a washleather face greasy locks in a sausage roll and his hair shaved off his foreheadand snatch a pot of porter from his hands and drain it to the dregs and say it is all right harry that fetched em but i know by experience she did so sauve qui peut dear friend and fellowlunatic for my sake and yours leave frankfort with me tomorrow severne hung his head and thought hard here was a new and wonderful turn he felt all manner of strange thingsa pang of jealousy for one he felt that on every account it would be wise to go and indeed dangerous to stay but a mania is a mania and so he could not look here old fellow he said if the opera were on tomorrow i would leave my three hundred behind me and sacrifice myself to you sooner than expose you to the fascinations of so captivating a woman as ina klosking ina klosking is that her name how do you know iifancy i heard so why she was not announced ina klosking it is a sweet name and he sighed but you are quite safe from her for one day continued severne so you must be reasonable i will go with you tuesday as early as you like but do be a good fellow and let me have the five hundred to try my system with tomorrow vizard looked sad and made no reply severne got impatient why what is it to a rich fellow like you if i had twelve thousand acres in a ring fence no friend would ask me twice for such a trifling sum vizard for the first time wore a supercilious smile at being so misunderstood and did not deign a reply severne went on mistaking his man i can give you bills for the money and for the three hundred you did lend me vizard did not receive this as expected bills said he gravely what do you do that sort of thing as well why not pray so long as im the holder not the drawer nor the acceptor besides they are not accommodation bills but good commercial paper you are a merchant then are you yes in a small way if you will allow me i will explain he did so and to save comments yet enable the reader to appreciate his explanation the true part of it is printed in italics the mendacious portion in ordinary type my estate in huntingdonshire is not very large and there are mortgages on it for the benefit of other members of my family i was always desirous to pay off these mortgages and took the best advice i could i have got an uncle he lives in the city he put me on to a good thing i bought a share in a trading vessel she makes short trips and turns her cargo often she will take out paper to america and bring back raw cotton she will land that at liverpool and ship english hardware and cotton fabrics for the mediterranean and greece and bring back currants from zante and lemons from portugal she goes for the nimble shilling well you know ships wear out and if you varnish them rotten and insure them high and they go to glory mr plimsoll is down on you like a hammer so when she had paid my purchasemoney three times over some fellows in the city made an offer for the roverthat was her name my share came to twelve hundred and my uncle said i was to take it now i always feel bound by what he decides they gave me four bills for four hundred three hundred three hundred and two hundred the four hundred was paid at maturity the others are not due yet i have only to send them to london and i can get the money back by thursday but you want me to start on tuesday that is enough said vizard wearily i will be your banker and you are a good fellow said severne warmly no no i am a weak fellow and an injudicious one but it is the old story when a friend asks you what he thinks a favor the right thing is to grant it at once he doesnt want your advice he wants the one thing he asks for there get me the bills and ill draw a check on muller herries advised him by saturdays post so we can draw on monday all right old man said severne and went away briskly for the bills when he got from the balcony into the room his steps flagged a little it struck him that ink takes time to dry and more time to darken as the rover with her nimble cargoes was first cousin to the flying dutchman with his crew of ghosts so the bills received by severne as purchasemoney for his ship necessarily partook of that ships aerial character indeed they existed as the schoolmen used to say in posse but not in esse to be less pedantic and more exact they existed as slips of blank paper with a government stamp to give them a mercantile character for a timeviz until presented for paymentthey must be drawn by an imaginary shipowner or a visionary merchant and indorsed by at least one shadow and a man of straw the man of straw sat down to inscribe self and shadows and became a dishonest writer of fiction for the art he now commenced appears to fall short of forgery proper but to be still more distinct from justifiable fiction the ingenious mr de foes certificate by an aeial justice of the peace to the truth of his ghostly narrative comes nearest to it in my poor reading qualms he had but not deep if the bills were drawn by imagination accepted by fancy and indorsed by impudence what did it matter to ned straw since his system would enable him to redeem them at maturity his only real concern was to conceal their recent origin so he wrote them with a broadnibbed pen that they might be the blacker and set them to dry in the sun he then proceeded to a change of toilet while thus employed there was a sharp tap at his door and vizards voice outside severne started with terror snapped up the three bills with the dexterity of a conjurerthe handle turnedhe shoved them into a drawervizard came inhe shut the drawer and panted vizard had followed the custom of oxonians among themselves which is to knock and then come in unless forbidden come said he cheerfully those bills im in a hurry to cash them now and end the only difference we have ever had old fellow the blood left severnes cheek and lips for a moment and he thought swiftly and hard the blood returned along with his ready wit how good you are said he but no it is sunday sunday ejaculated vizard what is that to you a fellow who has been years abroad i cant help it said severne apologetically i am superstitiousdont like to do business on a sunday i would not even shunt at the tables on a sundayi dont think ah you are not quite sure of that there is a limit to your superstition well will you listen to a story on a sunday rather then once on a time there was a scotch farmer who had a bonny cow and another farmer coveted her honestly one sunday they went home together from kirk and there was the cow grazing farmer two stopped eyed her and said to farmer one gien it were monday as it is the sabba day what would ye tak for your coow the other said the price would be nine pounds if it were monday and so they kept the sabbath and the cow changed hands though to the naked eye she grazed on in situ our negotiation is just as complete so what does it matter whether the actual exchange of bills and cash takes place today or tomorrow do you really mean to say it does not matter to you asked severne not one straw then as it does not matter to you and does to me give me my foolish way like a dear good fellow now that is smart said vizardvery smart then with a look of parental admiration he gets his own way in everything he will have your moneyhe wont have your money i wonder whether he will consent to walk those girls out and disburden me of their too profitable discourse that i will with pleasure well they are at luncheonwith their bonnets on i will join them in five minutes after luncheon miss vizard miss dover and mr severne started for a stroll miss maitland suggested that vizard should accompany them couldnt think of deserting you said he dryly the young ladies giggled because these two rarely opened their mouths to agree one being a professed womanhater and the other a manhater in words says misander in a sourish way since you value my conversation so perhaps you will be good enough not to smoke for the next ten minutes misogyn consented but sighed that sigh went unpitied and the lady wasted no time do you see what is going on between your sister and that young man yes a little flirtation a great deal more than that i caught them in this very room making love you alarm me said vizard with marked tranquillity i saw himkissherhand you relieve me said vizard as calmly as he had been alarmed theres no harm in that ive kissed the queens hand and the nation did not rise upon me however i object to it the superior sex should not play the spaniel i will tell him to drop that but permit me to say all this is in your department not mine but what can i do against three of them unless you support me there you have let them go out together together with fanny dover you mean yes and if fanny had any designs on him zoe would be safe and poor ned torn in two but fanny i am grieved to say seems inclined to assist this young man with zoe that is because it does not matter to her she has other viewsserious ones serious what a nunnery then i pity my lady abbess her views are plain enough to anybody but you are they then make me as wise as my neighbors well then she means to marry you what oh comethat is too good a joke it is sober earnest ask zoeask your friend mr severneask the chambermaidsask any creature with an eye in its head oh the blindness of you men the misogyn was struck dumb when he recovered it was to repine at the lot of man even my own familiar cousinonce removedin whom i trusted i depute you to inform her that i think her adorable and that matrimony is no longer a habit of mine set her on to poor severne he is a ladies man and the more the merrier is his creed such a girl as fanny is not to be diverted from a purpose of that sort besides she has too much sense to plunge into the severne andpauperism she is bent on a rich husband not a needy adventurer madam in my friends name i thank you you are very welcome sirit is only the truth then with a swift return to her original topic no i know perfectly well what fanny dover will do this afternoon she sketches it is too true said vizard dolefully showed me a ship in full sail and i praised it in my way i said that rock is rather well done well she will be seized with a desire to sketch she will sit down apart and say please dont watch meit makes me nervous the other two will take the hint and make love a good way off and zoe will go greater lengths with another woman in sightbut only just in sight and slyly encouraging herthan if she were quite alone with her mauvais sujet vizard was pleased with the old lady this is sagacious said he and shows an eye for detail i recognize in your picture the foxy sex but at this moment who can foretell which way the wind will blow you are not aware perhaps that zoe and fanny have had a quarrel they dont speak now in women you know vices are controlled by vicessee pope the conspiracy you dread will be averted by the other faults of their character their jealousy and their petulant tempers take my word for it they are sparring at this moment and that poor silly severne meditating and moderating and getting scratched on both sides for trying to be just at this moment the door opened and fanny dover glittered on the threshold in cambridge blue there said vizard did not i tell you they are come home only me said fanny gayly where are the others inquired miss maitland sharply not far offonly by the riverside and you left those two alone now dont be cross aunt cried fanny and limped up to her these new boots are so tight that i really couldnt bear them any longer i believe i shall be lame as it is you ought to be ashamed of yourself what will the people say la aunt it is abroad one does what one likesout of england heres a code of morals said vizard who must have his slap nonsense said miss maitland she will be sure to meet somebody all england is on the rhine at this time of the year and whether or no is it for you to expose that child to familiarity with a person nobody knows nor his family either you are twentyfive years old you know the world you have as poor an opinion of the man as i have or you would have set your own cap at himyou know you wouldand you have let out things to me when you were off your guard fanny dover you are behaving wickedly you are a false friend to that poor girl upon this lo the pert fanny hitherto so ready with her answers began to cry bitterly the words really pricked her conscience and to be scolded is one thing to be severely and solemnly reproached is another and before a man the official womanhater was melted in a moment by the saucy girls tears therethere said he kindly have a little mercy hang it all dont make a mountain of a molehill the official manhater never moved a muscle it is no use her crying to me she must give me a proof she is sorry fanny if you are a respectable girl and have any idea of being my heir go you this moment and bring them home yes aunt said fanny eagerly and went off with wonderful alacrity it was a very long apartment full forty feet and while fanny bustled down it miss maitland extended a skinny finger like one of macbeths witches and directed vizards eye to the receding figure so pointedly that he put up his spyglass the better to see the phenomenon as fanny skipped out and closed the door miss maitland turned to vizard with lean finger still pointing after fanny and uttered a monosyllable lame vizard burst out laughing la fourbe said he miss maitland accept my compliments you possess the key to a sex no fellow can unlock and now i have found an interpreter i begin to be interested in this little comedy the first act is just over there will be half an hours wait till the simulatrix of infirmity comes running back with the pilgrims of the rhine are they the pilgrims of the rhine or the pilgrims of love time will show play to recommence with a verbal encounter you will be one against three for all that i dont envy the greater number three to one no surely you will be on the right side for once well you see i am the audience we cant be all dramatis personae and no spectator during the wait i wonder whether the audience having nothing better to do may be permitted to smoke a cigar so long a lucid interval is irksome of course well the balcony is your smokingroom you will see them coming please tap at my door the moment you do half an hour elapsed an hour and the personages required to continue the comedy did not return vizard having nothing better to do fell to thinking of ina klosking and that was not good for him solitude and ennui fed his mania and at last it took the form of action he rang and ordered up his man harris a close discreet personage and directed him to go over to homburg and bring back all the information he could about the new singer her address in homburg married or single prude or coquette should information be withheld harris was to fee the porter at the operahouse the waiter at her hotel and all the human commodities that knew anything about her having dismissed harris he lighted his seventh cigar and said to himself it is all ned severnes fault i wanted to leave for england today the day had been overcast for some time and now a few big drops fell by way of warning then it turned cool then came a light drizzling rain and in the middle of this fanny dover appeared almost flying home vizard went and tapped at miss maitlands door she came out heres miss dover coming but she is alone the next moment fanny bounced into the room and started a little at the picture of the pair ready to receive her she did not wait to be taken to task but proceeded to avert censure by volubility and selfpraise aunt i went down to the river where i left them and looked all along it and they were not in sight then i went to the cathedral because that seemed the next likeliest place oh i have had such a race why did you come back before you had found them aunt it was going to rain and it is raining now hard she does not mind that zoe oh she has got nothing on bless me cried vizard godiva rediviva now harrington dont of course i mean nothing to spoil only her purple alpaca and that is two years old but my blue silk i cant afford to ruin it nobody would give me another i know what a heartless world said vizard dryly it is past a jest the whole thing objected miss maitland and now we are together please tell me if you can either of you who is this man what are his means i know the peerage the baronetage and the landed gentry but not severne that is a river not a family oh said vizard family names taken from rivers are never parvenues but we cant all be down in burke ned is of a good stock the old english yeoman the countrys pride yeoman said the maitland with sovereign contempt vizard resisted is this the place to sneer at an english yeoman where you see an unprincely prince living by a gamblingtable what says the old stave a german prince a marquis of france and a laird o the north countrie a yeoman o kent with his yearly rent would ding em out all three then said misander with a good deal of malicious intent you are quite sure your yeoman is not apauperan adventurer positive and a gambler no i am not at all sure of that but nobody is allwise i am not for one he is a fine fellow as good as gold as true as steel always polite always genial and never speaks ill of any of you behind your backs miss maitland bridled at that what i have said is not out of dislike to the young man i am warning a brother to take a little more care of his sister that is all however after your sneer i shall say no more behind mr severnes back but to his facethat is if we ever see his face again or zoes either oh aunt said fanny reproachfully it is only the rain la poor things they will be wet to the skin just see how it is pouring that it is and let me tell you there is nothing so dangerous as a teteatete in the rain a thunderstorm is worse aunt said fanny eagerly because then she is frightened to death and clings to himif he is nice having galloped into this revelation through speaking first and thinking afterward fanny pulled up short the moment the words were out and turned red and looked askant under her pale lashes at vizard observing several twinkles in his eyes she got up hastily and said she really must go and dry her gown yes said miss maitland come into my room dear fanny complied with rather a rueful face not doubting that the public dear was to get it rather hot in private her uneasiness was not lessened when the old maid said to her grimly now sit you down there and never mind your dress however it came rather mildly after all fanny you are not a bad girl and you have shown you were sorry so i am not going to be hard on you only you must be a good girl now and help me to undo the mischief and then i will forgive you aunt said fanny piteously i am older than she is and i know i have done rather wrong and i wont do it any more but pray pray dont ask me to be unkind to her today it is broochday miss maitland only stared at this obscure announcement so fanny had to explain that zoe and she had tiffed and made it up and zoe had given her a brooch hereupon she went for it and both ladies forgot the topic they were on and every other to examine the brooch aunt says fanny handling the brooch and eyeing it you were a poor girl like me before grandpapa left you the money and you know it is just as well to have a tiff now and then with a rich one because when you kiss and make it up you always get some reconciliationthing or other miss maitland dived into the past and nodded approval thus encouraged fanny proceeded to more modern rules she let miss maitland know it was always understood at her school that on these occasions of tiff reconciliation and present the girl who received the present was to side in everything with the girl who gave it for that one day that is the real reason i put on my tight bootsto earn my brooch isnt it a duck are they tight then awfully seenew on today but you could shake off your lameness in a moment la aunt you know one can fight with that sort of thing or fight against it it is like colds and headaches and fevers and all that you are in bed too ill to see anybody you dont much care for night comes and then you jump up and dress and go to a ball and leave your cold and your fever behind you because the ball wont wait till you are well and the bores will so dont ask me to be unkind to zoe broochday said fanny skipping back to her first position with singular pertinacity now fanny said miss maitland who wants you to be unkind to her but you must and shall promise me not to lend her any more downright encouragement and to watch the man well i promise that faithfully said fannyan adroit concession since she had been watching him like a cat a mouse for many days then you are a good girl and to reward you i will tell you in confidence all the strange stories i have discovered today oh do aunt cried fanny and now her eyes began to sparkle with curiosity miss maitland then bid her observe that the bedroom window was not a french casement but a doublesash windowclosed at present because of the rain but it had been wide open at the top all the time those two were smoking and talking secrets and child said the old lady very impressively if youwanttoknowwhat gentlemen really are you must be out of sight and listen to them smoking when i was a girl the gentlemen came out in their true colors over their wine now they are as close as wax drinking and even when they are tipsy they keep their secrets but once let them get by themselves and smoke the very air is soon filled with scandalous secrets none of the ladies in the house ever dreamed of their real characters their true histories and their genuine sentiments are locked up like that genius in the arabian nights and come out in smoke as he did the old lady chuckled at her own wit and the young one laughed to humor her well my dear those two smoked and revealed themselvestheir real selves and i listened and heard every word on the top of those drawers fanny looked at the drawers they were high la aunt how ever did you get up there by a chair oh fancy you perched up there listening at your age you need not keep throwing my age in my teeth i am not so very old only i dont paint and whiten and wear false hair there are plenty of coquettes about ever so much older than i am i have a great mind not to tell you and then much you will ever know about either of these men oh aunt dont be cruel i am dying to hear it as aunt was equally dying to tell it she passed over the skit upon her age though she did not forget nor forgive it and repeated the whole conversation of vizard and severne with rare fidelity but as i abhor what the evangelist calls battology and shakespeare damnable iteration i must draw upon the intelligence of the reader if any and he must be pleased to imagine the whole dialogue of those two unguarded smokers repeated to fanny and interrupted commented on at every salient point scrutinized sifted dissected and taken to pieces by two keen women sharp by nature and sharper now by collision of their heads no candor no tolerance no allowance for human weakness blunted the scalpel in their dexterous hands oh gossip delight of ordinary souls and more delightful still when you furnish food for detraction to fanny in particular it was exciting ravishing and the time flew by so unheeded that presently there came a sharp knock and an impatient voice cried chatter chatter chatter how long are we to be kept waiting for dinner all of us chapter vi at the very commencement of the confabulation so barbarously interrupted before it had lasted two hours and a half the misogyn rang the bell and asked for rosa zoes maid she came and he ordered her to have up a basket of wood and light a roaring fire in her mistresss room and put out garments to air he also inquired the number of zoes bedroom the girl said it was no the misogyn waited half an hour and then visited no he found the fire burned down to one log and some things airing at the fire as domestics air their employers things but not their own you may be sure there was a chemise carefully folded into the smallest possible compass and doubled over a horse at a good distance from the cold fire there were other garments and supplementaries all treated in the same way the misogyn looked and remarked as follows idiots at everything but taking in the men having relieved his spleen with this courteous and comprehensive observation he piled log upon log till the fire was half up the chimney then he got all the chairs and made a semicircle and spread out the various garments to the genial heat and so close that had a spark flown they would have been warmed with a vengeance and the superiority of the male intellect demonstrated this done he retired with a guilty air for he did not want to be caught meddling in such frivolities by miss dover or miss maitland however he was quite safe those superior spirits were wholly occupied with the loftier things of the mind especially the characters of their neighbors i must now go for these truants that are giving everybody so much trouble when fanny fell lame and said she was very sorry but she must go home and change her boots zoe was for going home too but fanny doubting her sincerity was peremptory and said they had only to stroll slowly on and then turn she should meet them coming back zoe colored high suspecting they had seen the last of this ingenious young lady what a good girl cried severne i am afraid she is a very naughty girl said zoe faintly and the first effect of fannys retreat was to make her a great deal more reserved and less sprightly severne observed and understood and saw he must give her time he was so respectful as well as tender that by degrees she came out again and beamed with youth and happiness they strolled very slowly by the fair river and the pretty little nothings they said to each other began to be mere vehicles for those soft tones and looks in which love is made far more than by the words themselves when they started on this walk severne had no distinct nor serious views on zoe but he had been playing with fire for some time and so now he got well burned walking slowly by his side and conscious of being wooed whatever the words might be zoe was lovelier than ever those lowered lashes that mantling cheek those soft tender murmurs told him he was dear and thrilled his heart though a cold one compared with hers he was in love as much as he could be and more than he had ever been before he never even asked himself whether permanent happiness was likely to spring from this love he was selfindulgent reckless and in love he looked at her wished he could recall his whole life and sighed why do you sigh said she gently i dont know yes i do because i am not happy not happy said she you ought to be and i am sure you deserve to be i dont know that however i think i shall be happier in a few minutes or else very unhappy indeed that depends on you on me mr severne and she blushed crimson and her bosom began to heave his words led her to expect a declaration and a proposal of marriage he saw her mistake and her emotion spoke so plainly and sweetly and tried him so that it cost him a great effort not to clasp her in his arms but that was not his cue at present he lowered his eyes to give her time and said sadly i cannot help seeing that somehow there is suspicion in the air about me miss maitland puts questions and drops hints miss dover watches me like a lynx even you gave me a hint the other day that i never talk to you about my relations and my past life pray do not confound me with other people said zoe proudly if i am curious it is because i know you must have done many good things and clever things but you have too little vanity or too much pride to tell them even to one whoesteems you and could appreciate i know you are as generous and noble as most people are narrowminded said severne enthusiastically and i have determined to tell you all about myself zoes cheeks beamed with gratified pride and her eyes sparkled only as i would not tell it to anybody but you i must stipulate that you will receive it in sacred confidence and not repeat it to a living soul not even to my brother who loves you so not even to him this alarmed the instinctive delicacy and modesty of a truly virgin soul i am not experienced said she but i feel i ought not to yield to curiosity and hear from you anything i am forbidden to tell my brother you might as well say i must not tell my mother for dear harrington is all the mother i have and i am sure he is a true friend to you this last a little reproachfully but for severnes habitual selfcommand he would have treated this delicacy as ridiculous prudery but he was equal to greater difficulties you are right by instinct in everything well then i shall tell you and you shall see at once whether it ought to be repeated or to remain a sacred deposit between me and the only creature i have the courage to tell it to zoe lowered her eyes and marked the sand with her parasol she was a little puzzled now and half conscious that somehow he was tying her to secrecy with silk instead of rope but she never suspected the deliberate art and dexterity with which it was done severne then made the revelation which he had been preparing for a day or two past and to avoid eternal comments by the author i must once more call in the artful aid of the printers the true part of mr severnes revelation is in italics the false in ordinary type when my father died i inherited an estate in huntingdonshire it was not so large as vizards but it was clear not a mortgage nor incumbrance on it i had a younger brother a fellow with charming manners and very accomplished these were his ruin he got into high society in london but high society is not always good society he became connected with a fast lot some of the young nobility of course he could not vie with them he got deeply in debt not but what they were in debt too every one of them he used to send to me for money oftener than i liked but i never suspected the rate he was going at i was anxious too about him but i said to myself he was just sowing his wild oats like other fellows well it went on untilto his misfortune and minehe got entangled in some disgraceful transactions the general features are known to all the world i dare say you have heard of one or two young noblemen who committed forgeries on their relations and friends some years ago one of them the son of an earl took his sisters whole fortune out of her bank with a single forged check i believe the sum total of his forgeries was over one hundred thousand pounds his father could not find half the money a number of the nobility had to combine to repurchase the documents many of them were in the hands of the jews and i believe a composition was effected with the help of a very powerful barrister an m p he went out of his line on this occasion and mediated between the parties what will you think when i tell you that my brother the son of my father and my mother was one of these forgersa criminal my poor friend cried zoe clasping her innocent hands it was a thunderclap i had a great mind to wash my hands of it and let him go to prison but how could i the struggle ended in my doing like the rest only poor i had no noble kinsmen with long purses to help me and no solicitorgeneral to mediate sub rosa the total amount would have swamped my family acres i got them down to sixty per cent and that only crippled my estate forever as for my brother he fell on his knees to me but i could not forgive him he left the country with a hundred pounds i gave him he is in canada and only known there as a most respectable farmer he talks of paying me back that i shall believe when i see it all i know for certain is that his crime has mortgaged my estate and left me poorand suspected while severne related this there passed a somewhat notable thing in the world of mind the inventor of this history did not understand it the hearer did and accompanied it with innocent sympathetic sighs her imagination more powerful and precise than the inventors pictured the horror of the highminded brother his agony his shame his respect for law and honesty his pity for his own flesh and blood his struggle and the final triumph of fraternal affection every line of the figment was alive to her and she realized the tale severne only repeated it at the last touch of his cold art the warmhearted girl could contain no longer oh poor mr severne she cried poor mr severne and the tears ran down her cheeks he looked at her first with a little astonishmentfancy taking his little narrative to heart like thatthen with compunction and then with a momentary horror at himself and terror at the impassable gulf fixed between them by her rare goodness and his depravity then for a moment he felt and felt all manner of things at once oh dont cry he blurted out and began to blubber himself at having made her cry at all and so unfairly it was his lucky hour this hysterical effusion undignified by a single grain of active contrition or even penitent resolve told in his favor they mingled their tears and hearts cannot hold aloof when tears come together yes they mingled their tears and the crocodile tears were the males if you please and the womans tears were pure holy drops that angels might have gathered and carried them to god for pearls of the human soul after they had cried together over the cool figment zoe said i do not repent my curiosity now you did well to tell me oh no you were right and i will never tell anybody people are narrowminded they shall never cast your brothers crime in your teeth nor your own losses i esteem you foroh so much more than ever i wonder you could tell me you would not wonder if you knew how superior you are to all the world how noble how generous and how i oh mr severne it is going to rain we must get home as fast as ever we can they turned and zoe with true virgin coyness and elastic limbs made the coming rain an excuse for such swift walking that severne could not make tender love to her to be sure apollo ran after daphne with his little proposals but i take it he ran mutetill he found he couldnt catch her indeed it was as much as severne could do to keep up with her fair heel and toe but i ascribe this to her not wearing high heels ever since fanny told her she was just a little too tall and she was novice enough to believe her she would not stop for the drizzle but at last it came down with such a vengeance that she was persuaded to leave the path and run for a cattleshed at some distance here she and severne were imprisoned luckily for them the kye had not come hame and the shed was empty they got into the farthest corner of it for it was all open toward the river and the rain pattered on the roof as if it would break it thus driven together was it wonderful that soon her hand was in his and that as they purred together and murmured soft nothings more than once she was surprised into returning the soft pressure which he gave it so often the plump declaration she had fled from and now seemed deliciously resigned to did not actually come but he did what she valued more he resumed his confidences told her he had vices was fond of gambling excused it on the score of his loss by his brother said he hoped soon to hear good news from canada didnt despair was happy now in spite of all had been happy ever since he had met her what declaration was needed the understanding was complete neither doubted the others love and zoe would have thought herself a faithless wicked girl if after this she had gone and accepted any other man but presently she had a misgiving and looked at her watch yes it wanted but one hour to dinner now her brother was rather a tartar about punctuality at dinner she felt she was already in danger of censure for her long teteatete with severne though the rain was the culprit she could not afford to draw every eye upon her by being late for dinner along with him she told severne they must go home now rain or no rain and she walked resolutely out into the weather severne did not like it at all but he was wise enough to deplore it only on her account and indeed her light alpaca was soon drenched and began to cling to her but the spirited girl only laughed at his condolences as she hurried on why it is only warm water said she this is no more than a bath in the summer sea bathing is getting wet through in blue flannel well i am bathing in blue alpaca but it will ruin your dress my dress why it is as old as the hills when i get home ill give it to rosa ready washedhaha the rain pelted and poured and long before they reached the inn zoes dress had become an external cuticle an alpaca skin but innocence is sometimes very bold she did not care a bit and to tell the truth she had little need to care beauty so positive as hers is indomitable the petty accidents that are the terrors of homely charms seem to enhance queen beauty disheveled hair adorns it close bound hair adorns it simplicity adorns it diamonds adorn it everything seems to adorn it because the truth is it adorns everything and so zoe drenched with rain and her dress a bathinggown was only a greek goddess tinted blue her bust and shoulders and her molded figure covered yet revealed what was she to an artists eye just the townly venus with her sculptors cunning draperies and junos gait et vera incessa patuit dea when she got to the hotel she held up her finger to severne with a pretty peremptoriness she had shown him so much tenderness she felt she had a right to order him now i must beg of you said she to go straight to your rooms and dress very quickly and present yourself to harrington five minutes before dinner at least i will obey said he obsequiously that pleased her and she kissed her hand to him and scudded to her own room at sight of the blazing fire and provident preparations she started and said aloud oh how nice of them and all dripping as she was she stood there with her young heart in a double glow such a nature as hers has too little egotism and lowbred vanity to undervalue worthy love the infinite heart of a zoe vizard can love but one with passion yet ever so many more with warm and tender affection she gave aunt maitland credit for this provident affection it was out of the sprightly fannys line and she said to herself dear old thing there i thought she was bottling up a lecture for me and all the time her real anxiety was lest i should be wet through thereupon she settled in her mind to begin loving aunt maitland from that hour she did not ring for her maid till she was nearly dressed and when rosa came and exclaimed at the condition of her castoff robes she laughed and told her it was nothingthe rhine was nice and warmpretending she had been in it she ordered her to dry the dress and iron it why la miss youll never wear it again to be sure said rosa demurely i dont know said the young lady archly but i mean to take great care of it and burst out laughing like a peal of silver bells because she was in high spirits and saw what rosa would be at give away the gown she had been wooed and wet through inno thank you such gowns as these be landmarks my masters vizard unconscious of her arrival was walking up and down the room fidgeting more and more when in came zoe dressed high in black silk and white lace looking ever so cozy and blooming like a rose what said he in and dressed he took her by the shoulders and gave her a great kiss you young monkey said he i was afraid you were washed away zoe suggested that would only have been a woman obliterated that is true said he with an air of hearty conviction i forgot that he then inquired if she had had a nice walk oh beautiful imprisoned half the time in a cowshed and then drenched but ill have a nice walk with you dear up and down the room come on then so she put her right hand on his left shoulder and gave him her left hand and they walked up and down the room zoe beaming with happiness and affection for everybody and walking at a graceful bend severne came in dressed as perfect as though just taken out of a bandbox he sat down at a little table and read a little journal unobtrusively it was his cue to divest his late teteatete of public importance then came dinner and two of the party absent vizard heard their voices going like millclacks at this sacred hour and summoned them rather roughly as stated above his back was to zoe and she rubbed her hands gayly to severne and sent him a flying whisper oh what fun we are the culprits and they are the ones scolded dinner waited ten minutes and then the defaulters appeared nothing was said but vizard looked rather glum and aunt maitland cast a vicious look at severne and zoe they had made a forced march and outflanked her she sat down and bided her time like a fowler waiting till the ducks come within shot but the conversation was commonplace inconsecutive shifty and vague and it was two hours before anything came within shot all this time not a soul suspected the ambushed fowler at last vizard having thrown out one of his hints that the fair sex are imperfect fanny being under the influence of miss maitlands revelations ventured to suggest that they had no more faults than men and certainly were not more deceitful indeed said vizard notmoredeceitful do you speak from experience oh no no said fanny getting rather frightened i only think so somehow well but you must have a reason may i respectfully inquire whether more men have jilted you than you have jilted you may inquire as respectfully as you like but i shant tell you that is right miss dover said severne dont you put up with his nonsense he knows nothing about it women are angels compared with men the wonder is how they can waste so much truth and constancy and beauty upon the foul sex to my mind there is only one thing we beat you in we do stick by each other rather better than you do you are truer to us we are a little truer to each other not a little suggested vizard dryly for my part said zoe blushing pink at her boldness in advancing an opinion on so large a matter i think these comparisons are rather narrowminded what have we to do with bad people male or female a good man is good and a good woman is good still i do think that women have greater hearts to love and men perhaps greater hearts for friendship then blushing roseate even in the short time we have been here we have seen two gentlemen give up pleasure for selfdenying friendship lord uxmoor gave us all up for a sick friend mr severne did more perhaps for he lost that divine singer you will never hear her now mr severne the maitland gun went off a sick friend mr severne ha ha ha you silly girl he has got no sick friend he was at the gamingtable that was his sick friend it was an effective discharge it winged a duck or two it killed as follows the tranquillitythe good humorand the content of the little party severne started and stared and lost color and then cast at vizard a venomous look never seen on his face before for he naturally concluded that vizard had betrayed him zoe was amazed looked instantly at severne saw it was true and turned pale at his evident discomfiture her lover had been guilty of deceitmean and rather heartless deceit even fanny winced at the pointblank denunciation of a young man who was himself polite to everybody she would have done it in a very different wayinsinuations innuendo etc they have found you out old fellow said vizard merrily but you need not look as if you had robbed a church hang it all a fellow has got a right to gamble if he chooses anyway he paid for his whistle for he lost three hundred pounds three hundred pounds cried the terrible old maid where ever did he get them to lose severne divined that he had nothing to gain by fiction here so he said sullenly i got them from vizard but i gave him value for them you need not publish our private transactions ned said vizard miss maitland this is really not in your department oh yes it is said she and so youll find this pertinacity looked like defiance vizard rose from his chair bowed ironically with the air of a man not disposed for a hot argument in that casewith permissionill withdraw to my veranda and in that he struck a light peacefulhere he took a suck shade you will meditate on the charms of ina klosking vizard received this poisoned arrow in the small of the back as he was sauntering out he turned like a shot as if a man had struck him and for a single moment he looked downright terrible and wonderfully unlike the easygoing harrington vizard but he soon recovered himself what you listen do you said he and turned contemptuously on his heel without another word there was an uneasy chilling pause miss maitland would have given something to withdraw her last shot fanny was very uncomfortable and fixed her eyes on the table zoe deeply shocked at severnes deceit was now amazed and puzzled about her brother ina klosking inquired she who is that ask mr severne said miss maitland sturdily now mr severne was sitting silent but with restless eyes meditating how he should get over that figment of his about the sick friend zoe turned round on him fixed her glorious eyes full upon his face and said rather imperiously mr severne who is ina klosking mr severne looked up blankly in her face and said nothing she colored at not being answered and repeated her question all this time fannys eyes were fixed on the young man even more keenly than zoes whoand whatis ina klosking she is a public singer do you know her yes i heard her sing at vienna yes yes but do you know her to speak to he considered half a moment and then said he had not that honor but said he rather hurriedly somebody or other told me she had come out at the opera here and made a hit what insiebel i dont know but i saw large bills out with her name she made her debut in gounods faust it is my siebel cried zoe rapturously why aunt no wonder harrington admires her for my part i adore her you child that is quite a different matter no it is not he is like me he has only seen her once as i have and on the stage fiddledeedee i tell you he is in love with her over head and ears he is wonderfully inflammable for a womanhater ask mr severne he knows mr severne is my brother in love with that lady severnes turn had come that able young man saw his chance and did as good a bit of acting as ever was extemporized even by an italian mime miss vizard said he fixing his hazel eyes on her for the first time in a way that made her feel his power what passed in confidence between two friends ought to be sacred dontyouthink so the girl quivered remembering the secret he had confessed to her miss maitland has done your brother and me the honor to listen to our secrets she shall repeat them if she thinks it delicate but i shall not without vizards consent and more than that the conversation seems to me to be taking the turn of casting blame and ridicule and i dont know what on the besthearted kindesthearted truesthearted noblest and manliest man i know i decline to take any further share in it with these last words in his mouth he stuck his hands defiantly into his pockets and stalked out into the veranda looking every inch a man zoe folded her arms and gazed after him with undisguised admiration how well everything he did became him his firing uphis brusqueriethe very movements of his body all so piquant charming and unwomanly as he vanished from her admiring eyes she turned with flaming cheeks on miss maitland and said well aunt you have driven them both out at the window now say something pretty to fanny and me and drive us out at the door miss maitland hung her head she saw she had them all against her but fanny and fanny was a trimmer she said sorrowfully no zoe i feel how unattractive i have made the room i have driven away the gods of your idolatrythey are only idols of clay but that you cant believe i will banish nobody else except a crossgrained but respectable old woman who is too experienced and too much soured by it to please young people when things are going wrong with this she took her bedcandle and retired zoe had an inward struggle as miss maitland opened her bedroom door she called to her aunt one word was it you that ordered the fire in my bedroom now if she had received the answer she expected she meant to say then please let me forget everything else you have said or done today but miss maitland stared a little and said fire in your bedroom no oh then i have nothing to thank you for this day said zoe with all the hardness of youth though as a general rule she had not her share of it the old lady winced visibly but she made a creditable answer then my dear you shall have my prayers this night and it does not matter much whether you thank me for them or not as she disappeared zoe flung herself wearily on a couch and very soon began to cry fanny ran to her and nestled close to her and the two had a rock together zoe crying and fanny coaxing and comforting ah sighed zoe this was the happiest day of my life and see how it ends quarreling and deceit the one i hate the other i despise no never again until i have said my prayers and am just going to sleep will i cry o giorno felice as i did this afternoon when the rain was pouring on me but my heart was all in a glow these pretty little lamentations of youth were interrupted by mr severne slipping away from his friend to try and recover lost ground he was coolly received by zoe then he looked dismayed but affected not to understand then zoe pinched fanny which meant i dont choose to put him on his defense but i am dying to hear if he has anything to say thereupon fanny obeyed that significant pinch and said mr severne my cousin is not a woman of the world she is a country girl with oldfashioned romantic notions that a man should be above telling fibs i have known her longer than you and i see she cant understand your passing off the gamblingtable for a sick friend why i never did said he as bold as brass mr severne miss dover my sick friend was at the golden star thats a small hotel in a different direction from the kursaal i was there from seven oclock till nine you ask the waiter if you dont believe me fanny giggled at this inadvertent speech but zoes feelings were too deeply engaged to shoot fun flying fanny cried she eagerly i heard him tell the coachman to drive him to that very place the golden star really said fanny mystified indeed i did dear i remember the golden star distinctly ladies i was there till nine oclock then i started for the theater unfortunately the theater is attached to the kursaal i thought i would just look in for a few minutes in fact i dont think i was there half an hour but miss maitland is quite right in one thing i lost more than two hundred pounds all through playing on a false system of course i know i had no business to go there at all when i might have been by your side and heard la klosking it was devilish bad taste and you may well be surprised and offended no no not at that said zoe but hang it all dont make a fellow worse than he is why should i invent a sick friend i suppose i have a right to go to the kursaal if i choose at any rate i mean to go tomorrow afternoon and win a pot of money hinder me who can zoe beamed with pleasure that spiteful old woman i am ashamed of myself of course you have it becomes a man to say je veux and it becomes a woman to yield forgive our unworthy doubts we will all go to the kursaal tomorrow the reconciliation was complete and to add to zoes happiness she made a little discovery rosa came in to see if she wanted anything that you must know was rosas way of saying it is very late im tired so the sooner you go to bed the better and zoe was by nature so considerate that she often went to bed more for rosas convenience than her own inclination but this time she said sharply yes i do i want to know who had my fire lighted for me in the middle of summer why squire to be sure said rosa whatmy brother yes miss and seen to it all hisself leastways i found the things properly muddled twas to be seen a man had been at em rosa retired leaving zoes face a picture just then vizard put his head cautiously in at the window and said in a comic whisper is she gone yes she is gone cried zoe and you are wanted in her place she ran to meet him who ordered a fire in my room and muddled all my things said she severely i did what of that oh nothing only now i know who is my friend young people heres a lesson for you when a lady is out in the rain dont prepare a lecture for her like aunt maitland but light her fire like this dear old duck of a womanhating impostor kiss me violently therepest that is not enough nor half there and there and there and there and there and there now look here my young friend said vizard holding her lovely head by both ears you are exciting yourself about nothing and that will end in one of your headaches so just take your candle and go to bed like a good little girl must i well then i will goodby tyrant dear oh how i love you come fanny she gave her hand shyly to severne and soon they were both in zoes room rosa was dismissed and they had their chat but it was nearly all on one side fanny had plenty to say but did not say it she had not the heart to cloud that beaming face again so soon she temporized zoe pressed her with questions too but she slurred things zoe asked her why miss maitland was so bitter against mr severne fanny said in an offhand way oh it is only on your account she objects to him and what are her objections oh only grammatical ones dear she says his antecedents are obscure and his relatives unknown ha ha ha fanny laughed but zoe did not see the fun then fanny stroked her down never mind that old woman i shall interfere properly if i see you in danger it was monstrous her making an esclandre at the very dinnertable and spoiling your happy day but she hasnt cried zoe eagerly alls well that ends well i am happyoh so happy you love me harrington loves me he loves me what more can any woman ask for than to be ambata bene this was the last word between zoe and fanny upon st broochs day as fanny went to her own room the vigilant maitland opened her door that looked upon the corridor and beckoned her in well said she did you speak to zoe just a word before dinner aunt she came in wet to the skin and in higher spirits than rosa ever knew her aunt groaned and what do you think her spoiled dress she ordered it to be ironed and put by it is a case next day they all met at a late breakfast and good humor was the order of the day this encouraged zoe to throw out a feeler about the gamblingtables then fanny said it must be nice to gamble because it was so naughty in a long experience said miss dover with a sigh i have found that whatever is nice is naughty and whatever is naughty is nice theres a short code of morals observed vizard for the use of seminaries now let us hear severne he knows all the defenses of gambling lunacy has discovered severne thus appealed to said play was like other things bad only when carried to excess at homburg where the play is fair what harm can there be in devoting two or three hours of a long day to trente et quarante the play exercises memory judgment sangfroid and other good qualities of the mind above all it is on the square now buying and selling shares without delivery bulling and bearing and rigging and stock exchange speculations in general are just as much gambling but with cards all marked and dice loaded and the fair player has no chance the world said this youthful philosopher is taken in by words the truth is that gambling with cards is fair and gambling without cards a swindle he is hard upon the city said the vizard but no matter proceed young man develop your code of morals for the amusement of mankind while duller spirits inflict instruction you have got my opinion said severne oblige us with yours no mine would not be popular just now i reserve it till we are there and can see the lunatics at work oh then we are to go cried fanny oh be joyful that depends on miss maitland it is not in my department instantly four bright eyes were turned piteously on the awful maitland oh aunt said zoe pleadingly do you think there would be any great harm in ourjust for once in a way my dear said miss maitland solemnly i cannot say that i approve of public gambling in general but at homburg the company is select i have seen a german prince a russian prince and two english countesses the very elite of london society seated at the same table in the kursaal i think therefore there can be no harm in your going under the conduct of older personsmyself for example and your brother code three suggested vizardthe chaperonian code and a very good one too said zoe but aunt must we look on or may we play just a little little my dear there can be no great harm in playing a little in good companyif you play with your own money she must have one dig at severne i shant play very deep then said fanny for i have got no money hardly vizard came to the front like a man no more should i said he but for herries co as it is i am a croesus and i shall stand one hundred pounds which you three ladies must divide and between you no doubt you will break the bank acclamations greeted this piece of misogyny when they had subsided severne was called on to explain the game and show the young ladies how to win a fortune with thirtythree pounds six shillings and eight pence the table was partly cleared two packs of cards sent for and the professor lectured this said he is the cream of the game six packs are properly shuffled and properly cut the players put their money on black or red which is the main event and is settled thus the dealer deals the cards in two rows he deals the first row for black and stops the moment the cards pass thirty that deal determines how near noir can get to thirtyone severne then dealt for noir and the cards came as follows queen of heartsfour of clubsten of spadesnine of diamonds total thirtythree he then dealt for red knave of clubsace of diamondstwo of spadesking of spadesnine of hearts total thirtytwo red wins because the cards dealt for red come nearer thirtyone besides that said he you can bet on the color or against it the actual color of the first card the player turns up on the black line must be black or red whichever happens to be it is called the color say it is red then if the black line of cards wins color loses now i will deal again for both events i deal for noir nine of diamonds red then is the actual color turned up on the black line do you bet for it or against it i bet for it cried zoe its my favorite color and what do you say on the main event oh red on that too very good i go on dealing for noir queen of diamonds three of spades knave of heartsnine of spades thirtytwo that looks ugly for your two events black coming so near as thirtytwo now for red four of hearts knave of spades seven of diamonds queen of clubsthirtyone by jove rouge gagne et couleur there is nothing like courage you have won both events oh what a nice game cried zoe he then continued to deal and they all bet on the main event and the color staking fabulous sums till at last both numbers came up thirtyone thereupon severne informed them that half the stakes belonged to him that was the trifling advantage accorded to the bank which trifling advantage said vizard has enriched the maneating company and their prince and built the kursaal and will clean you all out if you play long enough that said severne i deny it is more than balanced by the right the players have of doubling till they gain and by the maturity of the chances i will explain this to the ladies you see experience proves that neither red nor black can come up more than nine times running when therefore either color has come up four times you can put a moderate stake on the other color and double on it till it must come by the laws of nature say red has turned four times you put a napoleon on black red gains you lose a napoleon you dont remove it but double on it the chances are now five to one you gain but if you lose you double on the same and when you have got to sixteen napoleons the color must change uniformity has reached its physical limit that is called the maturity of the chances begin as unluckily as possible with five francs and lose if you have to double eight times before you win it only comes to twelve hundred and eighty francs given therefore a man to whom fifty napoleons are no more than five francs to us he can never lose if he doubles like a trojan till the chances are mature this is called the martingale but observe it only secures against loss heavy gains are made by doubling judiciously on the winning color or by simply betting on short runs of it when red comes up back red and double twice on it thus you profit by the remarkable and observed fact that colors do not as a rule alternate but reach ultimate equality by avoiding alternation and making short runs with occasional long runs the latter are rare and must be watched with a view to the balancing run of the other color this is my system and you really think you have invented it asked vizard i am not so conceited my system was communicated to me in the kursaal itselfby an old gentleman an old gentleman or the oh harrington cried zoe fie my wit is appreciated at its value proceed ned severne told him a little defiantly it was an old gentleman with a noble head a silvery beard and the most benevolent countenance he ever saw curious place for his reverence to be in hazarded vizard he saw me betting first on the black then on the red till i was cleaned out and then he beckoned me not a man of premature advice anyway he told me he had observed my play i had been relying on the alternations of the colors which alternation chance persistently avoids and arrives at equality by runs he then gave me a better system and having expounded his system he illustrated it tell the truth now he sat down and lost the coat off his back it followed his family acres you are quite wrong again he never plays he has heartdisease and his physician has forbidden him all excitement his nation humph french ah the nation that produced le philosophe sans le savoir and now it has added le philosophe sans le vouloir and you have stumbled on him what a life for an aged man fortunatus ille senex qui ludicola vivit tantalus handcuffed and glowering over a gamblingtable a hell in a hell oh harrington exclamations not allowed in sober argument zoe come ned it is not heartdisease it is purse disease just do me a favor here are five sovereigns give those to the old beggar and let him risk them i could hardly take such a liberty with an old gentleman of his age and appearancea man of honor too and high sentiments why id bet seven to four he is one of napoleons old soldiers the ladies sided unanimously with severne what offer a vieux de lempire five pounds oh fie fiddledeedee said the indomitable vizard besides he will do it with his usual grace he will approach the son of mars with that feigned humility which sits so well on youth and ask him as a personal favor to invest five pounds for him at rougeetnoir the old soldier will stiffen into double dignity at first then give him a low wink and end by sitting down and gambling he will be cautious at starting as one who opens trenches for the siege of mammon but soon the veteran will get heated and give battle he will fancy himself at jena since the croupiers are prussians if he loses you cut him dead being a humdrum englishman and if he wins he cuts you and pockets the cash being a frenchman that talks sentiment this sally provoked a laugh in which severne joined and said really for a landed proprietor you know a thing or two he consented at last with some reluctance to take the money and none of the persons present doubted that he would execute the commission with a grace and delicacy all his own nevertheless to run forward a little with the narrative i must tell you that he never did hand that five pound to the venerable sire a little thing prevented himthe old man wasnt born yet and now said vizard it is our last day in homburg you are all going to gratify your manialunacy is contagious suppose i gratify mine do dear said zoe and what is it i like your asking that when it was publicly announced last night and i fled discomfited to my balcony and in my confusion lighted a cigar my mania isthe klosking that is not a mania it is good taste she is admirable yes in an opera but i want to know how she looks and talks in a room and that is insane of me then so you shall insane or not i will call on her this morning and take you in my hand what an ample palm and what juvenile audacity zoe you take my breath away no audacity at all i am sure of my welcome how often must i tell you that we have mesmerized each other that lady and i and only waiting an opportunity to rush into each others arms it began with her singling me out at the opera but i dare say that was owing at first only to my being in full dress no no to your being like agamemnon a head taller than all the other greeks harrington i am not a greek i am a thorough english girl at heart though i am as black as a coal no apology needed in our present frame you are all the more like the ace of spades do you want me to take you to the klosking sir then you had better not make fun of me i tell you she sung to me and smiled on me and courtesied to me and now you have put it into my head i mean to call upon her and i will take you with me what i shall do i shall send in my card i shall be admitted and you will wait outside as soon as she sees me she will run to me with both hands out and say in excellent french i hope how mademoiselle you have deigned to remember me and to honor me with a visit then i shall say in schoolfrench yes madame excuse the intrusion but i was so charmed with your performance we leave homburg tomorrow and as unfortunately for myself i cannot have the pleasure of seeing you again upon the stage then i shall stop for her to interrupt me then she will interrupt me and say charming things as only foreigners can and then i shall say still in schoolfrench madame i am not alone i have my brother with me he adores music and was as fascinated with your siebel as myself may i present him then she will say oh yes by all means and i shall introduce you then you can make love to her that will be droll fanny ill tell you every word he says make love to her cried vizard is this your estimate of a brothers motives my object in visiting this lady is not to feed my mania but to cure it i have seen her on the stage looking like the incarnation of a poets dream i am extasie with her now let me catch her en deshabille with her porter on one side and her lover on the other and so to devonshire relieved of a fatal illusion if that is your view ill go by myself for i know she is a noble woman and as much a lady off the stage as on it my only fear is she will talk that dreadful guttural german with its oches and its aches and then where shall we all be we must ask mr severne to go with us a good idea noa vile one he is abominably handsome and has the gift of the gabin german and other languages he is sure to cut me out the villain look him up somebody till we come back now harrington dont be absurd he must and shall be of the party i have my reasons mr severne said she turning on him with a blush and a divine smile you will oblige me i am sure severnes face turned as blank as a dolls and he said nothing one way or other it was settled that they should all meet at the kursaal at four to dine and play but zoe and her party would go on ahead by the oneoclock train and so she retired to put on her bonneta technical expression which implies a good deal fanny went with her and as events more exciting than the usual routine of their young lives were ahead their tongues went a rare pace but the only thing worth presenting to the reader came at the end after the said business of the toilet had been dispatched zoe said i must go now or i shall keep them waiting only one dear said fanny dryly why only one mr severne will not go that he will i made a point of it you did dear but still he will not go there was something in this and in fannys tone that startled zoe and puzzled her sorely she turned round upon her with flashing eye and said no mysteries please dear why wont he go with me wherever i ask him to go or rather what makes you think he wont said fanny thoughtfully i could not tell you all in a moment why i feel so positive one puts little things together that are nothing apart one observes faces i do at least you dont seem to me to be so quick at that as most girls but zoe dear you know very well one often knows a thing for certain yet one doesnt know exactly what makes one know it now zoes amour propre was wounded by fannys suggestion that severne would not go to homburg or indeed to the worlds end with her so she drew herself up in her grand way and folded her arms and said a little haughtily then tell me what is it you know about him and me without knowing how on earth you know it the supercilious tone and grand manner nettled fanny and it wasnt brooch day she stood up to her lofty cousin like a little gamecock i know this said she with heightened cheek and flashing eyes and a voice of steel you will never get mr edward severne into one room with zoe vizard and ina klosking zoe vizard turned very pale but her eyes flashed defiance on her friend that ill know said she in a deep voice with a little gasp but a world of pride and resolution chapter vii the ladies went down together and found vizard ready mr severne was not in the room zoe inquired after him gone to get a sunshade said vizard there said zoe to fanny in a triumphant whisper what is that for but to go with us fanny made no reply they waited some time for severne and his sunshade at last vizard looked at his watch and said they had only five minutes to spare come down and look after him he must be somewhere about they went down and looked for him all over the platz he was not to be seen at last vizard took out his watch and said it is some misunderstanding we cant wait any longer so he and zoe went to the train neither said much on the way to homburg for they were both brooding vizards good sense and right feeling were beginning to sting him a little for calling on the klosking at all and a great deal for using the enthusiasm of an inexperienced girl to obtain an introduction to a public singer he sat moody in his corner taking himself to task zoes thoughts ran in quite another channel but she was no easier in her mind it really seemed as if severne had given her the slip probably he would explain his conduct but then that fanny should foretell he would avoid her company rather than call on mademoiselle klosking and that fanny should be rightthis made the thing serious and galled zoe to the quick she was angry with fanny for prophesying truly she was rather angry with severne for not coming and more angry with him for making good fannys prediction zoe vizard was a good girl and a generous girl but she was not a humble girl she had a great deal of pride and her share of vanity and here both were galled besides that it seemed to her most strange and disheartening that fanny who did not love severne should be able to foretell his conduct better than she who did love him such foresight looked like greater insight all this humiliated and also puzzled her strangely and so she sat brooding as deeply as her brother as for vizard by the time they got to homburg he had made up his mind as they got out of the train he said look here i am ashamed of myself i have a right to play the fool alone but i have no business to drag my sister into it we will go somewhere else there are lots of things to see i give up the klosking zoe stared at him a moment and then answered with cold decision no dear you must allow me to call on her now i am here she wont bite me well but it is a strange thing to do what does that matter we are abroad come zoe i am much obliged to you but give it up no dear harrington smiled at her pretty peremptoriness and misunderstood it this is carrying sisterly love a long way said he i must try and rise to your level i wont go with you then i shall go alone what if i forbid you miss she tapped him on the cheek with her fingers dont affect the tyrant dear you cant manage it fanny said something that has mortified me i shall go you can do as you like but stop where does she live suppose i decline to tell you i am seized with a virtuous fita regular paroxysm then i shall go to the opera and inquire dear but coaxingly you will tell me dear there said harrington you wicked tempting girl my sham virtue has oozed away and my real mania triumphs she lives at the golden star i was weak enough to send harris in last night to learn zoe smiled he hailed a conveyance and they started at once for the golden star zoe said harrington gravely something tells me i am going to meet my fate all the better said zoe i wish you to meet your fate my love for my brother is not selfish i am sure she is a good woman perhaps i may find out something about what oh never mind chapter viii all this time ina klosking was rehearsing at the theater quite unconscious of the impending visit a royal personage had commanded il barbiere the part of rosina to be restored to the original key it was written for a contralto but transposed by the influence of grisi having no performance that night they began to rehearse rather later than usual and did not leave off till a quarter to four oclock ina who suffered a good deal at rehearsals from the inaccuracy and apathy of the people went home fagged and with her throat parchedso does a bad rehearsal affect all good and earnest artists she ordered a cutlet with potato chips and lay down on the sofa while she was reposing came joseph ashmead to cheer her with good photographs of her taken the day before she smiled gratefully at his zeal he also reminded her that he had orders to take her to the kursaal he said the tables would be well filled from five oclock till quite late there being no other entertainment on foot that evening ina thanked him and said she would not miss going on any account but she was rather fatigued and faint oh ill wait for you as long as you like said ashmead kindly no my good comrade said ina i will ask you to go to the manager and get me a little money and then to the kursaal and secure me a place at the table in the largest room there i will join you if he is not thereand i am not so mad as to think he will be therei shall risk a few pieces myself to be nearer him in mind this amazed ashmead it was so unlike her you are joking said he why if you lose five napoleons at play it will be your death you will grizzle so yes but i shall not lose i am too unlucky in love to lose at cards i mean to play this afternoon and never again in all my life sir i am resolved oh if you are resolved there is no more to be said i wont run my head against a brick wall ina being half a foreigner thought this rather brusk she looked at him askant and said quietly others besides me can be stubborn and get their own way while speaking the language of submission not i invented volition with this flea in his ear the faithful joseph went off chuckling and obtained an advance from the manager and then proceeded to the principal gamingtable and after waiting some time secured a chair which he kept for his chief an hour went by an hour and a half he was obliged for very shame to bet this he did five francs at a time and his risk was so small and his luck so even that by degrees he was drawn into conversation with his neighbor a young swell who was watching the run of the colors and betting in silver and pricking a card preparatory to going in for a great coup meantime he favored mr ashmead with his theory of chances and ashmead listened very politely to every word because he was rather proud of the others notice he was so handsome well dressed and well spoken meantime ina klosking snatched a few minutes sleep as most artists can in the afternoon and was awakened by the servant bringing in her frugal repast a cutlet and a pint of bordeaux on her plate he brought her a large card on which was printed miss zoe vizard this led to inquiries and he told her a lady of superlative beauty had called and left that card ina asked for a description ah madame said karl do not expect details from me i was too dazzled and struck by lightning to make an inventory of her charms at least you can tell me was she dark or fair madame she was dark as night but glorious as the sun her earthly abode is the russie at frankfort blest hotel did she tell you so indirectly she wrote on the card with the smallest pencil i have hitherto witnessed the letters are faint the pencil being inferior to the case which was golden nevertheless as one is naturally curious to learn whence a bright vision has emerged i permitted myself to decipher your curiosity was natural said ina dryly i will detain you with no more questions she put the card carefully away and eat her modest repast then she made her afternoon toilet and walked slowly and pensively to the kursaal nothing there was new to her except to be going to the table without the man on whom it was her misfortune to have wasted her heart of gold i think therefore it would be better for me to enter the place in company with our novices and indeed we must or we shall derange the true order of time and sequence of incidents for please observe all the english ladies of our story met at the kursaal while ina was reposing on her sofa the firstcomers were zoe and harrington they entered the noble hall inscribed their names and by that simple ceremony were members of a club compared with which the greatest clubs in london are petty things a club with spacious diningrooms ballrooms concertrooms gamblingrooms theater and delicious gardens the building that combined so many rich treats was colossal in size and glorious with rich colors and gold laid on with oriental profusion and sometimes with oriental taste harrington took his sister through the drawingrooms first and she admired the unusual loftiness of the rooms the blaze of white and gold and of celadon and gold and the great russian lusters and the mighty mirrors but when they got to the diningroom she was enchanted that lofty and magnificent salon with its daring mixture of red and black and green and blue all melted into harmony by the rivers of gold that ran boldly among them went to her very heart a greek is half an oriental and zoe had what may be called the courage of color glorious she cried and clasped her hands and see what a background to the emerald grass outside and the ruby flowers they seem to come into the room through those monster windows splendid said harrington to whom all this was literally greek im so excited ill order dinner dinner said zoe disdainfully and sat down and eyed the moresque walls around her and the beauties of nature outside and brought them together in one picture harrington was a long time in conclave with m chevet then zoe became impatient oh do leave off ordering dinner said she and take me out to that other paradise the chevet shrugged his shoulders with pity vizard shrugged his too to soothe him and after a few more hurried words took the lover of color into the garden it was delicious with green slopes and rich foliage and flowers and enlivened by bright silk dresses sparkling fitfully among the green leaves or flaming out boldly in the sun and as luck would have it before zoe had taken ten steps upon the greensward the band of fifty musicians struck up and played as fifty men rarely play together out of germany zoe was enchanted she walked on air and beamed as bright as any flower in the place after her first ejaculation at the sudden music she did not speak for a good while her content was so great at last she said and do they leave this paradise to gamble in a room leave it they shun it the gamblers despise the flowers how perverse people are excitement who wants any more than this zoe said vizard innocent excitement can never compete with vicious what is it really wicked to play i dont know about wicked you girls always run to the biggest word but if avarice is a vice gambling cannot be virtuous for the root of gambling is mere avarice weak avarice come my young friend as were quite alone ill drop thersites and talk sense to you for once child there are two roads to wealth one is by the way of industry skill vigilance and selfdenial and these are virtues though sometimes they go with tricks of trade hardness of heart and taking advantage of misfortune to buy cheap and sell dear the other road to wealth is by bold speculation with risk of proportionate loss in short by gambling with cards or without them now look into the mind of the gamblerhe wants to make money contrary to nature and unjustly he wants to be rewarded without merit to make a fortune in a moment and without industry vigilance true skill or selfdenial a penny saved is a penny gained does not enter his creed strip the thing of its disguise it is avarice sordid avarice and i call it weak avarice because the gambler relies on chance alone yet accepts uneven chances and hopes that fortune will be as much in love with him as he is with himself what silly egotism you admire the kursaal and you are right then do just ask yourself why is there nothing to pay for so many expensive enjoyments and very little to pay for concerts and balls low prices at the opera which never pays its own expenses even chevets dinners are reasonable if you avoid his sham johannisberg all these cheap delights the gold the colors the garden the music the lights are paid for by the losses of feebleminded avarice but therei said all this to ned severne and i might as well have preached sense to the wind harrington i will not play i am much happier walking with my good brother faute de mieux zoe blushed but would not hearand it is so good of you to make a friend of me and talk sense oh seea lady with two blues come and look at her before they had taken five steps zoe stopped short and said it is fanny dover i declare she has not seen us yet she is shortsighted come here and the impetuous maid dragged him off behind a tuft of foliage when she had got him there she said hotly that it was too bad oh is it said he very calmly what why dont you see what she has done you so sensible to be so slow about womens ways and you are always pretending to know them why she has gone and bought that costume with the money you gave her to play with sensible girl dishonest girl i call her there you go to your big words no no a little money was given her for a bad purpose she has used it for a frivolous one that is a step in the right directionjargon of the day but to receive money for one purpose and apply it to another iswhat do you call itchosedetournement des fondswhat is the english word ive been abroad till ive forgotten english oh i knowembezzlement well that is a big word for a small transaction you have not dug in the mine of the vernacular for nothing harrington if you dont mind i do so please come ill talk to her stop a moment said vizard very gravely you will not say one word to her and why not pray because it would be unworthy of us and cruel to her barbarously cruel what call her to account before that old woman and me why not she is flaunting her blues before you two and plenty more feminine logic zoe the point is thisshe is poor you must know that this comes of poverty and love of dress not of dishonesty and love of dress and just ask yourself is there a creature that ought to be pitied more and handled more delicately than a poor lady why you would make her writhe with shame and distress well i do think there is not a single wild animal so cruel to another wild animal as a woman is to a woman you are cruel to one another by instinct but i appeal to your reasonif you have any zoes eyes filled you are right said she humbly thank you for thinking for me i will not say a word to her before you that is a good girl but come now why say a word at all oh it is no use your demanding impossibilities dear i could no more help speaking to her than i could fly and dont go fancying she will care a pin what i say if i dont say it before a gentleman having given him this piece of information she left her ambush and proceeded to meet the allunconscious blue girl but even as they went vizard returned to his normal condition and doled out rather indolently that they were out on pleasure and might possibly miss the object of the excursion if they were to encourage a habit of getting into rages about nothing zoe was better than her word she met fanny with open admiration to be sure she knew that apathy or even tranquillity on first meeting the blues would be instantly set down to envy and where did you get it dear at quite a small shop french oh no i think she was an austrian this is not a french mixture loud discordant colors that is the french taste here is heresy said vizard why i thought the french beat the world in dress yes dear said zoe in form and pattern but fanny is right they make mistakes in color they are terribly afraid of scarlet but they are afraid of nothing else and many of their mixtures are as discordant to the eye as wagners music to the ear now after all scarlet is the king of colors and there is no harm in king scarlet if you treat him with respect and put a modest subject next to him gypsy locks for instance suggested fanny slyly miss maitland owned herself puzzled in my day said she no one ever thought of putting blue upon blue but really somehow it looks well may i tell you why auntbecause the dressmaker had a real eye and has chosen the right tints of blue it is all nonsense about one color not going with another nature defies that and how by choosing the very tints of each color that will go together the sweetest room i ever saw was painted by a great artist and do you know he had colored the ceiling blue and the walls green and i assure you the effect was heavenly but then he had chosen the exact tints of green and blue that would go together the draperies were between crimson and maroon but theres another thing in fannys dress it is velvet now blue velvet is blue to the mind but it is not blue to the eye you try and paint blue velvet you will be surprised how much white you must lay on the high lights of all velvets are white this white helps to blend the two tints of blue this is very instructive said vizard i was not aware i had a sister youthful but profound let us go in and dine fanny demurred she said she believed miss maitland wished to take one turn round the grounds first miss maitland stared but assented in a mechanical way and they commenced their promenade zoe hung back and beckoned her brother miss maitland said she with such an air she wants to show her blues to all the world and his wife very natural said vizard so would you if you were in a scarlet gown with a crimson cloak zoe laughed heartily at this and forgave fanny her new dress but she had a worse bone than that to pick with her it was a short but agreeable promenade to zoe for now they were alone her brother instead of sneering complimented her never you mind my impertinence said he the truth is i am proud of you you are an observer me ohin color never mind an observer is an observer and genuine observation is not so common men see and hear with their prejudices and not their senses now we are going to those gamingtables at first of course you will play but as soon as ever you are cleaned out observe let nothing escape that womans eye of yours and so well get something for our money harrington said the girl proudly i will be all eye and ear soon after this they went in to dinner zoe cast her eyes round for severne and was manifestly disappointed at his not meeting them even there as for fanny she had attracted wonderful attention in the garden and was elated her conscience did not prick her in the least for such a trifle as detournement des fonds and public admiration did not improve her she was sprightly and talkative as usual but now she was also a trifle brazen and pert all round and so the dinner passed and they proceeded to the gamingtables miss maitland and zoe led fanny and harrington followed for miss dover elated by the bluesthough bytheby one hears of them as depressingand encouraged by admiration and chevets violetperfumed st peray took harringtons arm really as if it belonged to her they went into the library first and after a careless inspection came to the great attraction of the place they entered one of the gamblingrooms the first impression was disappointing there were two very long tables rounded off at the ends one for trente et quarante and one for roulette at each table were seated a number of persons and others standing behind them among the persons seated was the dealer or in roulette the spinner this official sat in the center flanked on each side by croupiers with rakes but at each end of the table there was also a croupier with his rake the rest were players or lookerson most of whom by wellknown gradations of curiosity and weakness to describe which minutely would be to write a little comedy that others have already written were drawn into playing at last so fidgets the moth about the candle before he makes up what no doubt the poor little soul calls his mind our little party stopped first at trente et quarante and zoe commenced her observations instead of the wild excitement she had heard of there was a subdued air a forced quiet especially among the seated players a stern etiquette presided and the gamblers shrouded themselves in wellbred stoicismlosing without open distress or ire winning without open exultation the old hands especially began play with a padlock on the tongue and a mask upon the face there are masks however that do not hide the eye and miss vizard caught some flashes that escaped the masks even then at the commencement of the play still external stoicism prevailed on the whole and had a fixed example in the tailleur and the croupiers playing many hours every day in the year but goodfriday and always with other peoples money these men had parted with passion and almost with sensation they had become skillful automata chanting a stave and raking up or scattering haycocks of gold which to them were counters it was with the monotonous voice of an automaton they intoned faites le jeu messieu messieu then after a pause of ten seconds le jeu est fait messieu then after two seconds rien ne va plus then mumblemumblemumble then la rouge perd et couleur or whatever might be the result then the croupiers first raked in the players losses with vast expedition next the croupiers in charge of the funds chucked the precise amount of the winnings on to each stake with unerring dexterity and the indifference of machines and the chant recommenced faites le jeu messieu pause ten seconds le jeu est fait messieu pause two seconds rien ne va plus the tailleur dealt and the croupier intoned la rouge gagne et couleur perd the mechanical raking and dexterous chucking followed this with a low buzzing and the deadened jingle of gold upon green cloth and the light grating of the croupiers rakes was the first impression upon zoes senses but the mere game did not monopolize her attention many seconds there were other things better worth noting the great varieties of human type that a single passion had brought together in a small german town her ear was regaled with such a polyglot murmur as she had read of in genesis but had never witnessed before here were the sharp tuscan and the mellow roman the sibilation of england the brogue of ireland the shibboleth of the minories the twang of certain american states the guttural expectoration of germany the nasal emphasis of france and even the modulated hindoostanee and the sonorous spanish all mingling the types of face were as various as the tongues here were the greeneyed tartar the blackeyed italian and the grayeyed saxon faces all cheekbones and faces no cheekbones the red arabian the fair dane and the dark hindoo her womans eye seized another phenomenonthe hands not nations only but varieties of the animal kingdom were represented here were the white hands of fair women and the red paws of obese shopkeepers and the yellow birdlike claws of old withered gamesters all stretched out side by side in strange contrast to place the stakes or scratch in the winnings and often the winners put their palms or paws on their heap of gold just as a dog does on a bone when other dogs are nigh but what zoes eye rested on longest were the costume and deportment of the ladies a few were in good taste others aimed at a greater variety of beautiful colors than the fair have up to this date succeeded in combining without inflicting more pain on the beholders than a beneficent creatorso far as we can judge by his own system of colorintended the cultivated eye to suffer exampleas the old writers used to sayone lady fired the air in primrose satin with redvelvet trimming this mild mixture reappeared on her head in a primrose hat with a red feather a gold chain so big that it would have done for a felon instead of a fool encircled her neck and was weighted with innumerable lockets which in size and inventive taste resembled a poached egg and betrayed the insular goldsmith a train three yards long completed this gorgeous figure she had commenced life a shrimpgirl and pushed a dredge before her instead of pulling a silken besom after her another stately queen with an a heated the atmosphere with a burnous of that color the french call flamme denfer and cooled it with a green bonnet a third appeared to have been struck with the beauty of a painters palette and the skill with which its colors mix before the brush spoils them green body violet skirts rosecolored trimmings purple sleeves light green boots lavender gloves a shawl all gauze and gold flounced like a petticoat a bonnet so small and red feather so enormous and allpredominant that a peacock seemed to be sitting on a hedge sparrows nest zoe suspected these polychromatic ladies at a glance and observed their manners in a mistrustful spirit carefully she was little surprised though a good deal shocked to find that some of them seemed familiar and almost jocular with the croupiers and that although they did not talk loud being kept in order by the general etiquette they rustled and fidgeted and played in a devilmaycare sort of manner this was in great measure accounted for by the circumstance that they were losing other peoples money at all events they often turned their heads over their shoulders and applied for fresh funds to their male companions zoe blushed at all this and said to vizard i should like to see the other rooms she whispered to miss maitland surely they are not very select in this one lead on said vizard that is the way fanny had not parted with his arm all this time as they followed the others he said but she will find it is all the same thing fanny laughed in his face dont you see cest la chasse au severne qui commence en voila un severe replied he she was mute she had not learned that sort of french in her finishingschool i forgive it the next room was the same thing over again zoe stood a moment and drank everything in then turned to vizard blushed and said may we play a little now why of course fanny no you begin dear we will stand by and wish you success you are a coward said zoe loftily and went to the table with more changes of color than veteran lancers betray in charging infantry it was the roulette table she chose that seems a law of her sex the true solution is not so profound as some that have been offered it is this trente et quarante is not only unintelligible but uninteresting at roulette there is a pictorial object and dramatic incident the board the turning of the moulinet and the swift revolutions of an ivory ball its lowered speed its irregular bounds and its final settlement in one of the many holes numbered and colored here the female understanding sees something it can grasp and above all the female eye catches something pictorial and amusing outside the loss or gain and so she goes by her nature to roulette which is a greater swindle than the other zoe staked five pounds on no for an excellent reason she was in her twentyfirst year the ball was so illogical as to go into no and she lost she stood by her number and lost again she lost thirteen times in succession the fourteenth time the ball rolled into and the croupier handed her thirtyfive times her stake and a lot more for color her eye flashed and her cheek flushed and i suppose she was tempted to bet more heavily for she said no that will never happen to me again i know and she rose the richer by several napoleons and said now let us go to another humph said vizard what an extraordinary girl she will give the devil more trouble than most of you heres precocious prudence fanny laughed in his face cest la chasse qui recommence said she i ought to explain that when she was in england she did not interlard her discourse with french scraps she was not so illbred but abroad she had got into a way of it through being often compelled to speak french vizard appreciated the sagacity of the remark but he did not like the lady any the better for it he meditated in silence he remembered that when they were in the garden zoe had hung behind and interpreted fanny illnaturedly and here was fanny at the same game literally backbiting or backnibbling at all events said he to himself and these two are friends female friends and he nursed his misogyny in silence they came into a very noble room the largest of all with enormous mirrors down to the ground and a ceiling blazing with gold and the air glittering with lusters two very large tables and a distinguished company at each especially at the trente et quarante before our little party had taken six steps into the room zoe stood like a pointer and fanny backed should these terms seem disrespectful let fanny bear the blame it is her application of the word chasse that drew down the simile yes there sat ned severne talking familiarly to joseph ashmead and preparing to put the pot on as he called it now zoe was so far gone that the very sight of severne was a balsam to her she had a little bone to pick with him and when he was out of sight the bone seemed pretty large but when she saw his adorable face unconscious as it seemed of wrong the bone faded and the face shone her own face cleared at the sight of him she turned back to fanny and vizard arch and smiling and put her finger to her mouth as much as to say let us have some fun we have caught our truant let us watch him unseen a little before we burst on him vizard enjoyed this and encouraged her with a nod the consequence was that zoe dropped miss maitlands arm who took that opportunity to turn up her nose and began to creep up like a young cat after a bird taking a step and then pausing then another step and a long pause and still with her eye fixed on severne he did not see her nor her companions partly because they were not in front of him but approaching at a sharp angle and also because he was just then beginning to bet heavily on his system by this means two progressive events went on contemporaneously the arch but catlike advance of zoe with pauses and the betting of severne in which he gave himself the benefit of his system noir having been the last to win he went against the alternation and put fifty pounds on noir red won then true to his system he doubled on the winning color one hundred pounds on red black won he doubled on black and red won and there were four hundred pounds of his five hundred gone in five minutes on this proof that the likeliest thing to happenviz alternation of the colordoes sometime happen severne lost heart he turned to ashmead with all the superstition of a gambler for gods sake bet for me said he he clutched his own hair convulsively in a struggle with his mania and prevailed so far as to thrust fifty pounds into his own pocket to live on and gave ashmead five tens well but said ashmead you must tell me what to do no no bet your own way for me he had hardly uttered these words when he seemed to glare across the table at the great mirror and suddenly putting his handkerchief to his mouth he made a bolt sidewise plunged amid the bystanders and emerged only to dash into a room at the side as he disappeared a lady came slowly and pensively forward from the outer door lifted her eyes as she neared the table saw a vacant chair and glided into it revealing to zoe vizard and her party a noble face not so splendid and animated as on the stage for its expression was slumbering still it was the face of ina klosking no transformation trick was ever done more neatly and smoothly than this in which nevertheless the performers acted without concert severne fled out and the klosking came slowly in yet no one had time to take the seat she glided into it so soon after severne had vacated it zoe vizard and her friends stared after the flying severne then stared at the newcomer and then turned round and stared at each other in mutual amazement and inquiry what was the meaning of this double incident that resembled a conjurers trick having looked at her companions and seen only her own surprise reflected zoe vizard fixed her eyes like burningglasses upon ina klosking then that lady thickened the mystery she seemed very familiar with the man severne had been so familiar with that man contributed his share to the multiplying mystery he had a muddy complexion hair the color of dirt a long nose a hatchet face mean little eyes and was evidently not a gentleman he wore a brown velveteen shootingcoat with a magenta tie that gave zoe a pain in the eye she had already felt sorry to see her severne was acquainted with such a man he seemed to her the ne plus ultra of vulgarity and now behold the artist the woman she had so admired was equally familiar with the same objectionable person to appreciate the hopeless puzzle of zoe vizard the reader must be on his guard against his own knowledge he knows that severne and ashmead were two bohemians who had struck up acquaintance all in a minute that very evening but zoe had not this knowledge and she could not possibly divine it the whole thing was presented to her senses thus a vulgar man with a brown velveteen shootingcoat and a redhot tie was a mutual friend of the gentlemanly severne and the dignified klosking severne left the mutual friend mademoiselle klosking joined the mutual friend and there she sat where severne had sat a moment ago by the side of their mutual friend all manner of thoughts and surmises thronged upon zoe vizard but each way of accounting for the mystery contradicted some plain fact or other so she was driven at last to a womans remedy she would wait and watch severne would probably come back and somehow furnish the key meantime her eye was not likely to leave the klosking nor her ear to miss a syllable the klosking might utter she whispered to vizard in a very peculiar tone i will play at this table and stepped up to it with the word the duration of such beauty as zoes is proverbially limited but the limit to its power while it does last has not yet been discovered it is a fact that as soon as she came close to the table two male gamblers looked up saw her wondered at her and actually jumped up and offered their seats she made a courteous inclination of the head and installed miss maitland in one seat without reserve she put a little gold on the table and asked miss maitland in a whisper to play for her she herself had neither eye nor ear except for ina klosking that lady was having a discussion sotto voce with ashmead and if she had been one of your mumblers whose name is legion even zoes swift ear could have caught little or nothing but when a voice has volume and the great habit of articulation has been brought to perfection the words travel surprisingly zoe heard the lady say to ashmead scarcely above her breath well but if he requested you to bet for him how can he blame you zoe could not catch ashmeads reply but it was accompanied by a shake of the head so she understood him to object then after a little more discussion ina klosking said what money have you of mine ashmead produced some notes very well said the klosking now i shall take my twentyfive pounds and twentyfive pounds of his and play when he returns we shall at all events have twentyfive pounds safe for him i take the responsibility oh thought zoe then he is coming back ah i shall see what all this means she felt sick at heart zoe vizard was on the other side but not opposite mademoiselle klosking she was considerably to the right hand and as the newcomer was much occupied just at first with ashmead who sat on her left zoe had time to dissect her which she did without mercy well her costume was beautifully made and fitted on a symmetrical figure but as to color it was neutrala warm french gray and neither courted admiration nor risked censure it was unpretending her lace collar was valuable but not striking her hair was beautiful both in gloss and color and beautifully but neatly arranged her gloves and wristbands were perfect as every woman aims at appearance openly or secretly and every other woman knows she does zoe did not look at this meek dress with male simplicity unsuspicious of design but asked herself what was the leading motive and the question was no sooner asked than answered she has dressed for her golden hair and her white throat her hair her deep gray eyes and her skin are just like a flower she has dressed herself as the modest stalk she is an artist at the same table were a russian princess an english countess and a bavarian duchessall well dressed upon the whole but their dresses showed off their dresses the kloskings showed off herself and there was a native dignity and above all a wonderful seemliness about the klosking that inspired respect dress and deportment were all of a piecedecent and deep while zoe was picking her to pieces ina having settled matters with ashmead looked up and of course took in every other woman who was in sight at a single sweep she recognized zoe directly with a flush of pleasure a sweet bright expression broke over her face and she bowed to her with a respectful cordiality that was captivating zoe yielded to the charm of manner and bowed and smiled in return though till that moment she had been knitting her black brows at her in wonder and vague suspicion ina trifled with the game at first ashmead was still talking to her of the young swell and his system he explained it to her and how it had failed not but what said he there is a great deal in it most evenings but today there are no runs it is all turn and turn about if it would rain now you would see a change well said ina i will bet a few pounds on red then on black till these runs begin during the above conversation of which zoe caught little because ashmead was the chief speaker she cast her eyes all round the table and saw a curious assemblage of figures there was a solemn turk melting his piasters with admirable gravity there was the russian princess and there was a lady dressed in loud incongruous colors such as once drew from a horrified modiste the cry ah dieu quelle immoralite and thats a fact there was a popish priest looking sheepish as he staked his silver and an anglican rector betting flyers and as nonchalant in the blest absence of his flock and the baptist minister as if he were playing at whist with the old bishop of norwich who played a nightly rubber in my fathers dayand a very bad one there was a french count nearly six feet high to whom the word old would have been unjust he was antique and had turned into bones and leather but the hair on that dilapidated trunk was its own and zoe preferred him much to the lusty old english beau beside him with ivory teeth and ebon locks that cost a pretty penny there was a fat livid neapolitan betting heavily there was a creole lady with a fine oval face rather sallow and eyes and hair as black as zoes own indeed the creole excelled her by the addition of a little black fringe upon her upper lip that prejudice apart became her very well her front hair was confined by two gold threads a little way apart on which were fixed a singular ornament the vivid eyes of a peacocks tail set close together all round it was glorious regal the hussy should have been the queen of sheba receiving solomon and showing her peacocks eyes against his crownjewels like the lilies of the field these products of nature are bad to beat as we say on yorkshire turf indeed that frontlet was so beautiful and well placed it drew forth glances of marked disdain from every lady within sight of it zoe excepted she was placable this was a lesson in color and she managed to forgive the teacher in consideration of the lesson amid the gaudier birds there was a dovea young lady well dressed with quakerlike simplicity in gray silk dress with no trimmings a white silk bonnet and veil her face was full of virtues meeting her elsewhere you would say that is a good wife a good daughter and the making of a good mother her expression at the table was thoughtful and a little anxious but every now and then she turned her head to look for her husband and gave him so sweet a smile of conjugal sympathy and affection as made zoe almost pray they might win the husband was an officer a veteran with grizzled hair and mustache a colonel who had commanded a brigade in action but could only love and spoil his wife he ought to have been her father her friend her commander and marched her out of that curseall to the top of cader idris if need was instead of that he stood behind her chair like her lackey all day for his dove was as desperate a gambler as any in europe it was not that she bet very heavily but that she bet every day and all day she began in the afternoon and played till midnight if there was a table going she knew no day of religionno day of rest she won and she lost her own fortune and her husbands stood the money drain but how about the golden hours she was losing her youth and wasting her soul yet the administration gave her a warning they did not allow the irretrievable hours to be stolen from her with a noiseless hand at all souls college oxford in the first quadrangle grave thoughtful men raised to the top story two hundred years ago a grand sundial the largest perhaps and noblest in the kingdom they set it on the face of the quad and wrote over the long pointer in large letters of gold these words pereunt et imputantur which refer to the hours indicated below and mean literally they perish and go down to our account but really imply a little more viz that they are wasted and go to our debit these are true words and big wordsbigger than any royal commissioner has uttered up to dateand reach the mind through the senses and have warned the scholars of many a generation not to throw away the seedtime of their youth which never can come twice to any man well the administration of the kursaal conveyed to that lost english dove and others a note of warning which struck the senses as does the immortal warning emblazoned on the fair brow of that beautiful college only in the kursaal the warning struck the ear not the eye they provided french clocks with a singularly clear metallic striking tick their blows upon the life of time rang sharp above the chant the mumble and the jingle these clocks seemed to cry aloud and say of the hours whose waste they recorded pereunt et imputantur pere unt et imputantur reckless of this protest the waves of play rolled on and ere long sucked all our characters but vizard into the vortex zoe hazarded a sovereign on red and won then two on black and won then four on red and won she was launched and fanny too they got excited and bet higher the croupiers pelted them with golden coins and they began to pant and flush and their eyes to gleam the old gamblers eyes seem to have lost this powerthey have grown fishy but the eyes of these female novices were a sight fannys being light gray gleamed like a panthers whose prey is within leap zoes dark orbs could not resemble any wild beasts but they glowed with unholy fire and indeed all down the table was now seen that which no painter can conveyfor his beautiful but contracted art confines him to a moment of timeand writers have strangely neglected to notice viz the progress of the countenance under play many of the masks melted as if they had been of wax and the natural expressions forced their way some got flushed with triumph others wild and haggard with their losses one ghastly glaring loser sat quite quiet when his all was gone but clinched his hands so that the nails ran into the flesh and blood trickled discovering which a friend dragged him off like something dead nobody minded the fat old beau got worried by his teeth and pulled them out in a pet and pocketed them miss maitland who had begun with her gray hair in neat little curls deranged one so with convulsive hand that it came all down her cheek and looked most rakish and unbecoming even zoe and fanny had turned from lambs to leopardessespatches of red on each cheek and eyes like redhot coals the colors had begun to run and at first the players lost largely to the bank with one exception ina klosking discerned the change and backed the winning color then doubled on it twice she did this so luckily three or four times that though her single stake was at first only forty pounds gold seemed to grow around her and even notes to rise and make a cushion she too was excited though not openly her gloves were off and her own lovely hand the whitest in the room placed the stakes you might see a red spot on her cheekbone and a strange glint in her deep eye but she could not do anything that was not seemly she played calmly boldly on the system that had cleared out ned severne and she won heavily because she was in luck it was her hour and her vein by this time zoe and fanny were cleaned out and looked in amazement at the klosking and wondered how she did it miss maitland at her last sovereign began to lean on the victorious klosking and bet as she did her pile increased the dove caught sight of her game and backed her luck the creole backed her heavily presently there was an extraordinary run on black numbers were caught the klosking won three times and lost three times but the bets she won were double bets and those she lost were single then came a refait and the bank swept off half her stake but even here she was lucky she had only forty pounds on byandby came the event of the night black had for some time appeared to rule the roost and thrust red off the table and the klosking lost two hundred pounds the klosking put two hundred pounds on red it won she doubled red won she doubled there was a dead silence the creole lady put the maximum on red three hundred pounds red won ina klosking looked a little pale but driven by some unaccountable impulse she doubled so did the creole red won the automata chucked sixteen hundred pounds to the klosking and six hundred pounds to the other lady ina bet forty pounds on black red won again she put two hundred pounds on black black won she doubled black won again she doubled black won doubled again black won the creole and others stood with her in that last run and the money was chucked but the settlement was followed by a short whisper and a croupier in a voice as mechanical as ever chanted that the sum set apart for that table was exhausted for that day the klosking and her backers had broken the bank chapter ix there was a buzzing and a thronging round the victorious player ina rose and with a delicate movement of her milkwhite hand turned the mountain of gold and column of notes toward ashmead make haste please she whispered then put on her gloves deliberately while ashmead shoved the gold and the notes anyhow into the inner pockets of his shootingjacket and buttoned it well up allons said she calmly and took his arm but as she moved away she saw zoe vizard passing on the other side of the table their eyes met she dropped ashmeads arm and made her a sweeping courtesy full of polite consideration and a sort of courteous respect for the person saluted coupled with a certain dignity and then she looked wistfully at her a moment i believe she would have spoken to her if she had been alone but miss maitland and fanny dover had both of them a trick of putting on nolimetangere faces among strangers it did not mean much it is an unfortunate english habit but it repels foreigners they neither do it nor understand it those two faces not downright forbidding but uninviting turned the scale and the klosking who was not a forward woman did not yield to her inclination and speak to zoe she took ashmeads arm again and moved away then zoe turned back and beckoned vizard he joined her there she is said zoe shall i speak to her would you believe it he thought a moment and then said gloomily well no half cured now seen the lover in time so that opportunity was frittered away before the english party left the kursaal zoe asked timidly if they ought not to make some inquiry about mr severne he had been taken ill again ay taken ill and gone to be cured at another table said vizard ironically ill make the tour and collar him he went off in a hurry miss maitland faced a glass and proceeded to arrange her curl fanny though she had offered no opposition to vizards going now seized zoes arm with unusual energy and almost dragged her aside the idea of sending harrington on that fools errand said she peevishly why zoe where are your eyes zoe showed her by opening them wide what do you mean whatdoimean no matter mr severne is not in this building and you know it how can i know all is so mysterious faltered zoe how do you know becausethereleast said is soonest mended fanny you are older than me and ever so much cleverer tell me or you are not my friend wait till you get home then here he is vizard told them he had been through all the rooms the only chance now was the diningroom no said fanny we wish to get home we are rather tired they went to the rail and at first vizard was rather talkative making his comments on the players but the ladies were taciturn and brought him to a stand ah thought he nothing interests them now adonis is not here so he retired within himself when they reached the russie he ordered a petit souper in an hour and invited the ladies meantime they retiredmiss maitland to her room and fanny with zoe to hers by this time miss dover had lost her alacrity and would i verily believe have shunned a teteatete if she could but there was a slight paleness in zoes cheek and a compression of the lips which told her plainly that young lady meant to have it out with her they both knew so well what was coming that zoe merely waved her to a chair and leaned herself against the bed and said now fanny so fanny was brought to bay dear me said she piteously i dont know what to do between you and aunt maitland if i say all i think i suppose you will hate me and if i dont i shall be told im wicked and dont warn an orphan girl she flew at me like a bulldog before your brother she said i was twentyfive and i only own to twentythree and after all what could i say for i do feel i ought to give you the benefit of my experience and make myself as disagreeable as she does and i have given you a hint and a pretty broad one but you want such plain speaking i do said zoe so please speak plainly if you can ah you say that and i mean it never mind consequences tell me the truth like a man eh and get hated men are well worth imitating in some things tell me the truth pleasant or not and i shall always respect you bother respect i am like the rest of us i want to be loved a little bit but thereim in for it i have said too much or too little i know that well zoe the long and the short isyou have a rival zoe turned rather pale but was not so much shaken as fanny expected she received the blow in silence but after a while she said with some firmness mademoiselle klosking oh you are not quite blind then and pray which does he prefer asked zoe a little proudly it is plain he likes you the best but why does he fear her so this is where you seem all in the dark he flew out of the opera lest she should see him oh absurd he cut you and vizard rather than call upon her with you and so he did he flew from the gamblingtable the moment she entered the room behind him she came in behind him there was a large mirror in front of him oh fanny oh and zoe clasped her hands piteously but she recovered herself and said after all appearances are deceitful not so deceitful as men said fanny sharply but zoe clung to her straw might not two things happen together he is subject to bleeding at the nose it is strange it should occur twice so but it is possible zoe said fanny gravely he is not subject to bleeding at the nose oh thenbut how can you know that what right have you to say that ill show you said fanny and left the room she soon came back holding something behind her back even at the last moment she was half unwilling however she looked down and said in a very peculiar tone here is the handkerchief he put before his face at the opera there and she threw it into zoes lap zoes nature revolted against evidence so obtained she did not even take up the handkerchief what she cried you took it out of his pocket no then you have been in his room and got it nothing of the kind i sent rosa my maid mine for that job i gave her half a crown to borrow it for a pattern zoe seized the handkerchief and ran her eye over it in a moment there was no trace of blood on it and there were his initials e s in the corner her womans eye fastened instantly on these silk said she and held it up to the light no hairgolden hair it is hers and she flung the handkerchief from her as if it were a viper and even when on the ground eyed it with dilating orbs and a hostile horror la said fanny fancy that you are not blind now you have seen more than i i made sure it was yellow silk but this frivolous speech never even entered zoes ear she was too deeply shocked she went feebly and sat down in a chair and covered her face with her hands fanny eyed her with pity there said she almost crying i never tell the truth but i bitterly repent it zoe took no notice of this droll apothegm her hands began to work what shall i do she said what shall i do oh dont go on like that zoe cried fanny after all it is you he prefers he ran away from her ah yes but whywhy what has he done jilted her i suppose aunt maitland thinks he is after money and you know you have got money have i nothing else said the proud beauty and lifted her bowed head for a moment you have everything but you should look things in the face is that singer an unattractive woman oh no but she is not poor her kind of talent is paid enormously that is true said fanny but perhaps she wastes it she is a gambler like himself let him go to her said zoe wildly i will share no mans heart he will never go to her unlesswell unless we tell him that she has broken the bank with his money if you think so badly of him tell him then and let him go oh i am wretchedi am wretched she lifted her hands in despair and began to cry and sob bitterly fanny was melted at her distress and knelt to her and cried with her not being a girl of steady principle she went round with the wind dear zoe said she it is deeper than i thought la if you love him why torment yourself no said zoe it is deceit and mystery that torment me oh what shall i do what shall i do fanny interpreted this vague exclamation of sorrow as asking advice and said i dare not advise you i can only tell you what i should do in your place i should make up my mind at once whether i loved the man or only liked him if i only liked him i would turn him up at once turn him up what is that turn him off then if i loved him i would not let any other woman have the least little bit of a chance to get him for instance i would not let him know this old sweetheart of his has won three thousand pounds at least for i noted her winnings diamond cut diamond my dear he is concealing from you something or other about him and this klosking hide you this one little thing about the klosking from him till you get my gentleman safe to england and this is love i call it warfare and love is warfare three times out of four anyway it is for you to decide zoe i do wish you had never seen the man he is not what he seems he is a poor adventurer and a bundle of deceit you are very hard on him you dont know all no nor a quarter and you know less there dear dry your eyes and fight against it after all you know you are mistress of the situation ill settle it for you which way you like you will oh fanny you are very good say indulgent please im not good and never will be if i can possibly help i despise good people they are as weak as water but i do like you zoe vizard better than any other woman in the world that is not saying very much my taste is for men i think them gods and devils compared with us and i do admire gods and devils no matter dear kiss me and say fanny act for me and ill do it zoe kissed her and then by a truly virginal impulse hid her burning face in her hands and said nothing at all fanny gave her plenty of time and then said kindly well dear then zoe murmured scarce audibly actas ifi loved him and still she kept her face covered with her hands fanny was anything but surprised at this conclusion of the struggle she said with a certain alacrity very well i will so now bathe your eyes and come in to supper no no please go and make an excuse for me i shall do nothing of the kind i wont be told byandby i have done wrong i will do your business but it shall be in your hearing then you can interfere if you choose only you had better not put your word in till you see what i am driving at with a little more encouragement zoe was prevailed on to sponge her tearful eyes and compose herself and join harrington at supper miss maitland soon retired pleading fatigue and packing and she had not been gone long when fanny gave her friend a glance and began upon harrington you are very fond of mr severne are you not said she i am said vizard stoutly preparing for battle you are not perhaps fanny laughed at this prompt pugnacity oh yes i am said she devoted but he has a weakness you must own he is rather fond of gambling he is i am sorry to say it is his one fault most of us have two or three dont you think it would be a pity if he were to refuse to go with us tomorrowwere to prefer to stay here and gamble no fear of that he has given me his word of honor still i think it would be hardly safe to tempt him if you go and tell him that friend of his won such a lot of money he will want to stop and if he does not stop he will go away miserable you know they began betting with his money though they went on with their own oh did they what was his own money how much was it zoe fifty pounds well said vizard you must admit it is hard he should lose his own money and yet i own i am most anxious to get him away from this place indeed i have a project i want him to rusticate a few months at our place while i set my lawyer to look into his affairs and see if his estate cannot be cleared ill be bound the farms are underlet what does the admirable crichton know about such trifles fanny looked at zoe whose color was rising high at all this well said she when you gentlemen fall in love with each other you certainly are faithful creatures because we can count on fidelity in return said vizard he thought a little and said well as to the other thingyou leave it to me let us understand one another nothing we saw at the gamblingtable is to be mentioned by us no crichton is to be taken to england for his good yes and i am to be grateful to you for your cooperation in this you can if you like and you will secure an agreeable companion for the rest of the tour ehmy diplomatic cousin and my silent sister yes but it is too bad of you to see through a poor girl and her little game like that i own he is a charming companion fannys cunning eyes twinkled and zoe blushed crimson to see her noble brother manipulated by this artful minx and then flattered for his perspicacity from that moment a revulsion took place in her mind and pride fought furiously with lovefor a time this was soon made apparent to fanny dover when they retired zoe looked very gloomy so fanny asked rather sharply well what is the matter now didnt i do it cleverly yes yes too cleverly oh fanny i begin to revolt against myself this is nice said fanny go on dear it is just what i ought to have expected you were there you had only to interfere you didnt and now you are discontented not with you spare me you are not to blame and i am very unhappy i am losing my selfrespect oh if this goes on i shall hate him yes dearfor five minutes and then love him double come dont deceive yourself and dont torment yourself all your trouble we shall leave it behind us tomorrow and every hour will take us further from it with this practical view of matters she kissed zoe and hurried to bed but zoe scarcely closed her eyes all night severne did not reach the hotel till past eleven oclock and went straight to his own room chapter x ashmead accompanied mademoiselle klosking to her apartment it was lighted and the cloth laid for supper under the chandelier a snowwhite hamburg damask ashmead took the winnings out of his pocket and proudly piled the gold and crumpled notes in one prodigious mass upon the linen that shone like satin and made the gold look doubly inviting then he drew back and gloated on it the klosking too stood and eyed the pile of wealth with amazement and a certain reverence let me count it said ashmead he did so and it came to four thousand nine hundred and eightyone pounds english money and to think said he if you had taken my advice you would not have a penny of this ill take your advice now said she i will never gamble again well take my advice and lock up the swag before a creature sees it homburg is full of thieves she complied and took away the money in a napkin ashmead called after her to know might he order supper if you will be so kind ashmead rejoiced at this unguarded permission and ordered a supper that made karl stare the klosking returned in about half an hour clad in a crisp peignoir ashmead confronted her i have ordered a bottle of champagne said he her answer surprised him you have done well we must now begin to prove the truth of the old proverb ce qui vient de la flute sen va au tambour at supper mr ashmead was the chief drinker and by a natural consequence the chief speaker he held out brilliant prospects he favored the klosking with a discourse on advertising no talent availed without it large posters pictures windowcards etc but as her talent was superlative he must now endeavor to keep up with it by invention in his linethe puff circumstantial the puff poetic the puff anecdotal the puff controversial all tending to blow the fame of the klosking in every eye and ring it in every ear you take my advice said he and devote this money every penny of it to publicity dont you touch a single shiner for anything that does not return a hundred per cent publicity does when the article is prime you forget said she this money does not all belong to me another can claim half the gentleman with whom we are in partnership ashmead looked literally blue nonsense said he roughly he can only claim his fifty pounds nay my friend i took two equal sums one was his one mine that has nothing to do with it he told me to bet for him i didnt and i shall take him back his fifty pounds and say so i know where to find him where that is my business dont you go mad now and break my heart well my friend we will talk of it tomorrow morning it certainly is not very clear and perhaps after i have prayed and slept i may see more plainly what is right ashmead observed she was pale and asked her with concern if she was ill no not ill said she but worn out my friend i knew not at the time how great was my excitement but now i am conscious that this afternoon i have lived a week my very knees give way under me upon this admission ashmead hurried her to bed she slept soundly for some hours but having once awakened she fell into a halfsleepless state and was full of dreams and fancies these preyed on her so that she rose and dispatched a servant to ashmead with a line in pencil begging him to take an early breakfast with her at nine oclock as soon as ever he came she began upon the topic of last night she had thought it over and said frankly she was not without hopes the gentleman if he was really a gentleman might be contented with something less than half but she really did not see how she could refuse him some share of her winnings should he demand it think of it said she the poor man losesfour hundred pounds i think you said then he says bet you for me and goes away trusting to your honor his luck changes in my hands is he to lose all when he loses and win nothing when he wins merely because i am so fortunate as to win much however we shall hear what he says you gave him your address i said i was at the golden star growled ashmead in a tone that plainly showed he was vexed with himself for being so communicative then he will pay us a visit as soon as he hears so i need give myself no further trouble why should you wait till he comes said crafty ashmead ina klosking colored she felt her friend was tempting her and felt she was not quite beyond the power of temptation what was he like said she to turn the conversation the handsomest young fellow i ever saw young of course yes quite a boy at least he looked a boy to be sure his talk was not like a boys very precocious i should say what a pity to begin gambling so young oh he is all right if he loses every farthing of his own he will marry money any woman would have him you never saw such a curled darling dark or fair fair pinkandwhite like a girl a hand like a lady indeed fine eyes splendid what color i dont know lord bless you a man does not examine another mans eyes like you ladies however now i think of it there was one curious thing i should know him by anywhere and what was that well you see his hair was brown but just above the forehead he had got one lock that was like your owngold itself while he said this the kloskings face underwent the most rapid and striking changes and at last she sat looking at him wildly it was some time before he noticed her and then he was quite alarmed at her strange expression what is the matter said he are you ill no no no only a littleastonished such a thing as that is very rare that it is i never saw a case before not one in all your life asked she eagerly well no not that i remember excuse me a minute said ina klosking and went hurriedly from the room ashmead thought her manner very strange but concluded she was a little unhinged by yesterdays excitement moreover there faced him an omelet of enormous size and savory he thought this worthy to divide a mans attention even with the great creatures tantrums he devoted himself to it and it occupied him so agreeably that he did not observe the conduct of mademoiselle klosking on her return she placed three photographs softly on the table not very far from him and then resumed her seat but her eye never left him and she gave monosyllabic and almost impatient replies to everything he mumbled with his mouth full of omelet when he had done his omelet he noticed the photographs they were all colored he took one up it was an elderly woman sweet venerable and fairhaired he looked at ina and at the photograph and said this is your mother it is it is angelicas might be expected he took up another this is your brother i suppose stop haloowhat is this are my eyes making a fool of me he held out the photograph at arms length and stared from it to her why madam said he in an awestruck voice this is the gentlemanthe playerid swear to him ina started from her seat while he spoke ah she cried i thought somy edward and sat down trembling violently ashmead ran to her and sprinkled water in her face for she seemed ready to faint but she murmured no no and soon the color rushed into her face and she clasped her hands together and cried i have found him and soon the storm of varying emotions ended in tears that gave her relief it was a long time before she spoke but when she did her spirit and her natural strength of character took the upper hand where is he said she firmly he told me he was at the russie we will go there at once when is the next train ashmead looked at his watch in ten minutes we can hardly do it yes we can order a carriage this instant i will be ready in one minute they caught the train and started as they glided along ashmead begged her not to act too hurriedly and expose herself to insult who will dare insult me nobody i hope still i cannot bear you to go into a strange hotel hunting this man it is monstrous but i am afraid you will not be welcome something has just occurred to me the reason he ran off so suddenly was he saw you coming there was a mirror opposite ah we need not have feared he would come back for his winnings idiotvillain you stab me to the heart said ina he ran away at sight of me ah jesu pity me what have i done to him honest ashmead had much ado not to blubber at this patient cry of anguish though the woman herself shed no tear just then but his judgment was undimmed by passion and he gave her the benefit take my advice said he and work it this way come in a close carriage to the side street that is nearest the russie ill go in to the hotel and ask for him by his namewhat is his name mr edward severne and say that i was afraid to stake his money but a friend of mine that is a bold player undertook it and had a great run of luck there is money owing you says i and my friend has brought it then he is sure to come you will have your veil down ill open the carriagedoor and tell him to jump in and when you have got him you must make him hear reason ill give you a good chanceill shut the carriagedoor ina smiled at his ingenuityher first smile that day you are indeed a friend said she he fears reproaches but when he finds he is welcome he will stay with me and he shall have money to play with and amuse himself how he likes i kept too tight a rein on him poor fellow my good mother taught me prudence yes but said ashmead you must promise me one thing not to let him know how much money you have won and not to go like a goose and give him a lot at once it never pays to part with power in this wicked world you give him twenty pounds a day to play with whenever he is cleaned out then the money will last your time and he will never leave you oh how coldhearted and wise you are said she but such a humiliating position for him dont you be silly you wont keep him any other way i will be as wise as i can sighed ina i have had a bitter lesson only bring him to me and then who knows i am a change my love may revive his and none of these pitiable precautions may be needed they would lower us both ashmead groaned aloud i see said he hell soon clean you out ah well he cant rob you of your voice and he cant rob you of your ashmead they soon reached frankfort ashmead put her into a carriage as agreed and went to the russie ina sat with her veil down in the carriage and waited ashmeads return with severne he was a long time coming she began to doubt and then to fear and wonder why he was so long at last he came in sight he was alone as he drew nearer she saw his face was thoroughly downcast my dear friend he faltered you are out of luck today he will not come with you oh he would come fast enough if he was there but he is gone gone to homburg no unfortunately he is gone to england went off by the fast train an hour ago ina fell back in silence just as if she had been struck in the face he is traveling with an english family and they have gone straight home here are their names i looked in the visitors book and talked to the servant and all mr vizard miss vizard vizard yesmiss maitland miss dover see i wrote them all down oh i am unfortunate why was i ever born dont say that dont say that it is annoying but we shall be able to trace him now and besides i see other ways of getting hold of him ina broke in upon his talk take me to the nearest church she cried mans words are vain ah jesu let me cry to thee he took her to the nearest church she went in and prayed for full two hours she came out pale and listless and ashmead got her home how he could her very body seemed all crushed and limp ashmead left her sad at heart himself so long as she was in sight ashmead could think only of her misery but the moment she was out of sight he remembered the theater she was announced for rosina that very night he saw trouble of all sorts before him he ran to the theater in great alarm and told the manager she had been taken very ill he must change the bill impossible was the reply if she cant sing i close ashmead went back to the star ina was in her bedroom he sent in a line can you sing tonight if not he says he must close the reply came back in rather a trembling hand i suffer too much by falsehood to break faith myself i shall pray till night and then i shall sing if i die on the stage all the better for me was not this a great soul chapter xi that same morning our english party snatched a hasty breakfast in traveling attire severne was not there but sent word to vizard he should be there in time this filled the cup zoes wounded pride had been rising higher and higher all the night and she came down rather pale from broken rest and sternly resolved she had a few serious words with fanny and sketched her out a little map of conduct which showed that she had thought the matter well over but her plan bid fair to be deranged severne was not at the station then came a change zoe was restless and cast anxious glances but at the second bell he darted into the carriage as if he had just dispatched some wonderful business to get there in time while the train was starting he busied himself in arranging his things but once started he put on his sunny look and prepared to be as usual the life and soul of the party but for once he met a frost zoe was wrapped in impenetrable hauteur and fanny in polite indifference never was loss of favor more ably marked without the least illbreeding and no good handle given to seek an explanation no doubt a straightforward man with justice on his side would have asked them plumply whether he had been so unfortunate as to offend and how and this was what zoe secretly wished however she might seem to repel it but severne was too crafty for that he had learned the art of waiting after a few efforts at conversation and smooth rebuffs he put on a surprised mortified and sorrowful air and awaited the attack which he felt would come soon or late this skillful inertia baffled the fair in a man in a woman they might have expected it and after a few hours zoes patience began to wear out the train stopped for twenty minutes and even while they were snatching a little refreshment the dark locks and the blonde came very close together and zoe exasperated by her own wounded pride and the sullen torpor of her lover gave fanny fresh instructions which nobody was better qualified to carry out than that young lady as nobody was better able to baffle female strategy than the gentleman this time however the ladies had certain advantages to balance his subtlety and his habit of stating anything true or false that suited his immediate purpose they opened very catlike fanny affected to be outgrowing her illhumor and volunteered a civil word or two to severne thereupon zoe turned sharply away from fanny as if she disapproved her conduct and took a book this was pretty sly and done i suppose to remove all idea of concert between the fair assailants whereas it was a secret signal for the concert to come into operation it being fannys part to play upon severne and zoes to watch from her corner every lineament of his face under fire bytheway mr severne said fanny apropos of a church on a hill they were admiring did you get your winnings my winnings you are sarcastical am i really i did not intend to be no no forgive me but that did seem a little cruel miss dover i was a heavy loser not while we were there the lady and gentleman who played with your money won oh such a deal the devil they did yes did you not stay behind last night to get it we never saw you at the russie i was very ill bleeding at the nose no that always relieves me when it comes i am subject to fainting fits once i lay insensible so long they were going to bury me now do pray tell me what makes you fancy anybody won a lot with my money well i will you know you left fifty pounds for a friend to bet with severne stared but was too eager for information to question her how she knew this yes i did said he and you really dont know what followed good heavens how can i well then as you ran outto faint mademoiselle klosking came in just as she did at the opera you know the time before when you ran outto bleed she slipped into your chair the very moment you left it and your friend with the flaming necktie told her you had set him to bet with your money bytheby mr severne how on earth do you and mademoiselle klosking who have both so much taste in dress come to have a mutual friend vulgarity in person with a velveteen coat and an impossible necktie what are you talking about miss dover i do just know mademoiselle klosking i met her in society in vienna two years ago but that cad i commissioned to bet for me i never saw before in my life you are keeping me on tenterhooks my moneymy moneymy money if you have a heart in your bosom tell me what became of my money he was violent for the first time since they had known him and his eyes flashed fire well said fanny beginning to be puzzled and rather frightened this man who you say was a new acquaintance whom i say do you mean to tell me i am a liar he fumbled eagerly in his breastpocket and produced a card there said he this is the card he gave me mr joseph ashmead now may this train dash over the next viaduct and take you and miss vizard to heaven and me to hell if i ever saw mr joseph ashmeads face before the moneythe money he uttered this furiously and it is a curious fact but zoe turned red and fanny pale it was really in quite a cowed voice miss dover went on to say la dont fly out like that well then the man refused to bet with your money so then mademoiselle klosking said she would and she playedoh how she did play she doubled and doubled and doubled hundreds upon hundreds she made a mountain of gold and a pyramid of banknotes and she never stopped till she broke the bankthere with my money gasped severne yes with your money your friend with the loud tie pocketed it i beg your pardon not your friendonly hers harrington says he is her cher ami the money is mine he shrieked i dont care who played with it it is mine and the fellow had the impudence to send me back my fifty pounds to the russie what you gave him your address this with an involuntary glance of surprise at zoe of course do you think i leave a man fifty pounds to play with and dont give him my address he has won thousands with my money and sent me back my fifty for a blind the thief well really it is too bad said fanny but thereim afraid you must make the best of it of course their sending back your fifty pounds shows they mean to keep their winnings you talk like a woman said he then grinding his teeth and stretching out a long muscular arm he said ill take the blackguard by the throat and tear it out of him though i tear his life out along with it all this time zoe had been looking at him with concern and even with admiration he seemed more beautiful than ever to her under the influence of passion and more of a man mr severne said she be calm fanny has misled you without intending it she did not hear all that passed between those two i did the velveteen and necktie man refused to bet with your money it was mademoiselle klosking who bet and with her own money she took twentyfive pounds of her own and twentyfive pounds of yours and won two or three hundred in a few moments surely as a gentleman you cannot ask a lady to do more than repay you your twentyfive pounds severne was a little cowed by zoe s interference he stood his ground but sullenly instead of violently miss vizard if i were weak enough to trust a lady with my money at a gambling table i should expect foul play for i never knew a lady yet who would not cheat at cards if she could i trusted my money to a tradesman to bet with if he takes a female partner that is no business of mine he is responsible all the same and ill have my money he jumped up at the word and looked out at the window he even fumbled with the door and tried to open it you had better jump out said fanny and then they would keep my money for good no said he ill wait for the nearest station he sunk back into his seat looking unutterable things fanny looked rather rueful at first then she said spitefully you must be very sure of your influence with your old sweetheart you forget she has got another nowa tradesman too he will stick to the money and make her stick to it their sending the fifty pounds shows that zoes eyes were on him with microscopic power and with all his selfcommand she saw him wince and change color and give other signs that this shaft had told in many ways he shut his countenance the next moment but it had opened and zoe was on fire with jealousy and suspicion fluctuating fanny regretted the turn things had taken she did not want to lose a pleasant male companion and she felt sure zoe would be unhappy and cross to her if he went surely mr severne she said you will not desert us and go back for so small a chance why we are a hundred and fifty miles from homburg and all the nearer to dear old england there therewe must be kinder to you and make you forget this misfortune thus spoke the trimmer the reply took her by surprise and whose fault is it that i am obliged to get out a hundred and fifty miles from homburg you knew all this you could have got me a delay of a few hours to go and get my due you know i am a poor man with all your cleverness you dont know what made me poor or you would feel some remorse perhaps but you know i am poor when most i could wish i were rich you have heard that old woman there fling my poverty in my teeth yet you could keep this from mejust to assist a cheat and play upon the feelings of a friend now what good has that done you to inflict misery on me in sport on a man who never gave you a moments pain if he could help it fanny looked ruefully this way and that her face began to work and she laid down her arms if a lady can be said to do that who lays down a strong weapon and takes up a stronger in other words she burst out crying and said no more you see she was poor herself severne took no notice of her he was accustomed to make women cry he thrust his head out of the window in hopes of seeing a station near and his whole being was restless as if he would like to jump out while he was in this condition of mind and body the hand he had once kissed so tenderly and shocked miss maitland passed an envelope over his shoulder with two lines written on it in pencil if you go back to homburg oblige me by remaining there this demands an explanation but it shall be brief fannys shrewd hint that the money could only be obtained from mdlle klosking had pierced zoe through and through her mind grasped all that had happened all that impended and wisely declining to try and account for or reconcile all the jarring details she settled with a womans broad instinct that somehow or other his going back to homburg meant going back to mademoiselle klosking whether that lady would buy him or not she did not know but going back to her meant going a journey to see a rival with consequences illimitable she had courage she had pride she had jealousy she resolved to lose her lover or have him all to herself share him she would not nor even endure the torture of the doubt she took an envelope out of her satchel and with the pencil attached to her chatelaine wrote the fatal words if you go back to homburg oblige me by remaining there at this moment she was not goaded by pique or any petty feeling indeed his reproach to fanny had touched her a little and it was with the tear in her eye she came to the resolution and handed him that line which told him she knew her value and cost what it might would part with any man forever rather than share him with the klosking or any other woman severne took the line eyed it realized it fell back from the window and dropped into his seat this gave zoe a consoling sense of power she had seen her lover raging and restless and wanting to jump out yet now beheld him literally felled with a word from her hand he leaned his head in his hand in a sort of brokendown collapsed dogged way that moved her pity though hardly her respect byandby it struck her as a very grave thing that he did not reply by word nor even by look he could decide with a glance and why did he hesitate was he really balancing her against mademoiselle klosking weighted with a share of his winnings this doubt was wormwood to her pride and selfrespect but his crushed attitude allayed in some degree the mere irritation his doubt caused the minutes passed and the miles still that broken figure sat before her with his face hidden by his white hand zoes courage began to falter misgivings seized her she had made that a matter of love which after all to a man might be a mere matter of business he was poor too and she had thrust her jealousy between him and money he might have his pride too and rebel against her affront as for his thoughts under that crushed exterior which he put on for a blind they were so deliberate and calculating that i shall not mix them on this page with that pure and generous creatures another time will do to reveal his sordid arithmetic as for zoe she settled down into wishing with all her heart she had not submitted her lover so imperiously to a test the severity of which she now saw she had underrated presently the speed of the train began to slackenall too soon she now dreaded to learn her fate was she or was she not worth a few thousand pounds ready money a signalpost was past proving that they were about to enter a station yet another now the wheels were hardly turning now the platform was visible yet he never moved his white delicate womanish fingers from his forehead but remained still absorbed and looked undecided at last the motion entirely ceased then as she turned her head to glean if possible the name of the place he stole a furtive glance at her she was pallid agitated he resolved upon his course as soon as the train stopped he opened the door and jumped out without a word to zoe or even a look zoe turned pale as death i have lost him said she no no cried fanny see he has not taken his cane and umbrella they will not keep him from flying to his money and her moaned zoe did you not see he never once looked at me he could not i am sick at heart this set fanny fluttering there let me out to speak to him sit quiet said zoe sternly no no if you love him i do love himpassionately and therefore ill die rather than share him with any one but it is dreadful to be fixed here and not allowed to move hand or foot it is the lot of women let me feel the hand of a friend that is all for i am sick at heart fanny gave her her hand and all the sympathy her shallow nature had to bestow zoe sat motionless gripping her friends hand almost convulsively a statue of female fortitude this suspense could not last long the officials ordered the travelers to the carriages doors were opened and slammed the engine gave a snort and only at that moment did mr edward severne tear the door open and bolt into the carriage oh it was pitiable but lovely to see the blood rush into zoes face and the fire into her eye and the sweet mouth expand in a smile of joy and triumph she sat a moment almost paralyzed with pleasure and then cast her eyes down lest their fire should proclaim her feelings too plainly as for severne he only glanced at her as he came in and then shunned her eye he presented to her the grave resolved countenance of a man who has been forced to a decision but means to abide by it in reality he was delighted at the turn things had taken the money was not necessarily lost since he knew where it was and zoe had compromised herself beyond retreating he intended to wear this anxious face a long while but his artificial snow had to melt so real a sun shone full on it the moment he looked full at zoe she repaid him with such a pointblank beam of glorious tenderness and gratitude as made him thrill with passion as well as triumph he felt her whole heart was his and from that hour his poverty would never be allowed to weigh with her he cleared up and left off acting because it was superfluous he had now only to bask in sunshine zoe always tender but coy till this moment made love to him like a young goddess even fanny yielded to the solid proof of sincerity he had given and was downright affectionate he was king and from one gradation to another they entered cologne with severne seated between the two girls each with a hand in his and a great disposition to pet him and spoil him more than once indeed a delicate head just grazed each of his square shoulders but candor compels me to own that their fatigue and the yawing of the carriage at the time were more to blame than the tired girls for at the enormity there was a prompt retirement to a distance miss maitland had been a long time in the land of nod and vizard from the first had preferred male companions and tobacco at cologne they visited the pride of germany that mighty cathedral which the middle ages projected commenced and left to decay of old age before completion and our enterprising age will finish but they departed on the same day before they reached england the lovemaking between severne and zoe though it never passed the bounds of good taste was so apparent to any female eye that miss maitland remonstrated severely with fanny but the trimmer was now won to the other side she would not offend aunt maitland by owning her conversion she said hypocritically i am afraid it is no use objecting at present aunt the attachment is too strong on both sides and whether he is poor or not he has sacrificed his money to her feelings and so now she feels bound in honor i know her she wont listen to a word now aunt why irritate her she would quarrel with both of us in a moment poor girl said miss maitland and took the hint she had still an arrow in her quivervizard in midchannel ten miles south of dover she caught him in a lucid interval of nonsmoke she reminded him he had promised her to give mr severne a hint about zoe so i did said he and have you well no to tell the truth i forgot then please do it now for they are going on worse than ever ill warn the fool said he he did warn him and in the following terms look here old fellow i hear you are getting awfully sweet on my sister zoe no answer severne on his guard now you had better mind your eye she is a very pretty girl and you may find yourself entangled before you know where you are severne hung his head of course i know it is great presumption in me presumption fiddlestick such a man as you are ought not to be tied to any woman or if you must be you ought not to go cheap mind zoe is a poor girl only ten thousand in the world flirt with whom you likethere is no harm in that but dont get seriously entangled with any of them good sisters and good daughters and good flirts make bad wives oh then said severne it is only on my account you object well principally and i dont exactly object i warn in the first place as soon as ever we get into barfordshire she will most likely jilt you you may be only her continental lover how can i tell or you either and if not and you were to be weak enough to marry her she would develop unexpected vices directlythey all do and you are not rich enough to live in a house of your own you would have to live in minea fine fate for a rising blade like you what a terrible prospectto be tied to the best friend in england as well as the loveliest woman oh if that is the view you take said vizard beaming with delight it is no use talking reason to you when they reached london vizard gave miss maitland an outline of this conversation and so far from seeing the humor of it which nevertheless was pretty strong and characteristic of the man and his one foible she took the huff and would not even stay to dinner at the hotel she would go into her own county by the next train bag and baggage mr severne was the only one who offered to accompany her to the great western railway she declined he insisted went with her got her ticket numbered and arranged her packages and saw her safely off with an air of profound respect and admirably feigned regret that she was the dupe of his art may be doubted that he lost nothing by it is certain men are not ruined by civility as soon as she was seated she said i beg sir you will waste no more time with me mr severne you have behaved to me like a gentleman and that is very unusual in a man of your age nowadays i cannot alter my opinion about my niece and you but i am sorry you are a poor gentlemanmuch too poor to marry her and i wish i could make you a rich one but i cannot there is my hand you should have seen the air of tender veneration with which the young machiavel bowed over her hand and even imprinted a light touch on it with his velvet lips then he retired disconsolate and once out of sight whipped into a ginpalace and swallowed a quartern of neat brandy to take the taste out of his mouth go it ned said he to himself you cant afford to make enemies the old lady went off bitter against the whole party except mr severne and he retired to his friends disembarrassed of the one foe he had not turned into a downright friend but only disarmed well does the great voltaire recommend what he well calls le grand art de plaire vizard sent harris into barfordshire to prepare for the comfort of the party and to light fires in all the bedrooms though it was summer and to see the beds blankets and sheets aired at the very fires of the very rooms they were to be used in this sacred office he never trusted to a housekeeper he used even to declare as the result of experience that it was beyond the intellect of any woman really to air mattresses blankets and sheetsall three he had also a printed list he used to show about of five acquaintances stout fellows all whom little bits of women such was his phraseology had laid low with damp beds having crippled two for life with rheumatism and lumbago and sent three to their long home meantime severne took the ladies to every public attraction by day and night and vizard thanked him before the fair for his consideration in taking them off his hands and severne retorted by thanking him for leaving them on his it may seem at first a vile selection but i am going to ask the ladies who honor me with their attention to follow not that gay amorous party of three but this solitary cynic on his round taking a turn round the garden in leicester square which was new to him harrington vizards observant eye saw a young lady rise up from a seat to go but turn pale directly and sit down again upon the arm of the seat as if for support halloo said vizard in his blunt way you are not well what can i do for you i am all right said she please go on the latter words in a tone that implied she was not a novice and the attentions of gentlemen to strange ladies were suspected i beg your pardon said vizard coolly you are not all right you look as if you were going to faint what are my lips blue no but they are pale well then it is not a case of fainting it may be exhaustion you know best what shall we do why nothing yes mind our own business with all my heart my business just now is to offer you some restorativea glass of wine oh yes i think i see myself going into a publichouse with you besides i dont believe in stimulants strength can only enter the human body one way i know what is the matter with me what is it i am not obliged to tell you of course you are not obliged but you might as well well then it is hunger hunger hungerfaminestarvation dont you know english i hope you are not serious madam said vizard very gravely however if ladies will say such things as that men with stomachs in their bosoms must act accordingly oblige me by taking my arm as you are weak and we will adjourn to that eatinghouse over the way much obliged said the lady satirically our acquaintance is not quite long enough for that he looked at her a tall slim young lady black merino by no means new clean cuffs and collar leaning against the chair for support and yet sacrificing herself to conventional propriety and even withstanding him with a pretty little air of defiance that was pitiable her pallor and the weakness of her body considered the poor womanhaters bowels began to yearn look here you little spitfire said he if you dont instantly take my arm ill catch you up and carry you over with no more trouble than you would carry a threadpaper she looked him up and down very keenly and at last with a slight expression of feminine approval the first she had vouchsafed him then she folded her arms and cocked her little nose at him you darent ill call the police if you do ill tell them you are my little cousin mad as a march hare starving and wont eat come how is it to be he advanced upon her you cant be in earnest sir said she with sudden dignity am i not though you dont know me i am used to be obeyed if you dont go with me like a sensible girl ill carry youto your dinnerlike a ruffian then ill golike a lady said she with sudden humility he offered her his arm she passed hers within but leaned as lightly as possible on it and her poor pale face was a little pink as they went he entered the eatinghouse and asked for two portions of cold roast beef not to keep her waiting they were brought sir said she with a subjugated air will you be so good as cut up the meat small and pass it to me a bit or two at a time he was surprised but obeyed her orders and if you could make me talk a little because at sight of the meat so near me i feel like a tigresspoor human nature sir i have not eaten meat for a week nor food of any kind this two days good god so i must be prudent people have gorged themselves with furious eating under those circumstances that is why i asked you to supply me slowly thank you you need not look at me like that better folk than i have died of hunger something tells me i have reached the lowest spoke when i have been indebted to a stranger for a meal vizard felt the water come into his eyes but he resisted that pitiable weakness bother that nonsense said he ill introduce myself and then you cant throw stranger in my teeth i am harrington vizard a barfordshire squire i thought you were not a cockney lord forbid does that information entitle me to any in return i dont know but whether or no my name is rhoda gale have another plate miss gale thanks he ordered another i am proud of your confiding your name to me miss gale but to tell the truth what i wanted to know is how a young lady of your talent and education could be so badly off as you must be it is not impertinent curiosity the young lady reflected a moment sir said she i dont think it is and i would not much mind telling you of course i studied you before i came here even hunger would not make me sit in a tavern beside a fool or a snob or with a faint blush a libertine but to tell ones own story that is so egotistical for one thing oh it is never egotistical to oblige now that is sophistical then again i am afraid i could not tell it to you without crying because you seem rather a manly man and some of it might revolt you and you might sympathize right out and then i should break down no matter do us both good yes but before the waiters and people see how they are staring at us already we will have another go in at the beef and then adjourn to the garden for your narrative no as much garden as you like but no more beef i have eaten one sirloin i reckon will you give me one cup of black tea without sugar or milk vizard gave the order she seemed to think some explanation necessary though he did not one cup of tea agrees with my brain and nerves said she it steadies them that is a matter of individual experience i should not prescribe it to others any the more for that vizard sat wondering at the girl he said to himself what is she a lusus naturoe when the tea came and she had sipped a little she perked up wonderfully said she oh the magic effect of food eaten judiciously now i am a lioness and do not fear the future yes i will tell you my storyand if you think you are going to hear a lovestory you will be nicely caughthaha no sir said she with rising fervor and heightened color you will hear a story the public is deeply interested in and does not know it ay a story that will certainly be referred to with wonder and shame whenever civilization shall become a reality and law cease to be a tool of injustice and monopoly she paused a moment then said a little doggedly as one used to encounter prejudice i am a medical student a wouldbe doctor ah and so well qualified by genuine gifts by study from my infancy by zeal quick senses and cultivated judgment that were all the leading london physicians examined tomorrow by qualified persons at the same board as myself most of those wealthy practitionersnot all mind youwould cut an indifferent figure in modern science compared with me whom you have had to rescue from starvationbecause i am a woman her eye flashed but she moderated herself and said that is the outline and it is a grievance now grievances are bores you can escape this one before it is too late if it lies with me i demand the minutest details said vizard warmly you shall have them and true to the letter vizard settled the small account and adjourned with his companion to the garden she walked by his side with her face sometimes thoughtfully bent on the ground and sometimes confronting him with ardor and told him a true story the simplicity of which i shall try not to spoil with any vulgar arts of fiction a little narrative of dry facts told to a womanhater by a woman chapter xii my father was an american my mother english i was born near epsom and lived there ten years then my father had property left him in massachusetts and we went to boston both my parents educated me and began very early i observe that most parents are babies at teaching compared with mine my father was a linguist and taught me to lisp german french and english my mother was an ideaed woman she taught me three raritiesattention observation and accuracy if i went a walk in the country i had to bring her home a budget the men and women on the road their dresses appearance countenances and words every kind of bird in the air and insect and chrysalis in the hedges the crops in the fields the flowers and herbs on the banks if i walked in the town i must not be eyes and no eyes woe betide me if i could only report the dresses really i have known me when i was but eight come home to my mother laden with details when perhaps an untrained girl of eighteen could only have specified that she had gone up and down a thoroughfare another time mother would take me on a visit next day or perhaps next week she would expect me to describe every article of furniture in her friends room and the books on the table and repeat the conversation the topics at all events she taught me to master history accurately to do this she was artful enough to turn sport into science she utilized a game young people in boston play it a writes an anecdote on paper or perhaps produces it in print she reads it off to b b goes away and writes it down by memory then reads her writing out to c c has to listen and convey her impression to paper this she reads to d and d goes and writes it then the original story and ds version are compared and generally speaking the difference of the two is a cautionagainst oral tradition when the steps of deviation are observed it is quite a study my mother with her good wit saw there was something better than fun to be got out of this she trained my memory of great things with it she began with striking passages of history and played the game with father and me but as my power of retaining and repeating correctly grew by practice she enlarged the business and kept enriching my memory so that i began to have tracts of history at my fingers ends as i grew older she extended the sport to laws and the great public controversies in religion politics and philosophy that have agitated the world but here she had to get assistance from her learned friends she was a woman valued by men of intellect and she had no mercymilked jurists physicians and theologians and historians all into my little pail to be sure they were as kind about it as she was unscrupulous they saw i was a keen student and gave my mother many a little gem in writing she read them out to me i listened hard and thus i fixed many great and good things in my trained memory and repeated them against the text i was never allowed to see that with this sharp training school subjects were childs play to me and i won a good many prizes very easily my mother would not let me waste a single minute over music she used to say music extracts what little brains a girl has open the piano you shut the understanding i am afraid i bore you with my mother not at all not at all i admire her oh thank you thank you sir she never uses big words so it is only of late i have had the nous to see how wise she is she corrected the special blots of the female character in me and it is sweet to me to talk of that dear friend what would i give to see her here well then sir she made me as far as she could awhat shall i say a kind of little intellectual gymnast fit to begin any study but she left me to choose my own line well i was for natural history first began like a girl gathered wild flowers and simples at epsom along with an old woman she discoursed on their traditional virtues and knew little of their real properties that i have discovered since from herbs to living things never spared a chrysalis but always took it home and watched it break into wings hung over the ponds in june watching the eggs of the frog turn to tadpoles and the tadpoles to johnny crapaud i obeyed scripture in one thing for i studied the ants and their ways i collected birds eggs at nine not a boy in the parish could find more nests in a day than i could with birdnesting buying and now and then begging i made a collection that figures in a museum over the water and is entitled eggs of british birds the colors attract and people always stop at it but it does no justice whatever to the great variety of seabirds eggs on the coast of britain when i had learned what little they teach in schools especially drawing and that is useful in scientific pursuits i was allowed to choose my own books and attend lectures one blessed day i sat and listened to agassizah no tragedy well played nor opera sung ever moved a heart so deeply as he moved mine that great and earnest man whose enthusiasm for nature was as fresh as my own and his knowledge a thousand times larger talk of heaven opening to the christian pilgrim as he passes jordan why god made earth as well as heaven and it is worthy of the architect and it is a joy divine when earth opens to the true admirer of gods works sir earth opened to me as agassiz discoursed i followed him about like a little bloodhound and dived into the libraries after each subject he treated or touched it was another little epoch in my life when i read whites letters to pennant about natural history in selborne selborne is an english village not half so pretty as most and until gilbert white came nobody saw anything there worth printing his book showed me that the humblest spot in nature becomes extraordinary the moment extraordinary observation is applied to it i must mimic gilbert white directly i pestered my poor parents to spend a month or two in the depths of the country on the verge of a forest they yielded with groans i kissed them and we rusticated i pried into every living thing not forgetting my old friends the insect tribe here i found ants with grander ideas than they have to home and satisfied myself they have more brains than apes they cooperate more and in complicated things sir there are ants that make greater marches for their size than napoleons invasion of russia even the less nomad tribes will march through fields of grass where each blade is a high gumtree to them and never lose the track i saw an army of red ants with generals captains and ensigns start at daybreak march across a road through a hedge and then through high grass till noon and surprise a fortification of black ants and take it after a sanguinary resistance all that must have been planned beforehand you know and carried out to the letter once i found a colony busy on some hard ground preparing an abode i happened to have been microscoping a wasp so i threw him down among the ants they were disgusted they ran about collecting opinions presently half of them burrowed into the earth below and undermined him till he lay on a crust of earth as thin as a wafer and a deep grave below then they all got on him except one and he stood pompous on a pebble and gave orders the earth brokethe wasp went down into his graveand the ants soon covered him with loose earth and resumed their domestic architecture i concluded that though the monkey resembles man most in body the ant comes nearer him in mind as for dogs i dont know where to rank them in nature because they have been pupils of man for centuries i bore you no oh yes i do an enthusiast is always a bore les facheux of moliere are just enthusiasts well sir in one word i was a natural philosophervery small but earnest and in due course my studies brought me to the wonders of the human body i studied the outlines of anatomy in books and plates and prepared figures and from that by degrees i was led on to surgery and medicinein books you understand and they are only half the battle medicine is a thing one can do it is a noble science a practical science and a subtle science where i thought my powers of study and observation might help me to be keen at reading symptoms and do good to man and be a famous woman so i concluded to benefit mankind and myself stop that sounds like selfdeception it must have been myself and mankind i concluded to benefit anyway i pestered that small section of mankind which consisted of my parents until they consented to let me study medicine in europe what all by yourself yes oh girls are very independent in the states and govern the old people mine said no a few dozen times but they were bound to end in yes and i went to zurich i studied hard there and earned the approbation of the professors but the school deteriorated too many ladies poured in from russia some were not in earnest and preferred flirting to study and did themselves no good and made the male students idle and wickeder than everif possible what else could you expect said vizard nothing else from unpicked women but when all the schools in europe shall be openas they ought to be and must and shallthere will be no danger of shallow girls crowding to any particular school besides there will be a more strict and rapid routine of examination then to sift out the female flirts and the male dunces along with them i hope well sir we few that really meant medicine made inquiries and heard of a famous old school in the south of france where women had graduated of old and two of us went there to tryan italian lady and myself we carried good testimonials from zurich and not to frighten the frenchmen at starting i attacked them alone cornelia was my elder and my superior in attainments she was a true descendant of those learned ladies who have adorned the chairs of philosophy jurisprudence anatomy and medicine in her native country but she has the wisdom of the serpent as well as of the sage and she put me forward because of my red hair she said that would be a passport to the dark philosophers of france was not that rather foxy miss gale foxy as my hair itself mr vizard well i applied to a professor he received me with profound courtesy and feigned respect but was staggered at my request to matriculate he gesticulated and bowed a la francaise and begged the permission of his foxyhaired invader from northern climes to consult his colleagues would i do him the great honor to call again next day at twelve i did and met three other polished authorities one spoke for all and said if i had not brought with me proofs of serious study they should have dissuaded me very earnestly from a science i could not graduate in without going through practical courses of anatomy and clinical surgery that however with a regular french shrug was my business not theirs it was not for them to teach me delicacy but rather to learn it from me that was a french sneer the french are un gens moqueur you know i received both shrug and sneer like marble he ended it all by saying the school had no written law excluding doctresses and the old records proved women had graduated and even lectured there i had only to pay my fees and enter upon my routine of studies so i was admitted on sufferance but i soon earned the good opinion of the professors and of this one in particular and then cornelia applied for admission and was let in too we lived together and had no secrets and i think sir i may venture to say that we showed some little wisdom if you consider our age and all that was done to spoil us as to parrying their little sly attempts at flirtation that is nothing we came prepared but when our fellowstudents found we were in earnest and had high views the chivalrous spirit of a gallant nation took fire and they treated us with a delicate reverence that might have turned any womans head but we had the credit of a sneeredat sex to keep up and felt our danger and warned each other and i remember i told cornelia how many young ladies in the states i had seen puffed up by the mens extravagant homage and become spoiled children and offensively arrogant and discourteous so i entreated her to check those vices in me the moment she saw them coming when we had been here a year attending all the lecturesclinical medicine and surgery includednews came that one british school edinburgh had shown symptoms of yielding to continental civilization and relaxing monopoly that turned me north directly my mother is english i wanted to be a british doctress not a french cornelia had misgivings and even condescended to cry over me but i am a mule and always was then that dear friend made terms with me i must not break off my connection with the french school she said no she had thought it well over i must ask leave of the french professors to study in the north and bring back notes about those distant thulians says she your studies in that savage island will be allowed to go for something here if you improve your timeand you will be sure to sweetheartthat i may be always proud of you dear cornelia am i to believe all this said vizard can women be such true friends what cannot women be what are you one of those who take us for a clique dont you know more than half mankind are women alas alas for them said rhoda sharply well well said vizard putting on sudden humility dont let us quarrel i hate quarrelingwhere im sure to get the worst ay friendship is a fine thing in men or women a far nobler sentiment than love you will not admit that of course being a woman oh yes i will said she why i have observed love attentively and i pronounce it a fever of the mind it disturbs the judgment and perverts the conscience you side with the beloved right or wrong what personal degradation i observe too that a grand passion is a grand misfortune they are always in a storm of hope fears doubt jealousy rapture rage and the end deceit or else satiety friendship is steady and peaceful not much jealousy no heartburnings it strengthens with time and survives the smallpox and a wooden leg it doubles our joys and divides our grief and lights and warms our lives with a steady flame solem e mundo tollunt qui tollunt amicitiam halloo cried vizard what you know latin too why of coursea smattering or how could i read pliny and celsus and ever so much more rubbish that custom chucks down before the gates of knowledge and says therebefore you go the right road you ought to go the wrong it is usual study now with the reverence they dont deserve the nonobservers of antiquity spare me the ancients miss gale said vizard and reveal me the girl of the period when i was so illbred as to interrupt you you had left france crowned with laurels and were just invading britain something in his words or his tone discouraged the subtle observer and she said coldly excuse me i have hardly the courage my british history is a tale of injustice suffering insult and worst of all defeat i cannot promise to relate it with that composure whoever pretends to science ought the wound still bleeds then vizard was vexed with himself and looked grave and concerned he said gently miss gale i am sorry to give you pain but what you have told me is so new and interesting i shall be disappointed if you withhold the rest besides you know it gives no lasting pain to relate our griefs come comebe brave and tell me well i will said she indeed some instinct moves me good may come of my telling it you i thinksomehowyou areajustman in the act of saying this she fixed her gray eyes steadily and searchingly upon vizards face so that he could scarcely meet them they were so powerful then suddenly the observation seemed to die out of them and reflection to take its place those darting eyes were turned inward it was a marked variety of power there was something wizardlike in the vividness with which two distinct mental processes were presented by the varied action of a single organ and vizard then began to suspect that a creature stood before him with a power of discerning and digesting truth such as he had not yet encountered either in man or woman she entered on her british adventures in her clear silvery voice it was not like ina kloskings rich and deep and tender yet it had a certain gentle beauty to those who love truth because it was dispassionate yet expressive and cool yet not cold one might call it truths silver trumpet on the brink of an extraordinary passage i pause to make no fewer than three remarks in my own person st let no reader of mine allow himself to fancy rhoda gale and her antecedents are a mere excrescence of my story she was rooted to it even before the first scene of itthe meeting of ashmead and the kloskingand this will soon appear d she is now going into a controverted matter and though she is sincere and truthful she is of necessity a partisan do not take her for a judge you be the judge d but as a judge never shuts his mind to either side do not refuse her a fair hearing above all do not underrate the question let not the balance of your understanding be so upset by ephemeral childishness as to fancy that it matters much whether you break an egg top or bottom because gullivers two nations went to war about it or that it matters much whether your queen is called queen of india or empress because two parties made a noise about it and the country has wasted ten thousand square miles of good paper on the subject trivial as the dust on a butterflys wing fight against these illusions of petty and ephemeral minds it does not matter the millionth of a straw to mankind whether any one woman is called queen or empress of india and it matters greatly to mankind whether the whole race of women are to be allowed to study medicine and practice it if they can rival the male or are to be debarred from testing their scientific ability and so outlawed though taxed in defiance of british liberty and all justice human and divine by eleven hundred lawgiversmost of em fools chapter xiii when i reached great britain the right of women to medicine was in this conditiona learned lawyer explained it carefully to me i will give you his words the unwritten law of every nation admits all mankind and not the male half only to the study and practice of medicine and the sale of drugs in great britain this law is called the common law and is deeply respected whatever liberty it allows to men or women is held sacred in our courts until directly and explicitly withdrawn by some act of the legislature under this ancient liberty women have occasionally practiced general medicine and surgery up to the year but for centuries they monopolized by custom one branch of practice the obstetric and that together with the occasional treatment of children and the nursing of both sexes which is semimedical and is their monopoly seems on the whole to have contented them till late years when their views were enlarged by wider education and other causes but their abstinence from general practice like their monopoly of obstetrics lay with women themselves and not with the law of england that law is the same in this respect as the common law of italy and france and the constitution of bologna where so many doctresses have filled the chairs of medicine and other sciences makes no more direct provision for female students than does the constitution of any scotch or english universitythe whole thing lay with the women themselves and with local civilization years ago italy was far more civilized than england so italian women took a large sphere of late the anglosaxon has gone in for civilization with his usual energy and is eclipsing italy therefore his women aspire to larger spheres of intellect and action beginning in the states because american women are better educated than english the advance of women in useful attainments is the most infallible sign in any country of advancing civilization all this about civilization is my observation sir and not the lawyers now for the lawyer again such being the law of england the british legislature passed an act in the real object of which was to protect the public against incapable doctors not against capable doctresses or doctors the act excludes from medical practice all persons whatever male or female unless registered in a certain register and to get upon that register the person male or female must produce a license or diploma granted by one of the british examining boards specified in a schedule attached to the act now these examining boards were all members of the leading medical schools if the legislature had taken the usual precaution and had added a clause compelling those boards to examine worthy applicants the act would have been a sound public measure but for want of that foresightand without foresight a lawgiver is an impostor and a public pestthe state robbed women of their old commonlaw rights with one hand and with the other enabled a respectable tradesunion to thrust them out of their new statutory rights unfortunately the respectable union to whom the legislature delegated an unconstitutional power they did not claim themselves of excluding qualified persons from examination and so robbing them of their license and their bread had an overpowering interest to exclude qualified women from medicine they had the same interest as the watchmakers union the printers the painters on china the calicoengravers and others have to exclude qualified women from those branches though peculiarly fitted for them but not more so than they are for the practice of medicine god having made them and not men the medical and unmusical sex wherever theres a tradesunion the weakest go to the wall those vulgar unions i have mentioned exclude women from skilled labor they excel in by violence and conspiracy though the law threatens them with imprisonment for it was it in nature then that the medical union would be infinitely forbearing when the legislature went and patted it on the back and said you can conspire with safety against your female rivals of course the clique were tempted more than any clique could bear by the unwariness of the legislature and closed the doors of the medical schools to female applicants against unqualified female practitioners they never acted with such zeal and consent and why the female quack is a public pest and a good foil to the union the qualified doctress is a public good and a blow to the union the british medical union was now in a fine attitude by act of parliament it could talk its contempt of medical women and act its terror of them and keep both its feigned contempt and its real alarm safe from the test of a public examinationthat crucible in which cant surmise and mendacity are soon evaporated or precipitated and only the truth stands firm for all that two female practitioners got upon the register and stand out living landmarks of experience and the truth in the dead wilderness of surmise and prejudice i will tell you how they got in the act of parliament makes two exceptions first it lets in without examinationand that is very unwiseany foreign doctor who shall be practicing in england at the date of the act although with equal incapacity it omits to provide that any future foreign doctor shall be able to demand examination in with the old foreign fogies blindfold right or wrong out with the rising foreign luminaries of an everadvancing science right or wrong and secondly it lets in without examination to experiment on the vile body of the public any person qualified or unqualified who may have been made a doctor by a very venerable and equally irrelevant functionary guess now who it is that a british parliament sets above the law as a doctormaker for that public it professes to love and protect the regius professor of medicine no tyndall no huxley no then i give it up the archbishop of canterbury oh come a joke is a joke this is no joke bright monument of british funkyism and imbecility there stands the clause setting that reverend and irrelevant doctormaker above the law which sets his graces female relations below the law and in practice outlaws the whole female population starving those who desire to practice medicine learnedly and oppressing those who out of modesty not yet quite smothered by custom and monopoly desire to consult a learned female physician instead of being driven like sheep by iron tyrannyin a country that babbles libertyto a male physician or a female quack well sir in miss elizabeth blackwell fought the good fight in the united states and had her troubles because the states were not so civilized then as now she graduated doctor at geneva in the state of new york she was practicing in england in and demanded her place on the register she is an englishwoman by birth but she is an english md only through america having more brains than britain this one islander sings hail columbia as often as god save the queen i reckon miss garrett an enthusiastic student traveled north south east and west and knocked in vain at the doors of every great school and university in britain but at last found a chink in the iron shutters of the london apothecaries it seems parliament was wiser in than in for it inserted a clause in the apothecaries act of compelling them to examine all persons who should apply to them for examination after proper courses of study their charter contained no loophole to evade the act and substitute him for person so they let miss garrett in as a student like all the students she had to attend lectures on chemistry botany materia medica zoology natural philosophy and clinical surgery in the collateral subjects they let her sit with the male students but in anatomy and surgery she had to attend the same lectures privately and pay for lectures all to herself this cost her enormous fees however it is only fair to say that if she had been one of a dozen female students the fees would have been diffused as it was she had to gild the pill out of her private purse in the hospital teaching she met difficulties and discouragement though she asked for no more opportunities than are granted readily to professional nurses and female amateurs but the whole thing is a mere money question that is the key to every lock in it she was freely admitted at last to one great hospital and all went smoothly till some surgeon examined the students viva voce then miss garrett was off her guard and displayed too marked a superiority thereupon the male students played the woman and begged she might be excluded and i am sorry to say for the credit of your sex this unmanly request was complied with by the womanish males in power however at her next hospital miss garrett was more discreet and took pains to conceal her galling superiority all her trouble endedwhere her competitors beganat the public examination she passed brilliantly and is an english apothecary in civilized france she is a learned physician she had not been an apothecary a week before the apothecaries society received six hundred letters from the medical smallfry in town and country they threatened to send no more boys to the apothecaries but to the college of surgeons if ever another woman received an apothecarys license now you know all men tremble in england at the threats of a tradesunion so the apothecaries instantly cudgeled their brains to find a way to disobey the law and obey the union the medical press gave them a hint and they passed a bylaw forbidding their students to receive any part of their education privately and made it known at the same time that their female students would not be allowed to study the leading subjects publicly and so they baffled the legislature and outlawed half the nation by a juggle which the press and the public would have risen against if a single grownup man had been its victim instead of four million adult women now you are a straightforward man what do you think of that humph said vizard i do not altogether approve it the strong should not use the arts of the weak in fighting the weak but in spite of your eloquence i mean to forgive them anything shakespeare has provided there with an excuse that fits all time our poverty but not our will consents poverty the poverty of a company in the city of london allons donc well sir for years after this all europe even russia advanced in civilization and opened their medical schools to women so did the united states only the pigheaded briton stood stockstill and gloried in his minority of one as if one small island is likely to be right in its monomania and all civilized nations wrong but while i was studying in france one lionhearted englishwoman was moving our native isle first she tried the university of london and that sets up for a liberal foundation answerour charter is expressly framed to exclude women from medical instruction then she sat down to besiege edinburgh now edinburgh is a very remarkable place it has only half the houses but ten times the intellect of liverpool or manchester and the university has two advantages as a home of science over the english universities it is far behind them in greek which is the language of error and nescience and before them in english and that is a tongue a good deal of knowledge is printed in edinburgh is the only center of british literature except london one medical professor received the pioneer with a concise severity and declined to hear her plead her cause and one received her almost brutally he said no respectable woman would apply to him to study medicine now respectable women were studying it all over europe well but perhaps his soul lived in an island that is so however personal applicants must expect a rub or two and most of the professors in and out of medicine treated her with kindness and courtesy still she found even the friendly professors alarmed at the idea of a woman matriculating and becoming civis edinensis so she made a moderate application to the senate viz for leave to attend medical lectures this request was indorsed by a majority of the medical professors and granted but on the appeal of a few medical professors against it the senate suspended its resolution on the ground that there was only one applicant this got wind and other ladies came into the field directly your humble servant among them then the senate felt bound to recommend the university court to admit such female students to matriculate as could pass the preliminary examination this is in history logic languages and other branches and we prepared for it in good faith it was a happy time after a good days work i used to go up the calton hill or arthurs seat and view the sea and the piraens and the violet hills and the romantic undulations of the city itself and my heart glowed with love of knowledge and with honorable ambition i ran over the names of worthy women who had adorned medicine at sundry times and in divers places and resolved to deserve as great a name as any in history refreshed by my walki generally walked eight miles and practiced gymnastics to keep my muscles hardi used to return to my little lodgings and they too were sweet to me for i was learning a new sciencelogic that was a nut to crack i have met few easier or sweeter one nonobserver had told me it was a sham science and mere pedantry another that it pretended to show men a way to truth without observing i found on the contrary that it was a very pretty little science which does not affect to discover phenomena but simply to guard men against rash generalization and false deductions from true data it taught me the untrained world is brimful of fallacies and verbal equivoques that ought not to puzzle a child but whenever they creep into an argument do actually confound the learned and the simple alike and all for want of a months logic yes i was happy on the hill and happy by the hearth and so things went on till the preliminary examination came it was not severe we ladies all passed with credit though many of the male aspirants failed how do you account for that asked vizard with my eyes i observe that the average male is very superior in intellect to the average female and i observe that the picked female is immeasurably more superior to the average male than the average male is to the average female is it so simple as that ay why not what are you one of those who believe that truth is obscurehides herselfand lies in a well i tell you sir truth lies in no well the place truth lies in isthe middle of the turnpike road but one old fogy puts on his green spectacles to look for her and another his red and another his blue and so they all miss her because she is a colorless diamond those spectacles are preconceived notions a priori reasoning cant prejudice the depth of mr shallows inner consciousness etc etc then comes the observer opens the eyes that god has given him tramples on all colored spectacles and finds truth as surely as the spectacled theorists miss her say that the intellect of the average male is to the average female as ten to six it is to the intellect of the picked female as ten to a hundred and fifty or even less now the intellect of the male edinburgh student was much above that of the average male but still it fell far below that of the picked female all the examinations at edinburgh showed this to all gods unspectacled creatures that used their eyes these remarks hit vizard hard they accorded with his own good sense and method of arguing but perhaps my more careful readers may have already observed this he nodded hearty approval for once and she went on we had now a right to matriculate and enter on our medical course but to our dismay the right was suspended the proofs of our general proficiency which we hoped would reconcile the professors to us as students of medicine alarmed people and raised us unscrupulous enemies in some who were justly respected and others who had influence though they hardly deserved it a general council of the university was called to reconsider the pledge the senate had given us and overawe the university court by the weight of academic opinion the court itself was fluctuating and ready to turn either way a large number of male students cooperated against us with a petition they too were a little vexed at our respectable figure in the preliminary examination the assembly met and the union orator got up he was a preacher of the gospel and carried the weight of that office christianity as well as science seemed to rise against us in his person he made a long and eloquent speech based on the intelligent surmises and popular prejudices that were diffused in a hundred leading articles and in letters to the editor by men and women to whom history was a dead letter in modern controversies for the press battled this matter for two years and furnished each party with an artillery of reasons pro and con he said womans sphere is the hearth and the home to impair her delicacy is to take the bloom from the peach she could not qualify for medicine without mastering anatomy and surgerybranches that must unsex her providence intending her to be mans helpmate not his rival had given her a body unfit for war or hard labor and a brain four ounces lighter than a mans and unable to cope with long study and practical science in short she was too good and too stupid for medicine it was eloquent but it was a priori reasoning and conjecture versus evidence yet the applause it met with showed one how happy is the orator qui hurle avec les loups taking the scientific preachers whole theory in theology and science woman was high enough in creation to be the mother of god but not high enough to be a sawbones well a professor of belleslettres rose on our side not with a rival theory but with facts he was a pupil of lord bacon and a man of the nineteenth century so he objected to a priori reasoning on a matter of experience to settle the question of capacity he gave a long list of women who had been famous in science such as bettesia gozzadini novella andrea novella calderini maddelena buonsignori and many more who were doctors of law and university professors dorotea bocohi who was professor both of philosophy and medicine laura bassi who was elected professor of philosophy in by acclamation and afterward professor of experimental physics anna manzolini professor of anatomy in gaetaua agnesi professor of mathematics christina roccati doctor of philosophy in clotilde tambroni professor of greek in maria dalle donne doctor of medicine in zaffira ferretti doctor of medicine in maria sega doctor of medicine in madalena noe graduate of civil law in ladies innumerable who graduated in law and medicine at pavia ferrara and padua including elena lucrezia cornaro of padua a very famous woman also in salamanca alcala cordova he named more than one famous doctress also in heidelberg gottingen giessen wurzburg etc and even at utrect with numberless graduates in the arts and faculties at montpellier and paris in all ages also outside reputations as of doctor bouvin and her mother acknowledged celebrities in their branch of medicine this chain he said has never been really broken there was scarcely a great foreign university without some female student of high reputation there were such women at vienna and petersburg many such at zurich at montpellier mademoiselle doumergue was carrying all before her and miss garrett and miss mary putnam at paris though they were weighted in the race by a foreign language let the male english physician pass a stiff examination in scientific french before he brayed so loud he had never done it yet this he said is not an age of chimeras it is a wise and wary age which has established in all branches of learning a sure test of ability in man or womanpublic examination followed by a public report these public examinations are all conducted by males and women are passing them triumphantly all over europe and america and graduate as doctors in every civilized country and even in halfcivilized russia he then went into our own little preliminary examination and gave the statistics in latin were examined men and women men were rejected but no women men were respectable optimi or firstrate woman bona and optima in mathematics were examined men and women of whom woman was optima and bona men were optimi and boni the rest failed in german men were examined and woman man was good and woman in logic men were examined and woman the woman came out fifth in rank and she had only been at it a month in moral philosophy men were examined and woman the woman came out third in arithmetic men and women men were optimi and woman optima several men failed and not one woman in mechanics men and woman the woman passed with fair credit as did men the rest failing in french were examined men and women men and woman were respectable men and woman passed two women attained the highest excellence optimoe and not one man in english men and women men were good and woman but women were optimoe and only man fancy you remembering figures like that said vizard it is all training and habit said she simply as to the study and practice of medicine degrading women he asked if it degraded men no it elevated them they could not contradict him on that point he declined to believe without a particle of evidence that any science could elevate the higher sex and degrade the lower what evidence we had ran against it nurses are not as a class unfeminine yet all that is most appalling disgusting horrible and unsexing in the art of healing is monopolized by them women see worse things than doctors women nurse all the patients of both sexes often under horrible and sickening conditions and lay out all the corpses no doctor objects to this on sentimental grounds and why because the nurses get only a guinea a week and not a guinea a flying visit to women the loathsome part of medicine to man the lucrative the noble nurses of the crimea went to attend males only yet were not charged with indelicacy they worked gratis the wouldbe doctresses look mainly to attending women but then they want to be paid for it there was the rubit was a mere money question and all the attempts of the union to hide this and play the sentimental shopman were transparent hypocrisy and humbug a doctor justly revered in edinburgh answered him but said nothing new nor effective and to our great joy the majority went with us thus encouraged the university court settled the matter we were admitted to matriculate and study medicine under certain conditions to which i beg your attention the instruction of women for the profession of medicine was to be conducted in separate classes confined entirely to women the professors of the faculty of medicine should for this purpose be permitted to have separate classes for women all these regulations were approved by the chancellor and are to this day a part of the law of that university we ladies five in number but afterward seven were matriculated and registered professional students of medicine and passed six delightful months we now look back upon as if it was a happy dream we were picked women all in earnest we deserved respect and we met with it the teachers were kind and we attentive and respectful the students were courteous and we were affable to them but discreet whatever seven young women could do to earn esteem and reconcile even our opponents to the experiment we did there was not an antistudent or downright flirt among us and indeed i have observed that an earnest love of study and science controls the amorous frivolity of women even more than mens perhaps our heads are really smaller than mens and we havent room in them to be like solomonextremely wise and arrant fools this went on until the first professional examination but after the examination the war to our consternation recommenced am i then badhearted for thinking there must have been something in that examination which roused the sleeping spirit of tradesunionism it seems probable then view that probability by the light of fact in physiology the male students were in chemistry obtained honors in physiology in chemistry in physiology and chemistry there were five women one obtained honors in physiology alone four obtained honors in both physiology and chemistry so you see the female students beat the male students in physiology at the rate of five to one and in chemistry seven and threequarters to one but horrible to relate one of the ladies eclipsed twentynine out of the thirtyone gentlemen who took honors in chemistry in capacity she surpassed them all for the two who were above her obtained only two marks more than she did yet they had been a year longer at the study this entitled her to a hope scholarship for that year would you believe it the scholarship was refused herin utter defiance of the founders conditionson the idle pretext that she had studied at a different hour from the male students and therefore was not a member of the chemistry class then why admit her to the competition said vizard why because the a priori reasoners took for granted she would be defeated then the cry would have been you had your chance we let you try for the hope scholarship but you could not win it having won it she was to be cheated out of it somehow or anyhow the separateclass system was not that ladys fault she would have preferred to pay the university lecturer lighter fees and attend a better lecture with the male students the separate class was an unfavorable condition of study which the university imposed on us as the condition of admitting us to the professional study of medicine surely then to cheat that lady out of her hope scholarship when she had earned it under conditions of study enforced and unfavorable was perfidious and dishonest it was even a little ungrateful to the injured sex for the money which founded these scholarships was womens money every penny of it the good professor hope had lectured to ladies fifty years ago had taken their fees and founded his scholarships with their money and it would have done his heart good to see a lady win and wear that prize which but for his female pupils would never have existed but it is easy to trample on a dead man as easy as on living women the perfidy was followed by ruthless tyranny they refused to admit the fair criminal to the laboratory else said they shell defeat more men that killed her as a chemist it gave inferior male students too great an advantage over her and so the public and professor hope were sacrificed to a tradesunion and lost a great analytical chemist and something moreshe had to my knowledge a subtle diagnosis now we have at present no great analyst and the few competent analysts we have do not possess diagnosis in proportion they can find a few poisons in the dead but they are slow to discover them in the living so they are not to be counted on to save a life where crime is administering poison that woman could and would i think they drove her out of chemistry wherein she was a genius into surgery in which she was only a talent she is now housesurgeon in a great hospital and the public has lost a great chemist and diagnostic physician combined up to the date of this enormity the press had been pretty evenly divided for and against us but now to their credit they were unanimous and reprobated the juggle as a breach of public faith and plain morality backed by public opinion one friendly professor took this occasion to move the university to relax the regulation of separate classes since it had been abused he proposed that the female students should be admitted to the ordinary classes this proposal was negatived by to this small majority was gained by a characteristic maneuver the queens name was gravely dragged in as disapproving the proposal when in fact it could never have been submitted to her or her comment if any must have been in writing and as to the general question she has never said a public word against medical women she has too much sense not to ask herself how can any woman be fit to be a queen with powers of life and death if no woman is fit to be so small a thing by comparison as a physician or a surgeon we were victims of a small majority obtained by imagination playing upon flunkyism and the first result was we were not allowed to sit down to botany with males mind you we might have gathered blackberries with them in umbrageous woods from morn till dewy eve and not a professor shocked in the whole faculty but we must not sit down with them to an intellectual dinner of herbs and listen in their company to the pedantic terms and childish classifications of botany in which kindred properties are ignored only the male student must be told in public that a foxglove is digitalis purpurea in the improved nomenclature of science and crowfoot is ranunculus sceleratus and the buckbean is menyanthis trifoliata and mugwort is artemesia judaica that having lost the properties of hyssop known to solomon we regain our superiority over that learned hebrew by christening it gratiola officinalis the sexes must not be taught in one room to discard such ugly and inexpressive terms as snowdrop meadowsweet heartsease feverfew cowslip etc and learn to know the cowslip as primula verisby class pentandria monogynia and the buttercup as ranunculus acnispolyandria monogynia the snowdrop as galanthus nivalishexandria monogynia and the meadowsweet as ulnaria the hearts ease as viola tricolor and the daisy as bellis perennissyngenesia superflua well said vizard i think the individual names can only hurt the jaws and other organs of speech but the classification is the mild luster of science to be cast over the natural disposition of young women toward polyandria monogynia is trigamy to be identified in their sweet souls with floral innocence and their victims sitting by such classifications are puerile and fanciful said miss gale but for that very reason they dont infect animals with trigamy novels are much more likely to do that especially ladies novels suggested vizard meekly some suggested the accurate rhoda but the sexes will never lose either morals or delicacy through courses of botany endured together it will not hurt young ladies a bit to tell them in the presence of young gentlemen that a cabbage is a thalamifioral exogen and its stamens are tetradynamous nor that the mushroom psalliata campestris and the toadstool myoena campestris are confounded by this science in one class cryptogamia it will not even hurt them to be told that the properties of the arum maculatum are little known but that the males are crowded round the center of the spadix and the females seated at the base said vizard pompously the pulpit and the teatable are centers of similar phenomena now i think of it the pulpit is a very fair calyx but the teatable is sadly squat yes sir but more than that not one of these pedants who growled at promiscuous botany has once objected to promiscuous dancing not even with the gentlemans arm round the ladys waist which the custom of centuries cannot render decent yet the professors of delicacy connive and the mother geese sit smirking at the wall oh world of hypocrites and humbugs i am afraid you are an upsetter general said vizard but you are abominably sincere and all this is a curious chapter of human nature pray proceed miss gale nodded gravely and resumed so much public ridicule fell on the union for this and the blind flunkyism which could believe the queen had meddled in the detail that the professors melted under it and threw open botany and natural history to us with other collateral sciences then came the great fight which is not ended yet to qualify for medicine and pass the stiff examination by which the public is very properly protected you must be versed in anatomy and clinical surgery books and lectures do not suffice for this without the human subjectalive and dead the university court knew that very well when it matriculated us and therefore it provided for our instruction by promising us separate classes backed by this public pledge we waited on the university professor of anatomy to arrange our fees for a separate lecture he flatly refused to instruct us separately for love or money or to permit his assistants that meant the union sees a way to put you in a cleft stick and cheat you out of your degree in spite of the pledge the university has given you in spite of your fees and of your time given to study in reliance on the promise this was a heavy blow but there was an extramural establishment called surgeons hall and the university formally recognized all the lecturers in this hall so we applied to those lecturers and they were shocked at the illiberality of the university professors and admitted us at once to mixed classes we attended lectures with the male students on anatomy and surgery and of all the anticipated evils not one took place sir the objections to mixed classes proved to be idle words yet the oldfashioned minds opposed to us shut their eyes and went on reasoning a priori and proving that the evils which they saw did not arise must arise should the experiment of mixed classes which was then succeeding ever he tried to qualify us for examination we now needed but one thing morehospital practice the infirmary is supported not so much by the university as the town we applied therefore with some confidence for the permission usually conceded to medical students the managers refused us the town infirmary then we applied to the subscribers the majority not belonging to a tradesunion declared in our favor and intimated plainly that they would turn out the illiberal managers at the next election of managers but by this time the war was hot and general and hard blows dealt on both sides it was artfully suppressed by our enemies in the profession and in the press that we had begged hard for the separate class which had been promised us in anatomy and permission to attend by ourselves a limited number of wards in the infirmary and on this falsehood by suppression worse calumnies were built i shall tell you what we really were and what foul mouths and pens insinuated we must be two accomplished women had joined us and we were now the seven wise virgins of a halfcivilized nation and if i know black from white we were seven of its brightest ornaments we were seven ladies who wished to be doctresses especially devoted to our own sex seven good students who went on our knees to the university for those separate classes in anatomy and clinical surgery which the university was bound in honor to supply us but our prayer rejected said to the university well use your own discretion about separate or mixed classes but for your own credit and that of human nature do not willfully tie a hangmans noose to throttle the weak and deserving and dont cheat seven poor hardworking meritorious women your own matriculated students out of our entrancefees which lie to this day in the university coffers out of the exceptionally heavy fees we have paid to your professors out of all the fruit of our hard study out of our diplomas and our bread solve the knot your own way we will submit to mixed classes or anything except professional destruction in this spirit our lionhearted leader wrote the letter of an uninjured dove and said there were a great many more wards in the infirmary than any male student could or did attend we would be content to divide the matter thus the male students to have the monopoly of twothirds we to have the bare right of admission to onethird by this the male students if any who had a sincere objection to study the sick and witness operations in our company could never be troubled with us and we though less favored than the male students could just manage to qualify for that public examination which was to prove whether we could make able physicians or not sir this gentle proposal was rejected with rude scorn and in aggressive terms such is the spirit of a tradesunion having now shown you what we were i will now tell you what our enemies declining to observe our conduct though it was very public suggested we must beseven shameless women who pursued medicine as a handle for sexuality who went into the dissectingroom to dissect males and into the hospital to crowd round the male patient and who demanded mixed classes that we might have male companions in those studies which every feminine woman would avoid altogether this keynote struck the public was regaled with a burst of hypocrisy such as moliere never had the luck to witness or oh what a comedy he would have written the immodest sex taking advantage of molieres decease without heirs of his brains set to work in public to teach the modest sex modesty in the conduct of this pleasant paradox the representatives of that sex which has much courage and little modesty were two professorswho conducted the paradox so judiciously that the london press reprimanded them for their foul insinuationsand a number of young men called medical students now the medical student surpasses most young men in looseness of life and indecency of mind and speech the representatives of womanhood to be instructed in modesty by these animals old and young were seven prudes whose minds were devoted to study and honorable ambition these women were as much above the average of their sex in feminine reserve and independence of the male sex as they were in intellect the average girl who throughout this discussion was all of a sudden puffed as a lily because she ceased to be observed can attend to nothing if a man is by she cant work she cant play she is so eaten up with sexuality the frivolous soul can just manage to play croquet with females but enter a man upon the scene and she does even that very ill and can hardly be got to take her turn in the only thing she has really given her mind to we were angels compared with this paltry creature and she was the standing butt of public censure until it was found that an imaginary picture of her could be made the handle for insulting her betters against these seven prudes decent dotards and their foulmouthed allies flung out insinuations which did not escape public censure and the medical students declared their modesty was shocked at our intrusion into anatomy and surgery and petitioned against us some of the press were deceived by this for a time and hurlaient avec les loups i took up one day my favorite weekly in which nearly every writer seems to me a scholar and was regaled with such lines as these it appears that girls are to associate with boys as medical students in order that when they become women they may be able to speak to men with entire plainness upon all the subjects of a doctors daily practice in plain words the aspirants to medicine and surgery desire to rid themselves speedily and effectually of that modesty which nature has planted in women and then the writer concludes we beg to suggest that there are other places besides dissectingrooms and hospitals where those ladies may relieve themselves of the modesty which they find so troublesome but fathers naturally object to this being done at their sons expense infamous cried vizard one comfort no man ever penned that that is some old woman writing down young ones i dont know said rhoda i have met so many womanish men in this business all i know is that my cheeks burned and for once in the fight scalding tears ran down them it was as if a friend had spat upon me what a chimera what a monstrous misinterpretation of pure minds by minds impure to us the dissectingroom was a temple and the dead an awe revolting to all our senses until the knife revealed to our minds the creators hand in structural beauties that the trained can appreciate if wicked dunces cant and as to the infirmary we should have done just what we did at zurich we held a little aloof from the male patients unless some goodnatured lecturer or pupil gave us a signal and then we came forward if we came uninvited we always stood behind the male students but we did crowd round the beds of the female patients and claimed the inner row and sir they thanked god for us openly a few awkward revelations were made during this discussion a medical student had the candor to write and say that he had been at a lecture and the professor had told an indelicate story and finding it palatable to his modest males had said there gentlemen now if female students were admitted here i could not have told you this amusing circumstance so that it was our purifying influence he dreaded in secret though he told the public he dreaded the reverse again female patients wrote to the journals to beg that female students might be admitted to come between them and the brutal curiosity of the male students to which they were subjected in so offensive a way that more than one poor creature declared she had felt agonies of shame even in the middle of an agonizing operation this being a cry from that public for whose sake the whole clique of physiciansmale and femaleexists had of course no great weight in the union controversy but sir if grave men and women will sit calmly down and fling dirt upon every woman who shall aspire to medicine in an island though she can do so on a neighboring continent with honor and choose their time when the dirt can only fall on seven known womensince the female students in that island are only seventhe pretended generality becomes a cowardly personality and wounds as such and excites less coldhearted and more hotheaded blackguards to outrage it was so at philadelphia and it was so at edinburgh our extramural teacher in anatomy was about to give a competitive examination now on these occasions we were particularly obnoxious often and clearly as it had been proved by a priori reasoning that we must be infinitely inferior to the average male we persisted in proving by hard fact that we were infinitely his superior and every examination gave us an opportunity of crushing solid reasons under hollow fact a band of medical students determined that for once a priori reasoning should have fair play and not be crushed by a thing so illusory as fact accordingly they got the gates closed and collected round them we came up one after another and were received with hisses groans and abusive epithets this mode of reasoning must have been admirably adapted to my weak understanding for it convinced me at once i had no business there and i was for private study directly but sir you know the ancients said better is an army of stags with a lion for their leader than an army of lions with a stag for their leader now it so happened that we had a lioness for our leader she pushed manfully through the crowd and hammered at the door then we crept quaking after she ordered those inside to open the gates and some student took shame and did in marched our lioness crept after by herher her cubs a thousand thanks good sir her does on second thoughts her hinds doe is the female of buck now i said stags well the ruffians who had undertaken to teach us modesty swarmed in too they dragged a sheep into the lectureroom lighted pipes produced bottles drank smoked and abused us ladies to our faces and interrupted the lecturer at intervals with their howls and ribaldry that was intended to show the professor he should not be listened to any more if he admitted the female students the affair got wind and other students not connected with medicine came pouring in with no worse motive probably than to see the lark some of these however thought the introduction of the sheep unfair to so respected a lecturer and proceeded to remove her but the professor put up his hand and said oh dont remove her she is superior in intellect to many persons here present at the end of the lecture thinking us in actual danger from these ruffians he offered to let us out by a side door but our lioness stood up and said in a voice that rings in my ear even now thank you sir no there are gentlemen enough here to escort us safely the magic of a great word from a great heart at certain moments when minds are heated at that word sir the scales fell from a hundred eyes manhood awoke with a start ay and chivalry too fifty manly fellows were round us in a moment with glowing cheeks and eyes and they carried us all home to our several lodgings in triumph the cowardly caitiffs of the tradesunion howled outside and managed to throw a little dirt upon our gowns and also hurled epithets most of which were new to me but it has since been stated by persons more versed in the language of the canaille that no fouler terms are known to the dregs of mankind thus did the immodest sex in the person of the medical student outrage seven fair samples of the modest sexto teach them modesty next morning the police magistrates dealt with a few of our teachers inflicted severe rebukes on them and feeble fines the craftier elders disowned the riot in public but approved it in private and continued to act in concert with it only with cunning not violence it caused no honest revulsion of feeling except in the disgusted public and they had no power to help us the next incident was a stormy debate by the subscribers to the infirmary and here we had a little feminine revenge which outraged as we had been i hope you will not grudge us our lioness subscribed five pounds and became entitled to vote and speech as the foulest epithets had been hurled at her by the union and a certain professor had told her to her face no respectable woman would come to him and propose to study medicine she said publicly that she had come to his opinion and respectable women would avoid himwhich caused a laugh she also gave a venerable old physician our bitter opponent a slap that was not quite so fair his attendant had been concerned in that outrage and she assumedin which she was not justifiedthat the old doctor approved to be sure said she they say he was intoxicated and that is the only possible excuse the old doctor had only to say that he did not control his assistants in the street and his own mode of conducting the opposition and his long life of honor were there to correct this young womans unworthy surmises and she would have had to apologize for going too far on mere surmise but instead of that he was so injudicious as to accuse her of foul language and say my attendant is a perfect gentleman he would not be my attendant if he were not our lioness had him directly oh said she if dr soandso prefers to say that his attendant committed that outrage on decency when in his sober senses i am quite content this was described as violent invective by people with weak memories who had forgotten the nature of the outrage our lioness was commenting on but in truth it was only superior skill in debate with truth to back it for my part i kept the police report at the time and have compared it with her speech the judicial comments on those rioters are far more severe than hers the truth is it was her facts that hit too hard not her expressions well sir she obtained a majority and those managers of the infirmary who objected to female students were dismissed and others elected at the same meeting the court of contributors passed a statute making it the law of the infirmary that students should be admitted without regard to sex but as to the mere election of managers the other party demanded a scrutiny of the votes and instructive figures came out there voted with us twentyeight firms thirtyone ladies seven doctors there voted with the union fourteen firms two ladies thirtyseven doctors and three druggists thereupon the tradesunion as declared by the figures alleged that firms ought not to vote nota bene they always had voted unchallenged till they voted for fair play to women the union served the provost with an interdict not to declare the new managers elected we applied for our tickets under the new statute but were impudently refused under the plea that the managers must first be consulted so did the servants of the infirmary defy the masters in order to exclude us by this time the great desire of women to practice medicine had begun to show itself numbers came in and matriculated and the pressure on the authorities to keep faith and relax the deadlock they had put us in was great thereupon the authorities instead of saying we have pledged ourselves to a great number of persons and pocketed their fees took fright and cast about for juggles they affected to discover all of a sudden that they had acted illegally in matriculating female students they would therefore not give back their fees and pay them two hundred pounds apiece for breach of contract but detain their fees and stop their studies until compelled by judicial decision to keep faith observe it was under advice of the lordjusticegeneral they had matriculated us and entered into a contract with us for fulfilling which it was not and is not in the power of any mortal man to punish them but these pettifoggers said this we have acted illegally and therefore not we but you shall suffer we will profit by our illegal act for we will cheat you out of your fees to the university and your fees to its professors as well as the seedtime of your youth that we have wasted now in that country they can get the opinions of the judges by raising what they call an action of declarator one would think it was their business to go to the judges and meantime give us the benefit of the legal doubt while it lasted and of the moral nodoubt which will last till the day of judgment and a day after not a bit of it they deliberately broke their contract with us kept our fees and cheated us out of the article we had bought of them disowned all sense of morality yet shifted the burden of law on to our shoulders litigation is long perfidy was in possession possession is nine points the female students are now sitting with their hands before them juggled out of their studies in plain defiance of justice and public faith waiting till time shall show them whether provincial lawyers can pettifog as well as tradesunion doctors as for me i had retired to civilized climes long before this i used to write twice a week to my parents but i withheld all mention of the outrage at surgeons hall i knew it would give them useless pain but in three weeks or so came a letter from my father unlike any other i ever knew him to write it did not even begin my dear child this was what he said the words are engraved in my memory out of that nation of cowards and skunks out of it this moment once and forever the states are your home draft on london inclosed write to me from france next week or write to me no more graduate in france then come north and sail from havre to new york you have done with britain and so have i till our next war pray god that maynt be long it was like a lions roar of anguish i saw my dear fathers heart was bursting with agony and rage at the insult to his daughter and i shed tears for him those wretches had never drawn from me i had cried at being insulted by scholars in the press but what was it to me that the scum of the medical profession which is the scum of gods whole creation called me words i did not know the meaning of and flung the dirt of their streets and the filth of their souls after me i was frightened a little that is all but that these reptiles could wound my darling old lions heart across the ocean sir he was a man who could be keen and even severe with men but every virtuous woman was a sacred thing to him had he seen one though a stranger insulted as we were he would have died in her defense he was a true american and to think the dregs of mankind could wound him for his daughter and so near the end of his own dear life oh she turned her head away my poor girl said vizard and his own voice was broken when he said that she gave him her hand and seemed to cling to his a little but she turned her head away from him and cried and even trembled a little but she very soon recovered herself and said she would try to end her story it had been long enough sir my father had often obeyed me but now i knew i must obey him i got testimonials in edinburgh and started south directly in a week i was in the south of france oh what a change in peoples minds by mere change of place the professors received me with winning courtesy some hats were lifted to me in the street with marked respect flowers were sent to my lodgings by gentlemen who never once intruded on me in person i was in a civilized land yet there was a disappointment for me i inquired for cornelia the wretch had just gone and married a professor i feared she was up to no good by her writing so seldom of late i sent her a line that an old friend had returned and had not forgotten her nor our mutual vows she came directly and was for caressing away her crime and dissolving it in crocodile tears but i played the injured friend and the tyrant then she curled round me and coaxed and said sweetheart i can advance your interests all the better you shall be famous for us both i shall be happier in your success than in my own in short she made it very hard to hold spite and it ended in feebleminded embraces indeed she was of service to me i had a favor to ask i wanted leave to count my scotch time in france my view was tenable and cornelia by her beauty and her popularity gained over all the professors to it but one he stood out well sir an extraordinary occurrence befriended me no not extraordinaryunusual i lodged on a second floor the first floor was very handsome a young englishman and his wife took it for a week she was musicala real genius the only woman i ever heard sing without whining for we are by nature the medical and unmusical sex so you said before i know i did and i mean to keep saying it till people see it well the young man was taken violently and mysteriously ill had syncope after syncope and at last ceased to breathe the wife was paralyzed and sat stupefied and the people about feared for her reason after a time they begged me to come down and talk to her of course i went i found her with her head upon his knees i sat down quietly and looked at him he was young and beautiful but with a feminine beauty his head finely shaped with curly locks that glittered in the sun and one golden lock lighter than the rest his eyes and eyelashes his oval face his white neck and his white hand all beautiful his left hand rested on the counterpane there was an emerald ring on one finger he was like some beautiful flower cut down i can see him now the woman lifted her head and saw me she had a noble face though now distorted and wild she cried tell me he is not dead tell me he is not dead and when i did not reply the poor creature gave a wild cry and her senses left her we carried her into another room while the women were bringing her to an official came to insist on the interment taking place they are terribly expeditious in the south of france this caused an altercation and the poor lady rushed out and finding the officer peremptory flung her arms round the body and said they should not be partedshe would be buried with him the official was moved but said the law was strict and the town must conduct the funeral unless she could find the sad courage to give the necessary instructions with this he was going out inexorable when all of a sudden i observed something that sent my heart into my mouth and i cried arretez so loud that everybody stared i said you must wait till a physician has seen him he has moved a finger i stared at the body and they all stared at me he had moved a finger when i first saw him his fingers were all close together but now the little finger was quite away from the third fingerthe one with the ring on i felt his heart and found a little warmth about it but no perceptible pulse i ordered them to take off his sheet and put on blankets but not to touch him till i came back with a learned physician the wife embraced me all trembling and promised obedience i got a fiacre and drove to dr brasseur who was my hostile professor but very able i burst on him and told him i had a case of catalepsy for himit wasnt catalepsy you know but physicians are fond of greek they prefer the wrong greek word to the right english so i called it catalepsy and said i believed they were going to bury a live man he shrugged his shoulders and said that was one of the customs of the country he would come in an hour i told him that would not do the man would be in his coffin he must come directly he smiled at my impetuosity and yielded i got him to the patient he examined him and said he might be alive but feared the last spark was going out he dared not venture on friction we must be wary well we tried this stimulant and that till at last we got a sigh out of the patient and i shall not forget the scream of joy at that sigh which made the room ring and thrilled us all byandby i was so fortunate as to suggest letting a small stream of water fall from a height on his head and face we managed that and byandby were rewarded with a sneeze i think a sneeze must revivify the brain wonderfully for he made rapid progress and then we tried friction and he got well very quick indeed as he had nothing the matter with him except being dead he got ridiculously well and began paying us fulsome compliments the doctor and me so then we handed him to his joyful wife they talk of crying for joy as if it was done every day i never saw it but once and she was the woman she made a curious gurgle but it was very pretty i was glad to have seen it and very proud to be the cause the next day that pair left he was english and so many goodnatured strangers called on him that he fled swiftly and did not even bid me goodby however i was told they both inquired for me and were sorry i was out when they went how good of them said vizard turning red oh never mind sir i made use of him i scribbled an article that very day entitled it while theres life theres hope and rushed with it to the editor of a journal he took it with delight i wrote it a la francaise picture of the dead husband mourning wife the impending interment effaced myself entirely and said the wife had refused to bury him until dr brasseur whose fame had reached her ears had seen the body to humor her the doctor was applied to and his benevolence being equal to his science he came when lo a sudden surprise the swift unerring eye of science detected some subtle sign that had escaped the lesser luminaries he doubted the death he applied remedies he exhausted the means of his art with little avail at first but at last a sigh was elicited then a sneeze and marvelous to relate in one hour the dead man was sitting up not convalescent but well i concluded with some reflections on this most important case of suspended animation very creditable to the profession of medicine and dr brasseur there was a fox well look at my hair what else could you expect i said that before too my notice published i sent it to the doctor with my respects but did not call on him however one day he met me and greeted me with a low bow mademoiselle said he you were always a good student but now you show the spirit of a confrere and so gracefully that we are all agreed we must have you for one as soon as possible i courtesied and felt my face red and said i should be the proudest woman in france grand dieu said he i hope not for your modesty is not the least of your charms so the way was made smooth and i had to work hard and in about fourteen months i was admitted to my final examination it was a severe one but i had some advantages each nation has its wisdom and i had studied in various schools being a linguist with a trained memory i occasionally backed my replies with a string of french german english and italian authorities that looked imposing in short i did pass with public applause and cordial felicitation they quite feted me the old welcomed me the young escorted me home and flung flowers over me at my door i reappeared in the balcony and said a few words of gratitude to them and their noble nation they cheered and dispersed my heart was in a glow i turned my eyes toward new york a fortnight more and my parents should greet me as a european doctress if not a british the excitement had been too great i sunk a little exhausted on the sofa they bought me a letter it was blackedged i tore it open with a scream my father was dead chapter xiv i was prostrated stupefied i dont know what i did or how long i sat there but cornelia came to congratulate me and found me there like stone with the letter in my hand she packed up my clothes and took me home with her i made no resistance i seemed all broken and limp soul and body and not a tear that day oh sir how small everything seems beside bereavement my troubles my insults were nothing now my triumph nothing for i had no father left to be proud of it with me i wept with anguish a hundred times a day why had i left new york why had i not foreseen this everyday calamity and passed every precious hour by his side i was to lose terror seized me my mother would go next no life of any value was safe a day death did not wait for disease it killed because it chose and to show its contempt of hearts but just as i was preparing to go to havre they brought me a telegram i screamed at it and put up my hands i said no no i would not read it to be told my mother was dead i would have her a few minutes longer cornelia read it and said it was from her i fell on it and kissed it the blessed telegram told she was coming home i was to go to london and wait for her i started cornelia paid my fees and put my diploma in my box i cared for nothing now but my own flesh and bloodwhat was left of itmy mother i reached london and telegraphed my address to my mother and begged her to come at once and ease my fears i told her my funds were exhausted but of course that was not the thing i poured out my heart about so i dare say she hardly realized my deplorable conditionlistless and bereaved alone in a great city with no money in her next letter she begged me to be patient she had trouble with her husbands executors she would send me a draft as soon as she could but she would not leave and let her child be robbed byandby the landlady pressed me for money i gave her my gowns and shawls to sell for me goose and just now i was a fox you are both but so is every woman she handed me a few shillings by way of balance i lived on them till they went then i starved a little with a ring on your finger you could have pawned for ten guineas pawn my ring my father gave it me she kissed it tenderly yet to vizard half defiantly pawning is not selling goose said he getting angry but i must have parted with it and you preferred to starve i preferred to starve said she steadily he looked at her her eyes faced his he muttered something and walked away three steps to hide unreasonable sympathy he came back with a grand display of cheerfulness your mother will be here next month said he with money in both pockets meantime i wish you would let me have a finger in the pieor rather my sister she is warmhearted and enthusiastic she shall call on you if you will permit it is she like you not a bit we are by different mothers hers was a greek and she is a beautiful dark girl i admire beauty but is she like youinindisposition lord no very superior not abominably clever like you but absurdly good you shall judge for yourself oblige me with your address the doctress wrote her address with a resigned air as one who had found somebody she had to obey and as soon as he had got it vizard gave her a sort of nervous shake of the hand and seemed almost in a hurry to get away from her but this was his way she would have been amazed if she had seen his change of manner the moment he got among his own people he burst in on them crying therethe prayers of this congregation are requested for harrington vizard saddled with a virago saddled with a virago screamed fanny saddled with a sighed zoe faintly saddled with a virago for life shouted vizard with a loud defiance that seemed needless since nobody was objecting violently to his being saddled look here said he descending all of a sudden to a meek injured air which however did not last very long i was in the garden of leicester square and a young lady turned faint i observed it and instead of taking the hint and cutting i offered assistanceoff my guard as usual she declined i persisted proposed a glass of wine or spirit she declined but at last let out she was starving oh cried zoe yes zoestarving a woman more learned more scientific more eloquent more offensive to a fellows vanity than i ever saw or even read ofa woman of genius starving like a genius and a ninny with a ring on her finger worth thirty guineas but my learned goose would not raise money on that because it was her fathers and he is dead poor thing said zoe and her eyes glistened directly it is hard zoe isnt it she is a physicianan able physician has studied at zurich and at edinburgh and in france and has a french diploma but must not practice in england because we are behind the continent in laws and civilizationso she says confound her impudence and my folly for becoming a womans echo but if i were to tell you her whole story your blood would boil at the trickery and dishonesty and oppression of the tradesunion which has driven this gifted creature to a foreign school for education and now that a foreign nation admits her ability and crowns her with honor still she must not practice in this country because she is a woman and we are a nation of halfcivilized men that is her chat you understand not mine we are not obliged to swallow all that but turn it how you will here are learning genius and virtue starving we must get her to accept a little money that means in her case a little fire and food zoe shall that woman go to bed hungry tonight no never said zoe warmly let me think offer her a loan well done that is a good idea will you undertake it she will be far more likely to accept she is a bit of a prude and all is my virago yes dear she will order the carriage she shall not go to bed hungrynobody shall that you are interested in oh after dinner will do dinner was ordered immediately and the brougham an hour after at dinner vizard gave them all the outline of the edinburgh struggle and the pros and cons during which narrative his female hearers might have been observed to get cooler and cooler till they reached the zero of perfect apathy they listened in dead silence but when harrington had done fanny said aside to zoe it is all her own fault what business have women to set up for doctors of course not said zoe only we must not say so he indulges us in our whims warm partisan of immortal justice when it was lucky enough to be backed by her affections miss vizard rose directly after dinner and with a fine imitation of ardor said she could lose no more timeshe must go and put on her bonnet you will come with me fanny when i was a girl or a boyi forget which it is so long agoa young lady thus invited by an affectionate friend used to do one of two things nine times out of ten she sacrificed her inclination and went the tenth she would make sweet engaging excuses and beg off but the girls of this day have invented silent volition when you ask them to do anything they dont quite like they look you in the face bland but full and neither speak nor move miss dover was a proficient in this graceful form of refusal by dead silence and resistance by placid inertia she just looked like the full moon in zoes face and never budged zoe being also a girl of the day needed no interpretation oh very well said she disobliging thingwith perfect good humor mind you vizard however was not pleased you go with her ned said he miss dover prefers to stay and smoke a cigar with me miss dovers face reddened but she never budged and it ended in zoe taking severne with her to call on rhoda gale rhoda gale stayed in the garden till sunset and then went to her lodgings slowly for they had no attractiona dark room no supper a hard landlady half disposed to turn her out dr rhoda gale never reflected much in the streets they were to her a field of minute observation but when she got home she sat down and thought over what she had been saying and doing and puzzled over the character of the man who had relieved her hunger and elicited her autobiography she passed him in review settled in her mind that he was a strong character a manly man who did not waste words wondered a little at the way he had made her do whatever he pleased blushed a little at the thought of having been so communicative yet admired the man for having drawn her out so and wondered whether she should see him again she hoped she should but she did not feel sure she sat half an hour thuswith one knee raised a little and her hands interlacedby a fireplace with a burnedout coal in it and byandby she felt hungry again but she had no food and no money she looked hard at her ring and profited a little by contact with the sturdy good sense of vizard she said to herself men understand one another i believe father would be angry with me for not then she looked tenderly and wistfully at the ring and kissed it and murmured not tonight you see she hoped she might have a letter in the morning and so respite her ring then she made light of it and said to herself no matter qui dort dine but as it was early for bed and she could not be long idle sipping no knowledge she took up the last good german work that she had bought when she had money and proceeded to read she had no candle but she had a lucifermatch or two and an old newspaper with this she made long spills and lighted one and read two pages by that paper torch and lighted another before it was out and then another and so on in succession fighting for knowledge against poverty as she had fought for it against perfidy while she was thus absorbed a carriage drew up at the door she took no notice of that but presently there was a rustling of silk on the stairs and two voices and then a tap at the door come in said she and zoe entered just as the last spill burned out rhoda gale rose in a dark room but a gaslight over the way just showed her figure miss gale said zoe timidly i am miss gale said rhoda quietly but firmly i am miss vizardthe gentlemans sister that you met in leicester square today and she took a cautious step toward her rhodas cheeks burned miss vizard she said excuse my receiving you so but you may have heard i am very poor my last candle is gone but perhaps the landlady would lend me one i dont know she is very disobliging and very cruel then she shall not have the honor of lending you a candle said zoe with one of her gushes now to tell the truth said she altering to the cheerful im rather glad i would rather talk to you in the dark for a little just at first may i by this time she had gradually crept up to rhoda i am afraid you must said rhoda but at least i can offer you a seat zoe sat down and there was an awkward silence oh dear said zoe i dont know how to begin i wish you would give me your hand as i cant see your face with all my heart there almost in a whisper he has told me rhoda put the other hand to her face though it was so dark oh miss gale how could you only think suppose you had killed yourself or made yourself very ill your mother would have come directly and found you so and only think how unhappy you would have made her can i have forgotten my mother asked rhoda of herself but aloud not willfully i am sure but you know geniuses are not always wise in these little things they want some good humdrum soul to advise them in the common affairs of life that want is supplied you now for i am herehaha you are no more commonplace than i am much less now ill be bound we will put that to the test said zoe adroitly enough my view of all this isthat here is a young lady in want of money for a time as everybody is now and then and that the sensible course is to borrow some till your mother comes over with her apronful of dollars now i have twenty pounds to lend and if you are so mighty sensible as you say you wont refuse to borrow it oh miss vizard you are very good but i am afraid and ashamed to borrow i never did such a thing time you began then i haveoften but it is no use arguing you mustor you will get poor me finely scolded perhaps he was on his good behavior with you being a stranger but at home they expect to be obeyed he will be sure to say it was my stupidity and that he would have made you directly do tell cried rhoda surprised into an idiom as if id have taken money from him why of course not but between us it is nothing at all there and she put the money into rhodas hand and then held both hand and money rather tightly imprisoned in her larger palm and began to chatter so as to leave the other no opening oh blessed darkness how easy it makes things does it not i am glad there was no candle we should have been fencing and blushing ever so long and made such a fuss about nothingand this prattle was interrupted by rhoda gale putting her right wrist round zoes neck and laying her forehead on her shoulder with a little sob so then they both distilled the inevitable dewdrops but as rhoda was not much given that way she started up and said darkness no i must see the face that has come here to help me and not humiliate me that is the first use ill make of the money i am afraid you are rather plain or you couldnt be so good as all this no said zoe im not reckoned plain only as black as a coal all the more to my taste said rhoda and flew out of the room and nearly stumbled over a figure seated on a step of the staircase who are you said she sharply my name is severne and what are you doing there waiting for miss vizard come in then she told me not then i tell you to the idea miss vizard yes please have mr severne in here he is sittinglike griefon the steps i will soon be back she flew to the landlady mrs grip i want a candle well the shops are open said the woman rudely oh i have no time here is a sovereign please give me two candles directly candlesticks and all the womans manner changed directly you shall have them this moment miss and my own candlesticks which they are plated she brought them and advised her only to light one they dont carry well miss said she they are waxor summat then they are summat said miss gale after a single glance at their composition ill make you a nice hot supper miss in half an hour said the woman maternally as if she were going to give it her no thank you bring me a twopenny loaf and a scuttle of coals la miss no more than thatout of a sov yesthe change having shown mrs grip her father was a yankee she darted upstairs with her candles zoe came to meet her and literally dazzled her rhoda stared at her with amazement and growing rapture oh you beauty she cried and drank her in from head to foot well said she drawing a long breath nature you have turned out a complete article this time i reckon then as severne laughed merrily at this she turned her candle and her eyes full on him very briskly she looked at him for a moment with a gratified eye at his comeliness then she started oh she cried he received the inspection merrily till she uttered that ejaculation then he started a little and stared at her we have met before said she almost tenderly have we said he putting on a mystified air she fixed him and looked him through and through youdontrememberme asked she then after giving him plenty of time to answer well then i must be mistaken and her words seemed to freeze themselves and her as they fell she turned her back on him and said to zoe with a good deal of sweetness and weight i have lived to see goodness and beauty united i will never despair of human nature this was too pointblank for zoe she blushed crimson and said archly i think it is time for me to run oh but i forgot here is my card we are all at that hotel if i am so very attractive you will come and see mewe leave town very soonwill you i will said rhoda and since you took me for an old acquaintance i hope you will treat me as one said severne with consummate grace and assurance i will sir said she icily and with a marvelous curl of the lip that did not escape him she lighted them down the stairs gazed after zoe and ignored severne altogether chapter xv going home in the carriage zoe was silent but severne talked nineteen to the dozen had his object been to hinder his companions mind from dwelling too long on one thing he could not have rattled the dice of small talk more industriously his words would fill pages his topics were that miss gale was an extraordinary woman but too masculine for his taste and had made her own troubles setting up doctress when her true line was governessfor boys he was also glib and satirical upon that favorite butt a friend who but a soidisant womanhater would pick up a strange virago and send his sister to her with twenty pounds ill tell you what it is miss vizard here miss vizard who had sat dead silent under a flow of words which is merely indicated above laid her hand on his arm to stop the flux for a moment and said quietly do you know her tell me know her how should i i thought you might have met herabroad well it is possible of course but very unlikely if i did i never spoke to her or i should have remembered her dont you think so she seemed very positive and i think she is an accurate person she seemed quite surprised and mortified when you said no well you know of course it is a mortifying thing when a lady claims a gentlemans acquaintance and the gentleman doesnt admit it but what could i do i couldnt tell a lie about itcould i of course not i was off my guard and rudish but you were not what tact what delicacy what high breeding and angelic benevolence and so clever too oh fie you listened you left the door ajar and i could not bear to lose a word that dropped from those lips so near me yes i listened and got such a lesson as only a noble gentle lady could give i shall never forget your womanly art and the way you contrived to make the benefaction sound nothing we are all of us at low water in turns and for a time especially me zoe vizard so heres a trifling loan a loan youll never see a shilling of it again no matter what do angels want of money oh pray said zoe you make me blush then i wish there was more light to see ityes an angel do you think i cant see you have done all this for a lady you do not really approve fancya she doctor my dear friend said zoe with a little juvenile pomposity one ought not to judge ones intellectual superiors hastily and this lady is oursthen gliding back to herself and it is my nature to approve what those i love approvewhen it is not downright wrong you know oh of course it is not wrong but is it wise zoe did not answer the question puzzled her come said he ill be frank and speak out in time i dont think you know your brother harrington he is very inflammable inflammable what harrington well yes for ive seen smoke issue from his mouthha ha ha ha ill pass that off for mine some day when you are not by but seriously your brother is the very man to make a fool of himself with a certain kind of woman he despises the whole sexin theory and he is very hard upon ordinary women and does not appreciate their good qualities but when he meets a remarkable woman he catches fire like tow he fell in love with mademoiselle klosking oh not in love i beg your pardon now this is between you and mehe was in love with her madly in love he was only saved by our coming away if those two had met and made acquaintance he would have been at her mercy i dont say any harm would have come of it but i do say that would have depended on the woman and not on the man zoe looked very serious and said nothing but her long silence showed him his words had told and now said he after a judicious pause here is another remarkable woman the last in the world i should fancy or vizard either perhaps if he met her in society but the whole thing occurs in the way to catch him he finds a lady fainting with hunger he feeds her and that softens his heart to her then she tells him the old storyvictim of the worlds injusticeand he is deeply interested in her she can see that she is as keen as a razor if those two meet a few more times he will be at her mercy and then wont she throw physic to the dogs and jump at a husband six feet high and twelve thousand acres i dont study women with a microscope as our womanhater does but i notice a few things about them and one is that their eccentricities all give way at the first offer of marriage i believe they are only adopted in desperation to get married what beautiful woman is ever eccentric catch her she can get a husband without that doctress will prescribe harrington a weddingring and if he swallows it it will be her last prescription she will send out for the family doctor after that like other wives you alarm me said zoe pray do not make me unjust this is a lady with a fine mind and not a designing woman oh i dont say she has laid any plans but these things are always extemporized the moment the chance comes you can count beforehand on the instinct of every woman who is clever and needy and on vizards peculiar weakness for women out of the common he is hard upon the whole sex but he is no match for individuals he owned as much himself to me one day you are not angry with me no no angry with you it is you i think of in all this he is a fine fellow and you are proud of him i wouldnt have him marry to mortify you for myself while the sister honors me with her regard i really dont much care who has the brother and the acres i have the best of the bargain zoe disputed thisin order to make him say it several times he did and proved it in terms that made her cheeks red with modesty and gratified pride and by the time they had got home he had flattered everything but pride love and happiness out of her heart poor girl the world is like the law full of implied contracts we give and take without openly agreeing to subtle severne counted on this and was not disappointed zoe rewarded him for his praises and her happiness by falling into his views about rhoda gale only she did it in her own ladylike way and not plump she came up to harrington and kissed him and said thank you dear for sending me on a good errand i found her in a very mean apartment without fire or candle i thought as much said vizard did she take the money yesas a loan make any difficulties a little dear severne put in his word now if you want to know all the tact and delicacy with which it was done you must come to me for miss vizard is not going to give you any idea of it be quiet sir or i shall be very angry i lent her the money dear and her troubles are at an end for her mother will certainly join her before she has spent your twenty pounds oh and she had not parted with her ring that is a comfort is it not you are a goodhearted girl zoe said vizard approvingly then recovering himself but dont you be blinded by sentiment she deserves a good hiding for not parting with her ring where is the sense of starving with thirty pounds on your finger zoe smiled and said his words were harder than his deeds because he doesnt mean a word he says put in fanny dover uneasy at the long cessation of her tongue for all conversation with don cigar had proved impracticable are you there still my lady disdain said vizard i thought you were gone to bed you might well think that i had nothing to keep me up said zoe rather smartly oh yes you hadcuriosity then turning to her brother in short you make your mind quite easy you have lent your money or given it to a worthy person but a little wrongheaded howeverwith a telegraphic glance at severneshe is very accomplished a linguist she need never be in want and she will soon have her mother to help her and advise her perhaps mrs gale has an income if not miss gale with her abilities will easily find a place in some house of business or else take to teaching if i was them i would set up a school unanimity is rare in this world but zoes good sense carried every vote her prompter severne nodded approval fanny said why of course and vizard who it was feared might prove refractory assented even more warmly than the others yes said he that will be the end of it you relieve me of a weight really when she told me that fable of learning maltreated honorable ambition punished justice baffled by trickery and virtue vilified and did not cry like the rest of you except at her father dying in new york the day she won her diploma at montpelier i forgave the poor girl her petticoats indeed i lost sight of them she seemed to me a very brave little fellow damnably ill used and i said this is not to be borne here is a fight and justice down under dirty feet what ho roaring at the top of his voice zoe and fanny screaming and pinching ned severne right and left ah ah vizard to the rescue but with the evening cool reflection came a sister youthful but suddenly sagacious with a gleam of suspicion very suddenly has stilled the waves of romance and the lips of beauty have uttered common sense shall they utter it in vain never it may be years before they do it again we must not slight rare phenomena zoe locuta esteccentricity must be suppressed doctresses warned by a little starvation must take the world as it is and teach little girls and boys languages and physic them with arithmetic and the globes these be drugs that do not kill they only make life a burden i dont think we have laid out our twenty pounds badly zoe and there is an end of it the incident is emptied as the french say and lighting bedcandles the ladies retire with the honors of war zoe has uttered good sense and miss dover has done the next best thing she has said very little miss dover shot in contemptuously i had no companion for want of a fool to speak her mind to chapter xvi ingenious mr severne having done his best to detach the poor doctress from vizard and his family in which the reader probably discerns his true motive now bent his mind on slipping back to homburg and looking after his money not that he liked the job to get hold of it he knew he must condense rascality he must play the penitent the lover and the scoundrel over again all in three days now though his egotism was brutal he was human in this that he had plenty of good nature skindeep and superficial sensibilities which made him shrink a little from this hotpressed rascality and barbarity on the other hand he was urged by poverty and laughable as it may appear by jealousy he had observed that the best of women if they are not only abandoned by him they love but also flattered and adored by scores will some times yield to the joint attacks of desolation pique vanity etc in this state of fluctuation he made up his mind so far as this he would manage so as to be able to go even this demanded caution so he began by throwing out in a seeming careless way that he ought to go down into huntingdonshire of course you ought said vizard no objection was taken and they rather thought he would go next day but that was not his game it would never do to go while they were in london so he kept postponing and saying he would not tear himself away and at last the day before they were to go down to barfordshire he affected to yield to a remonstrance of vizard and said he would see them off and then run down to huntingdonshire look into his affairs and cross the country to barfordshire you might take homburg on the way said fanny out of funher funnot really meaning it severne cast a piteous look at zoe for shame fanny said she and why put homburg into his head when i had forgotten there was such a place said mr severne taking his cue dexterously from zoe and feigning innocent amazement zoe colored with pleasure this was at breakfast at afternoon tea something happened the ladies were upstairs packing an operation on which they can bestow as many hours as the thing needs minutes one servant brought in the tea another came in soon after with a card and said it was for miss vizard but he brought it to harrington he read it miss rhoda gale md send it up to miss vizard said he the man was going out he stopped him and said you can show the lady in here all the same rhoda gale was ushered in she had a new gown and bonnet not showy but very nice she colored faintly at sight of the two gentlemen but vizard soon put her at her ease he shook hands with her and said sit down miss gale my sister will soon be here i have sent your card up to her shall i tell her said severne with the manner of one eager to be agreeable to the visitor if you please sir said miss gale severne went out zealously darted up to zoes room knocked and said pray come down here is that doctress meantime jack was giving gill the card and gill was giving it mary to give to the lady it got to zoes room in a quarter of an hour any news from mamma asked vizard in his blunt way yes sir good news no my mother writes me that i must not expect her she has to fight with a dishonest executor oh money money at that moment zoe entered the room but severne paced the landing he did not care to face miss gale and even in that short interval of time he had persuaded zoe to protect her brother against this formidable young lady and shorten the interview if she could so zoe entered the room bristling with defense of her brother at sight of her miss gale rose and her features literally shone with pleasure this was rather disarming to one so amiable as zoe and she was surprised into smiling sweetly in return but still her quick defensive eye drank miss gale on the spot and saw with alarm the improvement in her appearance she was very healthy as indeed she deserved to be for she was singularly temperate drank nothing but water and weak tea without sugar and never eat nor drank except at honest meals her youth and pure constitution had shaken off all that pallor and the pleasure of seeing zoe lent her a lovely color zoe microscoped her in one moment not one beautiful feature in her whole face eyes full of intellect but not in the least lovedarting nose an aquiline steadily reversed mouth vastly expressive but large teeth even and white but ivory not pearl chin ordinary head symmetrical and set on with grace i may add to complete the picture that she had a way of turning this head clean swift and birdlike without turning her body that familiar action of hers was fineso full of fire and intelligence zoe settled in one moment that she was downright plain but might probably be that mysterious and incomprehensible and dangerous creature a gentlemans beauty which to women means no beauty at all but a witchlike creature that goes and hits foul and eclipses real beautydolls to witby some mysterious magic pray sit down said zoe formally rhoda sat down and hesitated a moment she felt a frost vizard helped her miss gale has heard from her mother yes miss vizard said rhoda timidly and very bad news she cannot come at present and i am so distressed at what i have done in borrowing that money of you and see i have spent nearly three pounds of it in dress but i have brought the rest back zoe looked at her brother perplexed stuff and nonsense said vizard you will not take it zoe oh yes if you please do said rhoda still to zoe when i borrowed it i felt sure i could repay it but it is not so now my mother says it may be months before she can come and she forbids me positively to go to her oh but for that id put on boys clothes and go as a common sailor to get to her vizard fidgeted on his chair i suppose i mustnt go in a passion said he dryly who cares said miss gale turning her head sharply on him in the way i have tried to describe i care said vizard i find wrath interfere with my digestion please go on and tell us what your mother says she has more common sense than somebody else i wont namepoliteness forbids well who doubts that said the lady with frank good humor of course she has more sense than any of us well my mother saysoh miss vizard no she doesnt now she never heard the name of vizard miss gale was in no humor for feeble jokes she turned half angrily away from him to zoe she says i have been well educated and know languages and we are both under a cloud and i had better give up all thought of medicine and take to teaching well miss gale said zoe if you ask me i must say i think it is good advice with all your gifts how can you fight the world we are all interested in you here and it is a curious thing but do you know we agreed the other day you would have to give up medicine and fall into some occupation in which there are many ladies already to keep you in countenance teaching was mentioned i think was it not harrington rhoda gale sighed deeply i am not surprised said she most women of the world think with you but oh miss vizard please take into account all that i have done and suffered for medicine is all that to go for nothing think what a bitter thing it must be to do and then to undo to labor and study and then knock it all downto cut a slice out of ones life out of the very heart of itand throw it clean away i know it is hard for you to enter into the feelings of any one who loves science and is told to desert it but suppose you had loved a man you were proud ofloved him for five yearsand then they came to you and said there are difficulties in the way he is as worthy as ever and he will never desert you but you must give him up and try and get a taste for human rubbish it will only be five years of wasted life wasted youth wasted seedtime wasted affection and then a long vegetable life of unavailing regrets i love science as other women love men if i am to give up science why not die then i shall not feel my loss and i know how to die without pain oh the world is cruel ah i am too unfortunate everybody else is rewarded for patience prudence temperance industry and a life with high and almost holy aims but i am punished afflicted crushed under the injustice of the day do not make me a nursemaid i wont be a governess and i must not die because that would grieve my mother have pity on me have pity she trembled all over and stretched out her hands to zoe with truly touching supplication zoe forgot her part or lost the power to play it well she turned her head away and would not assent but two large tears rolled out of her beautiful eyes miss gale who had risen in the ardor of her appeal saw that and it set her off she leaned her brow against the mantelpiece not like a woman but a brave boy that does not want to be seen crying and she faltered out in france i am a learned physician and here to be a housemaid for i wont live on borrowed money i am very unfortunate severne who had lost patience came swiftly in and found them in this position and vizard walking impatiently about the room in a state of emotion which he was pleased to call anger zoe in a tearful voice said i am unable to advise you it is very hard that any one so deserving should be degraded vizard burst out it is harder the world should be so full of conventional sneaks and that i was near making one of them the last thing we ever think of in this paltry world is justice and it ought to be the first well for once ive got the power to be just and just ill be by god come leave off sniveling you two and take a lesson in justicefrom a beginner converts are always the hottest you know miss gale you shall not be driven out of science and your life and labor wasted you shall doctor barfordshire and teach it english too if any woman can this is the programme i farm two hundred acresvicariously of course nobody in england has brains to do anything himself that weakness is confined to your late fathers country and they suffer for it by outfighting outlying outmaneuvering outbullying and outwitting us whenever we encounter them well the farmhouse is large the bailiff has no children there is a wing furnished and not occupied you shall live there with the right of cutting vegetables roasting chickens sucking eggs and riding a couple of horses off their legs but what am i to do for all that oh only the work of two men you must keep my house in perfect health the servants have a trick of eating till they burst you will have to sew them up again there are only seven hundred people in the village you must cure them all and if you do i promise you their lasting ingratitude outside the village you must make them payif you can we will find you patients of every degree but whether you will ever get any fees out of them this deponent sayeth not however i can answer for the ladies of our county that they will all cheat youif they can miss gales color came and went and her eyes sparkled oh how good you are is there a hospital county hospital and infirmary within three miles fine country for disease intoxication prevalent leading to a bountiful return of accidents i promise you wounds bruises and putrefying sores and everything to make you comfortable oh dont laugh at me i am so afraid i shallno i hope i shall not disgrace you and then it is against the law but i dont mind that of course not what is the law to ladies with elevated views bytheby what is the penaltysix months oh no twenty pounds oh dear another twenty pounds make your mind easy unjust laws are a dead letter on a soil so primitive as ours i shall talk to uxmoor and a few more and no magistrate will ever summons you nor jury convict you in barfordshire you will be as safe there as in upper canada now thenattend we leave for barfordshire tomorrow you will go down on the first of next month by that time all will be ready start for taddington eleven oclock you will be met at the taddington station and taken to your farmhouse you will find a fire ten days old and for once in your life young lady you will find an aired bed because my man harris will be housemaid and not let one of your homicidal sex set foot in the crib miss gale looked from vizard to his sister like a person in a dream she was glowing with happiness but it did not spoil her she said humbly and timidly i hope i may prove worthy that is your business said vizard with supreme indifference mine is to be just have a cup of tea oh no thank you and it will be a part of my duty to object to afternoon tea but i am afraid none of you will mind me after a few more words in which severne seeing vizard was in one of his iron moods and immovable as him of rhodes affected now to be a partisan of the new arrangement miss gale rose to retire severne ran before her to the door and opened it as to a queen she bowed formally to him as she went out when she was on the other side the door she turned her head in her sharp fiery way and pointed with her finger to the emerald ring on his little finger a very fine one changed hands said she it was on the third finger of your left hand when we met last and she passed down the stairs with a face half turned to him and a cruel smile severne stood fixed looking after her cold crept among his bones he was roused by a voice above him saying very inquisitively what does she say he looked up and it was fanny dover leaning over the balusters of the next landing she had evidently seen all and heard some severne had no means of knowing how much his heart beat rapidly yet he told her boldly that the doctress had admired his emerald ring as if to give greater force to this explanation he took it off and showed it her very amicably he calculated that she could hardly at that distance have heard every syllable and at the same time he was sure she had seen miss gale point at the ring hum said fanny and that was all she said severne went to his own room to think he was almost dizzy he dreaded this rhoda gale she was incomprehensible and held a sword over his head tongues go fast in the country at the idea of this keen girl and zoe vizard sitting under a tree for two hours with nothing to do but talk his blood ran cold surely miss gale must hate him she would not always spare him for once he could not see his way clear should he tell her half the truth and throw himself on her mercy should he make love to her or what should he do one thing he saw clear enough he must not quit the field sooner or later all would depend on his presence his tact and his ready wit he felt like a man who could not swim and wades in deepening water he must send somebody to homburg or abandon all thought of his money why abandon it why not return to ina klosking his judgment alarmed at the accumulating difficulties began to intrude its voice what was he turning his back on a woman lovely loving and celebrated who was very likely pining for him and would share not only her winnings at play with him but the large income she would make by her talent what was he following a woman divinely lovely and good but whom he could not possess or if he did could not hold her long and whose love must end in horror but nature is not so unfair to honest men as to give wisdom to the cunning rarely does reason prevail against passion in such a mind as severnes it ended as might have been expected in his going down to vizard court with zoe an express train soon whirled them down to taddington in barfordshire there was harris with three servants waiting for them one with a light cart for their luggage and two with an open carriage and two spanking bays whose coats shone like satin the servants liveried and topbooted and buckskingloved and spruce as if just out of a bandbox were all smartness and respectful zeal they got the luggage out in a trice with harriss assistance mr harris then drove away like the wind in his dogcart the traveling party were soon in the barouche it glided away and they rolled on easy springs at the rate of twelve miles an hour till they came to the lodgegate it was opened at their approach and they drove full half a mile over a broad gravel path with rich grass on each side and grand old patriarchs oak and beech standing here and there and dappled deer grazing or lying in mottled groups till they came to a noble avenue of lofty limetrees with stems of rare size and smoothness and towering piles on piles of translucent leaves that glowed in the sun like flakes of gold at the end of this avenue was seen an old mansion built of that beautiful clean red brickwhich seems to have died outand whitestone facings and mullions with gables and oriel windows by the dozen but between the avenue and the house was a large oval plot of turf with a broad gravel road running round it and attached to the house but thrown a little back were the stables which formed three sides of a goodsized quadrangle with an enormous clock in the center the lawn kitchengarden icehouses pineries green houses revealed themselves only in peeps as the carriage swept round the spacious plot and drew up at the hall door no ringing of bells nor knocking even as the coachman tightened his reins the great hall door was swung open and two footmen appeared harris brought up a rearguard and received the party in due state a double staircase about ten feet broad rose out of the hall and up this mr harris conducted severne the only stranger into a bedroom with a great oriel window looking west this is your room sir said he shall i unpack your things when they come severne assented and that perfect majordomo informed him that luncheon was ready and retired catlike and closed the door so softly no sound was heard mr severne looked about him and admitted to himself that with all his experiences of life this was his first bedroom it was of great size to begin the oriel window was twenty feet wide and had half a dozen casements each with rosecolored blinds though some of them needed no blinds for green creepers with flowers like clusters of grapes curled round the mullions and the sun shone mellowed through their leaves enormous curtains of purple cloth with cold borders hung at each side in mighty folds to be drawn at nighttime when the eye should need repose from feasting upon color there were three brass bedsteads in a row only four feet broad with springbeds hair mattresses a foot thick and snowy sheets for coverlets instead of counterpanes so that if you were hot feverish or sleepless in one bed you might try another or two thick carpets and rugs satinwood wardrobes prodigious washhand stands with china backs four feet high towelhorses nearly as big as a donkey with short towels long towels thick towels thin towels bathing sheets etc baths of every shape and cans of every size a large kneehole table paper and envelopes of every size in short a room to sleep in study in live in and stick fast in night and day but what is this a gothic arch curtained with violet merino he draws the curtain it is an anteroom one half of it is a bathroom screened and paved with encaustic tiles that run up the walls so you may splash to your hearts content the rest is a studio and contains a choice little library of wellbound books in glass cases a pianoforte and a harmonium severne tried them they were both in perfect tune two clocks one in each room were also in perfect time thereat he wondered but the truth is it was a house wherein precision reigned a tuner and a clockmaker visited by contract every month this and two more guestchambers and the great dininghall were built under the plantagenets when all large landowners entertained kings and princes with their retinues as to that part of the house which was built under the tudors there are hundreds of country houses as important only mr severne had not been inside them and was hardly aware to what perfection rational luxury is brought in the houses of our large landed gentry he sat down in an antique chair of enormous size the back went higher than his head the seat ran out as far as his ankle when seated there was room in it for two and it was stuffedye gods how it was stuffed the sides the back and the seat were all hair mattresses a foot thick at least here nestled our sybarite with the sun shining through leaves and splashing his beautiful head with golden tints and transparent shadows and felt in the temple of comfort and incapable of leaving it alive he went down to luncheon it was distinguishable from dinner in this that they all got up after it and zoe said come with me children fanny and severne rose at the word vizard said he felt excluded from that invitation having cut his wiseteeth so he would light a cigar instead and he did zoe took the other two into the kitchen gardenfour acres surrounded with a high wall of orangered brick full of little holes where the nails had been zoe being now at home and queen wore a new and pretty deportment she was half maternal and led her friend and lover about like two kids she took them to this and that fruit tree set them to eat and looked on superior by way of climax she led them to the south wall crimson with ten thousand peaches and nectarines she stepped over the border took superb peaches and nectarines from the trees and gave them with her own hand to fanny and severne the head gardener glared in dismay at the fair spoliator zoe observed him and laughed poor lucas said she he would like them all to hang on the tree till they fell off with a wasp inside eat as many as ever you can young people lucas is amusing i never had peaches enough off the tree before said fanny no more have i said severne this must be the elysian fields and i shall spoil my dinner who cares said fanny recklessly dinner comes every day and always at the only time when one has no appetite but this eating of peachesoh what a beauty children said zoe gravely i advise you not to eat above a dozen do not enter on a fatal course which in one brief year will reduce you to a hapless condition therei was let loose among them at sixteen and ever since they pall but i do like to see you eat them and your eyes sparkle that is too bad of you said fanny driving her white teeth deep into a peach the idea now mr severne do my eyes sparkle like diamonds but that proves nothing it is their normal condition there make him a courtesy said zoe and come along she took them into the village it was one of the old sort little detached houses with little gardens in front in all of which were a few humble flowers and often a dark rose of surpassing beauty behind each cottage was a large garden with various vegetables and sometimes a few square yards of wheat there was one little row of new brick houses standing together their number five their name newtown this town of five houses was tiled the detached houses were thatched and the walls plastered and whitewashed like snow such whitewash seems never to be made in towns or to lose its whiteness in a day this broad surface of vivid white was a background against which the clinging roses the clustering creeping honeysuckles and the deep young ivy with its tender green and polished leaves shone lovely wood smoke mounted thin and silvery from a cottage or two that were cooking and embroidered the air not fouled it the little windows had diamond panes as in the middle ages and every cottage door was open suggesting hospitality and dearth of thieves there was also that old essential a village greena broad strip of sacred turf that was everybodys by custom though in strict law vizards here a village cow and a donkey went about grazing the edges for the turf in general was smooth as a lawn by the side of the green was the village alehouse after the green other cottages two of them quite overcanopied with lush woodbine with sweet muskroses and with eglantine one of these was called markss cottage and the other allens the rustic church stood in the middle of a hill nearly half a mile from the village they strolled up to it it had a tower built of flint and clad on two sides with ivy three feet deep and the body of the church was as snowy as the cottages and on the south side a dozen swallows and martins had lodged their mortar nests under the eaves they looked against the white like rugged gray stone bosses swallows and martins innumerable wheeled swift as arrows round the tower chirping and in and out of the church through an open window and added their music and their motion to the beauty of the place returning from the church to the village miss dover lagged behind and then severne infused into his voice those tender tones which give amorous significance to the poorest prose what an arcadia said he you would not like to be banished to it said zoe demurely that depends said he significantly instead of meeting him half way and demanding an explanation zoe turned coy and fell to wondering what fanny was about oh dont compel her to join us said severne she is meditating on what she is not much given that way on her past sins and preparing new ones for shame she is no worse than we are do you really admire islip indeed i do if this is islip it is then and this cottage with the clusterrose tree all over the walls is markss cottage we are rather proud of markss cottage said she timidly it is a bower said he warmly this encouraged zoe and she said is there not a wonderful charm in cottages i often think i should like to live in markss have you ever had that feeling never but i have it now i should like to live in itwith you zoe blushed like a rose but turned it off you would soon wish yourself back again at vizard court said she fannyfanny and she stood still fanny came up well what is the matter now said she with pert yet thoroughly apathetic indifference the matter isextravagances here is a man of the world pretending he would like to end his days in markss cottage stop a bit it was to be with somebody i loved and wouldnt you miss dover oh dear no we should be sure to quarrel cooped up in such a mite of a place no give me vizard court and plenty of money and the man of my heart you have not got one im afraid said zoe or you would not put him last why not when he is of the last importance said fanny flippantly and turned the laugh her way they strolled through the village together but in the grounds of vizard court fanny fairly gave them the slip severne saw his chance and said tenderly did you hear what she said about a large house being best for lovers yes i heard her said zoe defensively but very likely she did not mean it that young ladys words are air she will say one thing one day and another the next i dont know there is one thing every young ladys mind is made up about and that is whether it is to be love or money she was for both if i remember said zoe still coldly because she is not in love well i really believe she is notfor once there you see she is in an unnatural condition for her very so she is no judge no i should prefer markss cottage the smaller the better because then the woman i love could not ever be far from me he lowered his voice and drove the insidious words into her tender bosom she began to tremble and heave and defend herself feebly what have i to do with that you mustnt how can i help it you know the woman i lovei adoreand would not the smallest cottage in england be a palace if i was blessed with her sweet love and her divine company oh zoe zoe then she did defend herself after a fashion i wont listen to suchedward having uttered his name with divine tenderness she put her hands to her blushing face and fled from him at the head of the stairs she encountered fanny looking satirical she reprimanded her fanny said she you really must not do thatpauseout of our own grounds kiss me darling i am a happy girl and she curled round fanny and panted on her shoulder miss artful known unto men as fanny dover had already traced out in her own mind a line of conduct which the above reprimand minus the above kisses taken at their joint algebraical value did not disturb the fact is fanny hated home and liked vizard court above all places but she was due at home and hanging on to the palace of comfort by a thread any day her mother out of natural affection and goodbreeding might write for her and unless one of her hosts interfered she should have to go but harrington went for nothing in this unfortunately his hospitality was unobtrusive but infinite it came to him from the plantagenets through a long line of gentlemen who shone in vices but inhospitality was unknown to the whole chain and every human link in it he might very likely forget to invite fanny dover unless reminded but when she was there she was welcome to stay forever if she chose it was all one to him he never bothered himself to amuse his guests and so they never bored him he never let them he made them at home put his people and his horses at their service and preserved his even tenor so then the question of fannys stay lay with zoe and zoe would do one of two things she would either say with wellbred hypocrisy she ought not to keep fanny any longer from her motherand so get rid of her or would interpose and give some reason or other what that reason would be fanny had no precise idea she was sure it would not be the true one but there her insight into futurity and females ceased now zoe was thoroughly fascinated by severne and fanny saw it and yet zoe was too highbred a girl to parade the village and the neighborhood with him aloneand so placard her attachmentbefore they were engaged and the engagement sanctioned by the head of the house this consideration enabled miss artful to make herself necessary to zoe accordingly she showed on the very first afternoon that she was prepared to play the convenient friend and help zoe to combine courtship with propriety this plan once conceived she adhered to it with pertinacity and skill she rode and walked with them and in public put herself rather forward and asserted the leader but sooner or later at a proper time and place she lagged behind or cantered ahead and manipulated the wooing with tact and dexterity the consequence was that zoe wrote of her own accord to mrs dover asking leave to detain fanny because her brother had invited a college friend and it was rather awkward for her without fanny there being no other lady in the house at present she showed this to fanny who said earnestly as long as ever you like dear mamma will not miss me a bit make your mind easy vizard knowing his sister and entirely deceived in severne exercised no vigilance for to do zoe justice none was necessary if severne had been the man he seemed there was no mother in the house to tremble for her daughter to be jealous to watch to question to demand a clear explanationin short to guard her young as only the mothers of creation do the elysian days rolled on zoe was in heaven and severne in a fools paradise enjoying everything hoping everything forgetting everything and fearing nothing he had come to this with all his cunning he was intoxicated and blinded with passion now it was that the idea of marrying zoe first entered his head but he was not mad enough for that he repelled it with terror rage and despair he passed an hour or two of agony in his own room and came down looking pale and exhausted but indeed the little dumas though he does not pass for a moralist says truly and well les amours illegitimes portent toujours des fruits amers and ned severnes turn was come to suffer a few of the pangs he had inflicted gayly on more than one woman and her lover one morning at breakfast vizard made two announcements heres news said he dr gale writes to postpone her visit she is ill poor girl oh dear what is the matter inquired zoe always kindhearted gastritisso she says what is that inquired fanny mr severne who was much pleased at this opportune illness could not restrain his humor and said it was a disorder produced by the fumes of gas zoe accustomed to believe this gentlemans lies and not giving herself time to think said there was a great escape in the passage the night she went there then there was a laugh at her simplicity she joined in it but shook her finger at master severne vizard then informed zoe that lord uxmoor had been staying some time at basildon hall about nine miles off so he had asked him to come over for a week and he had accepted he will be here to dinner said vizard he then rang the bell and sent for harris and ordered him to prepare the blue chamber for lord uxmoor and see the things aired himself harris having retired catlike vizard explained my womankind shall not kill uxmoor he is a good fellow and his maniawe have all got a mania my young friendsis a respectable one he wants to improve the condition of the pooragainst their will his friend that was so ill i hope he has not lost him said zoe he hasnt lost him in this letter miss gush said vizard but you can ask him when he comes of course i shall ask him said zoe half an hour before dinner there was a grating of wheels on the gravel severne looked out of his bedroom window and saw uxmoor drive up dark blue coach silver harness glittering in the sun four chestnuts glossy as velvet two neat grooms as quick as lightning he was down in a moment and his traps in the hall and the grooms drove the trap round to the stables they were all in the drawingroom when lord uxmoor appeared greeted zoe with respectful warmth vizard with easy friendship severne and miss dover with wellbred civility he took zoe out and sat at her right hand at dinner as the new guest he had the first claim on her attention and they had a topic readyhis sick friend he told her all about him and his happy recovery with simple warmth zoe was interested and sympathetic fanny listened and gave severne short answers severne felt dethroned he was rather mortified and a little uneasy but too brave to show it he bided his time in the drawingroom lord uxmoor singled out zoe and courted her openly with respectful admiration severne drew fanny apart and exerted himself to amuse her zoe began to cast uneasy glances severne made common cause with fanny we have no chance against a lord or a lady you and i miss dover i havent said she but you need not complain she wishes she were here so do i will you help me no i shall not you can make love to me i am tired of never being made love to well said this ingenuous youth you certainly do not get your deserts in this house even i am so blinded by my passion for zoe that i forget she does not monopolize all the beauty and grace and wit in the house go on said fanny i can bear a good deal of itafter such a fast i have no doubt you can bear a good deal you are one of those that inspire feelings but dont share them give me a chance let me sing you a song a love song of course can you sing it as well as you can talk it with a little encouragement if you would kindly stand at the end of the piano and let me see your beautiful eyes fixed on me with disdain no no with just suspicion no with unmerited pity and he began to open the piano what do you accompany yourself yes after a fashion by that means i dont get run over then this accomplished person fixed his eyes on fanny dover and sung her an italian love song in the artificial passionate style of that nation and the english girl received it pointblank with complacent composure but zoe started and thrilled at the first note and crept up to the piano as if drawn by an irresistible cord she gazed on the singer with amazement and admiration his voice was a low tenor round and sweet as honey it was a real voice a musical instrument more tunable than lark to shepherds ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear and the klosking had cured him of the fatal whine which stains the amateur male or female and had taught him climax so that he articulated and sung with perfect purity and rang out his final notes instead of slurring them in short in plain passages he was a reflection on a small scale of that great singer he knew this himself and had kept clear of song it was so full of reminiscence and stings but now jealousy drove him to it it was vizards rule to leave the room whenever zoe or fanny opened the piano so in the evening that instrument of torture was always mute but hearing a male voice the squire who doted on good music as he abhorred bad strolled in upon the chance and he stared at the singer when the song ended there was a little clamor of ladies voices calling him to account for concealing his talent from them i was afraid of vizard said he he hates bad music none of your tricks said the squire yours is not bad music you speak your words articulately and even eloquently your accompaniment is a little queer especially in the bass but you find out your mistakes and slip out of them heaven knows how zoe you are tame but accurate correct his accompaniments some daywhen im out of hearing practice drives me mad give us another severne laughed goodhumoredly thus encouraged who could resist said he it is so delightful to sing in a shower bath of criticism he sung a sprightly french song with prodigious spirit and dash they all applauded and vizard said i see how it is we were not good enough he would not come out for us he wanted the public uxmoor you are the public it is to you we owe this pretty warbler have you any favorite song public say the word and he shall sing it you severne turned rather red at that and was about to rise slowly when uxmoor who was instinctively a gentleman though not a courtier said i dont presume to choose mr severne s songs but if we are not tiring him i own i should like to hear an english song for i am no musician and the words are everything with me severne assented dryly and made him a shrewd return for his courtesy zoe had a brave rose in her black hair he gave her one rapid glance of significance and sung a scotch song almost as finely as it could be sung in a room my love is like the red red rose thats newly sprung in june my love is like a melody thats sweetly played in tune the dog did not slur the short notes and howl upon the long ones as did a little fat jew from london with a sweet voice and no brains whom i last heard howl it in the theater royal edinburgh no he retained the pure rhythm of the composition and above all sung it with the gentle earnestness and unquavering emotion of a briton it struck zoes heart pointblank she drew back blushing like the rose in her hair and in the song and hiding her happiness from all but the keen fanny everybody but zoe applauded the song she spoke only with her cheeks and eyes severne rose from the piano he was asked to sing another but declined laughingly indeed soon afterward he glided out of the room and was seen no more that night consequently he became the topic of conversation and the three who thought they knew him vied in his praises in the morning an expedition was planned and uxmoor proffered his fourinhand it was accepted all young ladies like to sit behind four spanking trotters and few object to be driven by a viscount with a glorious beard and large estates zoe sat by uxmoor severne sat behind them with fanny a spectator of his open admiration he could not defend himself so well as last night and he felt humiliated by the position it was renewed day after day zoe often cast a glance back and drew him into the conversation yet on the whole uxmoor thrust him aside by his advantages and his resolute wooing the same thing at dinner it was only at night he could be number one he tuned zoes guitar and one night when there was a party he walked about the room with this and putting his left leg out serenaded one lady after another barfordshire was amazed and delighted at him but uxmoor courted zoe as if he did not exist he began to feel that he was the man to amuse women in barfordshire but uxmoor the man to marry them he began to sulk zoes quick eyes saw and pitied she was puzzled what to do lord uxmoor gave her no excuse for throwing cold water on him because his adoration was implied not expressed and he followed her up so closely she could hardly get a word with severne when she did there was consolation in every tone and she took care to let drop that lord uxmoor was going in a day or two so he was but he altered his mind and asked leave to stay severne looked gloomy at this and he became dejected he was miserable and showed it to see what zoe would do what she did was to get rather bored by uxmoor and glance from fanny to severne i believe zoe only meant do pray say things to comfort him but fanny read these gentle glances a la dover she got hold of severne one day and said what is the matter with you of course you cant divine said he sarcastically oh yes i can and it is your own fault my fault that is a good joke did i invite this man with all his advantages that was vizards doing who calls himself my friend if it was not this one it would be some other can you hope to keep zoe vizard from being courted why she is the beauty of the county and her brother not married it is no use your making love by halves to her she will go to some man who is in earnest and am i not in earnest not so much as he is you have known her four months and never once asked her to marry you so i am to be punished for my selfdenial selfdenial nonsense men have no selfdenial it is your cowardice dont be cruel you know it is my poverty your poverty of spirit you gave up money for her and that is as good as if you had it still and better if you love zoe scrape up an income somehow and say the word why harrington is bewitched with you and he is rolling in money i wouldnt lose her by cowardice if i were you uxmoor will offer marriage before he goes he is staying on for that now take my word for it when one man offers marriage and the other does not there is always a good chance of the girl saying this one is in earnest and the other is not we dont expect selfdenial in a man we dont believe in it we see you seizing upon everything else you care for and if you dont seize on us it wounds our vanity the strongest passion we have consider uxmoor has title wealth everything to bestow with the weddingring if he offers all that and you dont offer all you have how much more generous he looks to her than you do in short you think she will doubt my affection if i dont ask her to share my poverty if you dont and a rich man asks her to share his all im sure she will and so should i words are only words you torture me id rather die than lose her then live and win her ive told you the way i will scrape an income together and ask her upon your honor upon my soul then in my opinion you will have her in spite of lord uxmoor hot from this edward severne sat down and wrote a moving letter to a certain cousin of his in huntingdonshire my dear cousini have often heard you say you were under obligations to my father and had a regard for me indeed you have shown the latter by letting the interest on my mortgage run out many years and not foreclosing having no other friend i now write to you and throw myself on your pity i have formed a deep attachment to a young lady of infinite beauty and virtue she is above me in everything especially in fortune yet she deigns to love me i cant ask her hand as a pauper and by my own folly now deeply repented i am little more now all depends on youmy happiness my respectability sooner or later i shall be able to repay you all for gods sake come to the assistance of your affectionate cousin edward severne the brother a man of immense estates is an old friend and warmly attached to me if i could only through your temporary assistance or connivance present my estate as clear all would be well and i could repay you afterward to this letter he received an immediate reply dear edwardi thought you had forgotten my very existence yes i owe much to your father and have always said so and acted accordingly while you have been wandering abroad deserting us all i have improved your estate i have bought all the other mortgages and of late the rent has paid the interest within a few pounds i now make you an offer give me a long lease of the two farms at three hundred pounds a yearthey will soon be vacantand two thousand pounds out of hand and i will cancel all the mortgages and give you a receipt for them as paid in full this will be like paying you several thousand pounds for a beneficial lease the two thousand pounds i must insist on in justice to my own family your affectionate cousin george severne this munificent offer surprised and delighted severne and indeed no other man but cousin george who had a heart of gold and was grateful to neds father and also loved the scamp himself as everybody did would have made such an offer our adventurer wrote and closed with it and gushed gratitude then he asked himself how to get the money had he been married to zoe or not thinking of her he would have gone at once to vizard for the security was ample but in his present delicate situation this would not do no he must be able to come and say my estate is small but it is clear here is a receipt for six thousand pounds worth of mortgages i have paid off i am poor in land but rich in experience regrets and love be my friend and trust me with zoe he turned and twisted it in his mind and resolved on a bold course he would go to homburg and get that sum by hook or by crook out of ina kloskings winnings he took fanny into his confidence only he substituted london for homburg and oh miss dover said he do not let me suffer by going away and leaving a rival behind suffer by it said she no i mean to reward you for taking my advice dont you say a word to her it will come better from me ill let her know what you are gone for and she is just the girl to be upon honor and ever so much cooler to lord uxmoor because you are unhappy but have gone away trusting her and his artful ally kept her word she went into zoes room before dinner to have it out with her in the evening severne told vizard he must go up to london for a day or two all right said vizard tell some of them to order the dogcart for your train but zoe took occasion to ask him for how long and murmured remember how we shall miss you with such a look that he was in elysium that evening but at night he packed his bag for homburg and that chilled him he lay slumbering all night but not sleeping and waking with starts and a sense of horror at breakfast after reading his letters vizard asked him what train he would go by he said the one oclock all right said vizard then he rang the bell countermanded the dogcart and ordered the barouche a barouche for me said severne why i am not going to take the ladies to the station no it is to bring one here she comes down from london five minutes before you take the up train there was a general exclamation who was it aunt maitland no said vizard tossing a note to zoeit is doctress gale severnes countenance fell chapter xvii edward severne master of arts dreaded rhoda gale md he had deluded in various degrees several ladies that were no fools but here was one who staggered and puzzled him bright and keen as steel quick and spirited yet controlled by judgment and always mistress of herself she seemed to him a new species the worst of it was he felt himself in the power of this new woman and indeed he saw no limit to the mischief she might possibly do him if she and zoe compared notes he had thought the matter over and realized this more than he did when in london hence the good youths delight at her illness noticed in a former chapter he was very thoughtful all breakfast time and as soon as it was over drew vizard apart and said he would postpone his visit to london until he had communicated with his man of business he would go to the station and telegraph him and by that means would do the civil and meet miss gale vizard stared at him you meet my virago why i thought you disapproved her entirely no no only the idea of a female doctor not the lady herself besides it is a rule with me my dear fellow never to let myself disapprove my friends friends that is a bright idea and you are a good fellow said vizard go and meet the pest by all means and bring her here to luncheon after luncheon we will drive her up to the farm and ensconce her edward severne had this advantage over most impostors that he was masculine or feminine as occasion required for instance he could be hysterical or bold to serve the turn another examplehe watched faces like a woman and yet he could look you in the face like a man especially when he was lying in the present conjuncture a crafty woman would have bristled with all the arts of selfdefense but stayed at home and kept close to zoe not so our master of arts he went manfully to meet rhoda gale and so secure a teteatete and learn if possible what she meant to do and whether she could be cannily propitiated he reached the station before her and wired a very intelligent person who he knew conducted delicate inquiries and had been very successful in a divorce case public two years before even as he dispatched this message there was a whistling and a ringing and the sound of a coming train and ned severne ran to meet rhoda gale with a heart palpitating a little and a face beaming greatly to order he looked for her in the firstclass carriages but she was in the second and saw him he did not see her till she stepped out on the platform then he made toward her he took off his hat and said with respectful zeal if you will tell me what luggage you have the groom shall get it out miss gales eyes wandered over him loftily i have only a box and a bag sir both marked r g joe said hefor he had already made friends with all the servants and won their heartsbox and bag marked r g miss gale you had better take your seat in the carriage miss gale gave a little supercilious nod and he showed her obsequiously into the carriage she laid her head back and contemplated vacancy ahead in a manner anything but encouraging to this new admirer fate had sent her he turned away a little discomfited and when the luggage was brought up he had the bag placed inside and the box in a sort of boot and then jumped in and seated himself inside home said he to the coachman and off they went when he came in she started with wellfeigned surprise and stared at him oh said she i have met you before why it is mr severne excuse me taking you for one of the servants some people have short memories you know this deliberate affront was duly felt but parried with a masterhand why i am one of the servants said he only i am not vizards im yours indeed if you will let me i am too poor to have fine servants say too haughty you are not too poor for i shant cost you anything but a gracious word now and then unfortunately i dont deal in gracious words only true ones i see that then suppose you imitate me and tell me why you came to meet me this question came from her with sudden celerity like lightning out of a cloud and she bent her eyes on him with that prodigious keenness she could throw into those steel gray orbs when her mind put on its full power of observation severne colored a little and hesitated come now said this keen witch dont wait to make up a reason tell the truth for oncequickquickwhy did you come to meet me i didnt come to be bullied replied supple severne affecting sullenness you didnt cried the other acting vast surprise then what did you come for i dont know and i wish i hadnt come that i believe rhoda shot this in like an arrow but continued severne if i hadnt nobody would for it is vizards justicing day and the ladies are too taken up with a lord to come and meet such vulgar trifles as genius and learning and sci come come said rhoda contemptuously you care as little about science and learning and genius as i possess them you wont tell me well i shall find you out then after a pause who is this lord lord uxmoor what kind of a lord is he a very bushy lord bushyoh bearded like the pard now tell me said she is he cutting you out with miss vizard you shall judge for yourself please spare me on that one topicif you ever spared anybody in your life oh dear me said rhoda coolly im not so very cruel im only a little vindictive and catlike if people offend me i like to play with them a bit and amuse myself and then kill themkill themkill them that is all this pretty little revelation of character was accompanied with a cruel smile that showed a long row of dazzling white teeth they seemed capable of killing anything from a liar up to a hickorynut severne looked at her and gave a shudder then heaven forbid you should ever be my enemy said he sadly for i am unhappy enough already having delivered this disarming speech he collapsed and seemed to be overpowered with despondency miss gale showed no signs of melting she leaned back and eyed him with steady and composed curiosity as a zoologist studying a new specimen and all its little movements they drove up to the hall door and miss gale was conducted to the drawingroom where she found lord uxmoor and the two young ladies zoe shook hands with her fanny put a limp paw into hers which made itself equally limp directly so fannys dropped out lord uxmoor was presented to her at his own request soon after this luncheon was announced vizard joined them welcomed rhoda genially and told the party he had ordered the break and uxmoor would drive them to the farm round by hillstoke and the common and so said he by showing miss gale our most picturesque spot at once we may perhaps blind her to the horrors of her situationfor a time the break was driven round in due course with uxmoors team harnessed to it it was followed by a dogcart crammed with grooms uxmoorian and vizardian the break was padded and cushioned and held eight or nine people very comfortably it was indeed a sort of picnic van used only in very fine weather it rolled on beautiful springs its present contents were miss gale and her luggage and two hampers full of good things for her vizard severne and miss dover zoe sat on the box beside lord uxmoor they drove through the village and mr severne was so obliging as to point out its beauties to miss gale she took little notice of his comments except by a stiff nod every now and then but eyed each house and premises with great keenness at last she stopped his fluency by inquiring whether he had been into them all and when he said he had not she took advantage of that admission to inform him that in two days time she should be able to tell him a great deal more than he was likely to tell her upon his method of inspecting villages that is right said vizard snub him he gets snubbed too little here how dare he pepper science with his smalltalk but it is our faultwe admire his volubility oh said fanny with a glance of defiance at miss gale if we are to talk nothing but science it will be a weary world after the village there was a long gradual ascent of about a mile and then they entered a new country it was a series of woods and clearings some grass some arable huge oaks flung their arms over a road lined on either side by short turf closecropped by the gypsies cattle some band or other of them was always encamped by the roadside and never two bands at once and between these giant trees not one of which was ever felled you saw here and there a glade green as an emerald or a yellow stubble glowing in the sun after about a mile of this still mounting but gradually they emerged upon a spacious tablelanda long broad open grass plateau studded with cottages in this lake of grass uxmoor drew up at a word from zoe to show miss gale the scene the cottages were white as snow and thatched as at islip but instead of vegetablegardens they all had orchards the trees were apple and cherry of the latter not less than a thousand in that small hamlet it was literally a lawn a quarter of a mile long and about two hundred yards broad bordered with white cottages and orchards the cherries red and black gleamed like countless eyes among the cool leaves there was a little church on the lawn that looked like a pigeonhouse a cow or two grazed peacefully pigs big and little crossed the lawn grunting and squeaking satisfaction and dived into the adjacent woods after acorns and here and there a truffle the villagers knew not the value of there was a pond or two in the lawn one had a wooden plank fixed on uprights that went in some way a woman was out on the board barearmed dipping her bucket in for water in another pond an old knowing horse stood gravely cooling his heels up to the fetlocks these with shirts male and female drying on a line and whiteheaded children rolling in the dust and a donkey braying his heart out for reasons known only to himself if known at all were the principal details of the sylvan hamlet but on a general survey there were grand beauties the village and its turf lay in the semicircular sweep of an unbroken forest but at the sides of the leafy basin glades had been cut for drawing timber stacking bark etc and what milton calls so happily the checkered shade was seen in all its beauty for the hot sun struggled in at every aperture and splashed the leaves and the path with fiery flashes and streaks and topaz brooches all intensified in fire and beauty by the cool adjacent shadows looking back the view was quite open in most places the wooded lanes and strips they had passed were little more in so vast a panorama than the black stripes on a backgammon board the site was so high that the eye swept over all and rested on a broad valley beyond with a patchwork pattern of variegated fields and the curling steam of engines flying across all england then swept by a vast incline up to a horizon of faint green hills the famous pastures of the united kingdom so that it was a deep basin of foliage in front but you had only to turn your body and there was a fortymile view with all the sweet varieties of color that gem our fields and meadows as they bask in the afternoon sun of that golden time when summer melts into autumn and mellows without a chill oh cried miss gale dont anybody speak please it is too beautiful they respected an enthusiasm so rare in this young lady and let her contemplate the scene at her ease i reckon said she dogmatically and nodding that wise little head that this is old englandthe england my ancestors left in search of liberty and thats a plant that ranks before cherrytrees i rather think no i couldnt have gone id have stayed and killed a hundred tyrants but i wouldnt have chopped their heads off to vizard very confidentially id have poisoned em dont miss gale said fanny you make my blood run cold as it was quite indifferent to miss gale whether she made miss dovers blood run cold or not she paid no attention but proceeded with her reflections the only thing that spoils it is the smoke of those engines reminding one that in two hours you or i or that pastoral old hermit there in a smockfrock and a pipeand oh what bad tobaccocan be wrenched out of this paradise and shrieked and rattled off and flung into that wilderness of brick called london where the hearts are as hard as the pavementexcept those that have strayed there from barfordshire the witch changed face and tone and everything like lightning and threw this last in with a sudden grace and sweetness that contrasted strangely with her usual sharpness zoe heard and turned round to look down on her with a smile as sweet as honey i hardly think that is a drawback said she amicably does not being able to leave a place make it sweeter for then we are free in it you know but i must own there is a drawbackthe boys faces miss gale they are so pasty indeed says rhoda pricking up her ears form no false hopes of an epidemic this is not an infirmary in a wood miss gale said vizard my sister is a great colorist and pitches her expectations too high i dare say their faces are not more pasty than usual but this is a show place and looks like a garden so zoe wants the boys to be poppies and pansies and the girls roses and lilies whichtheyarenot all i know is said zoe resolutely that in islip the childrens faces are rosy but here they are pastydreadfully pasty well you have got a box of colors we will come up some day and tint all the puttyfaced boys it was to miss dover the company owed this suggestion no said rhoda their faces are my business ill soon fix them she didnt say puttyfaced she said pasty grateful to you for the distinction miss gale said zoe miss gale proceeded to insist that boys are not pastyfaced without a cause and it is to be sought lower down ah cried she suddenly is that a cherry that i see before me no a million they steal them and eat them by the thousand and thats why tell the truth now everybodythey eat the stones miss vizard said she did not know but thought them capable children know nothing said vizard please address all future scientific inquiries to an old inhabitant miss gale the country abounds in curiosities but among those curiosities even science with her searching eye has never yet discovered an unswallowed cherry stone in hillstoke village what not on the trees she is too much for me drive on coachman and drown her replies in the clatter of hoofs round by the stag zoe i am uneasy till i have locked fair science up i own it is a mean way of getting rid of a troublesome disputant now i think it is quite fair said fanny she shuts you up and so you lock her up tis well said vizard dolefully now i am no i who used to retort and keep girls in their placeswith difficulty here is ned severne too reduced to silence why wheres your tongue miss gale you would hardly believe it this is our chatterbox we have been days and days and could not get in a word edgewise for him but now all he can do is to gaze on you with canine devotion and devour the honeyi beg pardon the limejuiceof your lips i warn you of one thing though there is such a thing as a threatening silence he is evidently booking every word you utter and he will deliver it all for his own behind your back some fine day with this sort of banter and small talk not worth deluging the reader dead with they passed away the time till they reached the farm you stay here said vizardall but zoe tom and george get the things out the grooms had already jumped out of the dogcart and two were at the horses heads the stepladder was placed for zoe and vizard asked her to go in and see the rooms were all right while he took miss gale to the stables he did so and showed her a spirited galloway and a steady old horse and told her she could ride one and drive the other all over the country she thanked him but said her attention would be occupied by the two villages first and she should make him a report in fortyeight hours as you please said he you are terribly in earnest what should i be worth if i was not well come and see your shell and you must tell me if we have forgotten anything essential to your comfort she followed him and he led her to a wing of the farmhouse comparatively new and quite superior to the rest here were two good sunny rooms with windows looking south and west and they were both papered with a white watered pattern and a pretty french border of flowers at the upper part to look gay and cheerful zoe was in the bedroom arranging things with a pretty air of hospitality it was cheerily fitted up and a fire of beech logs blazing how good you are said rhoda looking wistfully at her but zoe checked all comments by asking her to look at the sittingroom and see if it would do rhoda would rather have stayed with zoe but she complied and found another bright cheerful room and vizard standing in the middle of it there was another beech fire blazing though it was hot weather here was a round table with a large pot full of flowers geraniums and musk flowers outside with the sun gilding their green leaves most amiably and everything unpretending but bright and comfortable well padded sofa luxurious armchair standup reading desk and a very large kneehole table a fine mirror from the ceiling to the dado a bookcase with choice books and on a pembroke table near the wall were several periodicals rhoda after a cursory survey of the room flew to the books oh said she what good books all standard works and several on medicine and i declare the last numbers of the lancet and the medical gazette and the very best french and german periodicals oh what have i done and what can i ever do what are you going to gush like the restand about nothing said vizard then im off come along zoe and he hurried his sister away she came at the word but as soon as they were out of the house asked him what was the matter i thought she was going to gush but i dare say it was a false alarm and why shouldnt she gush when you have been so kind poohnonsense i have not been kind to her and dont mean to be kind to her or to any woman besides she must not be allowed to gush she is the parish viragoimported from vast distances as suchand for her to play the woman would be an abominable breach of faith we have got our gusher likewise our flirt and it was understood from the first that this was to be a new dramatis personawas not to be a repetition of you or la dover butahemthe third grace a virago solidified vinegar rhoda gale felt very happy she was young healthy ambitious and sanguine she divined that somehow her turning point had come and when she contrasted her condition a month ago and the hardness of the world with the comfort and kindness that now surrounded her and the magnanimity which fled not to be thanked for them she felt for once in a way humble as well as grateful and said to herself it is not to myself nor any merit of mine i owe such a change as all this is what some call religion and others superstition overpowered her and she kneeled down and held communion with that great spirit which as she believed pervades the material universe and probably arises from it as harmony from the well strung harp theory of the day or plato redivivuswhich is it o great creative element and stream of tendencies in the universe whereby all things struggle toward perfection deign to be the recipient of that gratitude which fills me and cannot be silent and since gratitude is right in all and most of all in me at this moment forgive me if in the weakness of my intellect i fall into the old error of addressing you as an individual it is but the weakness of the heart we are persons and so we cry out for a personal god to be grateful to pray receive it soif indeed these words of mine have any access to your infinitely superior nature and if it is true that you influence the mind of man and are by any act of positive volition the cause of these benefits i now profit by then pray influence my mind in turn and make me a more worthy recipient of all these favors above all inspire me to keep faithfully to my own sphere which is on earth to be good and kind and tolerant to my fellow creatures perverse as they are sometimes and not content myself with saying good words to you to whose information i can add nothing nor yet to your happiness by any words of mine let no hollow sentiment of religion keep me long prating on my knees when life is so short and jumping suddenly up my duties can only be discharged afoot refreshed by this aspiration the like of which i have not yet heard delivered in churchesbut the rising generation will perhaps be more fortunate in that respectshe went into the kitchen ordered tea bread and butter and one egg for dinner at seven oclock and walked instantly back to hillstoke to inspect the village according to her ideas of inspection next morning down comes the bailiffs head man in his light cart and a note is delivered to vizard at the breakfast table he reads it to himself then proclaims silence and reads it aloud dear siras we crossed your hall to luncheon there was the door of a small room half open and i saw a large mahogany case standing on a marble table with one leg but three claws gilt i saw micro printed on the case so i hope it is a microscope and a fine one to enable you to find it if you dont know the room had crimson curtains and is papered in green flock that is the worst of all the poisonous papers because the texture is loose and the poisonous stuff easily detached and always flying about the room i hope you do not sit in it nor miss vizard because sitting in that room is courting death please lend me the microscope if it is one and ill soon show you why the boys are putty faced i have inspected them and find miss dovers epithet more exact than miss vizards which is singular i will take great care of it yours respectfully rhoda gale vizard ordered a servant to deliver the microscope to miss gales messenger with his compliments fanny wondered what she wanted with it not to inspect our little characters it is to be hoped said vizard why not pay her a visit you ladies then she will tell you perhaps the ladies instantly wore that bland look of inert but rocky resistance i have already noted as a characteristic of our girls vizard saw and said try and persuade them uxmoor i can only offer miss vizard my escort said lord uxmoor and i offer both ladies mine said ned severne rather loud and with a little sneer to mark his superior breeding the gentleman was so extremely polite in general that there was no mistaking his hostile intentions now the inevitable war had begun and the first shot was fired of course the wonder was it had not come long before and perhaps i ought to have drawn more attention to the delicacy and tact of zoe vizard which had averted it for a time to be sure she had been aided by the size of the house and its habits the ladies had their own sitting rooms fanny kept close to zoe by special orders and nobody could get a chance teteatete with zoe unless she chose by this means her native dignity and watchful tact by her frank courtesy to uxmoor and by the many little quiet ways she took to show severne her sentiments remained unchanged she had managed to keep the peace and avert that open competition for her favor which would have tickled the vanity of a fanny dover but shocked the refined modesty of a zoe vizard but nature will have her way soon or late and it is the nature of males to fight for the female at severnes shot uxmoor drew up a little haughtily but did not feel sure anything was intended he was little accustomed to rubs zoe on the other hand turned a little palejust a little for she was sorry but not surprised so she proved equal to the occasion she smiled and made light of it of course we are all going said she except one said vizard dryly that is too bad said fanny here he drives us all to visit his bluestocking but he takes good care not to go himself perhaps he prefers to visit her alone suggested severne zoe looked alarmed that is so said vizard observe i am learning her very phrases when you come back tell me every word she says pray let nothing be lost that falls from my virago the party started after luncheon and severne true to his new policy whipped to zoes side before uxmoor and engaged her at once in conversation uxmoor bit his lip and fell to fanny fanny saw at once what was going on and made herself very agreeable to uxmoor he was polite and a little gratified but cast uneasy glances at the other pair meantime severne was improving his opportunity sorry to disturb lord uxmoors monopoly said he sarcastically but i could not bear it any longer i do not object to the change said zoe smiling maternally on him but you will be good enough to imitate me in one thingyou will always be polite to lord uxmoor he makes it rather hard it is only for a time and we must learn to be capable of selfdenial i assure you i have exercised quite as much as i ask of you edward he is a gentleman of great worth universally respected and my brother has a particular wish to be friends with him so pray be patient be considerate have a little faith in one who she did not end the sentence well i will said he but please think of me a little i am beginning to feel quite thrust aside and degraded in my own eyes for putting up with it for shame to talk so said zoe but the tears came into her eyes the master of arts saw and said no more he had the art of not overdoing he left the arrow to rankle he walked by her side in a silence for ever so long then suddenly as if by a mighty effort of unselfish love went off into delightful discourse he cooed and wooed and flattered and fascinated and by the time they reached the farm had driven uxmoor out of her head miss gale was out the farmers wife said she had gone into the townmeaning hillstokewhich was strictly speaking a hamlet or tributary village hillstoke church was only twelve years old and the tithes of the place went to the parson of islip when zoe turned to go uxmoor seized the opportunity and drew up beside her like a soldier falling into the ranks zoe felt hot but as severne took no open notice she could not help smiling at the behavior of the fellows and uxmoor got his chance severne turned to fanny with a wicked sneer very well my lord said he but i have put a spoke in your wheel as if i did not see you clever creature said fanny admiringly ah miss dover i need to be as clever as you see what i have against me a rich lord with the bushiest beard never you mind said fanny good wine needs no bush ha ha you are lovely and have a wheedling tongue and you were there first be good nowand you can flirt with me to fill up the time i hate not being flirted at all it is stagnation yes but it is not so easy to flirt with you just a little you are so charming thereupon he proceeded to flatter her and wonder how he had escaped a passionate attachment to so brilliant a creature what saved me said he oracularly is that i never could love two at once and zoe seized my love at sight she left me nothing to lay at your feet but my admiration the tenderest friendship man can feel for woman and my lifelong gratitude for fighting my battle oh miss dover i must be quite serious a moment what other lady but you would be so generous as to befriend a poor man with another lady when theres wealth and title on the other side fanny blushed and softened but turned it off thereno heroics please said she you are a dear little fellow and dont go and be jealous for he shant have her he would never ask me to his house you know now i think you would perhapswho knows tell me fascinating monster are you going to be ungrateful not to you my home would always be yours and you know it and he caught her hand and kissed it in an ungovernable transport the strings of which be pulled himself he took care to be quick about it though and not let zoe or uxmoor see who were walking on before and behaving sedately in hillstoke lived on a pension from vizard old mrs greenaway rheumatic about the lower joints so she went on crutches but she went fast being vigorous and so did her tongue at hillstoke she was dame greenaway being a relic of that generation which applied the word dame to every wife high and low but at islip she was sally because she had started under that title fiftyfive years ago as housemaid at vizard court and by the tenacity of oral tradition retained it ever since in spite of two husbands she had wedded and buried with equal composure her feet were still springy her arms strong as iron and her crutches active at sight of our party she came out with amazing wooden strides agog for gossip and met them at the gate she managed to indicate a courtesy and said good day miss your sarvant all the

miss says i and she was off like a flash but i called my grandson bill and i told him he must follow her go where she would and let us know what she was up to down in islip then i went round the neighbors and one told me one tale and another another but it all comes to onewe have gotten a busybody thats the name i gives her she dont give in to that ye know she is a latiner and speaks according she gave master giles her own description says she im suspectorgeneral of this here districk so then giles he was skeared a bithe have got an acre of land of his own you knowand he up and

mouth but the old chap have got a hatful of money hid away in the thatch or somere only he haant a got the heart to spend it tell us more about the young lady asked uxmoor what young lady oh her she is not a young ladyleastways she is not dressed like one but like a plain decent body she was all of a pieceblue serge bless your heart the peddlers bring it round here at elevenpence halfpenny the yard and a good breadth too and plain boots not heeled like yourn miss nor yourn maam and a felt hat like a boy youd say the parish had dressed her for ten shillings and got a pot of beer out ont well never mind that said zoe i must tell you she is a very worthy young lady and my brother has a respect for her dress why sally you know it is not the wisest that spend most on dress you might tell us what she does dame greenaway snatched the word out of her mouth well then miss what she have done she have suspected everything she have suspected the ponds she have suspected the houses she have suspected the folk she must know what they eat and drink and wear next their very skin and what they do lie down on she have been at the very boys and forebade em to swallow the cherry stones poor things but old mrs nashwhich her boys lives on cherries at this time o year and to be sure they are a godsend to keep the children hereabout from starvingwell dame nash told her the almighty knew best he had put em together on the tree so why not in the boys insides and that was common sense to my mind but la she wouldnt heed it she said then youd eat the peach stones by that rule and the fish bones and all says she quite resolute like i forbid em to swallow the stones and says she ye mawnt gainsay me none on ye for i be the new doctor so then it all come out she isnt suspectorgeneral she

cheap that kills a body and doant cure em dear heart i forgot to tell ye about the ponds well you know there be no wells here we makes our tea out of the ponds and capital good tea to drink far before well water for i mind that one day about twenty years agone some interfering body did cart a barrel up from islip and if we wants water withouten tea why we can get plenty ont and none too much malt and hops at the black horse so this here young oman she suspects the poor ponds and casts a hevileye on them and she borrows two mugs of giles and carries the water home to suspect it closer that is all she have done at present but ye see she haant been here so very long you mark my words miss that young oman will turn hillstoke village topsyturvy or ever she goes back to london town nonsense sally said zoe how can anybody do that while my brother and i are alive she then slipped half a crown into sallys hand and led the way to islip on the road her conversation with oxmoor took a turn suggestive of this interview i forget which began it but they differed a little in opinion uxmoor admiring miss gales zeal and activity and zoe fearing that she would prove a rash reformer perhaps a reckless innovator and really said she why disturb things for go where i will i see no such paradise as these two villages they are indeed lovely said uxmoor but my own village is very pretty yet on nearer inspection i have found so many defects especially in the internal arrangements of the cottages that i am always glad to hear of a new eye having come to bear on any village i know you are very good said zoe and wish all the poor people about you to be as healthy and as happy as possible i really do said warmly i often think of the strange inequality in the lot of men living in the country i see around me hundreds of men who are by nature as worthy as i am or thereabouts yet they must toil and labor and indeed fight for bare food and clothing all their lives and worse off at the close of their long labor that is what grieves me to the heart all this time i revel in plenty and luxuriesnot forgetting the luxury of luxuries the delight of giving to those who need and deserve what have i done for all this i have been born of the right parents my merit then is the accident of an accident but having done nothing meritorious before i was born surely i ought to begin afterward i think a man born to wealth ought to doubt his moral title to it and ought to set to work to prove itought to set himself to repair the injustice of fortune by which he profits yes such a man should be a sort of human sunshine and diffuse blessings all round him the poor man that encounters him ought to bless the accident but there i am not eloquent you know how much more i mean than i can say indeed i do said zoe and i honor you ah miss vizard said uxmoor that is more than i can ever deserve you are praising me at your own expense said zoe well then said she sweetly please accept my sympathy it is so rare to find a gentleman of your age thinking so little of himself and so much of poor people yet that is a divine command but somehow we forget our religion out of churchmost of us i am sure i do for one this conversation brought them to the village and there they met vizard and zoe repeated old sallys discourse to him word for word he shook his head solemnly and said he shared her misgivings we have caught a tartar on arriving at vizard court they found miss gale had called and left two cards open rivalry having now commenced between uxmoor and severne his lordship was adroit enough to contrive that the drag should be in request next day then severne got fanny to convey a note to zoe imploring her to open her bedroom window and say goodnight to him the last for said he i have no coach and four and i am very unhappy this and his staying sullenly at home spoiled zoes ride and she was cool to uxmoor and spoiled his drive at night zoe peeped through the curtain and saw severne standing in the moonlight she drank him in for some time in silence then softly opened her window and looked out he took a step nearer she said very softly and tenderly you are very naughty and very foolish go to bed directly and she closed her window with a valiant slam then sat down and sighed same game next day uxmoor driving zoe wonderfully polite but chill because he was separating her and severne at night severne on the wet grass and zoe remonstrating severely but not sincerely and closing the window peremptorily she would have liked to keep open half the night it has often been remarked that great things arise out of small things and sometimes when in full motion depend on small things history offers brilliant examples upon its large stage fiction has imitated history in un verre deau and other compositions to these examples real or feigned i am now about to add one and the curious reader may if he thinks it worth while note the various ramifications at home and abroad of a seemingly trivial incident they were all seated at luncheon when a servant came in with a salver and said a gentleman to see you sir he presented his salver with a card upon it severne clutched the card and jumped up reddening show him in here said the hospitable vizard no no cried severne rather nervously it is my lawyer on a little private business vizard told the servant to show the visitor into the library and take in the madeira and some biscuits it is about a lease said ned severne and went out rather hurriedly la said fanny what a curious namepoikilus and what does s i mean i wonder this is enigmatical discourse said vizard dryly please explain why the card had poikilus on it you are very inquisitive said zoe coloring no more than my neighbors but the man put his salver right between our noses and how could i help seeing poikilus in large letters and s i in little ones up in the corner said vizard the female eye is naturally swift she couldnt help seeing all that in half a minute of time for ned severne snatched up the card with vast expedition i saw that too said fanny defiantly uxmoor put in his word poikilus that is a name one sees in the papers of course you do he is one of the humbugs of the day pretends to find things out advertises mysterious disappearances offers a magnificent rewardwith perfect safety because he has invented the lost girls features and dress and her disappearance into the bargain and i hold with the schoolmen that she who does not exist cannot disappear poikilus a puffing detective s i secret inquiry i spell enquiry with an ebut poikilus is a man of the day what the deuce can ned severne want of him i suppose i ought not to object i have established a female detective at hillstoke so ned sets one up at islip i shall make my own secret arrangements if poikilus settles here he will be drawn through the horsepond by smallminded rustics once a week while he was going on like this zoe felt uncomfortable and almost irritated by his volubility and it was a relief to her when severne returned he had confided a most delicate case to the detective given him written instructions and stipulated for his leaving the house without a word to any one and indeed seen him offall in seven minutes yet he returned to our party cool as a cucumber to throw dust in everybodys eyes i must apologize for this intrusion he said to vizard but my lawyer wanted to consult me about the lease of one of my farms and finding himself in the neighborhood he called instead of writing your lawyer eh said vizard slyly what is your lawyers name jackson said ned without a moments hesitation fanny giggled in her own despite instead of stopping here severne must go on it was his unlucky day not quite a gentleman you know or i would have inflicted his society on you not quiteeh said harrington so dryly that fanny dover burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter but zoe turned hot and cold to see him blundering thus and telling lie upon lie severne saw there was something wrong and buried his nose in pigeon pie he devoured it with an excellent appetite while every eye rested on him zoes with shame and misery uxmoors with open contempt vizards with good humored satire the situation became intolerable to zoe vizard indignant and deeply shocked herself she still could not bear to see him the butt of others ridicule and contempt she rose haughtily and marched to the door he raised his head for a moment as she went out she turned and their eyes met she gave him such a glance of pity and disdain as suspended the meat upon his fork and froze him into comprehending that something very serious indeed had happened he resolved to learn from fanny what it was and act accordingly but zoes maid came in and whispered fanny she went out and neither of the young ladies was seen till dinnertime it was conveyed to uxmoor that there would be no excursion of any kind this afternoon and therefore he took his hat and went off to pay a visit he called on rhoda gale she was at home he intended merely to offer her his respects and to side with her generally against these foolish rustics but she was pleased with him for coming and made herself so agreeable that he spent the whole afternoon comparing notes with her upon village life and the amelioration it was capable of each could give the other valuable ideas and he said he hoped she would visit his part of the country ere long she would find many defects but also a great desire to amend them this flattered her naturally and she began to take an interest in him that interest soon took the form of curiosity she must know whether he was seriously courting zoe vizard or not the natural reserve of a wellbred man withstood this at first but that armor could not resist for two mortal hours such a daughter of eve as this with her insidious questions her artful statements her catlike retreats and catlike returns she learnedthough he did not see how far he had committed himselfthat he admired zoe vizard and would marry her tomorrow if she would have him his hesitation to ask her because he had a rival whose power he could not exactly measure but a formidable and permitted rival they parted almost friends and rhoda settled quietly in her mind he should have zoe vizard since he was so fond of her here again it was severnes unlucky day and uxmoors lucky to carry this same day to a close severne tried more than once to get near zoe and ask if he had offended her and in what but no opportunity occurred so then he sat and gazed at her and looked unhappy she saw and was not unmoved but would not do more than glance at him he resigned himself to wait till night night came he went on the grass there was a light in zoes room it was eleven oclock he waited shivering till twelve then the light was put out but no window opened there was a moon and her windows glared black on him dark and bright as the eyes she now averted from him he was in disgrace the present incident i have recorded did not end here and i must now follow poikilus on his mission to homburg and if the reader has a sense of justice methinks he will not complain of the journey for see how long i have neglected the noblest figure in this story and the most to be pitied to desert her longer would be too unjust and derange entirely the balance of this complicated story chapter xviii a cruel mental stroke like a heavy blow upon the body sometimes benumbs and sickens at first but does not torture yet that is to follow it was so with ina klosking the day she just missed edward severne and he seemed to melt away from her very grasp into the wide world again she could drag herself to the theater and sing angelically with a dull and aching heart but next day her heart entered on sharper suffering she was irritated exasperated chained to the theater to homburg yet wild to follow severne to england without delay she told ashmead she must and would go he opposed it stoutly and gave good reasons she could not break faith with the management england was a large place they had as yet no clew but a name by waiting the clew would come the sure course was to give publicity in england to her winnings and so draw severne to her but for once she was too excited to listen to reason she was tempesttossed i will goi will go she repeated as she walked the room wildly and flung her arms aloft with reckless abandon and yet with a terrible majesty an instinctive grace and all the poetry of a great soul wronged and driven wild she overpowered ashmead and drove him to the director he went most unwillingly but once there was true to her and begged off the engagement eagerly the director refused this plump then ashmead still true to his commission offered him most reluctantly a considerable sum down to annul the contract and backed this with a quiet hint that she would certainly fall ill if refused the director knew by experience what this meant and how easily these ladies can command the human body to deaths door pro re nata and how readily a doctors certificate can be had to say or swear that the great creature cannot sing or act without peril to life though really both these arts are grand medicines and far less likely to injure the bona fide sick than are the certifying doctors draughts and drugs the director knew all this but he was furious at the disappointment threatened him no said he this is always the way a poor devil of a manager is never to have a success it is treacherous it is ungrateful ill close you tell her if she is determined to cut all our throats and kick her own good fortune down she can but by ill make her smart for it mind now she closes the theater and pays the expenses if she plays me false but if she is ill let her die and be and then ill believe her she is the healthiest woman in germany ill go and take steps to have her arrested if she offers to leave the town ashmead reported the managers threats and the klosking received them as a lioness the barking of a cur she drew herself swiftly up and her great eye gleamed imperial disdain at all his menaces but one he will not really close the theater said she loftily but uneasiness lurked in her manner he will said ashmead he is desperate and you know it is hard to go on losing and losing and then the moment luck turns to be done out of it in spite of a written bargain ive been a manager myself so many poor people said ina with a sigh and her defiant head sunk a little oh bother them said ashmead craftily let em starve god forbid said ina then she sighed again and her queenly head sunk lower then she faltered out i have the will to break faith and ruin poor people but i have not the courage then a tear or two began to trickle carrying with them all the egotistical resolution ina klosking possessed at that time perhaps we shall see her harden nothing stands still this time the poor conquered but every now and then for many days there were returns of torment and agitation and wild desire to escape to england ashmead made head against these with his simple arts for one thing he showed her a dozen paragraphs in ms he was sending to as many english weekly papers describing her heavy gains at the table with these stones said he i kill two birds extend your fame and entice your idol back to you here a growl which i suspect was an inarticulate curse joseph fi the pen of joseph on such occasions was like his predecessors coat polychromatic the klosking read him and wondered alas said she with what versatile skill do you descant on a single circumstance not very creditable creditable said ashmead it was very naughty but it is very nice and the creature actually winked forgetting of course whom he was winking at and wasting his vulgarity on the desert air for the kloskings eye might just manage to blinkat the meridian sun or so forth but it never winked once in all its life one of the paragraphs ran thus with a heading in small capitals a prima donna at the gambling table mademoiselle klosking the great contralto whose success has been already recorded in all the journals strolled on one of her off nights into the kursaal at homburg and sat down to trente et quarante her melodious voice was soon heard betting heavily with the most engaging sweetness of manner and doubling seven times upon the red she broke the bank and retired with a charming courtesy and eight thousand pounds in gold and notes another dealt with the matter thus rouge et noir the latest coup at homburg has been made by a cantatrice whose praises all germany are now ringing mademoiselle klosking successor and rival of alboni went to the kursaal pour passer le temps and she passed it so well that in half an hour the bank was broken and there was a pile of notes and gold before la klosking amounting to ten thousand pounds and more the lady waved these over to her agent mr joseph ashmead with a hand which par parenthese is believed to be the whitest in europe and retired gracefully on perusing this la klosking held two white hands up to heaven in amazement at the skill and good taste which had dragged this feature into the incident a dramatic situation a circumstance has lately occurred here which will infallibly be seized on by the novelists in search of an incident mademoiselle klosking the new contralto whose triumphant progress through europe will probably be the next event in music walked into the kursaal the other night broke the bank and walked out again with twelve thousand pounds and that charming composure which is said to distinguish her in private life what makes it more remarkable is that the lady is not a gamester has never played before and is said to have declared that she shall never play again it is certain that with such a face figure and voice as hers she need never seek for wealth at the gamblingtable mademoiselle klosking is now in negotiation with all the principal cities of the continent but the english managers we apprehend will prove awkward competitors were i to reproduce the nine other paragraphs it would be a very curious instructive and tedious specimen of literature and who knows i might corrupt some immaculate soul inspire some actor or actress singer or songstress with an itch for public selflaudation a foible from which they are all at present so free witness the era the hornet and figaro ina klosking spotted what she conceived to be a defect in these histories my friend said she meekly the sum i won was under five thousand pounds was it yes to be sure but you see these are english advertisements now england is so rich that if you keep down to any continental sum you give a false impression in england of the importance on the spot and so we are to falsify figures in the first of these legends it was double the truth and as i read it enlargesoh but it enlarges said ina with a gallicism we shall have to forgive in a lady who spoke five languages madam said ashmead dryly you must expect your capital to increase rapidly so long as i conduct it not being herself swift to shed jokes ina did not take them rapidly she stared at him he never moved a muscle she gave a slight shrug of her grand shoulders and resigned that attempt to reason with the creature she had a pill in store for him though she told him that as she had sacrificed the longings of her heart to the poor of the theater so she should sacrifice a portion of her illgotten gains to the poor of the town he made a hideously wry face at that asked what poorrates were for and assured her that pauper meant drunkard it is not written so in scripture said ina and i need their prayers for i am very unhappy in short ashmead was driven out from the presence chamber with a thousand thalers to distribute among the poor of homburg and once in the street his face did not shine like an angel of mercys but was very pinched and morose hardly recognizablepoor joe byandby he scratched his head now it is unaccountable but certain heads often yield an idea in return for that josephs did and his countenance brightened three days after this ina was surprised by a note from the burgomaster saying that he and certain of the town council would have the honor of calling on her at noon what might this mean she sent to ask for mr ashmead he was not to be found he had hidden himself too carefully the deputation came and thanked her for her munificent act of charity she looked puzzled at first then blushed to the temples munificent act gentlemen alas i did but direct my agent to distribute a small sum among the deserving poor he has done very ill to court your attention my little contribution should have been as private as it is insignificant nay madam said the clerk of the council who was a recognized orator your agent did well to consult our worthy burgomaster who knows the persons most in need and most deserving we do not doubt that you love to do good in secret nevertheless we have also our sense of duty and we think it right that so benevolent an act should be published as an example to others in the same view we claim to comment publicly on your goodness then he looked to the burgomaster who took him up and we comment thus madam since the middle ages the freedom of this town has not been possessed by any female there is however no law forbidding it and therefore madam the civic authorities whom i represent do hereby present to you the freedom of this burgh he then handed her an emblazoned vellum giving her citizenship with the reasons written plainly in golden letters ina klosking who had remained quite quiet during the speeches waited a moment or two and then replied with seemly grace and dignity mr burgomaster and gentlemen you have paid me a great and unexpected compliment and i thank you for it but one thing makes me uneasy it is that i have done so little to deserve this i console myself however by reflecting that i am still young and may have opportunities to show myself grateful and even to deserve in the future this honor which at present overpays me and almost oppresses me on that understanding gentlemen be pleased to bestow and let me receive the rare compliment you have paid me by admitting me to citizenship in your delightful town to herself ill scold him well for this low courtesy profound bows exit deputation enchanted with her manet klosking with the freedom of the city in her hand and ingratitude in her heart for her one idea was to get hold of mr joseph ashmead directly and reproach him severely for all this which she justly ascribed to his machinations the cunning ashmead divined her project and kept persistently out of her way that did not suit her neither she was lonely she gave the waiter a friendly line to bring him to her now mind you she was too honest to pretend she was not going to scold him so this is what she wrote my friendhave you deserted me come to me and be remonstrated what have you to fear you know so well how to defend yourself ina klosking arrived in a very few minutes mr ashamed jaunty cheerful and defensive ina with a countenance from which all discontent was artfully extracted laid before him in the friendliest way you can imagine an english bible it was her fathers and she always carried it with her i wish said she insidiously to consult you on a passage or two of this book how do you understand this when thou doest thine alms do not send a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do and this when thou doest thine alms let not thy right hand know what thy left hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly having pointed out these sentences with her finger she looked to him for his interpretation joseph thus erected into a scripture commentator looked at the passages first near and then afar off as if the true interpretation depended on perspective having thus gained a little time he said well i think the meaning is clear enough we are to hide our own light under a bushel but it dont say an agent is to hide his employers be serious sir this is a great authority oh of course of course stillif you wont be offended maamtimes are changed since then it was a very small place where news spread of itself and all that cannot be written for theatrical agents because there wasnt one in creation and so now their little customs lately invented like themselves are to prevail against gods immortal law it was something half way between handel and mellowed thunder the way her grand contralto suddenly rolled out these three words joseph was cunning he put on a crushed appearance deceived by which the firm but gentle klosking began to soften her tone directly it has given me pain said she sorrowfully and i am afraid god will be angry with us both for our ostentation not he said joseph consolingly bless your heart he is not half so irritable as the parsons fancy they confound him with themselves ina ignored this suggestion with perfect dignity and flowed on all i stipulate now is that i may not see this pitiable parade in print that is past praying for then said ashmead resolutely you might as well try to stop the waves as check publicityin our day your munificence to the poorconfound the lazy lotand the gratitude of those pompous prigs the deputationthe presentationyour admirable reply you never heard it now which as you say i was not so fortunate as to hear and so must content myself with describing itall this is flying north south east and west oh no no no you have not advertised it not advertised it for what do you take me wait till you see the bill i am running up against you madam you must take people as they are dont try to unashmead me it is impossible catch up that knife and kill me ill not resist on the contrary ill sit down and prepare an obituary notice for the weeklies and say i did it but while i breathe i advertise and joseph was defiant and the klosking shrugged her noble shoulders and said you best of creatures you are incurable to follow this incident to its conclusion not a week after this scene ina klosking detected in an english paper a charitable act mademoiselle klosking the great contralto having won a large sum of money at the kursaal has given a thousand pounds to the poor of the place the civic authorities hearing of this and desirous to mark their sense of so noble a donation have presented her with the freedom of the burgh written on vellum and gold mademoiselle klosking received the compliment with charming grace and courtesy but her modesty is said to have been much distressed at the publicity hereby given to an act she wished to be known only to the persons relieved by her charity ina caught the culprit and showed him this a thousand pounds said she are you not ashamed was ever a niggardly act so embellished and exaggerated i feel my face very red sir oh ill explain that in a moment said joseph amicably each nation has a coin it is always quoting france counts in francs germany in thalers america in dollars england in pounds when a thing costs a million francs in france or a million dollars in the states that is always called a million pounds in the english journals otherwise it would convey no distinct idea at all to an englishman turning thalers and francs into poundsthat is not exaggeration it is only translation ina gave him such a look he replied with an unabashed smile she shrugged her shoulders in silence this time and to the best of my belief made no more serious attempts to unashmead her ashmead a month had now passed and that was a little more than half the dreary time she had to wade through she began to count the days and that made her pine all the more time is like a kettle be blind to him he flies watch him he lags her sweet temper was a little affected and she even reproached ashmead for holding her out false hopes that his advertisements of her gains would induce severne to come to her or even write no said she there must be some greater attraction karl says that miss vizard who called upon me was a beauty and dark perhaps she was the lovely girl i saw at the opera she has never been there since and he is gone to england with people of that name well but that miss vizard called on you she cant intend to steal him from you but she may not know a woman may injure another without intending he may deceive her he has betrayed me her extraordinary beauty terrifies me it enchanted me and how much more a man joseph said he thought this was all fancy and as for his advertisements it was too early yet to pronounce on their effect the very day after this conversation he bounced into her room in great dudgeon there madam the advertisements have produced an effect and not a pleasant one heres a detective on to us he is feeling his way with karl i knew the man in a moment calls himself poikilus in print and smith to talk to but he is aaron at the bottom of it all and can speak several languages confound their impudence putting a detective on to us when it is they that are keeping dark who do you think has sent him asked ina intently the party interested i suppose interested in what why in the money you won for he was drawing karl about that then he sent the man and ina began to pant and change color well now you put it to me i think so come to look at it it is certain who else could it be here is a brace of sweeps they wouldnt be the worse for a good kicking you say the word and smith shall have one at all events alas my friend said ina for once you are slow what a messenger comes here direct from him and are we so dull we can learn nothing from him who comes to question us let me think she leaned her forehead on her white hand and her face seemed slowly to fill with intellectual power that man said she at last is the only link between him and me i must speak to him then she thought again no not yet he must be detained in the house letters may come to him and their postmarks may give us some clew ill recommend the house to him oh that is not necessary he will lodge here of his own accord does he know you i think not do not give him the least suspicion that you know he is a detective all right i wont if he sounds you about the money say nobody knows much about it except mademoiselle klosking if you can get the matter so far come and tell me but be you very reserved for you are not clear ashmead received these instructions meekly and went into the salle a manger and ordered dinner smith was there and had evidently got some information from karl for he opened an easy conversation with ashmead and it ended in their dining together smith played the openhanded country man to the lifestood champagne ashmead chattered and seemed quite off his guard smith approached the subject cautiously gamble here as much as ever all day some of them ladies and all why the ladies are the worst no are they now ah that reminds me i heard there was a lady in this very house won a pot o money it is true i am her agent i suppose she lost it all next day well not all for she gave a thousand pounds to the poor the dressmakers collared the rest i cannot say i have nothing to do except with her theatrical business she will make more by that than she ever made at play what is she tiptop the most rising singer in europe i should like to see her that you can easily do she sings tonight ill pass you in you are a good fellow have a bit of supper with me afterward bottle of fizz these two might be compared to a couple of spiders each taking the other for a fly smith was enchanted with inas singing or pretended ashmead was delighted with him or pretended introduce me to her said smith i dare not do that you are not professional are you no but you can say i am for a lark ashmead said he should like to but it would not do unless he was very wary oh im fly said the other she wont get anything out of me ive been behind the scenes often enough then ashmead said he would go and ask her if he might present a london manager to her he soon brought back the answer she is too tired tonight but i pressed her and she says she will be charmed if you will breakfast with her tomorrow at eleven he did not say that he was to be with her at halfpast ten for special instructions they were very simple my friend said she i mean to tell this man something which he will think it his duty to telegraph or write to him immediately it was for this i would not have the man to supper being after posttime this morning he shall either write or telegraph and then if you are as clever in this as you are in some things you will watch him and find out the address he sends to ashmead listened very attentively and fell into a brown study madam said he at last this is a firstrate combination you make him communicate with england and i will do the rest if he telegraphs ill be at his heels if he goes to the post i know a way if he posts in the house he makes it too easy at eleven ashmead introduced his friend sharpus manager of drury lane theater and watched the fencing match with some anxiety ina being little versed in guile but she had tact and selfpossession and she was not an angel after all but a woman whose wits were sharpened by love and suffering sharpus alias smith played his assumed character to perfection he gave the klosking many incidents of business and professional anecdotes and was excellent company the klosking was gracious and more bonne enfant than ashmead had ever seen her it was a fine match between her and the detective at last he made his approaches and i hear we are to congratulate you on success at rouge et noir as well as opera is it true that you broke the bank perfectly was the frank reply and won a million more or less said the klosking with an open smile i hope it was a good lump for our countrymen leave hundreds of thousands here every season it was four thousand nine hundred pounds sir phew well i wish it had been double you are not so close as our friend here madam no sir and shall i tell you why if you like madam said smith with assumed indifference mr ashmead is a model agent he never allows himself to see anybodys interests but mine now the truth is another person has an interest in my famous winnings a gentleman handed pounds to mr ashmead to play with he did not do so but i came in and joined pounds of my own to that pounds and won an enormous sum of course if the gentleman chooses to be chivalrous and abandon his claim he can but that is not the way of the world you know i feel sure he will come to me for his share some day and the sooner the better for money burns the pocket sharpus alias smith said this was really a curious story now suppose said he some fine day a letter was to come asking you to remit that gentleman his half what should you do i should decline it might be an escroc no mr ashmead here knows the gentleman do you not ill swear to him anywhere then to receive his money he must face the eye of ashmead ha ha the detective turned the conversation and never came back to the subject but shortly he pleaded an engagement and took his leave ashmead lingered behind but ina hurried him off with an emphatic command not to leave this man out of his sight a moment he violated this order for in five minutes he ran back to tell her in an agitated whisper that smith was at that moment writing a letter in the salle a manger oh pray dont come here cried ina in despair do not lose sight of him for a moment give me that letter to post then said ashmead and snatched one up ina had directed overnight he went to the hotel door and lighted a cigar out came smith with a letter in his very hand ashmead peered with all his eyes but smith held the letter vertically in his hand and the address inward the letter was sealed ashmead watched him and saw he was going to the general post he knew a shorter cut ran and took it and lay in wait as smith approached the box letter in hand he bustled up in a furious hurry and posted his own letter so as to stop smiths hand at the very aperture before he could insert his letter he saw apologized and drew back smith laughed and said all right old man that is to your sweetheart or you wouldnt be in such a hurry no it was to my grandmother said ashmead go on said smith and poked the ribs of joseph they went home jocular but the detective was no sooner out of the way than ashmead stole up to ina klosking and put his finger to his lips for karl was clearing away and in no hurry they sat on tenterhooks and thought he never would go he did go at last and then the klosking and ashmead came together like two magnets well all right letter to post saw address quite plainedward severne esq yes vizard court ah taddingtonbarfordshireengland ina who was standing all on fire now sat down and interlaced her hands vizard said she gloomily yes vizard court said ashmead triumphantly that means he is a large landed proprietor and you will easily find him if he is there in a month he will be there said ina she is very beautiful she is dark too and he loves change oh if to all i have suffered he adds that then you will forgive him that said ashmead shaking his head never look at me joseph ashmead he looked at her with some awe for she seemed transformed and her danish eye gleamed strangely you who have seen my torments and my fidelity mark what i say if he is false to me with another woman i shall kill himor else i shall hate him she took her desk and wrote at ashmeads dictation vizard court taddington barfordshire chapter xix the next morning vizard carried lord uxmoor away to a magistrates meeting and left the road clear to severne but zoe gave him no opportunity until just before luncheon and then she put on her bonnet and came downstairs but fanny was with her severne who was seated patiently in his bedroom with the door ajar came out to join them feeling sure fanny would openly side with him or slip away and give him his opportunity but as the young ladies stood on the broad flight of steps at the hall door an antique figure drew nighan old lady the shape of an egg so short and stout was she on her head she wore a black silk bonnet constructed many years ago with a droll design viz to keep off sun rain and wind it was like an iron coal scuttle slightly shortened yet have i seen some very pretty faces very prettily framed in such a bonnet she had an old black silk gown that only reached to her ankle and over it a scarlet cloak of superfine cloth fine as any colonel or queens outrider ever wore and looking splendid though she had used it forty years at odd times this dame had escaped the village ill rheumatics and could toddle along without a staff at a great and indeed a fearful pace for owing to her build she yawed so from side to side at every step that to them who knew her not a capsize appeared inevitable mrs judge i declare cried zoe ay miss hannah judge it is your sarvant maam and she dropped two courtesies one for each lady mrs judge was harringtons old nurse zoe often paid a visit to her cottage but she never came to vizard court except on harringtons birthday when the servants entertained all the old pensioners and retainers at supper her sudden appearance therefore and in gala costume astonished zoe probably her face betrayed this for the old lady began you wonder to see me here now doant ye well mrs judge said zoe diplomatically nobody has a better right to come you be very good miss i dont doubt my welcome nohow but said zoe playfully you seldom do us the honor so i am a little surprised what can i do for you you does enough for me miss you and young squire i baint come to ask no favors i aint one o that sort ill tell ye why i be come tis to warn you all up here this is alarming said zoe to fanny that is as may be said mrs judge forwarned forearmed the byword sayeth there is a young oman aprowling about this here parish as dont belong to hus la said fanny mustnt we visit your parish if we were not born there dont you take me up before i be down miss said the old nurse a little severely taint for the likes of you i speak which you are a lady and visits the court by permission of squire but what i objects to ishinterlopers she paused to see the effect of so big a word and then resumed graciously you see most of our hills comes from that there hillstoke if theres a poacher or a thief he is hillstoke they harbors the gypsies as ravage the whole country mostly and now they have let loose this here young oman on to us she is a poll pry goes about the town asarching pries into their housen and their vittels and their very beds old marks have got a muckheap at his door for his garden ye know well miss she sticks her parasole into this here and turns it about as if she was agoing to spread it says she i must know the decomposition of this ere as you keeps under the noses of your young folk well i seed her agoing her rounds and the folk had told me her ways so i did set me down to my knitting and wait for her and when she came to me i offered her a seat so she sat down and says she this is the one clean house in the village says she you might eat your dinner off the floor let alone the chairs and tables you are very good miss says i says she i wonder whether upstairs is as nice as this well says i them as keep it downstairs keeps it hup i dont drop cleanliness on the stairs you may be sure i suppose not says she but i should like to see that was what i was awaiting for you know so i said to her curiosity do breed curiosity says i afore you sarches this here house from top to bottom i should like to see the warrant what warrant says she ive no warrant dont take me for an enemy says she im your best friend says she im the new doctor i told her i had heard a whisper of that too but we had got a parish doctor already and one was enough not when he never comes anigh you says she and lets you go half way to meet your diseases i dont know for that says i and indeed i haant a notion what she meant for my part but says i i dont want no women folk to come here adoctoring o me thats sartin so she said but suppose you were very ill and the hedoctor three miles off and fifty others to visit afore you that is no odds says i i would not be doctored by a woman then she says to me says she now you look me in the face i can do that says i you or anybody else im an honest woman i am so i up and looked her in the face as bold as brass then says she am i to understand that if you was to be ill tomorrow you would rather die than be doctored by a woman she thought to daant me you see so i says well i dont know as i oodnt you do laugh miss well that is what she did all right says she make haste and die my good soul says she for while you live youll be a hobelisk to reform so she went off but i made to the door and called after her i should die when god pleased and i had seen a good many young folk laid out that looked as like to make old bones as ever she doeschalkfacedskinnytoad and i called after her she was no lady no more she aint to come into my own house and call a decent woman a hobelisk oh oh which i never was not even in my giddy days but did work hard in my youth and am respect for my old age yes nurse yes who doubts it and nursed young squire and lord bless your heart a was a poor puny child when i took him to my breast and in six months the finest chubbiest boy in all the parish and his drynurse for years arter and always at his heels akeeping him out of the stable and the ponds and consorting with the village boys and a proper resolute child he was and hard to manage and my own man that is gone and my son thats not so clever as some i always done justice by them both and arter all to be called a hobeliskoh oh oh paraphrase for the noun substantive idiot it is also a specimen of the greek figure litotes then behold the gentle zoe with her arm round nurses neck and her handkerchief to nurses eyes murmuring theretheredont cry nurse everybody esteems you and that lady did not mean to affront you she did not say obelisk she said obstacle that only means that you stand in the way of her improvements there was not much harm in that you know and nurse please give that lady her way to oblige me for it is by my brothers invitation she is here ye doant say so what does he hold with female shedoctoresses he wishes to try one she has his authority ye doant say so indeed i do consarn the wench why couldnt she says so stead o hargefying she is a stranger and means well so she did not think it necessary you must take my word for it la miss ill take yourn before hers you may be sure said mrs judge with a decided remnant of hostility and now a proverbial incident happened miss rhoda gale came in sight and walked rapidly into the group after greeting the ladies and ignoring severne who took off his hat to her with deep respect in the background she turned to mrs judge well old lady said she cheerfully and how do you do mrs judge replied in fawning accents thank you miss i be well enough to get about i was atelling em about youand to be sure it is uncommon good of a lady like you to trouble so much about poor folk dont mention it it is my duty and my inclination you see my good woman it is not so easy to cure diseases as people think therefore it is a part of medicine to prevent them and to prevent them you must remove the predisposing causes and to find out all those causes you must have eyes and use them you are right miss said la judge obsequiously prevention is better nor cure and they say a stitch in time saves nine that is capital good sense mrs judge and pray tell the villagers that and make them as full of the wisdom of nations as you seem to be and their houses as cleanif you can ill do my best miss said mrs judge obsequiously it is the least we can all do for a young lady like you that leaves the pomps and vanities and gives her mind to bettering the condishing of poor folk having once taken this cue and entered upon a vein of flattery she would have been extremely volublefor villages can vie with cities in adulation as well as in detractionbut she was interrupted by a footman announcing luncheon zoe handed mrs judge over to the man with a request that he would be kind to her and have her to dine with the servants yellowplush saw the gentlefolks away and then parting his legs and putting his thumbs into his waistcoat pockets delivered himself thus well old girl am i to give you my harm round to the kitchen or do you know the way by yourself young chap said mrs judge and turned a glittering eye i did know the way afore you was born and i should know it all one if so be you was to be hung or sent to botany bayto larn manners having delivered this shot she rolled away in the direction of roast beef the little party had hardly settled at the table when they were joined by vizard and uxmoor both gentlemen welcomed miss gale more heartily than the ladies had done and before luncheon ended vizard asked her if her report was ready she said it was have you got it with you yes then please hand it to me oh it is in my head i dont write much down that weakens the memory if you would give me half an hour after luncheon she hesitated a little zoe jealoused a teteatete and parried it skillfully oh said she but we are all much interested are not you lord uxmoor indeed i am said uxmoor so am i said fanny who didnt care a button yes but said rhoda truths are not always agreeable and there are some that i dont like she hesitated again and this time actually blushed a little the acute mr severne who had been watching her slyly came to her assistance look here old fellow said he to vizard dont you see that miss gale has discovered some spots in your paradise but out of delicacy does not want to publish them but to confide them to your own ear then you can mend them or not miss gale turned her eyes full on severne you are very keen at reading people sir said she dryly of course he is said vizard he has given great attention to your sex well if that is all miss gale pray speak out and gratify their curiosity you and i shall never quarrel over the truth im not so sure of that said miss gale however i suppose i must risk it i never do get my own way thats a fact after this little ebullition of spleen she opened her budget first of all i find that these villages all belong to one person so does the soil nobody can build cottages on a better model nor make any other improvement you are an absolute monarch this is a piece of russia not england they are all serfs and you are the czar it is true said vizard and it sounds horrid but it works benignly every snob who can grind the poor does grind them but a gentleman never and he hinders others now for instance an english farmer is generally a tyrant but my power limits his tyranny he may discharge his laborer but he cant drive him out of the village nor rob him of parish relief for poor hodge is my tenant not a snobs nobody can build a beershop in islip that is true but if they could they would sell bad beer give credit in the ardor of competition poison the villagers and demoralize them believe me republican institutions are beautiful on paper but they would not work well in barfordshire villages however you profess to go by experience in everything there are open villages within five miles ill give you a list visit them you will find that liberty can be the father of tyranny petty tradesmen have come in and built cottages and ground the poor down with rents unknown in islip farmers have built cottages and turned their laborers into slaves drunkenness dissipation poverty disaffection and miserythat is what you will find in the open villages now in islip you have an omnipotent squire and that is an abomination in theory a mediaeval monster a blot on modern civilization but practically the poor monster is a softener of poverty an incarnate buffer between the poor and tyranny the poor and misery ill inspect the open villages and suspend my opinion till then said miss gale heartily but in the meantime you must admit that where there is great power there is great responsibility oh of course well then your little outlying province of hillstoke is full of rheumatic adults and puttyfaced children the two phenomena arise from one causethe water no lime in it and too many reptiles it was the children gave me the clew i suspected the cherry stones at first but when i came to look into it i found they eat just as many cherry stones in the valley and are as rosy as apples but then there is well water in the valleys so i put this and that together and i examined the water they drink at hillstoke sir it is full of animalcula some of these cannot withstand the heat of the human stomach but others can for i tried them in mud artificially heated a giggle from fanny dover thanks to your microscope i have made sketches of several amphibia who live in those boys stomachs and irritate their membranes and share their scanty nourishment besides other injuries thereupon she produced some drawings they were handed round and struck terror in gentle bosoms oh gracious cried fanny one ought to drink nothing but champagne uxmoor looked grave vizard affected to doubt their authenticity he said you may not know it but i am a zoologist and these are antediluvian eccentricities that have long ceased to embellish the world we live in fie miss gale down with anachronisms miss gale smiled and admitted that one or two of the prodigies resembled antediluvian monsters but said oracularly that nature was fond of producing the same thing on a large scale and a small scale and it was quite possible the small type of antediluvian monster might have survived the large that is most ingenious said vizard but it does not account for this fellow he is not an antediluvian he is a barefaced modern for he is a steam engine this caused a laugh for the creature had a perpendicular neck like a funnel that rose out of a body like a horizontal cylinder at any rate said miss gale the little monster was in the world first so he is not an imitation of mans work well said vizard after all we have had enough of the monsters of the deep now we can vary the monotony and say the monsters of the shallow but i dont see how they can cause rheumatism i never said they did retorted miss gale sharply but the water which contains them is soft water there is no lime in it and that is bad for the bones in every way only the children drink it as it is the wives boil it and so drink soft water and dead reptiles in their tea the men instinctively avoid it and drink nothing but beer thus for want of a pure diluent with lime in solution an acid is created in the blood which produces gout in the rich and rheumatism in the poor thanks to their meager food and exposure to the weather poor things said womanly zoe what is to be done la said fanny throw lime into the ponds that will kill the monsters and cure the old peoples bones into the bargain this compendious scheme struck the imagination but did not satisfy the judgment of the assembly fanny said zoe reproachfully that would be killing two birds with one stone suggested uxmoor satirically the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel explained vizard composedly zoe reiterated her question what was to be done miss gale turned to her with a smile we have got nothing to do but to point out these abominations the person to act is the russian autocrat the paternal dictator the monarch of all he surveys and advocate of monarchial institutions he is the buffer between the poor and all their ills especially poison he must dig a well every eye being turned on vizard to see how he took this he said a little satirically what does science bid me bore for water at the top of a hill she does so said the virago now look here good people and although they were not all good people yet they all did look there she shone so with intelligence being now quite on her mettle halfcivilized man makes blunders that both the savage and the civilized avoid the savage builds his hut by a running stream the civilized man draws good water to his door though he must lay down pipes from a highland lake to a lowland city it is only halfcivilized man that builds a village on a hill and drinks worms and snakes and efts and antediluvian monsters in limeless water then i say if great but half civilized monarchs would consult science before they built their serf huts science would say dont you go and put down human habitations far from pure waterthe universal diluent the only cheap diluent and the only liquid which does not require digestion and therefore must always assist and never chemically resist the digestion of solids but when the mischief is done and the cottages are built on a hill three miles from water then all that science can do is to show the remedy and the remedy isboring then the remedy is like the discussion said fanny dover very pertly zoe was amused but shocked miss gale turned her head on the offender as sharp as a bird of course it is to children said she and that is why i wished to confine it to mature minds it is to you i speak sir are your subjects to drink poison or will you bore me a welloh please do you hear that said vizard piteously to uxmoor threatened and cajoled in one breath who can resist this fatal sexmiss gale i will bore a well on hillstoke common any idea how deep we must goto the antipodes or only to the center three hundred and thirty feet or thereabouts no more any idea what it will cost of course i have the well the double windlass the iron chain the two buckets a cupola over the well and twentythree keysone for every head of a house in the hamletwill cost you about pounds why this is detail made woman how do you know all this from tom wilder who is he what dont you know he is the eldest son of the islip blacksmith and a man that will make his mark he casts every thursday night he is the only village blacksmith in all the county who casts you know that i suppose no i had not the honor well he is then and i thought you would consent because you are so good and so i thought there could be no harm in sounding tom wilder he offers to take the whole contract if squires agreeable bore the well brick it fifty yards down he says that ought to be done if she is to have justice she is the well and he will also construct the gear he says there must be two iron chains and two buckets going together so then the empty bucket descending will help the man or woman at the windlass to draw the full bucket up pounds one weeks income your majesty she has inspected our rentroll now said vizard pathetically and knows nothing about the matter except that it is a mere fleabite to you to bore through a hill for water for all that i hope you will leave me to battle it with tom wilder then you wont be cheated for once you always are and it is abominable it would have been five hundred if you had opened the business i am sure that is true said zoe she added this would please mrs judge she was full of the superiority of islip to hillstoke stop a bit said vizard miss gale has not reported on islip yet no dear but she has looked into everything for mrs judge told me you have been into the cottages yes into markss yes i have been into markss she did not seem inclined to be very communicative so fanny out of mischief said pertly and what did you see there with your argus eye i sawthree generations ha ha la did you now and what were they all doing they were all living together night and day in one room this conveyed no very distinct idea to the ladies but vizard for the first time turned red at this revelation before uxmoor improver of cottage life confound the brutes said he why i built them a new room a larger one didnt you see it yes they stack their potatoes in it just like my people said uxmoor that is the worst of it they resist their own improvement yes but said the doctress with monarchial power we can trample on them for their good outside markss door at the back there is a muckheap as he calls it all the refuse of the house is thrown there it is a horrible melange of organic matter and decaying vegetables a hotbed of fever and malaria suffocated and poisoned with the breath of a dozen persons they open the window for fresh air and in rushes typhoid from the stronghold its victims have built two children were buried from that house last year they were both killed by the domestic arrangements as certainly as if they had been shot with a doublebarreled pistol the outside roses you admire so are as delusive as flattery their sweetness covers a foul unwholesome den markss cottage the show place of the village zoe vizard flushed with indignation at the bold hand of truth so rudely applied to a pleasant and cherished illusion vizard more candid and open to new truths shrugged his shoulders and said what can i do more than i have done oh it is not your fault said the doctress graciously it is theirs only as you are their superior in intelligence and power you might do something to put down indecency immorality and disease may i ask what well you might build a granary for the poor peoples potatoes no room can keep them dry but you build your granary upon four pillars then that is like a room over a cellar well ill build it soif i build it at all said vizard dryly what next then you could make them stack their potatoes in the granary and use the spare room and so divide their families and give morality a chance the muckheap you should disperse at once with the strong hand of power at this last proposal squire vizardthe truth must be tolddelivered a long plowmans whistle at the head of his own table pheugh said he for a lady that is more than half republican you seem to be taking very kindly to monarchial tyranny well now ill tell you the truth said she you have converted me ever since you promised me the well i have discovered that the best form of government is a goodhearted tyrant with a female viceroy over him eh only in these little domestic matters said rhoda deprecatingly women are good advisers in such things the male physician relies on drugs medical women are wanted to moderate that delusion to prevent disease by domestic vigilance and cure it by selected esculents and pure air these will cure fifty for one that medicine can besides drugs kill ever so many these never killed a creature you will give me the granary wont you oh and theres a black pond in the center of the village your tenant pickett who is a foolbegging his pardonlets all his liquid manure run out of his yard into the village till it accumulates in a pond right opposite the five cottages they call new town and its exhalations taint the air there are as many fevers in islip as in the back slums of a town you might fill the pond up with chalk and compel pickett to sink a tank in his yard and cover it then an agricultural treasure would be preserved for its proper use instead of being perverted into a source of infection vizard listened civilly and as she stopped requested her to go on i think we have had enough said zoe bitterly rhoda who was in love with zoe hung her head and said yes i have been very bold fiddlestick said vizard never mind those girls you speak out like a man a strangers eye always discovers things that escape the natives proceed no i wont proceed till i have explained to miss vizard you may spare yourself the trouble miss vizard thought islip was a paradise you have dispelled the illusion and she will never forgive you miss dover will because she is like gallioshe careth for none of these things not a pin said fanny with admirable frankness well but said rhoda naively i cant bear miss vizard to be angry with me i admire her so please let me explain islip is no paradisequite the reverse but the faults of islip are not your faults the children are ignorant but you pay for a school the people are poor from insufficient wages but you are not paymaster your gardeners your hinds and all your outdoor people have enough you give them houses you let cottages and gardens to the rest at half their value and very often they dont pay that but make excuses and you accept them though they are all stories for they can pay everybody but you and their one good bargain is with you miss vizard has carried a basket all her life with things from your table for the poor miss vizard blushed crimson at this sudden revelation if a man or a woman has served your house long theres a pension for life you are easy kind and charitable it is the faults of others i ask you to cure because you have such power now for instance if the boys at hillstoke are puttyfaced the boys at islip have no calves to their legs that is a sure sign of deteriorating species the lower type of savage has next to no calf the calf is a sign of civilization and due nourishment this single phenomenon was my clew and led me to others and i have examined the mothers and the people of all ages and i tell you it is a village of starvelings here a child begins life a starveling and ends as he began the nursing mother has not food enough for one far less for two the mans wages are insufficient and the diet is not only insufficient but injudicious the race has declined there are only five really big strong menjosh grace will hudson david wilder absalom green and jack greenaway and they are all over fiftymen of another generation i have questioned these men how they were bred and they all say milk was common when they were boys many poor people kept a cow squire doled it the farmers gave it or sold it cheap but nowadays it is scarcely to be had now that is not your fault but you are the man who can mend it new milk is meat and drink especially to young and growing people you have a large meadow at the back of the village if you could be persuaded to start four or five cows and let somebody sell the new milk to the poor at cost pricesay five farthings the quart you must not give it or they will water their muckheaps with it with those cows alone you will get rid in the next generation of the halfgrown slouching men the holloweyed narrowchested roundbacked women and the calfless boys one sees all over islip and restore the stalwart race that filled the little village under your sires and have left proofs of their wholesome food on the tombstones for i have read every inscription and far more people reached eightyfive between and than between and ah how i envy you to be able to do such great things so easily water to poisoned hillstoke with one hand milk to starved islip with the other this is to be indeed a king the enthusiast rose from the table in her excitement and her face was transfigured she looked beautiful for the moment ill do it shouted vizard and you are a trump miss gale sat down and the color left her cheek entirely fanny dover who had a very quick eye for passing events cried out oh dear she is going to faint now the tone implied what a plague she is thereupon severne rushed to her and was going to sprinkle her face but she faltered no no a glass of wine he gave her one with all the hurry and empressement in the world she fixed him with a strange look as she took it from him she sipped it one tear ran into it she said she had excited herself but she was all right now elastic rhoda i am very glad of it said vizard you are quite strong enough without fainting for heavens sake dont add womans weakness to your artillery or you will be irresistible and i shall have to divide vizard court among the villagers at present i get off cheap and science on the rampage let me seeonly a granary a well and six cows theyll give as much milk as twelve cows without the well said fanny it was her day for wit this time she was rewarded with a general laugh it subsided as such things will and then vizard said solemnly new ideas are suggested to me by this charming interview and permit me to give them a form which will doubtless be new to these accomplished ladies gin theres a hole in a your coats i rede ye tent it a chiels amang ye takin notes and faith hell prent it zoe looked puzzled and fanny inquired what language that was very good language then perhaps you will translate it into language one can understand the english of the day eh yes you think that would improve it do you well then if there is a defect in any one of your habilimeats let me earnestly impress on you the expediency of repairing it an individual is among you with singular powers of observation which will infallibly result in printing and publication zoe you are an affectionate sister take this too observant lady into the garden poison her with raw fruit and bury her under a pear tree zoe said she would carry out part of the programme if miss gale would come then the ladies rose and rustled away and the rivals would have followed but vizard detained them on the pretense of consulting them about the well but when the ladies had gone he owned he had done it out of his hatred to the sex he said he was sure both girls disliked his virago in their hearts so he had compelled them to spend an hour together without any man to soften their asperity this malicious experiment was tolerably successful the three ladies strolled together dismal as souls in purgatory one or two little attempts at conversation were made but died out for want of sympathy then fanny tried personalities the natural topic of the sex in general miss gale which do you admire most lord uxmoor or mr severne for their looks oh of course mr severne you dont admire beards then that depends where the mouth is well shaped and expressive the beard spoils it where it is commonplace the beard hides its defect and gives a manly character as a general rule i think the male bird looks well with his crest and feathers and so do i said fanny warmly and yet i should not like mr severne to have a beard dont you think he is very handsome he is something more said rhoda he is beautiful if he was dressed as a woman the gentlemen would all run after him i think his is the most perfect oval face i ever saw but you must not fall in love with him said fanny i do not mean to said rhoda falling in love is not my business and if it was i should not select mr severne why not pray inquired zoe haughtily her manner was so menacing that rhoda did not like to say too much just then she felt her way i am a physiognomist said she and i dont think he can be very truthful he is old of his age and there are premature marks under his eyes that reveal craft and perhaps dissipation these are hardly visible in the room but they are in the open air when you get the full light of day to be sure just now his face is marked with care and anxiety that young man has a good deal on his mind here the observer discovered that even this was a great deal too much zoe was displeased and felt affronted by her remarks though she did not condescend to notice them so rhoda broke off and said it is not fair of you miss dover to set me giving my opinion of people you must know better than i do oh what a garden and she was off directly on a tour of inspection come along said she and i will tell you their names and properties they could hardly keep up with her she was so eager the fruits did not interest her but only the simples she was downright learned in these and found a surprising number but the fact is mr lucas had a respect for his predecessors what they had planted he seldom uprootedat least he always left a specimen miss gale approved his system highly until she came to a row of green leaves like small horseradish which was planted by the side of another row that really was horseradish this is too bad even for islip said miss gale here is one of our deadliest poisons planted by the very side of an esculent herb which it resembles you dont happen to have hired the devil for gardener at any time do you just fancy any cook might come out here for horseradish and gather this plant and lay you all dead at your own table it is the aconitum of medicine the monkshood or wolfsbane of our ancestors call the gardener please and have every bit of it pulled up by the roots none of your lives are safe while poisons and esculents are planted together like this and she would not budge till zoe directed a gardener to dig up all the aconite a couple of them went to work and soon uprooted it the gardeners then asked if they should burn it not for all the world said miss gale make a bundle of it for me to take home it is only poison in the hands of ignoramuses it is most sovereign medicine i shall make tinctures and check many a sharp ill with it given in time it cuts down fever wonderfully and when you check the fever you check the disease soon after this miss gale said she had not come to stop she was on her way to taddington to buy lint and german styptics and many things useful in domestic surgery for said she the people at hillstoke are relenting at least they run to me with their cut fingers and black eyes though they wont trust me with their sacred rheumatics i must also supply myself with vermifuges till the well is dug and so mitigate puerile puttiness and internal torments the other ladies were not sorry to get rid of an irrelevant zealot who talked neither love nor dress nor anything that reaches the soul so zoe said what going already and having paid that tax to politeness returned to the house with alacrity but the doctress would not go without her wolfsbane aconite ycleped the irrelevant zealot being gone the true business of the mind was resumed and that is lovemaking or novelists give us false pictures of life and that is impossible as the doctress drove from the front door lord uxmoor emerged from the librarya coincidence that made both girls smile he hoped miss vizard was not too tired to take another turn oh no said zoe are you fanny at the first step they took severne came round an angle of the building and joined them he had watched from the balcony of his bedroom both men looked black at each other and made up to zoe she felt uncomfortable and hardly knew what to do however she would not seem to observe and was polite but a little stiff to both however at last severne having asserted his rights as he thought gave way but not without a sufficient motive as may be gathered from his first word to fanny my dear friend for heavens sake what is the matter she is angry with me about something what is it has she told you not a word but i see she is in a fury with you and really it is too ridiculous you told a fib that is the mighty matter i do believe no it isnt for you have told her a hundred no doubt and she liked you all the better but this time you have been naughty enough to be found out and she is romantic and thinks her lover ought to be the soul of truth well and so he ought said ned he isnt then and fanny burst out laughing so loud that zoe turned round and enveloped them both in one haughty glance as the exaggerating gaul would say la there was a look for you said fanny pertly as if i cared for her black brows i do though pray remember that then tell no more fibs such a fuss about nothing what is a fib and she turned up her little nose very contemptuously at all such trivial souls as minded a little mendacity indeed she disclaimed the importance of veracity so imperiously that severne was betrayed into saying well not much between you and me and ill be bound i can explain it explain it to me then well but i dont know which of your fibs it was another silver burst of laughter but zoe only vouchsafed a slightly contemptuous movement of her shoulders well no said severne half laughing himself at the sprightly jades smartness well then that friend of yours that called at luncheon severne turned grave directly yes said he you said he was your lawyer and came about a lease so he did and his name was jackson so it was this wont do you mustnt fib to me it was poikilus a secret inquiry and they all know it now tell me without a fibif you canwhat ever did you want with poikilus severne looked aghast he faltered out why how could they know why he advertises stupid and lord uxmoor and harrington had seen it gentlemen read advertisements that is one of their peculiarities of course he advertises that is not what i mean i did not drop his card did i no i am sure i pocketed it directly what mischiefmaking villain told them it was poikilus fanny colored a little but said hastily ah that i could not tell you the footman perhaps i should not wonder what is a fib curse him oh dont swear at the servants that is bad taste not when he has ruined me ruined younonsense make up some other fib and excuse the first i cant i dont know what to do and before my rival too this accounts for the air of triumph he has worn ever since and her glances of scorn and pity she is an angel and i have lost her stuff and nonsense said fanny dover be a man and tell me the truth well i will said he for i am in despair it is all that cursed money at homburg i could not clear my estate without it i dare not go for it she forbade me and indeed i cant bear to leave her for anything so i employed poikilus to try and learn whether that lady has the money still and whether she means to rob me of it or not fanny dover reflected a moment then delivered herself thus you were wrong to tell a fib about it what you must do nowbrazen it out tell her you love her but have got your pride and will not come into her family a pauper defy her to be sure we like to be defied now and then when we are fond of the fellow i will do it said he but she shuns me i cant get a word with her fanny said she would try and manage that for him and as the rest of their talk might not interest the reader and certainly would not edify him i pass on to the fact that she did that very afternoon go into zoes room and tell her severne was very unhappy he had told a fib but it was not intended to deceive her and he wished to explain the whole thing did he explain it to you asked zoe rather sharply no but he said enough to make me think you are using him very hardly to be sure you have another string to your bow oh that is the interpretation you put it is the true one do you think you can make me believe you would have shied him so long if lord uxmoor had not been in the house zoe bridled but made no reply and fanny went to her own room laughing zoe was much disturbed she secretly longed to hear severne justify himself she could not forgive a lie nor esteem a liar she was one of those who could pardon certain things in a woman she would not forgive in a man under a calm exterior she had suffered a noble distress but her pride would not let her show it yet now that he had appealed to her for a hearing and fanny knew he had appealed she began to falter still fanny was not altogether wrong the presence of a man incapable of a falsehood and that man devoted to her was a little damaging to severne though not so much as miss artful thought however this very afternoon lord uxmoor had told her he must leave vizard court tomorrow morning so zoe said to herself i need not make opportunities after tomorrow he will find plenty she had an instinctive fear he would tell more falsehoods to cover those he had told and then she should despise him and they would both be miserable for she felt for a moment a horrible dread that she might both love and despise the same person if it was edward severne there were several people to dinner and as hostess she managed not to think too much of either of her admirers however a stolen glance showed her they were both out of spirits she felt sorry her nature was very pitiful she asked herself was it her fault and did not quite acquit herself perhaps she ought to have been more open and declared her sentiments yet would that have been modest in a lady who was not formally engaged she was puzzled she had no experience to guide her only her high breeding and her virginal instincts she was glad when the night ended she caught herself wishing the next day was gone too when she retired uxmoor was already gone and severne opened the door to her he fixed his eyes on her so imploringly it made her heart melt but she only blushed high and went away sad and silent as her maid was undressing her she caught sight of a letter on her table what is that said she it is a letter said rosa very demurely zoe divined that the girl had been asked to put it there her bosom heaved but she would not encourage such proceedings nor let rosa see how eager she was to hear those very excuses she had evaded but for all that rosa knew she was going to read it for she only had her gown taken off and a peignoir substituted and her hair let down and brushed a little then she dismissed rosa locked the door and pounced on the letter it lay on her table with the seal uppermost she turned it round it was not from him it was from lord uxmoor she sat down and read it dear miss vizardi have had no opportunities of telling you all i feel for you without attracting an attention that might have been unpleasant to you but i am sure you must have seen that i admired you at first sight that was admiration of your beauty and grace though even then you showed me a gentle heart and a sympathy that made me grateful but now i have had the privilege of being under the same roof with you it is admiration no longerit is deep and ardent love and i see that my happiness depends on you will you confide your happiness to me i dont know that i could make you as proud and happy as i should be myself but i should try very hard out of gratitude as well as love we have also certain sentiments in common that would be one bond more but indeed i feel i cannot make my love a good bargain to you for you are peerless and deserve a much better lot in every way than i can offer i can only kneel to you and say zoe vizard if your heart is your own to give pray be my lover my queen my wife your faithful servant and devoted admirer uxmoor poor fellow said zoe and her eyes filled she sat quite quiet with the letter open in her hand she looked at it and murmured a pearl is offered me here wealth title all that some women sigh for andwhat i value above alla noble nature a true heart and a soul above all meanness no uxmoor will never tell a falsehood he could not she sighed deeply and closed her eyes all was still the light was faint yet she closed her eyes like a true woman to see the future clearer then in the sober and deep calm there seemed to be faint peeps of coming things it appeared a troubled sea and uxmoors strong hand stretched out to rescue her if she married him she knew the worstan honest man she esteemed and had almost an affection for but no love as some have an impulse to fling themselves from a height she had one to give herself to uxmoor quietly irrevocably by three written words dispatched that night but it was only an impulse if she had written it she would have torn it up presently a light thrill passed through her she wore a sort of halffurtive guilty look and opened the window ay there he stood in the moonlight waiting to be heard she did not start nor utter any exclamation somehow or other she almost knew he was there before she opened the window well said she with a world of meaning you grant me a hearing at last i do but it is no use you cannot explain away a falsehood of course not i am here to confess that i told a falsehood but it was not you i wished to deceive i was going to explain the whole thing to you and tell you all but there is no getting a word with you since that lord came he had nothing to do with it i should have been just as much shocked but it would only have been for five minutes zoe well just put yourself in my place a detective who ought to have written to me in reply to my note surprises me with a call i was ashamed that such a visitor should enter your brothers house to see me there sat my rivalan aristocrat i was surprised into disowning the unwelcomed visitor and calling him my solicitor now if zoe had been an old bailey counsel she would have kept him to the point reminded him that his visitor was unseen and fixed a voluntary falsehood on him but she was not an experienced crossexaminer and perhaps she was at heart as indignant at the detective as at the falsehood so she missed her advantage and said indignantly and what business had you with a detective you having one at all and then calling him your solicitor makes one think all manner of things i should have told you all about it that afternoon only our intercourse is broken off to please a rival suppose i gave you a rival and used you for her sake as you use me for his what would you say that would be a worse infidelity than sending for a detective would it not zoe replied haughtily you have no right to say you have a rival how dare you besides said she a little ruefully it is you who are on your defense not me true i forgot that recrimination is not convenient is it i can escape it by shutting the window said zoe coldly oh dont do that let me have the bliss of seeing you and i will submit to a good deal of injustice without a murmur the detective said zoe sternly i sent for him and gave him his instructions and he is gone for me to homburg ah i thought so what for about my money to try and find out whether they mean to keep it would you really take it if they would give it you of course i would yet you know my mind about it i know you forbade me to go for it in person and i obeyed you did i not yes you didat the time i do now you object to my going in person to homburg you know i was once acquainted with that lady and you feel about her a little of what i feel about lord uxmoor about a tenth part of what i feel i suppose and with not onetenth so much reason well i know what the pangs of jealousy are i will never inflict them on you as you have on me but i will have my money whether you like or not zoe looked amazed at being defied it was new to her she drew up but said nothing severne went on and i will tell you why because without money i cannot have you my circumstances have lately improved with my money that lies in homburg i can now clear my family estate of all incumbrance and come to your brother for your hand oh i shall be a very bad match even then but i shall not be a pauper nor a man in debt i shall be one of your own class as i was borna small landed gentleman with an unencumbered estate that is not the way to my affection i do not care for money but other people do dear zoe you have plenty of pride yourself you must let me have a little deeply as i love you i could not come to your brother and say give me your sister and maintain us both no zoe i cannot ask your hand till i have cleared my estate and i cannot clear it without that money for once i must resist you and take my chance there is wealth and a title offered you i wont ask you to dismiss them and take a pauper if you dont like me to try for my own money give your hand to lord uxmoor then i shall recall my detective and let all go for poverty or wealth will matter nothing to me i shall have lost the angel i love and she once loved me he faltered and the sad cadence of his voice melted her she began to cry he turned his head away and cried too there was a silence zoe broke it first edward said she softly zoe you need not defy me i would not humiliate you for all the world will it comfort you to know that i have been very unhappy ever since you lowered yourself so i will try and accept your explanation he clasped his hands with gratitude edward will you grant me a favor can you ask it is to have a little more confidence in one whonow you must obey me implicitly and perhaps we may both be happier tomorrow night than we are tonight directly after breakfast take your hat and walk to hillstoke you can call on miss gale if you like and say something civil what go and leave you alone with lord uxmoor yes ah zoe you know your power have a little mercy perhaps i may have a great dealif you obey me i will obey you then go to bed this minute she gave him a heavenly smile and closed the window next morning as soon as breakfast was over ned severne said any messages for hillstoke i am going to walk up there this morning embrace my virago for me said vizard severne begged to be excused he hurried off and lord uxmoor felt a certain relief the master of arts asked himself what he could do to propitiate the female m d he went to the gardener and got him to cut a huge bouquet choice and fragrant and he carried it all the way to hillstoke miss gale was at home as he was introduced rather suddenly she started and changed color and said sharply what do you want never asked him to sit down rude thing he stood hanging his head like a culprit and said with wellfeigned timidity that he came by desire of miss vizard to inquire how she was getting on and to hope the people were beginning to appreciate her oh that alters the case any messenger from miss vizard is welcome did she send me those flowers too they are beautiful no i gathered them myself i have always understood ladies loved flowers it is only by report you know that eh let me add something to your information a good deal depends on the giver and you may fling these out of the window she tossed them to him the master of arts gave a humble patient sigh and threw the flowers out of the window which was open he then sunk into a chair and hid his face in his hands miss gale colored and bit her lip she did not think he would have done that and it vexed her economical soul she cast a piercing glance at him then resumed her studies and ignored his presence but his patience exhausted hers he sat there twenty minutes at least in a state of collapse that bid fair to last forever so presently she looked up and affected to start what are you there still said she yes said be you did not dismiss me only my poor flowers well said she apologetically the truth is im not strong enough to dismiss you by the same road it is not necessary you have only to say go oh that would be rude could not you go without being told right out no i could not miss gale i cant account for it but there is some strange attraction you hate me and i fear you yet i could follow you about like a dog let me sit here a little longer and see you work miss gale leaned her head upon her hand and contemplated him at great length finally she adopted a catlike course no said she at last i am going my rounds you can come with me if i am so attractive he said he should be proud and she put on her hat in thirty seconds they walked together in silence he felt as if he were promenading a tiger cat that might stop any moment to fall upon him she walked him into a cottage there was a little dead wood burning on that portion of the brick floor called the hearth a pale old man sat close to the fire in a wooden armchair she felt his pulse and wrote him a prescription to mr vizards housekeeper vizard court please give the bearer two pounds of good roast beef or mutton not salted and one pint port wine rhoda gale m d here jenny she said to a sharp little girl the mans grandniece take this down to vizard court and if the housekeeper objects go to the frontdoor and demand in my name to see the squire or miss vizard and give them the paper dont you give it up without the meat take this basket on your arm then she walked out of the cottage and severne followed her he ventured to say that was a novel prescription she explained physicians are obliged to send the rich to the chemist or else the fools would think they were slighted but we need not be so nice with the poor we can prescribe to do them good when you inflicted your company on me i was sketching out a treatise to be entitled cure of disorders by esculents that old man is nearly exsanguis there is not a drug in creation that could do him an atom of good nourishing food may if not why he is booked for the long journey well he has had his innings he is fourscore do you think you will ever see fourscoreyou and your vices oh no but i think you will and i hope so for you go about doing good and some people one could name go about doing mischief severne made no reply soon after they discovered a little group principally women and children these were inspecting something on the ground and chattering excitedly the words of dire import she have possessed him with a devil struck their ear but soon they caught sight of miss gale and were dead silent she said what is the matter oh i see the vermifuge has acted it was so a puttyfaced boy had been unable to eat his breakfast had suffered malaise for hours afterward and at last had been seized with a sort of dry retching and had restored to the world they so adorn a number of amphibia which now wriggled in a heap and no doubt bitterly regretted the reckless impatience with which they had fled from an unpleasant medicine to a coldhearted world well good people said miss gale what are you making a fuss about are they better in the boy or out of him the women could not find their candor at a moments notice but old giles replied heartily why hout better an empty house than a bad tenant that is true said half a dozen voices at once they could resist common sense in its liquid form but not when solidified into a proverb catch me the boy said miss gale severely habitual culpability destroys selfconfidence so the boy suspected himself of crime and instantly took to flight his companions loved hunting so three swifter boys followed him with a cheerful yell secured him and brought him up for sentence dont be frightened jacob said the doctress i only want to know whether you feel better or worse his mother put in her word he was ever so bad all the morning hold your jaw said old giles and let the boy tell his own tale well then said jacob i was mortal bad but now do i feel like a feather wust ont is i be so blessed hungry now dalld if i couldnt eat the devilstuffed with thunder and lightning ill prescribe accordingly said miss gale and wrote in pencil an order on a beefsteak pie they had sent her from the court the boys companions put their heads together over this order and offered their services to escort him no thank you said the doctress he will go alone you young monkeys your turn will come then she proceeded on her rounds with mr severne at her heels until it was past one oclock then she turned round and faced him we will part here said she and i will explain my conduct to you as you seem in the dark i have been cooperating with miss vizard all this time i reckon she sent you out of the way to give lord uxmoor his opportunity so i have detained you while you have been studying medicine he has been popping the question of course goodby mr villain her words went through the man like cold steel it was one woman reading another he turned very white and put his hand to his heart but he recovered himself and said if she prefers another to me i must submit it is not my absence for a few hours that will make the difference you cannot make me regret the hours i have passed in your company goodby and he seemed to leave her very reluctantly one word said she softening a little im not proof against your charm unless i see zoe vizard in danger you have nothing to fear from me but i love her you understand he returned to her directly and said in most earnest supplicating tones but will you ever forgive me i will try and so they parted he went home at a great rate for miss gales insinuations had raised some fear in his breast meantime this is what had really passed between zoe and lord uxmoor vizard went to his study and fanny retired at a signal from zoe she rose but did not go she walked slowly toward the window uxmoor joined her for he saw he was to have his answer from her mouth her bosom heaved a little and her cheeks flushed lord uxmoor she said you have done me the greatest honor any man can pay a woman and from you it is indeed an honor i could not write such an answer as i could wish and besides i wish to spare you all the mortification i can ah said uxmoor piteously you are worthy of any ladys love but i have only my esteem to give you and that was given long ago uxmoor who had been gradually turning very white faltered i had my fears goodby she gave him her hand he put it respectfully to his lips then turned and left her sick at heart but too brave to let it be seen he preferred her esteem to her pity by this means he got both she put her handkerchief to her eyes without disguise but he only turned at the door to say in a pretty firm voice god bless you in less than an hour he drove his team from the door sitting heartbroken and desolate but firm and unflinching as a rock so then on his return from hillstoke severne found them all at luncheon except uxmoor he detailed his visit to miss gale and while he talked observed zoe was beaming with love and kindness he felt sure she had not deceived him he learned by merely listening that lord uxmoor was gone and he exulted inwardly after luncheon elysium he walked with the two girls and fanny lagged behind and zoe proved herself no coquette a coquette would have been a little cross and shown him she had made a sacrifice not so zoe vizard she never told him nor even fanny she had refused lord uxmoor she esteemed the great sacrifice she had made for him as a little one and so loved him a little more that he had cost her an earls coronet and a large fortune the party resumed their habits that uxmoor had interrupted and no warning voice was raised the boring commenced at hillstoke and doctress gale hovered over the work the various strata and their fossil deposits were an endless study and kept her microscope employed with this and her treatise on cure by esculents she was so employed that she did not visit the court for some days then came an invitation from lord uxmoor to stay a week with him and inspect his village she accepted it and drove herself in the bailiffs gig all alone she found her host attending to his duties but dejected so then she suspected and turned the conversation to zoe vizard and soon satisfied herself he had no hopes in that quarter yet he spoke of her with undisguised and tender admiration then she said to herself this is a man and he shall have her she sat down and wrote a letter to vizard telling him all she knew and what she thought viz that another woman and a respectable one had a claim on mr severne which ought to be closely inquired into and the ladys version heard think of it said she he disowned the woman who had saved his life he was so afraid i should tell miss vizard under what circumstances i first saw him she folded and addressed the letter but having relieved her mind in some degree by this she asked herself whether it would not be kinder to all parties to try and save zoe without an exposure probably severne benefited by his grace and his disarming qualities for her ultimate resolution was to give him a chance offer him an alternative he must either quietly retire or be openly exposed so then she put the letter in her desk made out her visit of which no further particulars can be given at present returned home and walked down to the court next morning to have it out with edward severne but unfortunately from the very day she offered him terms up at hillstoke the tide began to run in severnes favor with great rapidity a letter came from the detective severne received it at breakfast and laid it before zoe which had a favorable effect on her mind to begin poikilus reported that the money was in good hands he had seen the lady she made no secret of the thingthe sum was pounds and she said half belonged to her and half to a gentleman she did not know him but her agent ashmead did poikilus added that he had asked her would she honor that gentlemans draft she had replied she should be afraid to do that but mr ashmead should hand it to him on demand poikilus summed up that the lady was evidently respectable and the whole thing square severne posted this letter to his cousin under cover to show him he was really going to clear his estate but begged him to return it immediately and lend him pounds the accommodating cousin sent him pounds to aid him in wooing his heiress he bought her a hoop ring apologized for its small value and expressed his regret that all he could offer her was on as small a scale except his love she blushed and smiled on him like heaven opening small and great i take them said she and her lovely head rested on his shoulder they were engaged from that hour he could command a teteatete with her whenever he chose and his infernal passion began to suggest all manner of wild wicked and unreasonable hopes meantime there was no stopping he soon found he must speak seriously to vizard he went into his study and began to open the subject vizard stopped him fetch the other culprit said he and when zoe came blushing he said now i am going to make shorter work of this than you have done zoe has ten thousand pounds what have you got only a small estate worth eight thousand pounds that i hope to clear of all incumbrances if i can get my money fond of each other well dont strike me dead with your eyes i have watched you and i own a prettier pair of turtledoves i never saw well you have got love and i have got money ill take care of you both but you must live with me i promise never to marry this brought zoe round his neck with tears and kisses of pure affection he returned them and parted her hair paternally this is a beautiful world isnt it said he with more tenderness than cynicism this time ah that it is cried zoe earnestly but i cant have you say you will never be as happy as i am there are true hearts in this heavenly world for i have found one i have not and dont mean to try again i am going in for the paternal now you two are my children i have a talisman to keep me from marrying ill show it you he drew a photograph from his drawer set round with gold and pearls he showed it them suddenly they both started a fine photograph of ina klosking she was dressed as plainly as at the gamblingtable but without a bonnet and only one rose in her hair her noble forehead was shown and her face a model of intelligence womanliness and serene dignity he gazed at it and they at him and it he kissed it here is my fate said he now mark the ingenuity of a parent i keep out of my fates way but i use her to keep off any other little fates that may be about no other humbug can ever catch me while i have such a noble humbug as this to contemplate ah and here she is as siebel what a goddess just look at her adorable there this shall stand upon my table and the other shall be hung in my bedroom then my dear zoe you will be safe from a stepmother for i am your father now please understand that this brought poor zoe round his neck again with such an effusion that at last he handed her to severne and he led her from the room quite overcome and to avoid all conversation about what had just passed gave her over to fanny while he retired to compose himself by dinnertime he was as happy as a prince again and relieved of all compunction he heard afterward from fanny that zoe and she had discussed the incident and vizards infatuation fanny being specially wroth at vizards abuse of pearls but she told him she had advised zoe not to mention that ladys name but let her die out and in point of fact zoe did avoid the subject there came an eventful day vizard got a letter at breakfast from his bankers that made him stare and then knit his brows it was about edward severne s acceptances he said nothing but ordered his horse and rode into taddington the day was keen but sunny and seeing him afoot so early zoe said she should like a drive before luncheon she would show severne and fanny some ruins on pagnell hill they could leave the trap at the village inn and walk up the hill fanny begged off and severne was very glad the prospect of a long walk up a hill with zoe and then a day spent in utter seclusion with her fired his imagination and made his heart beat here was one of the opportunities he had long sighed for of making passionate love to innocence and inexperience zoe herself was eager for the drive and came down followed by rosa with some wraps and waited in the morningroom for the dogcart it was behind time for once because the careful coachman had insisted on the axle being oiled at last the sound of wheels was heard a carriage drew up at the door tell mr severne said zoe he is in the diningroom i think but it was not the dogcart a vigilant footman came hastily out and opened the hall door a lady was on the steps and spoke to him but in speaking she caught sight of zoe in the hall she instantly slipped pass the man and stood within the great door miss vizard said she zoe took a step toward her and said with astonishment mademoiselle klosking the ladies looked at each other and zoe saw something strange was coming for the klosking was very pale yet firm and fixed her eyes upon her as if there was nothing else in sight you have a visitormr severne yes said zoe drawing up can i speak with him he will answer for himself edward at her call severne came out hastily behind ina klosking she turned and they faced each other ah she cried and in spite of all there was more of joy than any other passion in the exclamation not so he he uttered a scream of dismay and staggered white as a ghost but still glared at ina klosking zoes voice fell on him like a clap of thunder whatedwardmr severnehas this lady still any right no none whatever he cried it is all past and gone what is past said ina klosking grandly are you out of your senses then she was close to him in a moment by one grand movement and took him by both lapels of his coat and held him firmly speak before this lady she cried haveinorightsover you and her voice was majestic and her danish eyes gleamed lightning the wretchs knees gave way a moment and he shook in her hands then suddenly he turned wild fiend you have ruined me he yelled and then with his natural strength which was great and the superhuman power of mad excitement he whirled her right round and flung her from him and dashed out of the door uttering cries of rage and despair the unfortunate lady thus taken by surprise fell heavily and by cruel ill luck struck her temple in falling against the sharp corner of a marble table it gashed her forehead fearfully and she lay senseless with the blood spurting in jets from her white temple zoe screamed violently and the hall and the hall staircase seemed to fill by magic in the terror and confusion harrington vizard strode into the hall from taddington what is the matter he cried a woman killed some one cried out she had fallen water foolsa spongedont stand gaping and he flung himself on his knees and raised the womans head from the floor one eager look into her white faceone wild crygreat god it is he had recognized her chapter xx it was piteous to see and hear the blood would not stop it spurted no longer but it flowed alarmingly vizard sent harris off in his own fly for a doctor to save time he called for ice he cried out in agony to his servants can none of you think of anything therethat hat here you women tear me the nap off with your fingers my god what is to be done shell bleed to death and he held her to his breast and almost moaned with pity over her as he pressed the cold sponge to her woundin vain for still the red blood would flow wheels ground the gravel servants flew to the door crying the doctor the doctor as if he could have been fetched in five minutes from three miles off yet it was a doctor harris had met miss gale walking quietly down from hillstoke he had told her in a few hurried words and brought her as fast as the horses could go she glided in swiftly keen but selfpossessed and took it all in directly vizard saw her and cried ah helpshe is bleeding to death she shall not said rhoda then to one footman bring a footstool you to another you bring me a cork to vizard you hold her toward me so now sponge the wound this done she pinched the lips of the wound together with her neat strong fingers see what i do she said to vizard you will have to do it while iah the stool now lay her head on that the other side man now sir compress the wound as i did vigorously hold the cork you till i want it she took out of her pocket some adhesive plaster and flakes of some strong styptic and a piece of elastic now said she to vizard give me a little opening in the middle to plaster these strips across the wound he did so then in a moment she passed the elastic under the sufferers head drew it over with the styptic between her finger and thumb and crack the styptic was tight on the compressed wound she forced in more styptic increasing the pressure then she whipped out a sort of surgical housewife and with some cutting instrument reduced the cork then cut it convex and fastened it on the styptic by another elastic there was no flutter yet it was all done in fifty seconds there said she she will bleed no more to speak of now seat her upright why i have seen her before this issir you can send the men away yes and harris pack up mr severnes things and bring them down here this moment the male servants retired the women held aloof fanny dover came forward pale and trembling and helped to place ina klosking in the hall porters chair she was insensible still but moaned faintly her moans were echoed all eyes turned it was zoe seated apart all bowed and brokenghastly pale and glaring straight before her poor girl said vizard we forgot her it is her heart that bleeds where is the scoundrel that i may kill him and he rushed out at the door to look for him the mans life would not have been worth much if squire vizard could have found him then but he soon came back to his wretched home and eyed the dismal scene and the havoc one man had madethe marble floor all stained with bloodina klosking supported in a chair white and faintly moaningzoe still crushed and glaring at vacancy and fanny sobbing round her with pity and terror for she knew there must be worse to come than this wild stupor take her to her room fanny dear said vizard in a hurried faltering voice and dont leave her rosa help miss dover do not leave her alone night nor day then to miss gale she will live tell me she will live i hope so said rhoda gale oh the blow will not kill her nor yet the loss of blood but i fear there will be distress of mind added to the bodily shock and such a noble face my own heart bleeds for her oh sir do not send her away to strangers let me take her up to the farm it is nursing she will need and tact when she comes to herself send here away to strangers cried vizard never no not even to the farm here she received her wound here all that you and i can do shall be done to save her ah heres harris with the villains things get the ladys boxes out and put mr severnes into the fly give the man two guineas and let him leave them at the swan in taddington he then beckoned down the women and had ina klosking carried upstairs to the very room severne had occupied he then convened the servants and placed them formally under miss gales orders and one female servant having made a remark he turned her out of the house neck and crop directly with her months wages the others had to help her pack only half an hour being allowed for her exit the house seemed all changed could this be vizard court dead gloomhurried whispersand everybody walking softly and scarednone knowing what might be the next calamity vizard felt sick at heart and helpless he had done all he could and was reduced to that condition women bear far better than menhe must wait and hope and fear he walked up and down the carpeted landing racked with anxiety at last there came a single scream of agony from ina kloskings room it made the strong man quake he tapped softly at the door rhoda opened it what is it he faltered she replied gravely only what must be she is beginning to realize what has befallen her dont come here you can do no good i will run down to you whenever i dare give me a nurse to help this first night he went down and sent into the village for a woman who bore a great name for nursing then he wandered about disconsolate the leaden hours passed he went to dress and discovered ina kloskings blood upon his clothes it shocked him first and then it melted him he felt an inexpressible tenderness at sight of it the blood that had flowed in her veins seemed sacred to him he folded that suit and tied it up in a silk handkerchief and locked it away in due course he sat down to dinnerwe are all such creatures of habit there was everything as usual except the familiar faces there was the glittering plate on the polished sideboard the pyramid of flowers surrounded with fruits there were even chairs at the table for the servants did not know he was to be quite alone but he was one delicate dish after another was brought him and sent away untasted soon after dinner rhoda gale came down and told him her patient was in a precarious condition and she feared fever and delirium she begged him to send one servant up to the farm for certain medicaments she had there and another to the chemist at taddington these were dispatched on swift horses and both were back in half an hour byandby fanny dover came down to him with red eyes and brought him zoes love but said she dont ask her to come down she is ashamed to look anybody in the face poor girl why what has she done oh harrington she has made no secret of her affection and now at sight of that woman he has abandoned her tell her i love her more than i ever did and respect her more where is her pride pride she is full of it and it will help herbyandby but she has a bitter time to go through first you dont know how she loves him what love him still after what he has done yes she interprets it this way and that she cannot bear to believe another woman has any real right to separate them separate them the scoundrel knocked her down for loving him still and fled from them both was ever guilt more clear if she doubts that he is a villain tell her from me he is a forger and has given me bills with false names on them the bankers gave me notice today and i was coming home to order him out of the house when this miserable business happened a forger is it possible said fanny but it is no use my telling her that sort of thing if he had committed murder and was true to her she would cling to him she never knew till now how she loved him nor i neither she put him in coventry for telling a lie but she was far more unhappy all the time than he was there is nothing to do but to be kind to her and let her hide her face dont hurry her not i god help her if she has a wish it shall be gratified i am powerless she is young surely time will cure her of a villain now he is detected fanny said she hoped so the truth is zoe had not opened her heart to fanny she clung to her and writhed in her arms but she spoke little and one broken sentence contradicted the other but mental agony like bodily finds its vent not in speech the brains great interpreter but in inarticulate cries and moans and sighs that prove us animals even in the throes of mind zoe was in that cruel stage of suffering so passed that miserable day chapter xxi ina klosking recovered her senses that evening and asked miss gale where she was miss gale told her she was in the house of a friend what friend that said miss gale i will tell you byandby you are in good hands and i am your physician i have heard your voice before said ina but i know not where and it is so dark why is it so dark because too much light is not good for you you have met with an accident what accident madam you fell and hurt your poor forehead see i have bandaged it and now you must let me wet the bandageto keep your brow cool thank you madam said ina in her own sweet but queenly way you are very good to me i wish i could see your face more clearly i know your voice then after a silence during which miss gale eyed her with anxiety she said like one groping her way to the truth ifellandhurtmy foreheadah then it was she uttered the cry that made vizard quake at the door and shook for a moment even rhodas nerves though as a rule they were iron in a situation of this kind it had all come back to ina klosking after that piteous cry she never said a word she did nothing but think and put her hand to her head and soon after midnight she began to talk incoherently the physician could only proceed by physical means she attacked the coming fever at once with the remedies of the day and also with an infusion of monkshood that poison promptly administered did not deceive her she obtained a slight perspiration which was so much gained in the battle in the morning she got the patient shifted into another bed and she slept a little after that but soon she was awake restless and raving still her character pervaded her delirium no violence nothing any sore injured woman need be ashamed to have said only it was all disconnected one moment she was speaking to the leader of the orchestra at another to mr ashmead at another with divine tenderness to her still faithful severne and though not hurried as usual in these cases it was almost incessant and pitiable to hear each observation was so wise and good yet all being disconnected the hearer could not but feel that a noble mind lay before him overthrown and broken into fragments like some attic column in the middle of this the handle was softly turned and zoe vizard came in pale and somber long before this she had said to fanny several times i ought to go and see her and fanny had said of course you ought so now she came she folded her arms and stood at the foot of the bed and looked at her unhappy rival unhappy as possible herself what contrary feelings fought in that young breast pity and hatred she must hate the rival who had come between her and him she loved she must pity the woman who lay there pale wounded and little likely to recover and with all this a great desire to know whether this sufferer had any right to come and seize edward severne by the arm and so draw down calamity on both the women who loved him she looked and listened and rhoda gale thought it hard upon her patient but it was not in human nature the girl should do otherwise so rhoda said nothing what fell from inas lips was not of a kind to make zoe more her friend her mind seemed now like a bird tied by a long silken thread it made large excursions but constantly came back to her love sometimes that love was happy sometimes unhappy often she said edward in the exquisite tone of a loving woman and whenever she did zoe received it with a sort of shiver as if a dagger fine as a needle had passed through her whole body at last after telling some tenor that he had sung f natural instead of f sharp and praised somebodys rendering of a song in il flauto magico and told ashmead to make no more engagements for her at present for she was going to vizard court the poor soul paused a minute and uttered a deep moan struck down by the very hand that was vowed to protect me said she then was silent again then began to cry and sob and wring her hands zoe put her hand to her heart and moved feebly toward the door however she stopped a moment to say i am no use here you would soon have me raving in the next bed i will send fanny then she drew herself up miss gale everybody here is at your command pray spare nothing you can think of to savemy brothers guest there came out the bitter drop when she had said that she stalked from the room like some red indian bearing a mortal arrow in him but too proud to show it but when she got to her own room she flung herself on her sofa and writhed and sobbed in agony fanny dover came in and found her so and flew to her but she ordered her out quite wildly no no go to her like all the rest and leave poor zoe all alone she is alone then fanny clung to her and tried hard to comfort her this young lady now became very zealous and active she divided her time between the two sufferers and was indefatigable in their service when she was not supporting zoe she was always at miss gales elbow offering her services do let me help you she said do pray let me help we are poor at home and there is nothing i cannot do im worth any three servants she always helped shift the patient into a fresh bed and that was done very often she would run to the cook or the butler for anything that was wanted in a hurry she flung gentility and humbug to the winds then she dressed in ten minutes and went and dined with vizard and made excuses for zoes absence to keep everything smooth and finally she insisted on sitting up with ina klosking till three in the morning and made miss gale go to bed in the room paid nurses said she they are no use except to snore and drink the patients wine you and i will watch her every moment of the night and if im ever at a loss what to do i will call you miss gale stared at her once and then accepted this new phase of her character the fever was hot while it lasted but it was so encountered with tonics and port wine and strong beef soup not your rubbishy beef tea that in fortyeight hours it began to abate ina recognized rhoda gale as the lady who had saved severnes life at montpellier and wept long and silently upon her neck in due course zoe hearing there was a great change came in again to look at her she stood and eyed her soon ina klosking caught sight of her and stared at her you here said she ah you are miss vizard i am in your house i will get up and leave it and she made a feeble attempt to rise but fell back and the tears welled out of her eyes at her helplessness zoe was indignant but for the moment more shocked than anything else she moved away a little and did not know what to say let me look at you said the patient ah you are beautiful when i saw you at the theater you fascinated me how much more a man i will resist no more you are too beautiful to be resisted take him and let me die i do her no good said zoe half sullenly half trembling indeed you do not said rhoda bluntly and almost bitterly she was all nurse ill come here no more said zoe sadly but sternly and left the room then ina turned to miss gale and said patiently i hope i was not rude to that ladywho has broken my heart fanny and rhoda took each a hand and told her she could not be rude to anybody my friends said ina looking piteously to each in turn it is her house you know and she is very good to me nowafter breaking my heart then fanny showed a deal of tact her house said she it is no more hers than mine why this house belongs to a gentleman and he is mad after music he knows you very well though you dont know him and he thinks you the first singer in europe you flatter me said ina sadly well he thinks so and he is reckoned a very good judge ah now i think of it i will show you something and then you will believe me she ran off to the library snatched up inas picture set round with pearls and came panting in with it there said she now you look at that and she put it before her eyes now who is that if you please oh it is ina klosking that was please bring me a glass the two ladies looked at each other miss gale made a negative signal and fanny said byandby this will do instead for it is as like as two peas now ask yourself how this comes to be in the house and set in pearls why they are worth three hundred pounds i assure you that the master of this house is fanatico per la musica heard you sing siebel at homburgraved about youwanted to call on you we had to drag him away from the place and he declares you are the first singer in the world and you cannot doubt his sincerity for here are the pearls ina kloskings pale cheek colored and then she opened her two arms wide and put them round fannys neck and kissed her her innocent vanity was gratified and her gracious nature suggested gratitude to her who had brought her the compliment instead of the usual ungrateful bumptiousness praise elicits from vanity then miss gale put in her wordwhen you met with this unfortunate accident i was for taking you up to my house it is three miles off but he would not hear of it he said no here she got her wound and here she must be cured so said fanny pray set your mind at ease my cousin harrington is a very good soul but rather arbitrary if you want to leave this place you must get thoroughly well and strong for he will never let you go till you are between these two ladies clever and cooperating ina smiled and seemed relieved but she was too weak to converse any more just then some hours afterward she beckoned fanny to her and said the master of the housewhat is his name harrington vizard whather father la no only her halfbrother if he is so kind to me because i sing why comes he not to see me she has come fanny smiled it is plain you are not an englishwoman though you speak it so beautifully an english gentleman does not intrude into a ladys room it is his room he would say that while you occupy it it is yours and not his he awaits my invitation then i dare say he would come if you were to invite him but certainly not without i wish to see him who has been so kind to me and so loves music but not todayi feel unable the next day she asked for a glass and was distressed at her appearance she begged for a cap what kind of a cap asked fanny one like that said she pointing to a portrait on the wall it was of a lady in a plain brown silk dress and a little white shawl and a neat cap with a narrow lace border all round her face this particular cap was out of date full sixty years but the house had a storeroom of relics and fanny with vizards help soon rummaged out a cap of the sort with a narrow frill all round her hair was smoothed a white silk band passed over the now closed wound and the cap fitted on her she looked pale but angelic fanny went down to vizard and invited him to come and see mademoiselle kloskingby her desire but she added miss gale is very anxious lest you should get talking of severne she says the fever and loss of blood have weakened her terribly and if we bring the fever on again she cannot answer for her life has she spoken of him to you not once then why should she to me because you are a man and she may think to get the truth out of you she knows we shall only say what is for the best she is very deep and we dont know her mind yet vizard said he would be as guarded as he could but if they saw him going wrong they must send him away oh miss gale will do that you may be sure said fanny thus prepared vizard followed fanny up the stairs to the sickroom either there is such a thing as love at first sight or it is something more than first sight when an observant man gazes at a woman for an hour in a blaze of light and drinks in her looks her walk her voice and all the outward signs of a beautiful soul for the stout cynics heart beat at entering that room as it had not beat for years to be sure he had not only seen her on the stage in all her glory but had held her pale and bleeding to his manly breast and his heart warmed to her all the more and indeed fairly melted with tenderness fanny went in and announced him he followed softly and looked at her wealth can make even a sickroom pretty the klosking lay on snowy pillows whose glossy damask was edged with lace and upon her form was an eiderdown quilt covered with violetcolored satin and her face was set in that sweet cap which hid her wound and made her eloquent face less ghastly she turned to look at him and he gazed at her in a way that spoke volumes a seat said she softly fanny was for putting one close to her no said miss gale lower down then she need not to turn her head so he sat down nearer her feet my good host said she in her mellow voice that retained its quality but not its power i desire to thank you for your goodness to a poor singer struck downby the hand that was bound to protect her vizard faltered out that there was nothing to thank him for he was proud to have her under his roof though deeply grieved at the cause she looked at him and her two nurses looked at her and at each other as much as to say she is going upon dangerous ground they were right but she had not the courage or perhaps as most women are a little catlike in this that they go away once or twice from the subject nearest their heart before they turn and pounce on it she must speak of other things first said she but if i was unfortunate in that i was fortunate in this that i fell into good hands these ladies are sisters to me and she gave miss gale her hand and kissed the other hand to fanny though she could scarcely lift it and i have a host who loves music and overrates my poor ability then after a pause what have you heard me sing siebel only siebel why that is a poor little thing so i thought till i heard you sing it and after siebel you bought my photograph instantly and wasted pearls on it no madam i wasted it on pearls if i were well i should call that extravagant but it is permitted to flatter the sickit is kind me you overrate i fear but you do well to honor music ay i who lie here wounded and brokenhearted do thank god for music our bodies are soon crushed our loves decay or turn to hate but art is immortal she could no longer roll this out in her grand contralto but she could still raise her eyes with enthusiasm and her pale face was illuminated a grand soul shone through her though she was pale weak and prostrate they admired her in silence after a while she resumed and said if i live i must live for my art alone miss gale saw her approaching a dangerous topic so she said hastily dont say if you live please because that is arranged you have been out of danger this twentyfour hours provided you do not relapse and i must take care of that my kind friend said ina i shall not relapse only my weakness is pitiable sometimes i can scarcely forbear crying i feel so weak when shall i be stronger you shall be a little stronger every three days there are always ups and downs in convalescence when shall i be strong enough to move let me answer that question said vizard when you are strong enough to sing us siebels great song there said fanny dover there is a mercenary host for you he means to have a song out of you till then you are his prisoner no no she is mine said miss gale and she shant go till she has sung me hail columbia none of your italian trash for me ina smiled and said it was a fair condition provided that hail columbia with which composition unfortunately she was unacquainted was not beyond her powers i have often sung for money said she but this timehere she opened her grand arms and took rhoda gale to her bosomi shall sing for love now we have settled that said vizard my mind is more at ease and i will retire one moment said ina turning to him then in a low and very meaning voice there is something else no doubt there is plenty said miss gale sharply and by my authority i postpone it all till you are stronger bid us goodby for the present mr vizard i obey said he but madam please remember i am always at your service send for me when you please and the oftener the better for me thank you my kind host oblige me with your hand he gave her his hand she took it and put her lips to it with pure and gentle and seemly gratitude and with no loss of dignity though the act was humble he turned his head away to hide the emotion that act and the touch of her sweet lips caused him miss gale hurried him out of the room you naughty patient said she you must do nothing to excite yourself sweet physician loving nurse i am not excited miss gale felt her heart to see gratitude does not excite said ina it is too tame a feeling in the best of us that is a fact said miss gale so let us all be grateful and avoid exciting topics think what i should feel if you had a relapse why you would break my heart should i i really think you would tough as it is one gets so fond of an unselfish patient you cannot think how rare they are dear you are a pearl i cannot afford to lose you then you shall not said ina firmly know that i who seem so weak am a woman of great resolution i will follow good counsel i will postpone all dangerous topics till i am stronger i will live for i will not grieve the true friends calamity has raised me of course fanny told zoe all about this interview she listened gloomily and all she said was sisters do not go for much when a man is in love do brothers when a woman is said fanny i dare say they go for as much as they are worth zoe that is not fair harrington is full of affection for you but you will not go near him any other man would be very angry do pray make an effort and come down to dinner today no no he has you and his klosking and i have my broken heart i am alone and so will be all alone she cried and sobbed but she was obstinate and fanny could only let her have her own way in that another question was soon disposed of when fanny invited her into the sickroom she said haughtily i go there no more cure her and send her awayif harrington will let her go i dare say she is to be pitied of course she is she is your fellowvictim if you would only let yourself see it unfortunately instead of pitying her i hate her she has destroyed my happiness and done herself no good he does not love her and never will fanny found herself getting angry so she said no more for she was determined nothing should make her quarrel with poor zoe but after dinner being teteatete with vizard she told him she was afraid zoe could not see things as they were and she asked him if he had any idea what had become of severne fled the country i suppose are you sure he is not lurking about what for to get a word with zoealone he will not come near this i will break every bone in his skin if he does but he is so sly he might hang about what for she never goes out and if she did have you so poor an opinion of her as to think she would speak to him oh no and she would forbid him to speak to her but he would be sure to persist and he has such wonderful powers of explanation and she is blinded by love i think he would make her believe black was white if he had a chance and if he is about he will get a chance some day she is doing the very worst thing she couldshutting herself up so any moment she will turn wild and rush out reckless she is in a dangerous state you mark my words she is brokenhearted and yet she is bitter against everybody except that young villain and he is the only enemy she has in the world i dont believe mademoiselle klosking ever wronged her nor ever will appearances are against her but she is a good woman or i am a fool take my advice harrington and be on your guard if he had written a penitent letter to mademoiselle klosking that would be a different thing but he ignores her and that frightens me for zoe harrington would not admit that zoe needed any other safeguard against a detected scoundrel than her own sense of dignity he consented however to take precautions if fanny would solemnly promise not to tell zoe and so wound her on that condition he would see his headkeeper tomorrow and all the keepers and watchers should be posted so as to encircle the parish with vigilance he assured fanny these fellows had a whole system of signals to the ear and eye and severne could not get within a mile of the house undetected but said he i will not trust to that alone i will send an advertisement to the local papers and the leading london journals so worded that the scoundrel shall know his forgery is detected and that he will be arrested on a magistrates warrant if he sets foot in barfordshire fanny said that was capital and altogether he had set her mind at rest then do as much for me said vizard please explain a remarkable phenomenon you were always a bright girl and no fool but not exactly what humdrum people would call a good girl you are not offended the idea why i have publicly disowned goodness again and again you have heard me so i have but was not that rather deceitful of you for you have turned out as good as gold anxiety has kept me at home of late and i have watched you you live for others you are all over the house to serve two suffering women that is real charity not sexual charity which humbugs the world but not me you are cook housemaid butler nurse and friend to both of them in an interval of your time so creditably employed you come and cheer me up with your bright little face and give me wise advice i know that women are all humbugs only you are a humbug reversed and deserve a statueand trimmings you have been passing yourself off for a naughty girl and all the time you were an extra good one and that puzzles the womanhater the cynical student who says he has fathomed woman my poor dear harrington if you cannot read so shallow a character as i am how will you get on with those ladies upstairszoe who is as deep as the sea and turbid with passion and the klosking who is as deep as the ocean she thought a moment and said there i will have pity on you you shall understand one woman before you die and that is me ill give you the clew to my seeming inconsistenciesif you will give me a cigarette what another hidden virtue you smoke not i except when i happen to be with a noble soul who wont tell vizard found her a russian cigarette and lighted his own cigar and she lectured as follows what women love and cant do without if they are young and healthy and spirited isexcitement i am one who pines for it now society is so constructed that to get excitement you must be naughty waltzing all night and flirting all day are excitement crochet and church and examining girls in st matthew and dining en famille and going to bed at ten are stagnation good girlsthat means stagnant girls i hate and despise the tame little wretches and i never was one and never will be but now look here we have two ladies in love with one villainthat is exciting one gets nearly killed in the housethat is gloriously exciting the other is brokenhearted if i were to be a bad girl and say it is not my business i will leave them to themselves and go my little millround of selfishness as before why what a fool i must be i should lose excitement instead of that i run and get thinks for the kloskingexcitement i cook for her and nurse her and sit up half the nightexcitement then i run to zoe and do my best for herand get snubbedexcitement then i sit at the head of your table and order youexcitement oh it is lovely shall you not be sorry when they both get well and routine recommences of course i shall that is the sort of good girl i am and oh when that fatal day comes how i shall flirt heaven help my next flirtee i shall soon flirt out the stigma of a good girl you mark my words i shall flirt with some married man after this i never did that yet but i shall i know i shallahthere i have burned my finger never mind that is exciting as such i accept it goodby i must go and relieve miss gale exit the good girl on her mission of charityha ha she hummed a valse a deux temps and went dancing out with such a whirl that her petticoats which were ample and not as now like a sack tied at the knees made quite a cool air in the room she had not been gone long when miss gale came down full of her patient she wanted to get her out of bed during the daytime but said she was not strong enough to sit up would he order an invalid couch down from london she described the article and where it was to be had he said harris should go up in the morning and bring one down with him he then put her several questions about her patient and at last asked her with an anxiety he in vain endeavored to conceal what she thought was the relation between her and severne now it may be remembered that miss gale had once been on the point of telling him all she knew and had written him a letter but at that time the klosking was not expected to appear on the scene in person were she now to say she had seen her and severne living together rhoda felt that she should lower her patient she had not the heart to do that rhoda gale was not of an amorous temperament and she was all the more open to female attachments with a little encouragement she would have loved zoe but she had now transferred her affection to the klosking she replied to vizard almost like a male lover defending the object of his affection the exact relation is more than i can tell but i think he has lived upon her for she was richer than he was and i feel sure he has promised her marriage and my great fear now is lest he should get hold of her and keep his promise he is as poor as a rat or a female physician and she has a fortune in her voice and has money besides miss dover tells me pray keep her here till she is quite well please i will and then let me have her up at hillstoke she is beginning to love me and i dote on her so do i ah but you must not why not because well why not she is not to love any man again who will not marry her i wont let her ill kill her first i love her so a rogue she shant marry and i cant let you marry her because her connection with that severne is mysterious she seems the soul of virtue but i could not let you marry her until things are clearer make your mind easy i will not marry hernor anybody elsetill things are a great deal clearer than i have ever found them where your sex is concerned miss gale approved the resolution next day vizard posted his keepers and sent his advertisements to the london and country journals fanny came into his study to tell him there was more troublemiss maitland taken seriously ill and had written to zoe poor old soul said vizard i have a great mind to ride over and see her somebody ought to go said fanny well you go how can iwith zoe and mademoiselle klosking and you to look after instead of one old woman not much excitement in that no cousin to think of your remembering why you must have gone to bed sober i often do you were always an eccentric landowner dont you talk you are a caricature this banter was interrupted by miss gale who came to tell harrington mademoiselle klosking desired to see him at his leisure he said he would come directly before you go said miss gale let us come to an understanding she had only two days fever but that fever and the loss of blood and the shock to her nerves brought her to deaths door by exhaustion now she is slowly recovering her strength because she has a healthy stomach and i give her no stimulants to spur and then weaken her but choice and simple esculents the effect of which i watch and vary them accordingly but the convalescent period is always one of danger especially from chills to the body and excitements to the brain at no period are more patients thrown away for want of vigilance now i can guard against chills and other bodily things but not against excitementsunless you cooperate the fact is we must agree to avoid speaking about mr severne we must be on our guard we must parry we must evade we must be deaf stupid slippery but no severnefor five or six days more at all events thus forewarned vizard in due course paid his second visit to ina klosking he found her propped up with pillows this time she begged him to be seated she had evidently something on her mind and her nurses watched her like cats you are fond of music sir not of all music i adore good music i hate bad and i despise mediocre silence is golden indeed compared with poor music you are right sir have you good music in the house a little i get all the operas and you know there are generally one or two good things in an operaamong the rubbish but the great bulk of our collection is rather oldfashioned it is sacred musicoratorios masses anthems services chants my mother was the collector her tastes were good but narrow do you care for that sort of music sacred music why it is of all music the most divine and soothes the troubled soul can i not see the books i read music like words by reading i almost hear we will bring you up a dozen books to begin on he went down directly and such was his pleasure in doing anything for the klosking that he executed the order in person brought up a little pile of folios and quartos beautifully bound and lettered a lady having been the collector now as he mounted the stairs with his very chin upon the pile who should he see looking over the rails at him but his sister zoe she was sadly changed there was a fixed ashen pallor on her cheek and a dark circle under her eyes he stopped to look at her my poor child said he you look very ill i am very ill dear would you not be better for a change i might why coop yourself up in your own room why deny yourself a brothers sympathy the girl trembled and tears came to her eyes is it with me you sympathize said she can you doubt it zoe zoe hung her head a moment and did not reply then she made a diversion what are those books oh i seeyour mothers musicbooks nothing is too good for her nothing in the way of musicbooks is too good for her for shame are you jealous of that unfortunate lady zoe made no reply she put her hands before her face that vizard might not see her mind then he rested his books on a table and came and took her head in his hands paternally do not shut yourself up any longer solitude is dangerous to the afflicted be more with me than ever and let this cruel blow bind us more closely instead of disuniting us he kissed her lovingly and his kind words set her tears flowing but they did her little goodthey were bitter tears between her and her brother there was now a barrier sisterly love could not pass he hated and despised edward severne and she only distrusted him and feared he was a villain she loved him still with every fiber of her heart and pined for his explanation of all that seemed so dark so then he entered the sickroom with his musicbooks and zoe after watching him in without seeming to do so crept away to her own room then there was rather a pretty little scene miss gale and miss dover on each side of the bed held a heavy musicbook and mademoiselle klosking turned the leaves and read when the composition was worth reading if it was not she quietly passed it over without any injurious comment vizard watched her from the foot of the bed and could tell in a moment by her face whether the composition was good bad or indifferent when bad her face seemed to turn impassive like marble when good to expand and when she lighted on a masterpiece she was almost transfigured and her face shone with elevated joy this was a study to the enamored vizard and it did not escape the quicksighted doctress she despised music on its own merits but she despised nothing that could be pressed into the service of medicine and she said to herself ill cure her with esculents and music the book was taken away to make room for another then said ina klosking mr vizard i desire to say a word to you excuse me my dear friends miss gale colored up she had not foreseen a teteatete between vizard and her patient however there was no help for it and she withdrew to a little distance with fanny but she said to vizard openly and expressively remember when they had withdrawn a little way ina klosking fixed her eyes on vizard and said in a low voice your sister vizard started a little at the suddenness of this but he said nothing he did not know what to say when she had waited a little and he said nothing she spoke again tell me something about her is she good forgive me it is not that i doubt she is good according to her lights is she proud yes is she just no and i never met a woman that was indeed it is rare why does she not visit me i dont know she blames me for all that has happened i dont know madam my sister looks very ill and keeps her own room if she does not visit you she holds equally aloof from us all she has not taken a single meal with me for some days since i was your patient and your guest pray do not conclude from thatwho can interpret a woman another woman enigmas to you we are transparent to each other sir will you grant me a favor will you persuade miss vizard to see me here aloneall alone it will be a greater trial to me than to her for i am weak in this request i am not selfish she can do nothing for me but i can do a little for her to pay the debt of gratitude i owe this hospitable house may heaven bless it from the roof to the foundation stone i will speak to my sister and she shall visit youwith the consent of your physician it is well said ina klosking and beckoned her friends one of whom miss gale proceeded to feel her pulse with suspicious glances at vizard but she found the pulse calm and said so vizard took his leave and went straight to zoes room she was not there he was glad of that for it gave him hopes she was going to respect his advice and give up her solitary life he went downstairs and on to the lawn to look for her he could not see her anywhere at last when he had given up looking for her he found her in his study crouched in a corner she rose at sight of him and stood before him harrington said she in rather a commanding way aunt maitland is ill and i wish to go to her harrington stared at her with surprise you are not well enough yourself quite well enough in body to go anywhere well but said harrington she caught him up impatiently surely you cannot object to my visiting aunt maitland she is dangerously ill i had a second letter this morningsee and she held him out a letter harrington was in a difficulty he felt sure this was not her real motive but he did not like to say so harshly to an unhappy girl he took a moderate course not just now dear said he what am i to wait till she dies cried zoe getting agitated at his opposition be reasonable dear you know you are the mistress of this house do not desert me just now consider the position it is a very chattering county i entertain mademoiselle klosking i could not do otherwise when she was nearly killed in my hall but for my sister to go away while she remains here would have a bad effect it is too late to think of that harrington the mischief is done and you must plead your eccentricity why should i bear the blame i never approved it you would have sent her to an inn eh no but miss gale offered to take her then i am to understand that you propose to mark your reprobation of my conduct by leaving my house what publicly oh no you may say to yourself that your sister could not bear to stay under the same roof with mr severnes mistress but this chattering county shall never know my mind my aunt is dangerously ill she lives but thirty miles off she is a fit object of pity she is arespectablelady she is all alone no female physician no flirt turned sister of charity no womanhater to fetch and carry for her and so i shall go to her i am your sister not your slave if you grudge me your horses i will go on foot vizard was white with wrath but governed himself like a man go on young lady said he go on jeer and taunt and wound the best brother any young madwoman ever had but dont think ill answer you as you deserve im too cunning if i was to say an unkind word to you i should suffer the tortures of the damned so go on no no forgive me harrington it is your opposition that drives me wild oh have pity on me i shall go mad if i stay here do pray pray pray let me go to aunt maitland you shall go zoe but i tell you plainly this step will be a blow to our affectionthe first zoe cried at that but as she did not withdraw her request harrington told her with cold civility that she must be good enough to be ready directly after breakfast tomorrow and take as little luggage as she could with convenience to herself horses were sent on that night to the fox an inn halfway between vizard court and miss maitlands place in the morning a light barouche with a sling for luggage came round and zoe was soon seated in it then to her surprise harrington came out and sat beside her she was pleased at this and said what are you going with me dear all that way yes to save appearances said he and took out a newspaper to read this froze zoe and she retired within herself it was a fine fresh morning the coachman drove fast the air fanned her cheek the motion was enlivening the horsess hoofs rang quick and clear upon the road fresh objects met the eye every moment her heart was as sad and aching as before but there arose a faint encouraging sense that some day she might be better or things might take some turn when they had rolled about ten miles she said in a low voice harrington well you were right cooping ones self up is the way to go mad of course it is i feel a little better nowa very little i am glad of it but he was not hearty and she said no more he was extremely attentive to her all the journey and indeed had never been half so polite to her this however led to a result he did not intend nor anticipate zoe being now cool fell into a state of compunction and dismay she saw his affection leaving her for her and stiff politeness coming instead she leaned forward put her hands on his knees and looked all scared in his face harrington she cried i was wrong what is aunt maitland to me you are my all bid him turn the horses heads and go home why we are only six miles from the place what does that matter we shall have had a good long drive together and i will dine with you after it and i will ride or drive with you every day if you will let me vizard could not help smiling he was disarmed you impulsive young monkey said he i shall do nothing of the kind in the first place i couldnt turn back from anything im only a man in the next place i have been thinking it over as you have and this is a good move of ours though i was a little mortified at first occupation is the best cure of love and this old lady will find you plenty besides nursing improves the character look at that frivolous girl fanny how she has come out and you know zoe if you get sick of it in a day or two you have only to write to me and i will send for you directly a short absence with so reasonable a motive as visiting a sick aunt will provoke no comments it is all for the best this set zoe at her ease and brother and sister resumed their usual manners they reached miss maitlands house and were admitted to her sickroom she was really very ill and thanked them so pathetically for coming to visit a poor lone old woman that now they were both glad they had come zoe entered on her functions with an alacrity that surprised herself and vizard drove away but he did not drive straight home he had started from vizard court with other views he had telegraphed lord uxmoor the night before and now drove to his place which was only five miles distant he found him at home and soon told him his errand do you remember meeting a young fellow at my house called severne i do said lord uxmoor dryly enough well he has turned out an impostor uxmoors eye flashed he had always suspected severne of being his rival and a main cause of his defeat an impostor said he that is rather a strong word certainly i never heard a gentleman tell such a falsehood as he volunteered aboutwhats the fellows namea detective oh poikilus that is nothing that was one of his white lies he is a villain all round and a forger by way of climax a forger what a criminal rather here are his drafts the drawer and acceptor do not exist the whole thing was written by edward severne whose indorsement figures on the bill he got me to cash these bills i deposit them with you and i ask you for a warrant to commit himif he should come this way is that likely not at all it is a hundred to one he never shows his nose again in barfordshire when he was found out he bolted and left his very clothes in my house i packed them off to the swan at taddington he has never been heard of since and i have warned him by advertisement that he will be arrested if ever he sets foot in barfordshire well then well then i am not going to throw away a chance the beggar had the impudence to spoon on my sister zoe that was my fault not hers he was an old college acquaintance and i gave him opportunitiesi deserve to be horsewhipped however i am not going to commit the same blunder twice my sister is in your neighborhood for a few days ah and perhaps you will be good enough to keep your eye on her i feel much honored by such a commission but you have not told me where miss vizard is with her aunt miss maitland at somerville villa near bagley apropos i had better tell you what she is there for or your good dowager will be asking her to parties she has come to nurse her aunt maitland the old lady is seriously ill and all our young coquettes are going in for nursing we have a sick lady at our house i am sorry to say and she is nursed like a queen by doctress gale and ex flirt fanny dover now is fulfilled the saying that was said o woman in our hours of ease i spare you the rest and simply remark that our zoe fired by the example of those two ladies has devoted herself to nursing aunt maitland it is very good of her but experience tells me she will very soon find it extremely trying and as she is a very pretty girl and therefore a fit subject of male charity you might pay her a visit now and then and show her that this best of all possible worlds contains young gentlemen of distinction with long and glossy beards as well as peevish old women who are extra selfish and tyrannical when they happen to be sick uxmoor positively radiated as this programme was unfolded to him vizard observed that and chuckled inwardly he then handed him the forged acceptances lord uxmoor begged him to write down the facts on paper and also his application for the warrant he did so lord uxmoor locked the paper up and the friends parted vizard drove off easy in his mind and congratulating himself not unreasonably on his little combination by means of which he had provided his sister with a watchdog a companion and an honorable lover all in one uxmoor put on his hat and strode forth into his own grounds with his heart beating high at this strange turn of things in favor of his love neither foresaw the strange combinations which were to arise out of an event that appeared so simple and onesided chapter xxii ina kloskings cure was retarded by the state of her mind the excitement and sharp agony her physician had feared died away as the fever of the brain subsided but then there settled down a grim listless lethargy which obstructed her return to health and vigor once she said to rhoda gale but i have nothing to get well for as a rule she did not speak her mind but thought a great deal she often asked after zoe and her nurses could see that her one languid anxiety was somehow connected with that lady yet she did not seem hostile to her now nor jealous it was hard to understand her she was reserved and very deep the first relief to the deadly languor of her mind came to her from music that was no great wonder but strange to say the music that did her good was neither old enough to be revered nor new enough to be fashionable it was english music too and passe music she came across a collection of anglican anthems and serviceswritten most of it toward the end of the last century and the beginning of this the composers names promised little they were blow nares green kent king jackson etc the words and the music of these compositions seemed to suit one another and as they were all quite new to her she went through them almost eagerly and hummed several of the strains and with her white but now thin hand beat time to others she even sent for vizard and said to him you have a treasure here do you know these compositions he inspected his treasure i remember said he my mother used to sing this one when the eye saw her then it blessed her and parts of this one hear my prayer and let me see she used to sing this psalm praise the lord by jackson i am ashamed to say i used to ask for praise the lord jackson meaning to be funny not devout she did not choose ill said ina i thought i knew english music yet here is a whole stream of it new to me is it esteemed i think it was once but it has had its day that is strange for here are some immortal qualities these composers had brains and began at the right end they selected grand and tuneful words great and pious thoughts they impregnated themselves with those words and produced appropriate music the harmonies are sometimes thin and the writers seem scarcely to know the skillful use of discords but they had heart and invention they saw their way clear before they wrote the first note there is an inspired simplicity and fervor if all these choice things are dead they must have fallen upon bad interpreters no doubt said vizard so please get well and let me hear these pious strains which my poor dear mother loved so well interpreted worthily the kloskings eyes filled that is a temptation said she simply then she turned to rhoda gale sweet physician he has done me good he has given me something to get well for vizards heart yearned do not talk like that said he buoyantly then in a broken voice heaven forbid you should have nothing better to live for than that sir said she gravely i have nothing better to live for now than to interpret good music worthily there was a painful silence ina broke it she said quite calmly first of all i wish to know how others interpret these strains your mother loved and i have the honor to agree with her oh said vizard we will soon manage that for you these things are not defunct only unfashionable every choir in england has sung them and can sing them after a fashion so at twelve oclock tomorrow look outfor squalls he mounted his horse rode into the cathedral towndistant eight milesand arranged with the organist for himself four leading boys and three lay clerks he was to send a carriage in for them after the morning service and return them in good time for vespers fanny told ina klosking and she insisted on getting up by this time doctress gale had satisfied herself that a little excitement was downright good for her patient and led to refreshing sleep so they dressed her loosely but very warmly and rolled her to the window on her invalid couch set at a high angle it was a fine clear day in october keen but genial and after muffling her well they opened the window while she sat there propped high and inhaling the pure air vizard conveyed his little choir by another staircase into the antechamber and under his advice they avoided preludes and opened in full chorus with jacksons song of praise at the first burst of sacred harmony ina klosking was observed to quiver all over they sung it rather coarsely but correctly and boldly and with a certain fervor there were no operatic artifices to remind her of earth the purity and the harmony struck her full the great singer and sufferer lifted her clasped hands to god and the tears flowed fast down her cheeks these tears were balm to that poor lacerated soul tormented by many blows o lacrymarum fons tenero sacros ducemtium ortus ex animo quater felix in imo qui scatentem pectore te pia nympha sensit rhoda gale who hated music like poison crept up to her and infolding her delicately laid a pair of wet eyes softly on her shoulder vizard now tapped at the door and was admitted from the musicroom he begged ina to choose another composition from her book she marked a service and two anthems and handed him the volume but begged they might not be done too soon one after the other that would be quite enough for one day especially if they would be good enough to repeat the hymn of praise to conclude for said she these are things to be digested soon the boys pure voices rose again and those poor dead english composers with prosaic names found their way again to the great foreign singers soul they sung an anthem which is now especially despised by those great critics the organists of the countrymy song shall be of mercy and judgment the klosking forgave the thinness of the harmony and many little faults in the vocal execution the words no doubt went far with her being clearly spoken she sat meditating with her moist eyes raised and her face transfigured and at the end she murmured to vizard with her eyes still raised after all they are great and pious words and the music has at least this crowning virtueit means the words then she suddenly turned upon him and said there is another person in this house who needs this consolation as much as i do why does she not come but perhaps she is with the musicians whom do you mean your sister why she is not in the house ina klosking started at that information and bent her eyes keenly and inquiringly on him she left two days ago indeed to nurse a sick aunt indeed had she no other reason not that i know of said vizard but he could not help coloring a little the little choir now sung a service king in f they sung the magnificat rudely and rather profanely but recovered themselves in the dimittis when it was over ina whispered to be a light to lighten the gentiles that is an inspired duet oh how it might be sung of course it might whispered vizard so you have something to get well for yes my friendthanks to you and your sainted mother this uttered in a voice which under the healing influence of music seemed to have regained some of its rich melody was too much for our cynic and he bustled off to hide his emotion and invited the musicians to lunch all the servants had been listening on the stairs and the hospitable old butler plied the boys with sparkling moselle which being himself reared on mighty port he thought a light and playful winejust the thing for women and children so after luncheon they sung rather wild and the klosking told vizard dryly that would do for the present then he ordered the carriage for them and asked mademoiselle klosking when she would like them again when can i she inquired rather timidly every day if you likesundays and all i must be content with every other day vizard said he would arrange it so and was leaving her but she begged him to stay a moment she would be safer here said she very gravely vizard was taken aback by the suddenness of this return to a topic he was simple enough to think she had abandoned however he said she is safe enough i have taken care of that you may be sure you have done well sir said ina very gravely she said no more to him but just before dinner fanny came in and miss gale went for a walk in the garden ina pinned fanny directly where is miss vizard said she quietly fanny colored up but seeing in a moment that fibs would be dangerous said mighty carelessly she is at aunt maitlands where does she live dear in a poky little place called somerville villa far from this not very it is forty miles by the railway but not thirty by the road and zoe went in the barouche all the way mademoiselle klosking thought a little and then taking fanny dovers hand said to her very sweetly i beg you to honor me with your confidence and tell me something believe me it is for no selfish motive i ask you but i think miss vizard is in danger she is too far from her brother and too far from me mr vizard says she is safe now can you tell me what he means how can she be safe is her heart turned to stone like mine no indeed said fanny yes i will be frank with you for i believe you are wiser than any one of us zoe is not safe left to herself her heart is anything but stone and heaven knows what wild mad thing she might be led into but i know perfectly well what vizard means no i dont like to tell it you all it will give you pain there is little hope of that i am past pain well thenmiss gale will scold me no she shall not oh i know you have got the upper hand even of her so if you promise i shall not be scolded ill tell you you see i had my misgivings about this very thing and as soon as vizard came homeit was he who took her to aunt maitlandi asked him what precautions he had taken to hinder that man from getting hold of her again well thenoh i ought to have begun by telling you mr severne forged bills to get money out of harrington good heavens oh harrington will never punish him if he keeps his distance but he has advertised in all the papers warning him that if he sets foot in barfordshire he will be arrested and sent to prison ina klosking shook her head when a man is in love with such a woman as that dangers could hardly deter him that depends upon the man i think but harrington has done better than that he has provided her with a watchdogthe best of all watchdogsanother lover lord uxmoor lives near aunt maitland and he adores zoe so harrington has commissioned him to watch her and cure her and all i wish hed cure mean earls coronet and twenty thousand a year you relieve my mind said ina then after a pausebut let me ask you one question more why did you not tell me miss vizard was gone i dont know said fanny coloring up she told me not who why the vixen in command she orders everybody and why did she forbid you dont know yes you do kiss me dear there i will distress you with no more questions why should i our instincts seldom deceive us well so be it i have something more to get well for and i will fanny looked up at her inquiringly yes said she the daughter of this hospitable house will never return to it while i am in it poor girl she thinks she is the injured woman so be it i will get welland leave it fanny communicated this to miss gale and all she said was she shall go no further than hillstoke then for i love her better than any man can love her fanny did not tell vizard and he was downright happy seeing the woman he loved recover by slow degrees her health her strength her color her voice parting was not threatened he did not realize that they should ever part at all he had vague hopes that while she was under his roof opportunity might stand his friend and she might requite his affection all this would not bear looking into very closely for that very reason he took particular care not to look into it very closely but hoped all things and was happy in this condition he received a little shock a onehorse fly was driven up to the door and a card brought in mr joseph ashmead vizard was always at home at vizard court except to convicted bores mr ashmead was shown into his study vizard knew him at a glance the velveteen coat had yielded to tweed but another loud tie had succeeded to the one that fired the air at homburg there too was the washleather face and other traits vizard professed to know an actresss lover by yes it was the very man at sight of whom he had fought down his admiration of la klosking and declined an introduction to her vizard knew the lady better now but still he was a little jealous even of her acquaintances and thought this one unworthy of her so he received him with stiff but guarded politeness leaving him to open his business ashmead overawed by the avenue the dozen gables fourscore chimneys etc addressed him rather obsequiously but with a certain honest trouble that soon softened the bad impression caused by his appearance sir said he pray excuse this intrusion of a stranger but i am in great anxiety it is not for myself but for a lady a very distinguished lady whose interests i am charged with it is mademoiselle klosking the famous singer vizard maintained a grim silence you may have heard of her i have i almost fancy you once heard her singat homburg i did then i am sure you must have admired her being a gentleman of taste well sir it is near a fortnight since i heard from her well sir you will say what is that to you but the truth is she left me in london to do certain business for her and she went down to this very place i offered to come with her but she declined to be sure it was a delicate matter and not at all in my way she was to write to me and report progress and give me her address that i might write to her but nearly a fortnight has passed i have not received a single letter i am in real distress and anxiety a great career awaits her in england sir but this silence is so mysterious so alarming that i begin actually to hope she has played the fool and thrown it all up and gone abroad with that blackguard what blackguard sir joseph drew in his horns i spoke too quick sir said he it is no business of mine but these brilliant women are as mad as the rest in throwing away their affections they prefer a blackguard to a good man it is the rule excuse my plain speaking mr ashmead said vizard i may be able to answer your questions about this lady but before i do so it is right i should know how far you possess her confidence to speak plainly have you any objection to tell me what is the precise relation between you and her certainly not sir i am her theatrical agent is that all not quite i have been a good deal about her lately and have seen her in deep distress i think i may almost say i am her friend though a very humble one vizard did not yet quite realize the truth that this bohemian had in his heart one holy spothis pure devotion and unsexual friendship for that great artist still his prejudices were disarmed and he said well mr ashmead excuse my crossquestioning you i will now give myself the pleasure of setting your anxieties at rest mademoiselle klosking is in this house ashmead stared at him and then broke out in this house o lord how can that be it happened in a way very distressing to us all though the result is now so delightful mademoiselle klosking called here on a business with which perhaps you are acquainted i am sir unfortunately she met with an accident in my very hall an accident that endangered her life sir and of course we took charge of her she has had a zealous physician and good nurses and she is recovering slowly she is quite out of danger but still weak i have no doubt she will be delighted to see you only as we are all under the orders of her physician and that physician is a woman and a bit of a vixen you must allow me to go and consult her first vizard retired leaving joseph happy but mystified he was not long alone in less than a minute he had for companions some wellbuttered sandwiches made with smoked ham and a bottle of old madeira the solids melted in his mouth the liquid ran through his veins like oil charged with electricity and elixir vitoe byandby a female servant came for him and ushered him into ina kloskings room she received him with undisguised affection and he had much ado to keep from crying she made him sit down near her in the vast embrasure of the window and gave him a letter to read she had just written to him they compared notes very rapidly but their discourse will not be given here because so much of it would be repetition they were left alone to talk and they did talk for more than an hour the first interruption indeed was a recitativo with chords followed by a verse from the leading treble mr ashmead looked puzzled the klosking eyed him demurely before the anthem concluded vizard tapped and was admitted from the musicroom ina smiled and waved him to a chair both the men saw by her manner they were not to utter a sound while the music was going on when it ceased she said do you approve that my friend if it pleases you madam replied the wary ashmead it does more than please me it does me good that reconciles me to it at once oh then you do not admire it for itself notverymuch pray speak plainly i am not a tyrant to impose my tastes well then madam i feel very grateful to anything that does you good otherwise i should say the music wasrather dreary and the singingvery insipid the open struggle between josephs honesty and his awe of the klosking tickled vizard so that he leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily the klosking smiled superior he means said she that the music is not operatic and the boys do not clasp their hands and shake their shoulders and sing passionately as women do in a theater heaven forbid they should if this world is all passion there is another which is all peace and these boys sweet artless tones are the nearest thing we shall get in this world to the unimpassioned voices of the angels they are fit instruments for pious words set by composers who however obscure they may be were men inspired and have written immortal strains which as i hear them seem hardly of this worldthey are so free from all mortal dross vizard assented warmly ashmead asked permission to hear another they sung the magnificat by king in f upon my word said ashmead there is a deal of go in that then they sung the nuno dimittis he said a little dryly there was plenty of repose in that my friend said she there isto the honor of the composer the magnificat is the bright and lofty exultation of a young woman who has borne the messiah and does not foresee his sufferings only the boon to the world and the glory to herself but the dimittis is the very opposite it is a gentle joy and the world contentedly resigned by a good old man fatigued who has run his race and longs to sleep after lifes fever when next you have the good fortune to hear that song think you see the sun descending red and calm after a day of storms and an aged christian saying goodnight and you will honor poor dead king as i do the music that truly reflects great words was never yet small music write it who may you are right madam said ashmead when i doubted its being good music i suppose i meant salable ah voila said the klosking then turning to vizard for sympathy what this faithful friend understands by good music is music that can be sold for a good deal of money that is so said ashmead stoutly i am a theatrical agent you cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear you have tried it more than once you know but it would not work ashmead amused vizard and he took him into his study and had some more conversation with him he even asked him to stay in the house but ashmead was shy and there was a theater at taddington so he said he had a good deal of business to do he had better make the swan his headquarters i shall be at your service all the same sir or mademoiselle kloskings have a glass of madeira mr ashmead well sir to tell the truth i have had one or two then it knows the road you are very good sir what madeira is this the wine the doctors ran down a few years ago they couldnt have tasted it well it is like ourselves improved by traveling that has been twice to india it will never go again past me said ashmead gayly my mouth is a cape it will never weather he went to his inn before he had been there ten minutes up rattled a smart servant in a smart dogcart hamperfor joseph ashmead esquire anything to pay what forits from vizard court and the dogcart rattled away joseph was in the hall and witnessed this phenomenon he said to himself i wish i had a vast acquaintanceall country gentlemen that afternoon ina klosking insisted on walking up and down the room supported by mesdemoiselles gale and dover the result was fatigue and sleep that is all tomorrow said she i will have but one live crutch i must and will recover my strength in the evening she insisted on both ladies dining with mr vizard here too she had her way vizard was in very good spirits and when the servants were gone complimented miss gale on her skill our skill you mean said she it was you who prescribed this new medicine of the mind the psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and it was you who administered the ashmead and he made her laugh or nearlyand that we have never been able to do she must take a few grains of ashmead every day the worst of it is i am afraid we shall cure her too quickly and then we shall lose her but that was to be expected i am very unfortunate in my attachments i always was if i fall in love with a woman she is sure to hate me or else die or else fly away i love this one to distraction so she is sure to desert me because she couldnt misbehave and i wont let her die well said vizard you know what to doretard the cure that is one of the arts of your profession and so it is but how can i when i love her no we must have recourse to our benevolent tyrant again he must get miss vizard back here before my goddess is well enough to spread her wings and fly vizard looked puzzled this said he sounds like a riddle or female logic it is both said rhoda miss dover give him the mot denigme im offto the patient i adore she vanished swiftly and vizard looked to fanny for a solution but fanny seemed rather vexed with miss gale and said nothing then he pressed her to explain she answered him with a certain reluctance mademoiselle klosking has taken into her head that zoe will never return to this house while she is in it who put that into her head now said vizard bitterly nobody upon my honor a womans instinct well she is horrified at the idea of keeping your sister out of her own house so she is getting well to go and the strength of her will is such that she will get well all the better but zoe will soon get tired of somerville villa a little persuasion will bring her home especially if you were to offer to take her place oh i would do that to oblige you harrington if i saw any good at the end of it but please think twice how can zoe and that lady ever stay under the same roof how can they meet at your table and speak to each other they are rivals they are both getting cured and neither will ever see the villain again i hope not but who can tell well never mind them if their eyes are not opened by this time they will get no pity from me it is you i think of now then in a hesitating way and her cheeks mantling higher and higher with honest blushesyou have suffered enough already from women i know it is not my business but it does grieve me to see you going into trouble again what good can come of it her connection with that man so recent and sostrange the world will interpret its own way your position in the countyevery eye upon you i see the way inno doubt it is strewed with flowers but i see no way out be brave in time harrington it will not be the first time she must be a good woman somehow or faces eyes and voices and ways are all a lie but if she is good she is very unfortunate and she will give you a sore heart for life if you dont mind id clinch my teeth and shut my eyes and let her go in time vizard groaned aloud and at that a tear or two rolled down fannys burning cheeks you are a good little girl said vizard affectionately but i cannot he hung his head despondently and muttered i see no way out either but i yield to fate i feared her and fled from her she has followed me i can resist no more i drift some men never know happiness i shall have had a happy fortnight at all events i thank you and respect you for your advice but i cant take it so now i suppose you will be too much offended to oblige me oh dear no would you mind writing to aunt maitland and saying you would like to take zoes place i will do it with pleasure to oblige you besides it will be a fib and it is so long since i have told a good fib when shall i write oh about the end of the week yes that will be time enough miss gale wont let her go till next week ah after all how nice and natural it is to be naughty fibs and flirtation welcome home this is the beauty of being goodand i shall recommend it to all my friends on this very accountyou can always leave it off at a moments notice without any trouble now naughtiness sticks to you like a burr so with no more ado this new mentor became vizards accomplice and they agreed to get zoe back before the klosking could get strong enough to move with her physicians consent as the hamper of madeira was landed in the hall of the swan inn a genial voice cried you are in luck ashmead turned and there was poikilus peering at him from the doorway of the commercial room what is the game now thought ashmead but what he said was why i know that face i declare it is the gent that treated me at homburg bring in the hamper dick then to poikilus have ye dined yet no going to dine in half an hour roast gosling just enough for two well divide it if you like and ill stand a bottle of old madeira my old friend squire vizard has just sent it me ill just have a splash dinner will be ready by then he bustled out of the room but said as he went i say old man open the hamper and put two bottles just within the smile of the fire he then went upstairs and plunged his head in cold water to clear his faculties for the encounter the friends sat down to dinner and afterward to the madeira both gay and genial outside but within full of designtheir object being to pump one another in the encounter at homburg ashmead had an advantage poikilus thought himself unknown to ashmead but this time there was a change poikilus knew by this time that la klosking had gone to vizard court how she had known severne was there puzzled him a good deal but he had ended by suspecting ashmead in a vague way the parties therefore met on even terms ashmead resolved to learn what he could about severne and poikilus to learn what he could about zoe vizard and mademoiselle klosking ashmead opened the ball been long here just come business yes want to see if theres any chance of my getting paid for that job what job why the homburg job look herei dont know why i should have any secrets from a good fellow like you only you must not tell anybody else oh honor bright well then i am a detective ye dont mean that im poikilus good heavens well i dont care i havent murdered anybody heres your health poikilus i say you could tell a tale or two that i could but im out of luck this time the gentleman that employed me has mizzled and he promised me fifty pounds i came down here in hopes of finding him saw him once in this neighborhood well you wont find him here i dont think you must excuse me but your employer is a villain he has knocked a lady down and nearly killed her you dont say that yes that beautiful lady the singer you saw in homburg what the lady that said he should have his money the same why he must be mad no a scoundrel that is all then she wont give him his money after that not if i can help it but if she likes to pay you your commission i shall not object to that you are a good fellow what is more i shall see her tomorrow and i will put the question to her for you poikilus was profuse in his thanks and said he began to think it was his only chance then he had a misgiving i have no claim on the lady said he and i am afraid i have been a bad friend to her i did not mean it though and the whole affair is dark to me you are not very sharp then for a detective said ashmead well shut your mouth and open your eyes your mr severne was the ladys lover and preyed upon her he left her she was fool enough to love him still and pined for him he is a gambler and was gambling by my side when mademoiselle klosking came in so he cut his lucky and left me fifty pounds to play for him and she put the pot on and broke the bank i didnt know who he was but we found it out by his photograph then you came smelling after the money and we sold you nicely my fine detective we made it our business to know where you wrote tovizard court she went down there and found him just going to be married to a beautiful young lady she collared him he flung her down and cut her temple opennearly killed her she lies ill in the house and the other young lady is gone away brokenhearted where to how should i know what is that to you why dont you see wherever she is he wont be far off he likes her best dont he it dont follow that she likes him now she has found him out he had better not go after her or hell get a skinful of broken bones my friend squire vizard is the man to make short work with him if he caught the blackguard spooning after his sister and serve him right still i wish i knew where that young lady is i dare say i could learn if i made it my business having brought the matter to that point poikilus left it and simply made himself agreeable he told ashmead his experiences and as they were many of them strange and dramatic he kept him a delighted listener till midnight the next day ashmead visited mademoiselle klosking and found her walking up and down the room with her hand on miss gales shoulder she withdrew into the embrasure and had some confidential talk with him as a matter of course he told her about poikilus and that he was hunting down severne for his money indeed said the klosking please tell me every word that passed between you he did so as nearly as he could remember mademoiselle klosking leaned her brow upon her hand a considerable time in thought then she turned on ashmead and said quietly that poikilus is still acting for him and the one thing they desire to learn is where to find miss vizard and delude her to her ruin no no cried ashmead violently but the next moment his countenance fell you are wiser than i am said he it may be confound the sneak ill give it him next time i see him why he must love villainy for its own sake i as good as said you would pay him his fifty pounds what fifty pounds his fifty pounds is a falsehood like himself now my friend please take my instructions my positive instructions yes madam you will not change your friendly manner show no suspicion nor anger if they are cunning we must be wise and the wise always keep their temper you will say miss vizard has gone to ireland but to what part is only known to her brother tell him this and be very free and communicative on all other subjects for this alone has any importance now as for me i can easily learn where somerville villa is and in a day or two shall send you to look after her one thing is cleari had better lose no time in recovering my strength well my will is strong i will lose no timeyour arm monsieur and she resumed her promenade ashmead instructed as above dined again with the detective but out of revenge gave him but one bottle of madeira as they sipped it he delivered a great many words and in the middle of them said oh bytheby i asked after that poor young lady gone to ireland but they didnt know what part after dinner ashmead went to the theater when he came back poikilus was gone so did wisdom baffle cunning that time but cunning did not really leave the field that very evening an aged man in green spectacles was inquiring about the postal arrangements to vizard court and next day he might have been seen in a back street of taddington talking to the village postman and afterward drinking with him it was poikilus groping his way chapter xxiii a few words avail to describe the sluggish waters of the dead sea but what pen can portray the indian ocean lashed and tormented by a cyclone even so a few words have sufficed to show that ina kloskings heart was all benumbed and deadened and with the help of insult treachery loss of blood brainfever and selfesteem rebelling against villainy had outlived its power of suffering poignant torture but i cannot sketch in a few words nor paint in many the tempest of passion in zoe vizard yet it is my duty to try and give the reader some little insight into the agony the changes the fury the grief the tempest of passion in a virgin heart in such a nature the great passions of the mind often rage as fiercely or even more so than in older and experienced women literally zoe vizard loved edward severne one minute and hated him the next gave him up for a traitor and then vowed to believe nothing until she had heard his explanation burned with ire at his silence sickened with dismay at his silence then for a while love and faith would get the upper hand and she would be quite calm why should she torment herself an old sweetheart abandoned long ago had come between them he had unfortunately done the woman an injury in his wild endeavor to get away from her well what business had she to use force no doubt he was ashamed afflicted at what he had done being a man or was in despair seeing that lady installed in her brothers house and her story probably a parcel of falsehoods listened to then she would have a gleam of joy for she knew he had not written to ina klosking but soon despondency came down like a dark cloud for she said to herself he has left us both he sees the woman he does not love will not let him have the one he does love and so he has lost heart and will have no more to say to either when her thoughts took this turn she would cry piteously but not for long she would dry her eyes and burn with wrath all round she would still hate her rival but call her lover a cowarda contemptible coward after her day of raging and grieving and doubting and fearing and hoping and despairing night overtook her with an exhausted body a bleeding heart and weeping eyes she had been so happyon the very brink of paradise and now she was deserted her pillow was wet every night she cried in her very sleep and when she woke in the morning her body was always quivering and in the very act of waking came a horror and an instinctive reluctance to face the light that was to bring another day of misery such is a fair though loose description of her condition the slight fillip given to her spirits by the journey did her a morsel of good but it died away having to nurse aunt maitland did her a little good at first but she soon relapsed into herself and became so distraite that aunt maitland who was all self being an invalid began to speak sharply to her on the second day of her visit to somerville villa as she sat brooding at the foot of her aunts bed suddenly she heard horses feet and then a ring at the halldoor her heart leaped perhaps he had come to explain all he might not choose to go to vizard court what if he had been watching as anxiously as herself and had seized the first opportunity in a moment her pale cheek rivaled carmine the girl brought up a card lord uxmoor the color died away directly say i am very sorry but at this moment i cannot leave my aunt the girl stared with amazement and took down the message uxmoor rode away zoe felt a moments pleasure no if she could not see the right man she would not see the wrong that at least was in her power nevertheless in the course of the day remembering uxmoors worth and the pain she had already given him she was almost sorry she had indulged herself at his expense superfluous contrition he came next day as a matter of course she liked him none the better for coming but she went downstairs to him he came toward her but started back and uttered an exclamation you are not well he said in tones of tenderness and dismay not very she faltered for his open manly concern touched her and you have come here to nurse this old lady indeed miss vizard you need nursing yourself you know it is some time since i had the pleasure of seeing you and the change is alarming may i send you dr atkins my mothers physician i am much obliged to you no oh i forgot you have a physician of your own sex why is she not looking after you miss gale is better employed she is at vizard court in attendance on a far more brilliant personmademoiselle klosking a professional singer perhaps you know her i saw her at homburg well she met with an accident in our halla serious one and harrington took her in and has placed all his resourceshis lady physician and allat her service he is so fond of music a certain satirical bitterness peered through these words but honest uxmoor did not notice it he said then i wish you would let me be your doctorfor want of a better and you think you can cure me said zoe satirically it does seem presumptuous but at least i could do you a little good if you could be got to try my humble prescription what is it asked zoe listlessly it is my mare phillis she is the delight of every lady who mounts her she is thoroughbred lively swift gentle docile amiable perfect ride her on these downs an hour or two very day ill send her over tomorrow may i if you like rosa would pack up my ridinghabit rosa was a prophetess next day came phillis saddled and led by a groom on horseback and uxmoor soon followed on an old hunter he lifted zoe to her saddle and away they rode the groom following at a respectful distance when they got on the downs they had a delightful canter but zoe in her fevered state of mind was not content with that she kept increasing the pace till the old hunter could no longer live with the young filly and she galloped away from lord uxmoor and made him ridiculous in the eyes of his groom the truth is she wanted to get away from him he drew the rein and stood stockstill she made a circuit of a mile and came up to him with heightened color and flashing eyes looking beautiful well said she dont you like galloping yes but i dont like cruelty cruelty look at the mares tail how it is quivering and her flanks panting and no wonder you have been over twice the derby course at a racing pace miss vizard a horse is not a steam engine ill never ride her again said zoe i did not come here to be scolded i will go home they walked slowly home in silence uxmoor hardly knew what to say to her but at last he murmured apologetically never mind the poor mare if you are better for galloping her she waited a moment before she spoke and then she said well yes i am better im better for my ride and better for my scolding goodby meaning forever goodby said he in the same tone only he sent the mare next day and followed her on a young thoroughbred what said zoe am i to have another trial and another after that so this time she would only canter very slowly and kept stopping every now and then to inquire satirically if that would distress the mare but uxmoor was too goodhumored to quarrel for nothing he only laughed and said you are not the only lady who takes a horse for a machine these rides did her bodily health some permanent good but their effect on her mind was fleeting she was in fair spirits when she was actually bounding through the air but she collapsed afterward at first when she used to think that severne never came near her and uxmoor was so constant she almost hated uxmoorso little does the wrong man profit by doing the right thing for a woman i admit that though not a deadly womanhater myself but byandby she was impartially bitter against them both the wrong man for doing the right thing and the right man for not doing it as the days rolled by and severne did not appear her indignation and wounded pride began to mount above her love a beautiful woman counts upon pursuit and thinks a man less than man if he does not love her well enough to find her though hid in the caves of ocean or the labyrinths of bermondsey she said to herself then he has no explanation to offer another woman has frightened him away from me i have wasted my affections on a coward her bosom boiled with love and contempt and wounded pride and her mind was tossed to and fro like a leaf in a storm she began by force of will to give uxmoor some encouragement only after it she writhed and wept at last finding herself driven to and fro like a leaf she told miss maitland all and sought counsel of her she must have something to lean on the old lady was better by this time and spoke kindly to her she said mr severne was charming and she was not bound to give him up because another lady had past claims on him but it appeared to her that mr severne himself had deserted her he had not written to her probably he knew something that had not yet transpired and had steeled himself to the separation for good reasons it was a decision she must accept let her then consider how forlorn is the condition of most deserted women compared with hers here was a devoted lover whom she esteemed and who could offer her a high position and an honest love if she had a mother that mother would almost force her to engage herself at once to lord uxmoor having no mother the best thing she could do would be to force herselfto say some irrevocable words and never look back it was the lot of her sex not to marry the first love and to be all the happier in the end for that disappointment though at the time it always seemed eternal all this spoken in a voice of singular kindness by one who used to be so sharp made zoes tears flow gently and somewhat cooled her raging heart she began now to submit and only cry at intervals and let herself drift and uxmoor visited her every day and she found it impossible not to esteem and regard him nevertheless one afternoon just about his time she was seized with such an aversion to his courtship and such a revolt against the slope she seemed gliding down that she flung on her bonnet and shawl and darted out of the house to escape him she said to the servant i am gone for a walk if anybody calls uxmoor did call and receiving this message he bit his lip sent the horse home and walked up to the windmill on the chance of seeing her anywhere he had already observed she was never long in one mood and as he was always in the same mind he thought perhaps he might be tolerably welcome if he could meet her unexpected meantime zoe walked very fast to get away from the house as soon as possible and she made a round of nearly five miles walking through two villages and on her return lost her way however a shepherd showed her a bridleroad which he told her would soon take her to somerville villa through the small pastures and accordingly she came into a succession of meadows not very large they were all fenced and gated but the gates were only shut not locked this was fortunate for they were new fivebarred gates and a lady does not like getting over these even in solitude her clothes are not adapted there were sheep in some of these cows in others and the pastures wonderfully green and rich being always well manured and fed down by cattle zoes love of color was soothed by these emerald fields dotted with white sheep and red cows in the last field before the lane that led to the village a single beast was grazing zoe took no notice of him and walked on but he took wonderful notice of her and stared then gave a disagreeable snort he took offense at her indian shawl and after pawing the ground and erecting his tail he came straight at her at a tearing trot and his tail out behind him zoe saw and screamed violently and ran for the gate ahead which of course was a few yards further from her than the gate behind she ran for her life but the bull when he saw that broke into a gallop directly and came up fast with her she could not escape at that moment a man vaulted clean over the gate tore a pitchfork out of a heap of dung that luckily stood in the corner and boldly confronted the raging bull just in time for at that moment zoe lost heart and crouched screaming in the side ditch with her hands before her eyes the newcomer rash as his conduct seemed was countrybred and knew what he was about he drove one of the prongs clean through the great cartilage of the bulls mouth and was knocked down like a ninepin with the broken staff of the pitchfork in his hand and the bull reared in the air with agony the prong having gone clean through his upper lip in two places and fastened itself as one fastens a pin in that leathery but sensitive organ now uxmoor was a university athlete he was no sooner down than up so when the bull came down from his rearing and turned to massacre his assailant he was behind him and seizing his tail twisted it and delivered a thundering blow on his backbone and followed it up by a shower of them on his ribs run to the gate zoe he roared whack whack whackrun to the gate i tell youwhackwhackwhackwhackwhack thus ordered zoe vizard who would not have moved of herself being in a collapse of fear scudded to the gate got on the right side of it and looked over with two eyes like saucers she saw a sight incredible to her instead of letting the bull alone now she was safe uxmoor was sticking to him like a ferret the bull ran tossing his nose with pain and bellowing uxmoor dragged by the tail and compelled to follow in preposterous giant strides barely touching the ground with the point of his toe pounded the creatures ribs with such blows as zoe had never dreamed possible they sounded like flail on wooden floor and each blow was accompanied with a loud jubilant shout presently being a fives player and ambidexter he shifted his hand and the tremendous whacks resounded on the bulls left side the bull thus belabored and resounding like the big drum made a circuit of the field but found it all too hot he knew his way to a certain quiet farmyard he bolted and came bang at zoe once more with furious eyes and goredistilling nostrils but this time she was on the right side of the gate yet she drew back in dismay as the bull drew near and she was right for in his agony and amazement the unwieldy but sinewy brute leaped the fivebarred gate and cleared it all but the top rail that he burst through as if it had been paper and dragged uxmoor after him and pulled him down and tore him some yards along the hard road on his back and bumped his head against a stone and so got rid of him then pounded away down the lane snorting and bellowing and bleeding the prong still stuck through his nostrils like a pin zoe ran to uxmoor with looks of alarm and tender concern and lifted his head to her tender bosom for his clothes were torn and his cheeks and hands bleeding but he soon shook off his confusion and rose without assistance have you got over your fright said he that is the question oh yes yes it is only you i am alarmed for it is much better i should be killed than you killed i never had better fun in my life it was glorious i stuck to him and hitthere i have not had anything i could hit as hard as i wanted to since i used to fight with my cousin jack at eton oh miss vizard it was a whirl of elysium but i am sorry you were frightened let me take you home oh yes but not that way that is the way the monster went quivered zoe oh he has had enough of us but i have had too much of him take me some other roada hundred miles round how i tremble so you do take my armno putting the tips of your fingers on it is no use take it reallyyou want support be courageous nowwe are very near home zoe trembled and cried a little to conclude the incident but walked bravely home on uxmoors arm in the hall at somerville villa she saw him change color and insisted on his taking some port wine i shall be very glad said he a decanter was brought he filled a large tumbler and drank it off like water this was the first intimation he gave zoe that he was in pain and his nerves hard tried nor did she indeed arrive at that conclusion until he had left her of course she carried all this to aunt maitland that lady was quite moved by the adventure she sat up in bed and listened with excitement and admiration she descanted on lord uxmoors courage and chivalry and congratulated zoe that such a pearl of manhood had fallen at her feet why child said she surely after this you will not hesitate between this gentleman and a beggarly adventurer who has nothing not even the courage of a man turn your back on all such rubbish and be the queen of the county id be content to die tomorrow if i could see you countess of uxmoor you shall live and see it dear aunt said zoe kissing her well said miss maitland if anything can cure me that will and really said she i feel better ever since that brave fellow began to bring you to your senses admiration and gratitude being now added to esteem zoe received lord uxmoor next day with a certain timidity and half tenderness she had never shown before and as he was by nature a rapid wooer he saw his chance and stayed much longer than usual and at last hazarded a hope that he might be allowed to try and win her heart thereupon she began to fence and say that love was all folly he had her esteem and her gratitude and it would be better for both of them to confine their sentiments within those rational bounds that i cannot do said uxmoor so i must ask your leave to be ambitious let me try and conquer your affection as you conquered the bull yes only not so rudely nor so quickly ill be bound well i dont know why i should object i esteem you more than anybody in the world you are my beau ideal of a man if you can make me love you all the better for me only i am afraid you cannot may i try yes said zoe bushing carnation may i come every day twice a day if you like i think i shall succeedin time i hope you may then he kissed her hand devotedlythe first time in his lifeand went away on wings zoe flew up to her aunt maitland flushed and agitated aunt i am as good as engaged to him i have said such unguarded things im sure he will understand it that i consent to receive his addresses as my lover not that i really said so i hope said aunt maitland that you have committed yourself somehow or other and cannot go back i think i have yes it is all over i cannot go back now then she burst out crying then she was near choking and had to smell her aunts salts while still the tears ran fast miss maitland received this with perfect composure she looked on them as the last tears of regret given to a foolish attachment at the moment of condemning it forever she was old and had seen these final tears shed by more than one loving woman just before entering on her day of sunshine and now zoe must be alone and vent her swelling heart she tied a handkerchief round her head and darted into the garden she went round and round it with fleet foot and beating pulses the sun began to decline and a cold wind to warn her in she came for the last time to a certain turn of the gravel walk where there was a little iron gate leading into the wooded walk from the meadows at that gate she found a man she started back and leaned against the nearest tree with her hands behind her it was edward severneall in black and pale as death but not paler than her own face turned in a moment indeed they looked at each other like two ghosts chapter xxiv zoe was the first to speak or rather to gasp why do you come here because you are here and how dare you come where i amnow your falsehood is found out and flung into my very face i have never been false to you at this moment i suffer for my fidelity you suffer i am glad of it how in many ways but they are all light compared with my fear of losing your love i will listen to no idle words said zoe sternly a lady claimed you before my face why did you not stand firm like a man and say you have no claim on me now i have a right to love another and i do why did you flybecause you were guilty no said he doggedly surprised and confounded but not guilty fool idiot that i was i lost my head entirely yes it is hopeless you must despise me you have a right to despise me dont tell me said zoe you never lose your head you are always selfpossessed and artful would to heaven i had never seen you she was violent he gave her time zoe said he after a while if i had not lost my head should i have illtreated a lady and nearly killed her ah said zoe sharply that is what you have been suffering fromremorse and well you may you ought to go back to her and ask her pardon on your knees indeed it is all you have left to do now i know i ought then do what you ought goodby i cannot i hate her what because you have broken her heart and nearly killed her no but because she has come between me and the only woman i ever really loved or ever can she would not have done that if you had not given her the right i see her now she looked justice and you looked guilt words are idle when i can see her face before me still no woman could look like that who was in the wrong but youguilt made you a coward you were false to her and false to me and so you ran away from us both you would have talked either of us over alone but we were together so you ran away you have found me alone now so you are brave again but it is too late i am undeceived i decline to rob mademoiselle klosking of her lover so goodby and this time she was really going but he stopped her at least dont go with a falsehood on your lips said he coldly a falsehoodme yes it is a falsehood how can you pretend i left that lady for you when you know my connection with her had entirely ceased ten months before i ever saw your face this staggered zoe a moment so did the heat and sense of injustice he threw into his voice i forgot that said she naively then recovering herself you may have parted with her but it does not follow that she consented fickle men desert constant women it is done every day you are mistaken again said he when i first saw you i had ceased to think of mademoiselle klosking but it was not so when i first left her i did not desert her i tore myself from her i had a great affection for her you dare to tell me that well at all events it is the truth why did you leave her then out of selfrespect i was poor she was rich and admired men sent her bouquets and bracelets and flattered her behind the scenes and i was lowered in my own eyes so i left her i was unhappy for a time but i had my pride to support me and the wound was healed long before i knew what it was to love really to love there was nothing here that zoe could contradict she kept silence and was mystified then she attacked him on another quarter have you written to her since you behaved like a ruffian to her no and i never will come what may it is wicked of me but i hate her i am compelled to esteem her but i hate her zoe could quite understand that but in spite of that she said of course you do men always hate those they have used ill why did you not write to me had a mind to be impartial i suppose i had reason to believe it would have been intercepted for shame vizard is incapable of such a thing ah you dont know how he is changed he looks on me as a mad dog consider zoe do pray take the real key to it all he is in love with mademoiselle klosking madly in love with her and i have been so unfortunate as to injure hernearly to kill her i dare say he thinks it is on your account he hates me but men deceive themselves it is for her he hates me oh ay think for a moment and you will see it is you are not in his confidence i am sure he has never told you that he ordered his keepers to shoot me down if i came about the house at night oh no no cried zoe do you know he has raised the country against me and has warrants out against me for forgery because i was taken in by a rogue who gave me bills with sham names on them and i got vizard to cash them as soon as we found out how i had been tricked my uncle and i offered at once to pay him back his money but no he prefers to keep the bills as a weapon zoe began to be puzzled a little but she said you have been a long time discovering all these grievances why have you held no communication all this time because you were inaccessible does not your own heart tell you that i have been all these weeks trying to communicate and unable why i came three times under your window at night and you never never would look out i did look out ever so often if i had been you i should have looked ten thousand times i only left off coming when i heard the keepers were ordered to shoot me down not that i should have cared much for i am desperate but i had just sense enough left to see that if my dead body had been brought bleeding into your hall some night none of you would ever have been happy again your eyes would have been opened all of you well zoe you left vizard court that i learned but it was only this morning i could find out where you were gone and you see i am herewith a price upon my head please read vizards advertisements she took them and read them a hot flush mounted to her cheek you see said he i am to be imprisoned if i set my foot in barfordshire well it will be false imprisonment and mademoiselle kloskings lover will smart for it at all events i shall take no orders but from you you have been deceived by appearances i shall do all i can to undeceive you and if i cannot there will be no need to imprison me for a deceit of which i was the victim nor to shoot me like a dog for loving you i will take my broken heart quietly away and leave barfordshire and england and the world for aught i care then he cried and that made her cry directly ah she sighed we are unfortunate appearances are so deceitful i see i have judged too hastily and listened too little to my own heart that always made excuses but it is too late now why too late it is but why it all looked so ugly and you were silent we are unfortunate my brother would never let us marry and besidesoh why did you not come before i might as well say why did you not look out of your window you could have done it without risking your life as i did or why did you not advertise you might have invited an explanation from e s under cover to soandso ladies never think of such things you know that very well oh i dont complain but i do say that those who love should not be ready to reproach they should put a generous construction you might have known and you ought to have known that i was struggling to find you and torn with anguish at my impotence no no i am so young and inexperienced and all my friends against you it is they who have parted us how can they part us if you love me still as i love you because for the last fortnight i have not loved you but hated you and doubted you and thought my only chance of happiness was to imitate your indifference and while i was thinking so another person has come forward one whom i have always esteemed and now in my pity and despair i have given him hopes she hid her burning face in her hands i see you are false to me and therefore you have suspected me of being false to you at that she raised her head high directly edward you are unjust look in my face and you may see what i have suffered before i could bring myself to condemn you what your paleness that dark rim under your lovely eyesam i the cause indeed you are but i forgive you you are sadly pale and worn too oh how unfortunate we are do not cry dearest said he do not despair be calm and let me know the worst i will not reproach you though you have reproached me i love you as no woman can love come tell me then the truth is lord uxmoor has renewed his attention to me ah he has been here every day severne groaned aunt maitland was on his side and spoke so kindly to me and he saved my life from a furious bull he is brave noble good and he loves me i have committed myself i cannot draw back with honor but from me you can because i am poor and hated and have no title if you are committed to him you are engaged to me i am so now i can go neither way if i had poison i would take it this moment and end all for gods sake dont talk so i am sure you exaggerate you cannot in those few days have pledged your faith to another let me see your finger ah theres my ring on it still bless you my own darling zoebless you and he covered her hand with kisses and bedewed it with his everready tears the girl began to melt and all power to ooze out of her mind and body she sighed deeply and said what can i doi dont say with honor and credit but with decency what can i do tell me first what you have said to him that you consider so compromising zoe with many sighs replied i believei saidi was unhappy and so i was and i ownedthat i admiredand esteemed him and so i do and then of course he wanted more and i could not give more and he asked might he try and make me love him andi saidi am afraid i saidhe might if he could and a very proper answer too ah but i said he might come every day it is idle to deceive ourselves i have encouraged his addresses i can do nothing now with credit but die or go into a convent when did you say this this very day then he has never acted on it no but he will he will be here tomorrow for certain then your course is plain you must choose tonight between him and me you must dismiss him by letter or me upon this spot i have not much fortune to offer you and no coronet but i love you and you have seen me reject a lovely and accomplished woman whom i esteem as much as you do this lord reject him why you have seen me fling her away from me like a dog sooner than leave you in a moments doubt of my love if you cannot write a civil note declining an earl for me your love in not worthy of mine and i will begone with my love i will not take it to mademoiselle klosking though i esteem her as you do this lord but at all events i will take it away from you and leave you my curse instead for a false fickle girl that could not wait one little month but must fall with her engaged ring on her finger into another mans arms oh zoe zoe who could have believed this of you dont reproach me i wont bear it she cried wildly i hope not to have to reproach you said he firmly i cannot conceive your hesitating i am worn out love has been too great a torment oh if i could find peace again her tears flowed he put on a sympathizing air you shall have peace dismiss him as i tell you and he will trouble you no more shake hands with me and say you prefer him and i will trouble you no more but with two lovers peace is out of the question and so is selfrespect i know i could not vacillate between you and mademoiselle klosking or any other woman ah edward if i do this you ought to love me very dearly i shall better than everif possible and never make me jealous again i never shall dearest our troubles are over edward i have been very unhappy i could not bear these doubts again you shall never be unhappy again i must do what you require i suppose that is how it always ends oh dear oh dear zoe it must be done you know it must i warn you i shall do it as kindly as i can of course you will you ought to i must go in now i feel very cold how soon tomorrow will you meet me here when you please said she languidly at ten oclock yes then there was a tender parting and zoe went slowly in she went to her own room just to think it all over alone she caught sight of her face in the glass her cheeks had regained color and her eyes were bright as stars she stopped and looked at herself there now said she and i seem to myself to live again i was mad to think i could ever love any man but him he is my darling my idol there was no late dinner at somerville villa indeed ladies left to themselves seldom dine late nature is strong in them and they are hungriest when the sun is high at seven oclock zoe vizard was seated at her desk trying to write to lord uxmoor she sighed she moaned she began and dropped the pen and hid her face she became almost wild and in that state she at last dashed off what follows dear lord uxmoorfor pitys sake forgive the mad words i said to you today it is impossible i can do no more than admire and esteem you my heart is gone from me forever pray forgive me though i do not deserve it and never see me nor look at me again i ask pardon for my vacillation it has been disgraceful but it has ended and i was under a great error which i cannot explain to you when i led you to believe i had a heart to give you my eyes are opened our paths lie asunder pray pray forgive me if it is possible i will never forgive myself nor cease to bless and revere you whom i have used so ill zoe vizard that day uxmoor dined alone with his mother for a wonder and he told her how miss vizard had come round he told her also about the bull but so vilely that she hardly comprehended he had been in any danger these encounters are rarely described to the life except by us who avoid themexcept on paper lady uxmoor was much pleased she was a proud politic lady and this was a judicious union of two powerful houses in the county and one that would almost command the elections but above all she knew her sons heart was in the match and she gave him a mothers sympathy as she retired she kissed him and said when you are quite sure of the prize tell me and i will call upon her being alone lord uxmoor lighted a cigar and smoked it in measureless content the servant brought him a note on a salver it had come by hand uxmoor opened it and read every word straight through down to zoe vizard read it and sat petrified he read it again he felt a sort of sickness come over him he swallowed a tumbler of port a wine he rarely touched but he felt worse now than after the bullfight this done he rose and stalked like a wounded lion into the drawingroom which was on the same floor and laid the letter before his mother you are a woman too said he a little helplessly tell mewhat on earth does this mean the dowager read it slowly and keenly and said it meansanother man ah said uxmoor with a sort of snarl have you seen any one about her no not lately at vizard court there was but that is all over now i conclude it was a mr severne an adventurer a fellow that was caught out in a lie before us all vizard tells me a lady came and claimed him before miss vizard and he ran away an unworthy attachment in short very unworthy if it was an attachment at all was he at vizard court when she declined your hand yes did he remain after you went i suppose so yes he must have then the whole thing is clear that man has come forward again unexpectedly or written and she dismisses you my darling there is but one thing for you to do leave her and thank her for telling you in time a less honorable fool would have hidden it and then we might have had a countess of uxmoor in the divorce court some day or other i had better go abroad said uxmoor with a groan this country is poisoned for me go by all means let janneway pack up your things tomorrow i should like to kill that fellow first you will not even waste a thought on him if you are my son you are right mother what am i to say to her not a word what not answer her letter it is humble enough i am surepoor soul mother i am wretched but i am not bitter and my rival will revenge me uxmoor your going abroad is the only answer she shall have the wisest man in these matters who ever lived has left a rule of conduct to every wellborn mana rule which believe me is wisdom itself le bruit est pour le fat la plainte est pour le sot lhonnete homme trompe seloigne et ne dit mot you will make a tour and not say a word to miss vizard good bad nor indifferent i insist upon that very well thank you dear mother you guide me and dont let me make a fool of myself for i am terribly cut up you will be the only countess of uxmoor in my day then he knelt at her feet and she kissed his head and cried over him but her tears only made this proud lady stronger next day he started on his travels now but for zoe he would on no account have left england just then for he was just going to build model cottages in his own village upon designs of his own each with a little plot and a public warehouse or granary with divisions for their potatoes and apples etc however he turned this over in his mind while he was packing he placed certain plans and papers in his dispatch box and took his ticket to taddington instead of going at once to london from taddington he drove over to hillstoke and asked for miss gale they told him she was fixed at vizard court that vexed him he did not want to meet vizard he thought it the part of a jerry sneak to go and howl to a brother against his sister yet if vizard questioned him how could he conceal there was something wrong however he went down to vizard court but said to the servant who opened the door i am rather in a hurry sir do you think you could procure me a few minutes with miss gale you need not trouble mr vizard yes my laud certainly my laud please step in the morningroom my laud mr vizard is out that was fortunate and miss gale came down to him directly fanny took that opportunity to chatter and tell mademoiselle klosking all about lord uxmoor and his passion for zoe and he will have her too said she boldly lord uxmoor told miss gale he had called upon business he was obliged to leave home for a time and wished to place his projects under the care of a person who could really sympathize with them and make additions to them if necessary men said he are always making oversights in matters of domestic comfort besides you are full of ideas i want you to be viceroy with full power and act just as you would if the village belonged to you rhoda colored high at the compliment wells cows granary real educationwhat you like said he i know your mind begin abolishing the lower orders in the only way they can be got rid ofby raising them in comfort cleanliness decency and knowledge then i shall not be missed im going abroad going abroad yes here are my plans alter them for the better if you can all the work to be done by the villagers weekly wages we buy materials they will be more reconciled to improved dwellings when they build them themselves here are the addresses of the people who will furnish money it will entail traveling but my people will always meet you at the station if you telegraph from taddington you accept a thousand thanks i am afraid i must be off she went into the hall with him half bewildered and only at the door found time to ask after zoe vizard a little better i think than when she came does she know you are going abroad no i dont think she does yet it was settled all in a hurry he escaped further questioning by hurrying away miss gale was still looking after him when ina klosking came down dressed for a walk and leaning lightly on miss dovers arm this was by previous consent of miss gale well dear said fanny what did he say to you something that has surprised and puzzled me very much she then related the whole conversation with her usual precision ina klosking observed quietly to fanny that this did not look like successful wooing i dont know that said fanny stoutly oh miss gale did you not ask him about her certainly i did and he said she was better than when she first came there said fanny triumphantly miss gale gave her a little pinch and she dropped the subject vizard returned and found mademoiselle klosking walking on his gravel he offered her his arm and was a happy man parading her very slowly and supporting her steps and purring his congratulations into her ear suppose i were to invite you to dinner what would you say i think i should say tomorrow and a very good answer too tomorrow shall be a fete you spoil me that is impossible it was strange to see them together he so happy she so apathetic yet gracious next morning came a bit of human naturea letter from zoe to fanny almost entirely occupied with praises of lord uxmoor she told the bull story better than i haveif possibleand in short made uxmoor a hero of romance fanny carried this in triumph to the other ladies and read it out there said she didnt i tell you rhoda read the letter and owned herself puzzled i am not then said fanny they are engagedover the bull like europa and i forgot whoand so he is not afraid to go abroad now that is just like the men they cool directly the chase is over now the truth was that zoe was trying to soothe her conscience with elegant praises of the man she had dismissed and felt guilty ina klosking said little she was puzzled too at first she asked to see zoes handwriting the letter was handed to her she studied the characters it is a good hand she said nothing mean there and she gave it back but with a glance she had read the address and learned that the post town was bagley all that day at intervals she brought her powerful understanding to bear on the paradox and though she had not the facts and the clew i have given the reader she came near the truth in an essential matter she satisfied herself that lord uxmoor was not engaged to zoe vizard clearly if so he would not leave england for months she resolved to know more and just before dinner she wrote a line to ashmead and requested him to call on her immediately that day she dined with vizard and the ladies she sat at vizards right hand and he told her how proud and happy he was to see her there she blushed faintly but made no reply she retired soon after dinner all next day she expected ashmead he did not come she dined with vizard next day and retired to the drawingroom the piano was opened and she played one or two exquisite things and afterward tried her voice but only in scales and somewhat timidly for miss gale warned her she might lose it or spoil it if she strained the vocal chord while her whole system was weak next day ashmead came with apologies he had spent a day in the cathedral town on business he did not tell her how he had spent that day going about puffing her as the greatest singer of sacred music in the world and paving the way to her engagement at the next festival yet the singlehearted joseph had really raised that commercial superstructure upon the sentiments she had uttered on his first visit to vizard court ina now held a private conference with him i think said she i have heard you say you were once an actor i was madam and a very good one too cela va sans dire i never knew one that was not at all events you can disguise yourself anything madam from grandfather whitehead to a boy in a pinafore famous for my makeups i wish you to watch a certain house and not be recognized by a person who knows you well madam nothing is infra dig if done for you nothing is distasteful if done for you thank you my friend i have thought it well to put my instructions on paper ay that is the best way she handed him the instructions he read them and his eyes sparkled ah this is a commission i undertake with pleasure and ill execute it with zeal he left her soon after to carry out these instructions and that very evening he was in the wardrobe of the little theater rummaging out a suitable costume and also in close conference with the wigmaker next day vizard had his mothers sables taken out and aired and drove mademoiselle klosking into taddington in an open carriage fanny told her they were his mothers sables and none to compare with them in the country on returning she tried her voice to the harmonium in her own antechamber and found it was gaining strengthlike herself meantime zoe vizard met severne in the garden and told him she had written to lord uxmoor and he would never visit her again but she did not make light of the sacrifice this time she had sacrificed her own selfrespect as well as uxmoors and she was sullen and tearful he had to be very wary and patient or she would have parted with him too and fled from both of them to her brother uxmoors wounded pride would have been soothed could he have been present at the first interview of this pair he would have seen severne treated with a hauteur and a sort of savageness he himself was safe from safe in her unshaken esteem but the world is made for those who can keep their temper especially the female part of the world sad kind and loving but never irritable severne smoothed down and soothed and comforted the wounded girl and seeing her two or three times a dayfor she was completely mistress of her timegot her completely into his power again uxmoor did not reply she had made her selection love beckoned forward it was useless to look back love was omnipotent they both began to recover their good looks as if by magic and as severnes passion though wicked was earnest no poor bird was ever more completely entangled by birdlime than zoe was caught by edward severne their usual place of meeting was the shrubbery attached to somerville villa the trees being young made all the closer shade and the gravelwalk meandered and shut them out from view severne used to enter this shrubbery by a little gate leading from the meadow and wait under the trees till zoe came to him vizards advertisements alarmed him and he used to see the coast clear before he entered the shrubbery and also before he left it he was so particular in this that observing one day an old man doddering about with a basket he would not go in till he had taken a look at him he found it was an ancient whitehaired villager gathering mushrooms the old fellow was so stiff and his hand so trembling that it took him about a minute to gather a single fungus to give a reason for coming up to him severne said how old are you old man i be ninety measter next martinmasday only ninety said our adonis contemptuously you look a hundred and ninety he would have been less contemptuous had he known that the mushrooms were all toadstools and the village centenaire was mr joseph ashmead resuming his original arts and playing grandfather whitehead on the green grass chapter xxv mademoiselle klosking told vizard the time drew near when she must leave his hospitable house say a month hence said he she shook her head of course you will not stay to gratify me said he half sadly half bitterly but you will have to stay a week or two longer par ordonnance du medecin my physician is reconciled to my going we must all bow to necessity this was said too firmly to admit a reply the old house will seem very dark again whenever you do go said vizard plaintively it will soon be brightened by her who is its true and lasting light was the steady reply a day or two passed with nothing to record except that vizard hung about ina klosking and became if possible more enamored of her and more unwilling to part with her mr ashmead arrived one afternoon about three oclock and was more than an hour with her they conversed very earnestly and when he went miss gale found her agitated this will not do said she it will pass my friend said ina i will sleep she laid herself down and slept three hours before dinner she arose refreshed and dined with the little party and on retiring to the drawingroom she invited vizard to join them at his convenience he made it his convenience in ten minutes then she opened the piano played an introduction and electrified them all by singing the leading song in siebel she did not sing it so powerfully as in the theater she would not have done that even if she could but still she sung it out and nobly it seemed a miracle to hear such singing in a room vizard was in raptures they cooled suddenly when she reminded him what he had said that she must stay till she could sing siebels song i keep to the letter of the contract said she my friends this is my last night at vizard court please try and shake that resolution said vizard gravely to mesdemoiselles dover and gale they cannot said ina it is my destiny and yet said she after a pause i would not have you remember me by that flimsy thing let me sing you a song your mother loved let me be remembered in this house as a singer by that then she sung handels song what though i trace each herb and flower that decks the morning dew did i not own jehovahs power how vain were all i knew she sung it with amazing purity volume grandeur and power the lusters rang and shook the hearts were thrilled and the very souls of the hearers ravished she herself turned a little pale in singing it and the tears stood in her eyes the song and its interpretation were so far above what passes for music that they all felt compliments would be an impertinence their eyes and their long drawn breath paid the true homage to that great master rightly interpreteda very rare occurrence ah said she that was the hand could brandish goliaths spear and this is how you reconcile us to losing you said vizard you might stay at least till you had gone through my poor mothers collection ah i wish i could but i cannot i must not my fate forbids it fate and destiny said vizard stuff and nonsense we make our own destiny mine is to be eternally disappointed and happiness snatched out of my hands he had no sooner made this pretty speech than he was ashamed of it and stalked out of the room not to say any more unwise things this burst of spleen alarmed fanny dover there said she now you cannot go he is very angry ina klosking said she was sorry for that but he was too just a man to be angry with her long the day would come when he would approve her conduct her lip quivered a little as she said this and the water stood in her eyes and this was remembered and understood long after both by miss dover and rhoda gale when does your royal highness propose to start inquired rhoda gale very obsequiously and just a little bitterly tomorrow at halfpast nine oclock dear friend said ina then you will not go without me you will get the better of mr vizard because he is only a man but i am a woman and have a will as well as you if you make a journey tomorrow i go with you deny me and you shant go at all her eyes flashed defiance ina moved one step took rhodas little defiant head and kissed her cheek sweet physician and kind friend of course you shall go with me if you will and be a great blessing to me this reconciled miss gale to the proceedings she packed up a carpetbag and was up early making provisions of every sort for her patients journey air pillows soft warm coverings medicaments stimulants etc in a little bag slung across her shoulders thus furnished and equipped in a uniform suit of gray cloth and wideawake hat she cut a very sprightly and commanding figure but more like diana than hebe the klosking came down a pale juno in traveling costume and a quarter of an hour before the time a pairhorse fly was at the door and mr ashmead in the hall the ladies were both ready but vizard had not appeared this caused an uneasy discussion he must be very angry said fanny in a half whisper i cannot go while he is sighed la klosking there is a limit even to my courage mr harris said rhoda would you mind telling mr vizard well miss said harris softly i did step in and tell him which he told me to go to the devil missa hobservation i never knew him to make before this was not encouraging yet the klosking quietly inquired where he was in there maam said harris in his study mademoiselle klosking placed between two alternatives decided with her usual resolution she walked immediately to the door and tapped at it then scarcely waiting for an instant opened it and walked in with seeming firmness though her heart was beating rather high the people outside looked at one another i wonder whether he will tell her to go to the devil said fanny who was getting tired of being good no use said miss gale she doesnt know the road when la klosking entered the study vizard was seated disconsolate with two pictures before him his face was full of pain and la kloskings heart smote her she moved toward him hanging her head and said with inimitable sweetness and tenderness here is a culprit come to try and appease you there came a time that he could hardly think of these words and her penitent submissive manner with dry eyes but just then his black dog had bitten him and he said sullenly oh never mind me it was always so your sex have always made me smart forif flying from my house before you are half recovered gives you half the pleasure it gives me pain and mortification say no more about it ah why say it gives me pleasure my friend you cannot really think so i dont know what to think you ladies are all riddles then i must take you into my confidence and with some reluctance i own let you know why i leave this dear kind roof today vizards generosity took the alarm no said i will not extort your reasons it is a shame of me your bare will ought to be law in this house and what reasons could reconcile me to losing you so suddenly you are the joy of our eyes the delight of our ears the idol of all our hearts you will leave us and there will be darkness and gloom instead of sunshine and song well go but you cannot soften the blow with reasons mademoiselle klosking flushed and her bosom heaved for this was a strong man greatly moved with instinctive tact she saw the best way to bring him to his senses was to give him a good opening to retreat ah monsieur said she you are trop grand seigneur you entertain a poor wounded singer in a chamber few princes can equal you place everything at her disposal such a physician and nurse as no queen can command a choir to sing to her royal sables to keep the wind from her and ladies to wait on her and when you have brought her back to life you say to yourself she is a woman she will not be thoroughly content unless you tell her she is adorable so out of politeness you descend to the language of gallantry this was not needed i dispense with that kind of comfort i leave your house because it is my duty and leave it your grateful servant and true friend to my last hour she had opened the door and vizard could now escape his obstinacy and his heart would not let him do not fence with me said he leave that to others it is beneath you if you had been content to stay i would have been content to show my heart by halves but when you offer to leave me you draw from me an avowal i can no longer restrain and you must and shall listen to it when i saw you on the stage at homburg i admired you and loved you that very night but i knew from experience how seldom in women outward graces go with the virtues of the soul i distrusted my judgment i feared you and i fled you but our destiny brought you here and when i held you pale and wounded in my very arms my heart seemed to go out of my bosom oh no more no more pray cried mademoiselle klosking but the current of love was not to be stemmed since that terrible hour i have been in heaven watching your gradual and sure recovery but you have recovered only to abandon me and your hurry to leave me drives me to desperation no i cannot part with you you must not leave me either this day or any day give me your hand and stay here forever and be the queen of my heart and of my house for some time la klosking had lost her usual composure her bosom heaved tumultuously and her hands trembled but at this distinct proposal the whole woman changed she drew herself up with her pale cheek flushing and her eyes glittering what sir said she have you read me so ill do you not know i would rather be the meanest drudge that goes on her knees and scrubs your floors than be queen of your house as you call it ah jesu are all men alike then that he whom i have so revered whose mothers songs i have sung to him makes me a proposal dishonorable to me and to himself dishonorable cried vizard why what can any man offer to any woman more honorable than i offer you i offer you my heart and my hand and i say do not go my darling stay here forever and be my queen my goddess my wife your wife she stared wildly at him your wife am i dreaming or are you neither do you think i can be content with less than that ina i adore you she put her hand to her head i know not who is to blame for this said she and she trembled visibly ill take the blame said he gayly said ina very gravely you who do me the honor to offer me your name have you asked yourself seriously what has been the nature of my relation with edward severne no cried vizard violently and i do not mean to i see you despise him now and i have my eyes and my senses to guide me in choosing a wife i choose youif you will have me she listened then turned her moist eyes full upon him and said to him this is the greatest honor ever befell me i cannot take it not take it no but that is my misfortune do not be mortified you have no rival in my esteem what shall i say my friendat least i may call you that if i explain now i shall weep much and lose my strength what shall i do i thinkyes that will be bestyou shall go with me today to the end of the world something tells me you will know all and forgive me shall i take my bag you might take an evening dress and some linen very well i wont keep you a moment said he and went upstairs with great alacrity she went into the hall with her eyes bent on the ground and was immediately pinned by rhoda gale whose piercing eye and inquisitive finger on her pulse soon discovered that she had gone through a trying scene this is a bad beginning of an imprudent journey said she i have a great mind to countermand the carriage no no said ina i will sleep in the railway and recover myself the ladies now got into the carriage ashmead insisted on going upon the box and vizard soon appeared and took his seat opposite miss gale and mademoiselle klosking the latter whispered her doctress it would be wise of me not to speak much at present la gale communicated this to vizard and they drove along in dead silence but they were naturally curious to know where they were going so they held some communication with their eyes they very soon found they were going to taddington station then came a doubtwere they going up or down that was soon resolved mr ashmead had hired a saloon carriage for them with couches and conveniences they entered it and mademoiselle klosking said to miss gale it is necessary that i should sleep you shall said miss gale while she was arranging the pillows and things la klosking said to vizard we artists learn to sleep when we have work to do without it i should not be strong enough this day she said this in a halfapologetic tone as one anxious not to give him any shadow of offense she was asleep in five minutes and miss gale sat watching her at first but presently joined vizard at the other end and they whispered together said she what becomes of the theory that women have no strength of will there is mademoiselle je le veux in person when she wants to sleep she sleeps and look at you and medo you know where we are going no no more do i the motive power is that personification of divine repose there how beautiful she is with her sweet lips parted and her white teeth peeping and her upper and lower lashes wedded and how graceful she is a goddess said vizard i wish i had never seen her mark my words she will give me the sorest heart of all i hope not said rhoda very seriously ina slept sweetly for nearly two hours and all that time her friends could only guess where they were going at last the train stopped for the sixth time and ashmead opened the door this worthy who was entirely in command of the expedition collected the luggage including vizards bag and deposited it at the station he then introduced the party to a pairhorse fly and mounted the box when they stopped at bagley vizard suspected where they were going when he saw the direction the carriage took he knew it and turned very grave indeed he even regretted that he had put himself so blindly under the control of a woman he cast searching glances at mademoiselle klosking to try and discover what on earth she was going to do but her face was as impenetrable as marble still she never looked less likely to do anything rash or in bad taste quietness was the main characteristic of her face when not rippled over by a ravishing sweetness but he had never seen her look so great and lofty and resolute as she looked now a little stern too as one who had a great duty to do and was inflexible as iron when truly feminine features stiffen into marble like this beauty is indeed imperial and worthy of epic song it rises beyond the wing of prose my reader is too intelligent not to divine that she was steeling herself to a terrible interview with zoe vizardterrible mainly on account of the anguish she knew she must inflict but we can rarely carry out our plans exactly as we trace themunexpected circumstances derange them or expand them and i will so far anticipate as to say that in this case a most unexpected turn of events took la klosking by surprise whether she proved equal to the occasion these pages will show very soon chapter xxvi poikilus never left taddingtononly the swan more than once he was within sight of ashmead unobserved once indeed that gentleman who had a great respect for dignitaries saluted him for at that moment poikilus happened to be a sleek dignitary of the church of england poikilus when quite himself wore a mustache and was sallow and lean as a weasel but he shaved and stuffed and colored for the dean shovelhat portly walk and green spectacles did the rest grandfather whitehead saluted his reverence chuckled poikilus kept severne posted by letter and wire as to many things that happened outside vizard court but he could not divine the storm that was brewing inside ina kloskings room yet severne defended himself exactly as he would have done had he known all he and zoe spent elysian hours meeting twice a day in the shrubbery and making love as if they were the only two creatures in the world but it was blind elysium only to one of themseverne was uneasy and alarmed the whole time his sagacity showed him it could not last and there was always a creeping terror on him would not uxmoor cause inquiries would he not be sure to tell vizard would not vizard come there to look after zoe or order her back to vizard court would not the klosking get well and interfere once more he passed the time between heaven and hell whenever he was not under the immediate spell of zoes presence a sort of vague terror was always on him he looked all round him wherever he went this terror and his passion which was now as violent as it was wicked soon drove him to conceive desperate measures but by masterly selfgovernment he kept them two days to his own bosom he felt it was too soon to raise a fresh and painful discussion with zoe he must let her drink unmixed delight and get a taste for it and then show her on what conditions alone it could be had forever it was on the third day after their reconciliation she found him seated on a bench in the shrubbery lost in thought and looking very dejected she was close to him before he noticed then he sprung up stared at her and began to kiss her hands violently and even her very dress it is you said he once more yes dear said zoe tenderly did you think i would not come i did not know whether you could come i feel that my happiness cannot last long and zoe dear i have had a dream i dreamed we were taken prisoners and carried to vizard court and on the steps stood vizard and mademoiselle klosking arminarm i believe they were man and wife and you were taken out and led weeping into the house and i was left there raging with agony and then that lady put out her finger in a commanding way and i was whirled away into utter darkness and i heard you moan and i fought and dashed my head against the carriage and i felt my heart burst and my whole body filled with some cold liquid and i went to sleep and i heard a voice say it is all over his trouble is ended i was dead this narrative and his deep dejection set zoes tears flowing poor edward she sighed i would not survive you but cheer up dear it was only a dream we are not slaves i am not dependent on any one how can we be parted we shall unless we use our opportunity and make it impossible to part us zoe do not slight my alarm and my misgivings such warnings are prophetic for heavens sake make one sacrifice more and let us place our happiness beyond the reach of man only tell me how there is but one waymarriage zoe blushed high and panted a little but said nothing ah said he piteously i ask too much how can you say that said zoe of course i shall marry you dearest what do you think i could do what i have done for anybody but my husband that is to be i was mad to think otherwise said he but i am in low spirits and full of misgivings oh the comfort the bliss the peace of mind the joy if you would see our hazardous condition and make all safe by marrying me tomorrow tomorrow why edward are you mad how can we be married so long as my brother is so prejudiced against you if we wait his consent we are parted forever he would forgive us after itthat is certain but he would never consent he is too much under the influence of hisof mademoiselle klosking indeed i cannot hope he will consent beforehand sighed zoe but i have not the courage to defy him and if i had we could not marry all in a moment like that we should have to be cried in church that is quite gone out among ladies and gentlemen not in our family besides even a special license takes time i suppose oh no i could not be married in a clandestine discreditable way i am a vizardplease remember that would you degrade the woman you honor with your choice and her red cheeks and flashing eyes warned him to desist god forbid said he if that is the alternative i consent to lose herand lose her i shall he then affected to dismiss the subject and said let me enjoy the hours that are left me much misery or much bliss can be condensed in a few days i will enjoy the blessed time and we will wait for the chapter of accidents that is sure to part us then he acted reckless happiness and broke down at last she cried but showed no sign of yielding her pride and selfrespect were roused and on their defense the next day he came to her quietly sad he seemed languid and listless and to care for nothing he was artful enough to tell her on the information of poikilus that vizard had hired the cathedral choir three times a week to sing to his inamorata and that he had driven her about taddington dressed like a duchess in a whole suit of sables at that word the girl turned pale he observed and continued and it seems these sables are known throughout the county there were several carriages in the town and my informant heard a lady say they were mrs vizards sables worth five hundred guineasa russian princess gave them her it is quite true said zoe his mothers sables is it possible they all say he is caught at last and this is to be the next mrs vizard they may well say so if he parades her in his mothers sables said zoe and could not conceal her jealousy and her indignation i never dared so much as ask his permission to wear them said she and if you had he would have told you the relics of a saint were not to be played with that is just what he would have said i do believe the female heart was stung ah well said severne i am sure i should not grudge him his happiness if you would see things as he does and be as brave as he is thank you said zoe women cannot defy the world as men do then passionately why do you torment me so why do you urge me so a poor girl all alone and far from advice what on earth would you have me do secure us against another separation unite us in bliss forever and so i would if i could you know i would but it is impossible no zoe it is easy there are two ways we can reach scotland in eight hours and there by a simple writing and declaration before witnesses we are man and wife a gretna green marriage it is just as much a legal marriage as if a bishop married us at st pauls however we could follow it up immediately by marriage in a church either in scotland or the north of england but there is another way we can be married at bagley any day before the registrar is that a marriagea real marriage as real as legal as binding as a wedding in st pauls nobody in this county has ever been married so i should blush to be seen about after it our first happy year would not be passed in this country we should go abroad for six months ay fly from shame on our return we should be received with open arms by my own people in huntingdonshire until your people came round as they always do he then showed her a letter in which his pearl of a cousin said they would receive his wife with open arms and make her as happy as they could uncle tom was coming home from india with two hundred thousand pounds he was a confirmed old bachelor and edward his favorite etc zoe faltered a little so then he pressed her hard with love and entreaties and promises and even hysterical tears then she began to crya sure sign of yielding give me time she saidgive me time he groaned and said there was no time to lose otherwise he never would have urged her so for all that she could not be drawn to a decision she must think over such a step next morning at the usual time he came to know his fate but she did not appear he waited an hour for her she did not come he began to rage and storm and curse his folly for driving her so hard at last she came and found him pale with anxiety and looking utterly miserable she told him she had passed a sleepless night and her head had ached so in the morning she could not move my poor darling said he and i am the cause say no more about it dear one i see you do not love me as i love you and i forgive you she smiled sadly at that for she was surer of her own love than his zoe had passed a night of torment and vacillation and but for her brother having paraded mademoiselle klosking in his mothers sables she would i think have held out but this turned her a little against her brother and as he was the main obstacle to her union with severne love and pity conquered yet still honor and pride had their say edward said she i love you with all my heart and share your fears that accident may separate us i will let you decide for both of us but before you decide be warned of one thing i am a girl no longer but a woman who has been distracted with many passions if any slur rests on my fair name deeply as i love you now i shall abhor you then he turned pale for her eye flashed dismay into his craven soul he said nothing and she continued if you insist on this hasty halfclandestine marriage then i consent to thisi will go with you before the registrar and i shall come back here directly next morning early we will start for scotland and be married that other way before witnesses then your fears will be at an end for you believe in these marriages only as i do notfor i look on these legal marriages merely as solemn betrothalsi shall be miss zoe vizard and expect you to treat me so until i have been married in a church like a lady of course you shall said he and overwhelmed her with expressions of gratitude respect and affection this soothed her troubled mind and she let him take her hand and pour his honeyed flatteries into her ear as he walked her slowly up and down she could hardly tear herself away from the soft pressure of his hand and the fascination of his tongue and she left him more madly in love with him than ever and ready to face anything but dishonor for him she was to come out at twelve oclock and walk into bagley with him to betroth herself to him as she chose to consider it before the stipendiary magistrate who married couples in that way of the two marriages she had consented to merely as preliminaries to a real marriage zoe despised this the most for the scotch marriage was at all events ancient and respectable lovers had been driven to it again and again she was behind her time and severne thought her courage had failed her after all but no at halfpast twelve she came out and walked briskly toward bagley he was behind her and followed her she took his arm nervously let me feel you all the way she said to give me courage so they walked arminarm and as they went his courage secretly wavered hers rose at every step about half a mile from the town they met a carriage and pair at sight of them a gentleman on the box tapped at the glass window and said hurriedly here they are together mademoiselle klosking said stop the carriage then pausing a little mr vizardon your word of honor no violence the carriage was drawn up ashmead opened the door in a trice and la klosking followed by vizard stepped out and stood like a statue before edward severne and zoe vizard severne dropped her arm directly and was panicstricken zoe uttered a little scream at the sight of vizard but the next moment took fire at her rivals audacity and stepped boldly before her lover with flashing eyes and expanded nostrils that literally breathed defiance chapter xxvii you infernal scoundrel roared vizard and took a stride toward severne no violence said ina klosking sternly it will be an insult to this lady and me very well then said vizard grimly i must wait till i catch him alone meantime permit me to speak sir said ina believe me i have a better right than even you then pray ask my sister why i find her on that villains arm i should not answer her said zoe haughtily but my brother i will harrington all this vulgar abuse confirms me in my choice i take his arm because i have accepted his hand i am going into bagley with him to become his wife this announcement took away vizards breath for a moment and ina klosking put in her word you cannot do that pray he warned he is leading you to infamy infamy what because he cannot give me a suit of sables infamy because we prefer virtuous poverty to vice and wealth no young lady said ina coloring faintly at the taunt but because you could only be his paramour not his wife he is married already at these words spoken with that power ina klosking could always command zoe vizard turned ashy pale but she fought on bravely married it is false to whom to me i thought so now i know it is not true he left you months before we ever knew him look at him he does not say it is false zoe turned on severne and at his face her own heart quaked are you married to this lady she asked and her eyes dilated to their full size searched his every feature not that i know of said he impudently is that the serious answer you expected miss vizard said ina keenly then to severne you are unwise to insult the woman on whom from this day you must depend for bread miss vizard to you i speak and not to this shameless man for your mothers sake do me justice i have loved him dearly but now i abhor him would i could break the tie that binds us and give him to you or to any lady who would have him but i cannot and shall i hold my tongue and let you be ruined and dishonored i am an older woman than you and bound by gratitude to all your house dear lady i have taxed my strength to save you i feel that strength waning pray read this paper and consent to save yourself i will read it said rhoda gale interfering i know german it is an authorized duplicate certifying the marriage of edward severne of willingham in huntingdonshire england to ina ferris daughter of walter ferris and eva klosking of zutzig in denmark the marriage was solemnized at berlin and here are the signatures of several witnesses eva klosking fraulein graafe zug the capellmeister vicomte meurice french attache count hompesch bavarian plenipotentiary herr formes ina explained in a voice that was now feeble i was a public character my marriage was public not like the clandestine union which is all he dared offer to this wellborn lady the bavarian and french ministers are both in london said vizard eagerly we can easily learn if these signatures are forged like your acceptances but if one shadow of doubt remained severne now removed it he uttered a scream of agony and fled as if the demons of remorse and despair were spurring him with redhot rowels there you little idiot roared vizard does that open you eyes oh mr vizard said ina reproachfully for pitys sake think only of her youth and what she has to suffer i can do no more for her i feelsofaint ashmead and rhoda supported her into the carriage vizard touched to the heart by inas appeal held out his eloquent arms to his stricken sister and she tottered to him and clung to him all limp and broken and wishing she could sink out of the sight of all mankind he put his strong arm round her and though his own heart was desolate and broken he supported that broken flower of womanhood and half led half lifted her on until he laid her on a sofa in somerville villa then for the first time he spoke to her we are both desolate now my child let us love one another i will be ten times tenderer to you than i ever have been she gave a great sob but she was past speaking ina klosking miss gale and ashmead returned in the carriage to bagley half a mile out of the town they found a man lying on the pathway with his hat off and white as a sheet it was edward severne he had run till he dropped ashmead got down and examined him he came back to the carriage door looking white enough himself it is all over said he the man is dead miss gale was out in a moment and examined him no said she the heart does not beat perceptibly but he breathes it is another of those seizures help me get him into the carriage this was done and the driver ordered to go a foots pace the stimulants miss gale had brought for ina klosking were now applied to revive this malefactor and both ladies actually ministered to him with compassionate faces he was a villain but he was superlatively handsome and a feather might turn the scale of life or death the seizure though really appalling to look at did not last long he revived a little in the carriage and was taken still insensible but breathing hard into a room in the railway hotel when he was out of danger miss gale felt ina kloskings pulse and insisted on her going to taddington by the next train and leaving severne to the care of mr ashmead ina who in truth was just then most unfit for any more trials feebly consented but not until she had given ashmead some important instructions respecting her malefactor and supplied him with funds miss gale also instructed ashmead how to proceed in case of a relapse and provided him with materials the ladies took a train which arrived soon after and being so fortunate as to get a ladys carriage all to themselves they sat intertwined and rocking together and ina klosking found relief at last in a copious flow of tears rhoda got her to hillstoke cooked for her nursed her lighted fires aired her bed and these two friends slept together in each others arms ashmead had a hard time of it with severne he managed pretty well with him at first because he stupefied him with brandy before he had come to his senses and in that state got him into the next train but as the fumes wore off and severne realized his villainy his defeat and his abject condition between the two women he had wronged he suddenly uttered a yell and made a spring at the window ashmead caught him by his calves and dragged him so powerfully down that his face struck the floor hard and his nose bled profusely the hemorrhage and the blow quieted him for a time and then ashmead gave him more brandy and got him to the swan in a halflethargic lull this faithful agent and man of all work took a private sitting room with a double bedded room adjoining it and ordered a hot supper with champagne and madeira severne lay on a sofa moaning the waiter stared trouble whispered ashmead confidentially take no notice supper as quick as possible byandby severne started up and began to rave and tear about the room cursing his hard fate and ended in a kind of hysterical fit ashmead being provided by miss gale with salts and aromatic vinegar etc applied them and ended by dashing a tumbler of water right into his face which did him more good than chemistry then he tried to awaken manhood in the fellow what are you howling about said he why you are the only sinner and you are the least sufferer come drop sniveling and eat a bit trouble dont do on an empty stomach severne said he would try but begged the waiter might not be allowed to stare at a brokenhearted man broken fiddlesticks said honest joe severne tried to eat but could not but he could drink and said so ashmead gave him champagne in tumblers and that on his empty stomach set him raving and saying life was hell to him now but presently he fell to weeping bitterly in which condition ashmead forced him to bed and there he slept heavily in the morning ashmead sat by his bedside and tried to bring him to reason now look here said he you are a lucky fellow if you will only see it you have escaped bigamy and a jail and as a reward for your good conduct to your wife and the many virtues you have exhibited in a short space of time i am instructed by that lady to pay you twenty pounds every saturday at twelve oclock it is only a thousand a year but dont you be downhearted i conclude she will raise your salary as you advance you must forge her name to a heavy check rob a church and abduct a schoolgirl or twomisses in their teens and wards of chancery preferredand she will make it thirty no doubt and joe looked very sour that for her twenty pounds a week cried this injured man she owes me two thousand pounds and more she has been my enemy and her own the foolto go and peach she had only to hold her tongue and be mrs vizard and then she would have had a rich husband that adores her and i should have had my darling beautiful zoe the only woman i ever loved or ever shall oh said ashmead then you expected your wife to commit bigamy and so make it smooth to you of course i did was the worthy severne s reply and so she would if she had had a grain of sense see what a contrast now we are all unhappyherself includedand it is all her doing well young man said ashmead drawing a long breath didnt i tell you you are a lucky fellow you have got twenty pounds a week and that blest boon a conscience void of offense you are a happy man heres a strong cup of tea for you just you drink it and then get up and take the train to the little village there kindred spirits and fresh delights await you you are not to adorn barfordshire any longer that is the order well ill go to londonbut not without you me what do you want of me you are a good fellow and the only friend i have left but for you i should be dead or mad you have pulled me through through the window i did lord forgive me for it said joseph well ill go up to town with you but i cant be always tied to your tail i havent got twenty pounds a week to be sure he added dryly i havent earned it that is one comfort he telegraphed hillstoke and took severne up to london there the bohemian very soon found he could live and even derive some little enjoyment from his viceswithout joseph ashmead he visited him punctually every saturday and conversed delightfully if he came any other day it was sure to be for an advance he never got it chapter xxviii fanny dover was sent for directly to somerville villa and three days after the distressing scene i have endeavored to describe vizard brought his wrecked sister home her condition was pitiable and the moment he reached vizard court he mounted his horse and rode to hillstoke to bring miss gale down to her there he found ina klosking with her boxes at the door waiting for the fly that was to take her away it was a sad interview he thanked her deeply for her noble conduct to his sister and then he could not help speaking of his own disappointment mademoiselle klosking on this occasion was simple sad and even tender within prudent limits she treated this as a parting forever and therefore made no secret of her esteem for him but said she i hope one day to hear you have found a partner worthy of you as for me who am tied for life to one i despise and can never love again i shall seek my consolation in music and please god in charitable actions he kissed her hand at parting and gave her a long long look of miserable regret that tried her composure hard and often recurred to her memory she went up to london took a small suburban house led a secluded life and devoted herself to her art making a particular study now of sacred music she collected volumes of it and did not disdain to buy it at bookstalls or wherever she could find it ashmead worked for her and she made her first appearance in a new oratorio her songs proved a principal feature in the performance events did not stand still in barfordshire but they were tame compared with those i have lately related and must be dispatched in fewer words aunt maitland recovered unexpectedly from a severe illness and was a softened woman she sent fanny off to keep zoe company that poor girl had a bitter time and gave doctress gale great anxiety she had no brain fever but seemed quietly insensibly sinking into her grave no appetite and indeed was threatened with atrophy at one time but she was so surrounded with lovingkindness that her shame diminished her pride rose and at last her agony was blunted and only a pensive languor remained to show that she had been crushed and could not be again the bright proud highspirited beauty of barfordshire for many months she never mentioned either edward severne ina klosking or lord uxmoor it was a long time before she went outside the gates of her own park she seemed to hate the outer world her first visit was to miss gale that young lady was now very happy she had her mother with her mrs gale had defeated the tricky executor and had come to england with a tidy little capital saved out of the fire by her sagacity and spirit mrs gales character has been partly revealed by her daughter i have only to add she was a homely wellread woman of few words but those fewgrapeshot exampleshe said to zoe young lady excuse an old womans freedom who might be your mother the troubles of young folk have a deal of self in them more than you could believe now just you try something to take you out of self and you will be another creature ah sighed zoe would to heaven i could oh said mrs gale anybody with money can do it and the world so full of real trouble now my girl tells me you are kind to the poor why not do something like rhoda is doing for this lord she is overseer or goodness knows what to rhoda defiantly viceroy you have money and your brother will not refuse you a bit o land why not build some of these newfangled cottages with fancy gardens and dwarf palaces for a cow and a pig rhoda child if i was a poor woman i could graze a cow in the lanes hereabouts and feed a pig in the woods now you do that for the poor miss vizard and dont let my girl think for you breed your own ideas that will divert you from self my dear and you will begin to find ittherejust as if a black cloud was clearing away from your mind and letting your heart warm again zoe caught at the idea and that very day asked vizard timidly whether he would let her have some land to build a model cottage or two on will it be believed that the goodnatured vizard made a wry face what two proprietors in islip for a moment or two he was all squire but soon the brother conquered well said he i cant give you a feesimple i must think of my heirs but i will hold a court and grant you a copyhold or ill give you a ninetynine years lease at a peppercorn theres a slip of three acres on the edge of the green you shall amuse yourself with that he made it over to her directly for a century at ten shillings a year and as he was her surviving trustee he let her draw in advance on her ten thousand pounds mapping out the ground with rhoda settling the gardens and the miniature pastures and planning the little houses and outhouses and talking a great deal compared with what she transacted proved really a certain antidote to that lethargy of woe which oppressed her and here for a time i must leave her returning slowly to health of body and some tranquillity of mind but still subject to fits of shame and gnawed by bitter regrets chapter xxix the reputation mademoiselle klosking gained in the new oratorio aided by ashmeads exertions launched her in a walk of art that accorded with her sentiments she sung in the oratorio whenever it could be performed and also sung select songs from it and other sacred songs at concerts she was engaged at a musical festival in the very cathedral town whose choir had been so consoling to her she entered with great zeal into this engagement and finding there was a general desire to introduce the leading choristerboy to the public in a duet she surprised them all by offering to sing the second part with him if he would rehearse it carefully with her at her lodgings he was only too glad as might be supposed she found he had a lovely voice but little physical culture he read correctly but did not even know the nature of the vocal instrument and its construction which is that of a bagpipe she taught him how to keep his lungs full in singing yet not to gasp and by this simple means enabled him to sing with more than twice the power he had ever exercised yet she also taught him the swell a figure of music he knew literally nothing about when after singing a great solo to salvos of applause mademoiselle klosking took the second part with this urchin the citizens and all the musical people who haunt a cathedral were on the tiptoe of expectation the boy amazed them and the rich contralto that supported him and rose and swelled with him in ravishing harmony enchanted them the vast improvement in the boys style did not escape the hundreds of persons who knew him and this duet gave la klosking a great personal popularity her last song by her own choice was what though i trace handel and the majestic volume that rang through the echoing vault showed with what a generous spirit she had subdued that magnificent organ not to crush her juvenile partner in the preceding duet among the persons present was harrington vizard he had come there against his judgment but he could not help it he had been cultivating a dull tranquillity and was even beginning his old game of railing on women as the great disturbers of male peace at the sight of her and the sound of her first notes away went his tranquillity and he loved her as ardently as ever but when she sung his mothers favorite and the very roof rang and three thousand souls were thrilled and lifted to heaven by that pure and noble strain the rapture could not pass away from this one heart while the ear ached at the cessation of her voice the heart also ached and pined and yearned he ceased to resist from that day he followed her about to her public performances all over the midland counties and she soon became aware of his presence she said nothing till ashmead drew her attention then being compelled to notice it she said it was a great pity surely he must have more important duties at home ashmead wanted to recognize him and put him into the best place vacant but la klosking said no i will be more his friend than to lend him the least encouragement at the end of that tour she returned to london while she was there in her little suburban house she received a visit from mr edward severne he came to throw himself at her feet and beg forgiveness she said she would try and forgive him he then implored her to forget the past she told him that was beyond her power he persisted and told her he had come to his senses all his misconduct now seemed a hideous dream and he found he had never really loved any one but her so then he entreated her to try him once more to give him back the treasure of her love she listened to him like a woman of marble love where i despise said she never the day has gone by when these words can move me come to me for the means of enjoying yourselfgambling drinking and your other vicesand i shall indulge you but do not profane the name of love i forbid you ever to enter my door on that errand i presume you want money there is a hundred pounds take it and keep out of my sight till you have wasted it he dashed the notes proudly down she turned her back on him and glided into another room when she returned he was gone and the hundred pounds had managed to accompany him he went straight from her to ashmead and talked big he would sue for restitution of conjugal rights dont do that for my sake said ashamed she will fly the country like a bird and live in some village on bread and milk oh i would not do you an ill turn for the world said the master of arts you have been a kind friend to me you saved my life it is imbittered by remorse and recollections of the happiness i have thrown away and the heart i have wronged no matter this visit disturbed la klosking and disposed her to leave london she listened to a brilliant offer that was made her through ashmead by the manager of the italian opera who was organizing a provincial tour the tour was well advertised in advance and the company opened to a grand house at birmingham mademoiselle klosking had not been long on the stage when she discovered her discarded husband in the stalls looking the perfection of youthful beauty the next minute she saw vizard in a private box mr severne applauded her loudly and flung her a bouquet mr vizard fixed his eyes on her beaming with admiration but made no public demonstration the same incident repeated itself every night she sung and at every town at last she spoke about it to ashmead in the vague suggestive way her sex excels in i presume you have observed the people in front yes madam two in particular could you not advise him to desist which of em madam mr vizard of course he is losing his time and wasting sentiments it is cruel should be wasted ashmead said he dared not take any liberty with mr vizard so the thing went on severne made acquaintance with the manager and obtained the entree behind the scenes he brought his wife a bouquet every night and presented it to her with such reverence and grace that she was obliged to take it and courtesy or seem rude to the people about then she wrote to miss gale and begged her to come if she could miss gale who had all this time been writing her loveletters twice a week immediately appointed her mother viceroy and went to her friend ina klosking explained the situation to her with a certain slight timidity and confusion not usual to her and said now dear you have more courage than the rest of us and i know he has a great respect for you and indeed miss dover told me he would quite obey you would it not be the act of a friend to advise him to cease this unhappywhat good can come of it he neglects his own duties and disturbs me in mine i sometimes ask myself would it not be kinder of me to give up my business or practice it elsewheregermany or even italy does he call on you no does he write to you oh no i wish he would because then i should be able to reply like a true friend and send him away consider dear it is not like a nobody dangling after a public singer that is common enough we are all run after by idle men even signorina zubetta who has not much voice nor appearance and speaks a genoese patois when she is not delivering a libretto but for a gentleman of position with a heart of gold and the soul of an emperor that he should waste his time and his feelings so on a woman who can never be anything to him it is pitiable well but after all it is his business and he is not a child besides remember he is really very fond of music if i were you id look another way and take no notice but i cannot ah and why not pray because he always takes a box on my left hand two from the stage i cant think how he gets it at all the theaters and then he fixes his eyes on me so i cannot help stealing a look he never applauds nor throws me bouquets he looks oh you cannot conceive how he looks and the strange effect it is beginning to produce on me he mesmerizes you i know not but it is a growing fascination oh my dear physician interfere if it goes on we shall be more wretched than ever then she enveloped rhoda in her arms and rested a hot cheek against hers i see said rhoda you are afraid he will make you love him i hope not but artists are impressionable and being looked at so by one i esteem night after night when my nerves are strungcela magace and she gave a shiver and then was a little hysterical and that was very unlike her rhoda kissed her and said resolutely she would stop it not unkindly oh no you will not tell him it is offensive to me no pray do not give him unnecessary pain no he is not to be mortified no i shall miss him sadly shall you naturally especially at each new place only conceive one is always anxious on the stage and it is one thing to come before a public all strangers and nearly all poor judges it is another to see all ready for your first note a noble face bright with intelligence and admirationthe face of a friend often that one face is the only one i allow myself to see it hides the whole public then dont you be silly and send it away ill tell you the one fault of your character you think too much of other people and too little of yourself now that is contrary to the scheme of nature we are sent into the world to take care of number one what said ina are we to be all selfindulgence is there to be no principle no womanly prudence foresight discretion no i feel the sacrifice but no power shall hinder me from making it if you cannot persuade him ill do like other singers i will be ill and quit the company dont do that said rhoda now you have put on your iron look it is no use arguingi know that to my cost therei will talk to him only dont hurry me let me take my opportunity this being understood ina would not part with her for the present but took her to the theater she dismissed her dresser at rhodas request and rhoda filled that office so they could talk freely rhoda had never been behind the scenes of a theater before and she went prying about ignoring the music for she was almost earless presently whom should she encounter but edward severne she started and looked at him like a basilisk he removed his hat and drew back a step with a great air of respect and humility she was shocked and indignant with ina for letting him be about her she followed her off the stage into her dressing room and took her to task i have seen mr severne here he comes every night and you allow him it is the manager but he would not admit him if you objected i am afraid to do that why we should have an esclandre i find he has had so much consideration for me as to tell no one our relation and as he has never spoken to me i do the most prudent thing i can and take no notice should he attempt to intrude himself on me then it will be time to have him stopped in the hall and i shall do it coute que coute ah my dear friend mine is a difficult and trying position after a very long wait ina went down and sung her principal song with the usual bravas and thunders of applause she was called on twice and as she retired severne stepped forward and with a low obsequious bow handed her a beautiful bouquet she took it with a stately courtesy but never looked nor smiled rhoda saw that and wondered she thought to herself that is carrying politeness a long way to be sure she is half a foreigner having done his nightly homage severne left the theater and soon afterward the performance concluded and ina took her friend home ashmead was in the hall to show his patroness to her carriagea duty he never failed in rhoda shook hands with him and he said delighted to see you here miss you will be a great comfort to her the two friends communed till two oclock in the morning but the limits of my tale forbid me to repeat what passed suffice it to say that rhoda was fairly puzzled by the situation but having a great regard for vizard saw clearly enough that he ought to be sent back to islip she thought that perhaps the very sight of her would wound his pride and finding his mania discovered by a third person he would go of his own accord so she called on him my lord received her with friendly composure and all his talk was about islip he did not condescend to explain his presence at carlisle he knew that qui sexcuse saccuse and left her to remonstrate she had hardly courage for that and hoped it might be unnecessary she told ina what she had done but her visit was futile at night there was vizard in his box next day the company opened in manchester vizard was in his box thereseverne in front till inas principal song then he came round and presented his bouquet but this time he came up to rhoda gale and asked her whether a penitent man might pay his respects to her in the morning she said she believed there were very few penitents in the world i know one said he well i dont then said the virago but you can come if you are not afraid of course ina klosking knew of this appointment two minutes after it was made she merely said do not let him talk you over he is not so likely to talk me over as you said rhoda you are mistaken was inas reply i am the one person he will never deceive again rhoda gale received his visit he did not beat about the bush nor fence at all he declared at once what he came for he said at the first sight of you whom i have been so ungrateful to i could not speak but now i throw myself on your forgiveness i think you must have seen that my ingratitude has never sat light on me i have seen that you were terribly afraid of me said she i dare say i was but i am not afraid of you now and here on my knees i implore you to forgive my baseness my ingratitude oh miss gale you dont know what it is to be madly in love one has no principle no right feeling against a real passion and i was madly in love with her it was through fear of losing her i disowned my physician my benefactress who had saved my life miserable wretch it was through fear of losing her that i behaved like a ruffian to my angel wife and would have committed bigamy and been a felon what was all this but madness you who are so wise will you not forgive me a crime that downright insanity was the cause of humph if i understand right you wish me to forgive you for looking in my face and saying to the woman who had saved your life i dont know you yesif you can no now you put it in plain words i see it is not to be forgiven you are mistaken it was like a stab to my heart and i cried bitterly over it then i deserve to be hanged that is all but on consideration i believe it is as much your nature to be wicked as it is my angel inas to be good so i forgive you that one thing you charming villain she held out her hand to him in proof of her good faith he threw himself on his knees directly and kissed and mumbled her hand and bedewed it with hysterical tears oh dont do that said she or im bound to give you a good kick i hate she men give me a moment said he and i will be a man again he sat with his face in his hands gulping a little come said she cocking her head like a keen jackdaw now let us have the real object of your visit no no said he inadvertentlyanother time will do for that i am content with your forgiveness now i can wait what for can you ask do you consider this a happy state of things certainly not but it cant be helped and we have to thank you for it it could be helped in time if you would persuade her to take the first step what step not to disown her husband to let him at least be her friendher penitent humble friend we are man and wife if i were to say so publicly she would admit it in this respect at least i have been generous will she not be generous too what harm could it do her if we lived under the same roof and i took her to the theater and fetched her home and did little friendly offices for her and so got the thin edge of the wedge in eh mr severne i decline all interference in a matter so delicate and in favor of a person who would use her as ill as ever if he once succeeded in recovering her affections so then she dismissed him peremptorily but true to vizards interest she called on him again and after a few preliminaries let him know that severne was every night behind the scenes a spasm crossed his face i am quite aware of that said he but he is never admitted into her house how do you know he is under constant surveillance spies no thieftakers all from scotland yard and love brings men down to this what is it for when i am sure of your cooperation i will let you know my hopes he doubts my friendship said rhoda sorrowfully no only your discretion i will be discreet well then sooner or later he is sure to form some improper connection or other and then i hope you will aid me in persuading her to divorce him that is not so easy in this country it is not like our western states where the saying is they give you five minutes at a railway station for divorce you forget she is a german protestant and the marriage was in that country it will be easy enough very well dismiss it from your mind she will never come before the public in that way nothing you nor i could urge would induce her vizard replied doggedly i will never despair so long as she keeps him out of her house rhoda told ina klosking this and said now it is in your own hands you have only to let your charming villain into your house and mr vizard will return to islip ina klosking buried her face in her hands and thought at night vizard in his box as usual severne behind the scenes with his bouquet but this night he stayed for the ballet to see a french danseuse who had joined them he was acquainted with her before and had a sprightly conversation with her in other words he renewed an old flirtation the next opera night all went as usual vizard in the box looking sadder than usual rhodas good sense had not been entirely wasted severne with his bouquet and his grave humility until the play ended and la klosking passed out into the hall her back was hardly turned when mademoiselle lafontaine dressed for the ballet in a most spicy costume danced up to her old friend and slapped his face very softly with a rose then sprung away and stood on her defense ill have that rose cried severne nenni and a kiss into the bargain jamais cest ce que nous verrons he chased her she uttered a feigned ah and darted away he followed her she crossed the scene at the back where it was dark bounded over an open trap which she saw just in time but severne not seeing it because she was between him and it fell through it and striking the mazarine fell into the cellar fifteen feet below the stage the screams of the dancers soon brought a crowd round the trap and reached mademoiselle klosking just as she was going out to her carriage there she cried another accident and she came back making sure it was some poor carpenter come to grief as usual on such occasions her purse was always ready they brought severne up sensible but moaning and bleeding at the temple and looking all streaky about the face they were going to take him to the infirmary but mademoiselle klosking with a face of angelic pity said no he bleeds he bleeds he must go to my house they stared a little but it takes a good deal to astonish people in a theater severne was carried out his head hastily bandaged and he was lifted into la kloskings carriage one of the people of the theater was directed to go on the box and la klosking and ashmead supported him and he was taken to her lodgings she directed him to be laid on a couch and a physician sent for miss gale not having yet returned from liverpool whither she had gone to attend a lecture ashmead went for the physician but almost at the door he met miss gale and mr vizard miss said he you are wanted there has been an accident mr severne has fallen through a trap and into the cellar no bones broken not he he has only broken his head and that will cost her a broken heart where is he where i hoped never to see him again what in her house said rhoda and hurried off at once mr ashmead said vizard a word with you by all means sir said ashmead as we go for the doctor dr menteith has a great name he lives close by your hotel sir as they went vizard asked him what he meant by saying this accident would cost her a broken heart why sir said ashmead he is on his good behavior to get back has been for months begging and praying just to be let live under the same roof she has always refused but some fellows have such luck i dont say he fell down a trap on purpose but he has done it and no broken bones but plenty of blood that is the very thing to overcome a womans feelings and she is not proof against pity he will have her again why she is his nurse now and see how that will work we have a weeks more business here and by bad luck a dead fortnight all along of dublin falling through unexpectedly he is as artful as old nick he will spin out that broken head of his and make it last all the three weeks and she will nurse him and he will be weak and grateful and cry and beg her pardon six times a day and she is only a woman after all and they are man and wife when all is done the road is beaten they will run upon it again till his time is up to play the rogue as bad as ever you torture me said vizard i am afraid i do sir but i feel it my duty mr vizard you are a noble gentleman and i am only what you see but the humblest folk will have their likes and dislikes and i have a great respect for you sir i cant tell you the mixture of things i feel when i see you in the same box every night of course i am her agent and the house would not be complete without you but as a man i am sorry especially now that she has let him into her house take a humble friends advice sir and cut it dont you come between any woman and her husband especially a public lady she will never be more to you than she is she is a good woman and he must keep gaining ground he has got the pull rouse all your pride sir and your manhood and you have got plenty of both and cut it dont look right nor left but cut itand forgive my presumption vizard was greatly moved give me your hand he said you are a worthy man ill act on your advice and never forget what i owe you stick to me like a leech and see me off by the next train for i am going to tear my heart out of my bosom luckily there was a train in half an hour and ashmead saw him off then went to supper he did not return to inas lodgings he did not want to see severne nursed he liked the fellow too but he saw through him clean and he worshiped ina klosking chapter xxx at one oclock next day ashmead received a note from mademoiselle klosking saying arrange with mr xto close my tour with manchester pay the fortnight if required she was with the company at a months notice on either side you must understand instead of going to the manager he went at once in utter dismay to mademoiselle klosking and there learned in substance what i must now briefly relate miss gale found edward severne deposited on a sofa ina was on her knees by his side sponging his bleeding temple with looks of gentle pity strange to say the wound was in the same place as his wifes but more contused and no large vein was divided miss gale soon stanched that she asked him where his pain was he said it was in his head and his back and he cast a haggard anxious look on her take my arm said she now stand up he tried but could not and said his legs were benumbed miss gale looked grave lay him on my bed said la klosking that is better than these hard couches you are right said miss gale ring for the servants he must be moved gently he was carried in and set upon the edge of the bed and his coat and waistcoat taken off then he was laid gently down on the bed and covered with a down quilt doctress gale then requested ina to leave the room while she questioned the patient ina retired in a moment or two miss gale came out to her softly at sight of her face la klosking said oh dear it is more serious than we thought very serious poor edward collect all your courage for i cannot lie either to patient or friend and you are right said la klosking trembling i see he is in danger worse than that where theres danger there is hope here there is none he is a dead man oh no no he has broken his back and nothing can save him his lower limbs have already lost sensation death will creep over the rest do not disturb your mind with idle hopes you have two things to thank god forthat you took him into your own house and that he will die easily indeed were he to suffer i should stupefy him at once for nothing can hurt him ina klosking turned faint and her knees gave way under her rhoda ministered to her and while she was so employed dr menteith was announced he was shown in to the patient and the accident described to him he questioned the patient and examined him alone he then came out and said he would draw a prescription he did so doctor said la klosking tell me the truth it cannot be worse than i fear madam said the doctor medicine can do nothing for him the spinal cord is divided give him anything he fancies and my prescription if he suffers pain not otherwise shall i send you a nurse no said mademoiselle klosking we will nurse him night and day he retired and the friends entered on their sad duties when severne saw them both by his bedside with earnest looks of pity he said do not worry yourselves im booked for the long journey ah well i shall die where i ought to have lived and might have if i had not been a fool ina wept bitterly they nursed him night and day he suffered little and when he did miss gale stupefied the pain at once for as she truly said nothing can hurt him vitality gradually retired to his head and lingered there a whole day but to his last moment the art of pleasing never abandoned him instead of worrying for this or that every moment he showed in this desperate condition singular patience and wellbred fortitude he checked his wifes tears assured her it was all for the best and that he was reconciled to the inevitable i have had a happier time than i deserve said he and now i have a painless death nursed by two sweet women my only regret is that i shall not be able to repay your devotion ina nor become worthy of your friendship miss gale he died without fear it being his conviction that he should return after death to the precise condition in which he was before birth and when they begged him to see a clergyman he said pray do not give yourselves or him that trouble i can melt back into the universe without his assistance he even died content for this polished bohemian had often foreseen that if he lived long he should die miserably but the main feature of his end was his extraordinary politeness he paid miss gale compliments just as if he were at his ease on a sofa and scarce an hour before his decease he said faintly i declarei have been so busydyingi have forgotten to send my kind regards to good mr ashmead pray tell him i did not forget his kindness to me he just ceased to live so quiet was his death and a smile rested on his dead features and they were as beautiful as ever so ended a fair pernicious creature endowed too richly with the art of pleasing and quite devoid of principle few bad men knew right so well and went so wrong ina buried her face for hours on his bed and kissed his cold features and hand she had told him before he died she would recall all her resolutions if he would live but he was gone death buries a mans many faults and his few virtues rise again she mourned him sincerely and would not be comforted she purchased a burying place forever and laid him in it then she took her aching heart far away and was lost to the public and to all her english friends the faithful rhoda accompanied her half way to london then returned to her own duties in barfordshire chapter xxxi i must now retrograde a little to relate something rather curious and i hope not uninteresting zoe vizard had been for some time acting on mrs gales advice building planning for the good of the poor and going out of herself more and more she compared notes constantly with miss gale and conceived a friendship for her it had been a long time coming because at first she disliked miss gales manners very much but that lady had nursed her tenderly and now advised her and zoe who could not do anything by halves became devoted to her as she warmed to her good work she gave signs of clearer judgment she never mentioned severne but she no longer absolutely avoided ina kloskings name and one day she spoke of her as a highprincipled woman for which the gale kissed her on the spot one name she often uttered and always with regret and selfreproachlord uxmoors i think that now she was herself building and planning for the permanent improvement of the poor she felt the tie of a kindred sentiment uxmoor was her predecessor in this good work too and would have been her associate if she had not been so blind this thought struck deep in her her mind ran more and more on uxmoor his manliness his courage in her defense and his gentlemanly fortitude and bravery in leaving her without a word at her request running over all these she often blushed with shame and her eyes filled with sorrow at thinking of how she had treated him and lost him forever by not deserving him she even made oblique and timid inquiries but could learn nothing of him except that he sent periodical remittances to miss gale for managing his improvements these however came in through a country agent from a town agent and left no clew but one fine day with no warning except to his own people lord uxmoor came home and the next day rode to hillstoke to talk matters over with miss gale he was fortunate enough to find her at home he thanked her for the zeal and enthusiasm she had shown and the progress his works had made under her supervision he was going away without even mentioning the vizard family but the crafty gale detained him going to vizard court said she no said he very dryly ah i understand but perhaps you would not mind going with me as far as islip there is something there i wish you to see humph is it anything very particular because it is three cottages rising with little flower gardens in front square plots behind and arrangements for breeding calves with other ingenious novelties a new head come into our business my lord you have converted vizard i thought you would he is a satirical fellow but he will listen to reason no it is not mr vizard indeed it is no convert of mine it is an independent enthusiast but i really believe your work at home had some hand in firing her enthusiasm a lady do i know her you may i suppose you know everybody in barfordshire will you come do of course i will come miss gale please tell one of your people to walk my horse down after us she had her hat on in a moment and walked him down to islip her tongue was not idle on the road you dont ask after the people said she theres poor miss vizard she had a sad illness we were almost afraid we should lose her heaven forbid said uxmoor startled by this sudden news mademoiselle klosking got quite well and oh what do you think mr severne turned out to be her husband what is that shouted uxmoor and stopped dead short mr severne a married man yes and mademoiselle klosking a married woman you amaze me why that mr severne was paying his attentions to miss vizard so i used to fancy said rhoda carelessly but you see it came out he was married and so of course she packed him off with a flea in his ear did she when was that let me see it was the th of october why that was the very day i left england how odd why did you not stay another week gentlemen are so impatient never mind that is an old story now here we are those are the cottages the workmen are at dinner ten to one the enthusiast is there this is her time you stay here ill go and see she went off on tiptoe and peeped and pried here and there like a young witch presently she took a few steps toward him with her finger mysteriously to her lips and beckoned him he entered into the pantomimeshe seemed so earnest in itand came to her softly do just take a peep in at that opening for a door said she then youll see her her back is turned she is lovely only you know she has been ill and i dont think she is very happy uxmoor thought this peeping at enthusiasts rather an odd proceeding but miss gale had primed his curiosity and he felt naturally proud of a female pupil he stepped up lightly looked in at the door and to his amazement saw zoe vizard sitting on a carpenters bench with her lovely head in the suns rays he started then gazed then devoured her with his eyes what was this his pupil how gentle and sad she seemed all his stoicism melted at the sight of her she sat in a sweet pensive attitude pale and drooping but to his fancy lovelier than ever she gave a little sigh his heart yearned she took out a letter read it slowly and said softly and slowly poor fellow he thought he recognized his own handwriting and could stand no more he rushed in and was going to speak to her but she screamed and no conjurer ever made a card disappear quicker than she did that letter as she bounded away like a deer and stood blushing scarlet and palpitating all over uxmoor was ashamed of his brusquerie what a brute i am to frighten you like this said he pray forgive me but the sight of you after all these weary monthsand you said poor fellow did i said zoe faintly looking scared yes sweet zoe and you were reading a letter no reply i thought the poor fellow might be myself not that i am to be pitied if you think of me still i do thenvery often oh lord uxmoor i want to go down on my knees to you that is odd now for it is exactly what i should like to do to you what for it is i who have behaved so ill never mind that i love you but you mustnt you must love some worthy person oh you leave that to me i have no other intention but may i just see whose letter you were reading oh pray dont ask me i insist on knowing i will not tell you there it is she gave it to him with a guilty air and hid her face dear zoe suppose i were to repeat the offer i made here i advise you not said she all in a flurry why because becausei might say yes well then ill take my chance once more zoe will you try and love me try i believe i do love you or nearly i think of you very often then you will do something to make me happy anything everything will you marry me yes that i will said zoe almost impetuously and then with a grand look of conscious beauty i can make you forgive me uxmoor on this caught her in his arms and kissed her with such fire that she uttered a little stifled cry of alarm but it was soon followed by a sigh of complacency and she sunk resistless on his manly breast so after two sieges he carried that fair citadel by assault then let not the manly heart despair nor take a mere brace of noes from any woman nothing short of three negatives is serious they walked out in arminarm and very close to each other and he left her solemnly engaged leaving this pair to the delights of courtship and growing affection on zoes sidefor a warm attachment of the noblest kind did grow by degrees out of her penitence and esteem and desire to repair her faulti must now take up the other thread of this narrative and apologize for having inverted the order of events for it was in reality several days after this happy scene that mademoiselle klosking sent for miss gale chapter xxxii vizard then with ashmead returned home in despair and zoe now happy in her own mind was all tenderness and sisterly consolation they opened their hearts to each other and she showed her wish to repay the debt she owed him how far she might have succeeded in time will never be known for he had hardly been home a week when miss gale returned all in black and told him severne was dead and buried he was startled and even shocked remembering old times but it was not in human nature he should be sorry not to be indecorously glad at so opportune an exit was all that could be expected from him when she had given him the details his first question was how did she bear it she is terribly cut upmore than one would think possible for she was ice and marble to him before he was hurt to death where is she gone to london she will write to me i supposepoor dear but one must give her time from that hour vizard was in a state of excitement hoping to hear from ina klosking or about her but unwilling from delicacy to hurry matters at last he became impatient and wrote to ashmead whose address he had and said frankly he had a delicacy in intruding on mademoiselle klosking in her grief yet his own feelings would not allow him to seem to neglect her would mr ashmead then tell him where she was as she had not written to any one in barfordshirenot even to her tried friend miss gale he received an answer by return of post dear siri am grieved to tell you that mademoiselle klosking has retired from public life she wrote to me three weeks ago from dover requesting me to accept as a token of her esteem the surplus money i hold in hand for heri always drew her salaryand bidding me farewell the sum included her profits by psalmody minus her expenses and was so large it could never have been intended as a mere recognition of my humble services and i think i have seldom felt so downhearted as on receiving this princely donation it has enabled me to take better offices and it may be the foundation of a little fortune but i feel that i have lost the truly great lady who has made a man of me sir the relish is gone for my occupation i can never be so happy as i was in working the interests of that great genius whose voice made our leading soprani sound like whistles and who honored me with her friendship sir she was not like other leading ladies she never bragged never spoke ill of any one and you can testify to her virtue and her discretion i am truly sorry to learn from you that she has written to no one in barfordshire i saw by her letter to me she had left the stage but her dropping you all looks as if she had left the world i do hope she has not been so mad as to go into one of those cursed convents mr vizard i will now write to friends in all the continental towns where there is good music she will not be able to keep away from that long i will also send photographs and hope we may hear something if not perhaps a judicious advertisement might remind her that she is inflicting pain upon persons to whom she is dear i am sir your obliged and grateful servant joseph ashmead here was a blow i really believe vizard felt this more deeply than all his other disappointments he brooded over it for a day or two and then as he thought miss gale a very illused person though not of course so illused as himself he took her ashmeads letter this is nice said she therei must give up loving women besides they throw me over the moment a man comes if it happens to be the right one unnatural creatures said vizard ungrateful at all events do you think she has gone into a convent not she in the first place she is a protestant and in the second she is not a fool i will advertise the idea do you think i am going to sit down with my hands before me and lose her forever no indeed i dont think you are that sort of a man at all ha ha oh miss gale pity me tell me how to find her that fanny dover says women are only enigmas to men they understand one another what said rhoda turning swiftly on him does that little chit pretend to read my noble ina if she cannot perhaps you can you are so shrewd do tell me what does it all mean it means nothing at all i dare say only a womans impulse they are such geese at times every one of them oh if i did but know what country she is in i would ransack it humcountries are biggish places i dont care what will you give me to tell you where she is at this moment all i have in the world that is sufficient well then first assign me your estates then fetch me an ordnance map of creation and i will put my finger on her you little mocking fiend you i am not im a tall beneficent angel and ill tell you where she isfor nothing keep your land who wants itit is only a bother for pitys sake dont trifle with me i never will where your heart is interested she is at zutzig ah you good girl she has written to you not a line the monster and ill serve her out ill teach her to play hideandseek with gale md zutzig said vizard how can you know what does that matter well yesi will reveal the mental process first of all she has gone to her mother how do you know that oh dear dear dear because that is where every daughter goes in trouble i shouldshe has fancy you not seeing thatwhy fanny dover would have told you that much in a moment but now you will have to thank my mother for teaching me attention the parent of memory pray sir who were the witnesses to that abominable marriage of hers i remember two baron hompesch no count hompesch and count meurice viscount what have you forgotten herr formes fraulein graafe zug the capellmeister and her very mother come now whose daughter is she i forget im sure walter ferris and eva klosking of zutzig in denmark packstart for copenhagen consult an ordnance map there find out zutzig go to zutzig and you have got her it is some hole in a wilderness and she cant escape you clever little angel ill be there in three days do you really think i shall succeed your own fault if you dont she has run into a culdesac through being too clever and besides women sometimes run away just to be caught and hide on purpose to be found i should not wonder if she has said to herself he will find me if he loves me so very very muchill try him not a word more angelic fox said vizard im off to zutzig he went out on fire she opened the window and screeched after him everything is fair after her behavior to me take her a book of those spiritual songs she is so fond of johnny comes marching home is worth the lot i reckon away went vizard found copenhagen with ease zutzig with difficulty being a small village but once there he soon found the farmhouse of eva klosking he drove up to the door a danish laborer came out from the stable directly and a buxom girl with pale golden hair opened the door these two seized his luggage and conveyed it into the house and the hired vehicle to the stable vizard thought it must be an inn the girl bubbled melodious sounds and ran off and brought a sweet venerable name vizard recognized eva klosking at once the old lady said few strangers come hereare you not english yes madam it is mr vizardis it not yes madam ah sir my daughter will welcome you but not more heartily than i do my child has told me all she owes to youthen in danish god bless the hour you come under this roof vizards heart beat tumultuously wondering how ina klosking would receive him the servant had told her a tall stranger was come she knew in a moment who it was so she had the advantage of being prepared she came to him her cheeks dyed with blushes and gave him both hands you here said she oh happy day mother he must have the south chamber i will go and prepare it for him teclateclaand she was all hostess she committed him to her mother while she and the servant went upstairs he felt discomfited a little he wanted to know all in a moment whether she would love him however danish hospitality has its good side he soon found out he might live the rest of his days there if he chose he soon got her alone and said you knew i should find you cruel one how could i dream of such a thing said she blushing oh love is a detective you said to yourself if he loves me as i ought to be loved he will search europe for me but he will find me oh then it was not to be at peace and rest on my mothers bosom i came here it was to give you the trouble of running after me oh fie you are right i am a vain fool no that you are not after all how do i know all that was in my heart ahem be sure of this you are very welcome i must go and see about your dinner in that danish farmhouse life was very primitive eva klosking and both her daughters helped the two female servants or directed them in every department so ina who was on her defense had many excuses for escaping vizard when he pressed her too hotly but at last she was obliged to say oh pray my friendwe are in denmark here widows are expected to be discreet but that is no reason why the english fellows who adore them should be discreet perhaps not but then the danish lady runs away which she did but after the bustle of the first day he had so many opportunities he walked with her sat with her while she worked and hung over her entranced while she sung he produced the book from vizard court without warning and she screamed with delight at sight of it and caught his hand in both hers and kissed it she reveled in those sweet strains which had comforted her in affliction and oh the eyes she turned on him after singing any song in this particular book those tender glances thrilled him to the very marrow to tell the honest truth his arrival was a godsend to ina klosking when she first came home to her native place and laid her head on her mothers bosom she was in elysium the house the wood fires the cooing doves the bleating calves the primitive life the recollections of childhoodall were balm to her and she felt like ending her days there but as the days rolled on came a sense of monotony and excessive tranquillity she was on the verge of ennui when vizard broke in upon her from that moment there was no stagnation he made life very pleasant to her only her delicacy took the alarm at his open declarations she thought them so premature at last he said to her one day i begin to fear you will never love me as i love you who knows said she time works wonders i wonder said he whether you will ever marry any other man ina was shocked at that oh my friend how could iunless said she with a sly sideglance you consented consent id massacre him ina turned toward him you asked my hand at a time when you thought mei dont know what you thoughtthat is a thing no woman could forget and now you have come all this way for me i am yours if you can wait for me he caught her in his arms she disengaged herself gently and her hand rested an unnecessary moment on his shoulder is that how you understand waiting said she with a blush but an indulgent smile what is the use waiting it is a matter of propriety how long are we to wait only a few months my friend it is like a boy to be too impatient alas would you marry me in my widows cap of course i would now ina love a widow who has been two years separated from her husband certainly that makes a differencein ones own mind but one must respect the opinion of the world dear friend it is of you i think though i speak of myself you are an angel take your own time after all what does it matter i dont leave zutzig without you inas pink tint and sparkling eyes betrayed anything but horror at that insane resolution however she felt it her duty to say that it was unfortunate she should always be the person to distract him from his home duties oh never mind them said this singlehearted lover i have appointed miss gale viceroy however one day he had a letter from zoe telling him that lord uxmoor was now urging her to name the day but she had declined to do that not knowing when it might suit him to be at vizard court but dearest said she mind you are not to hurry home for me i am very happy as i am and i hope you will soon be as happy love she is a noble woman the latter part of this letter tempted vizard to show it to ina he soon found his mistake she kissed it and ordered him off he remonstrated she put on for the first time in denmark her marble look and said you will lessen my esteem if you are cruel to your sister let her name the weddingday at once and you must be there to give her away and bless her union with a brothers love he submitted but a little sullenly and said it was very hard he wrote to his sister accordingly and she named the day and vizard settled to start for home and be in time as to the proprieties he had instructed miss maitland and fanny dover and given them and la gale carte blanche it was to be a magnificent wedding this being excitement fanny dover was in paradise moreover a rosycheeked curate had taken the place of the venerable vicar and miss dovers threat to flirt out the stigma of a nun was executed with promptitude zeal pertinacity and the dexterity that comes of practice when the day came for his leaving zutzig vizard was dejected who knows when we may meet again said he ina consoled him do not be sad dear friend you are doing your duty and as you do it partly to please me i ought to try and reward you ought i not and she gave him a strange look i advise you not to press that question said he at the very hour of parting inas eyes were moist with tenderness but there was a smile on her face very expressive yet he could not make out what it meant she did not cry he thought that hard it was his opinion that women could always cry she might have done the usual thing just to gratify him he reached home in good time and played the grand seigneurnobody could do it better when driven to itto do honor to his sister she was a peerless bride she stood superior with ebon locks and coal black eyes encircled by six bridemaidsall picked blondes the bevy with that glorious figure in the middle seemed one glorious and rare flower after the wedding the breakfast and then the traveling carriage the four liveried postilions bedecked with favors but the bride wept on vizards neck and a light seemed to leave the house when she was gone the carriages kept driving away one after another till four oclock and then vizard sat disconsolate in his study and felt very lonely yet a thing no bigger than a leaf sufficed to drive away this somber mood a piece of ambercolored paper scribbled on with a pencil a telegram from ashmead good news lost sheep turned up is now with her mother at claridges hotel then vizard was in raptures now he understood inas composure and the half sly look she had given him and her dry eyes at parting and other things he tore up to london directly with a telegram flying ahead burst in upon her and had her in his arms in a moment before her mother she fenced no longer but owned he had gained her love as he had deserved it in every way she consented to be married that week in london only she asked for a continental tour before entering vizard court as his wife but she did not stipulate even for thatshe only asked it submissively as one whose duty it now was to obey not dictate they were married in st georges church very quietly by special license then they saw her mother off and crossed to calais they spent two happy months together on the continent and returned to london but vizard was too oldfashioned and too proud of his wife to sneak into vizard court with her he did not make it a county matter but he gave the village such a fete as had not been seen for many a day the preparations were intrusted to mr ashmead at inas request he will be sure to make it theatrical she said but perhaps the simple villagers will admire that and it will amuse you and me love and the poor dear old thing will be in his gloryi hope he will not drink too much ashmead was indeed in his glory nothing had been seen in a play that he did not electrify islip with and the surrounding villages he pasted large posters on walls and barn doors and his small bills curled round the patriarchs of the forest and the roadside trees and blistered the gate posts the day came a soapy pole with a leg of mutton on high for the successful climber races in sacks short blindfold races with wheelbarrows pig with a greasy tail to be won by him who could catch him and shoulder him without touching any other part of him bowls of treacle for the boys to duck heads in and fish out coins skittles nine pins aunt sally etc etc etc but what astonished the villagers most was a maypole with long ribbons about which ballet girls undisguised as highlanders danced and wound and unwound the partycolored streamers to the merry fiddle and then danced reels upon a platform then returned to their little tent but out again and danced hornpipes undisguised as jacky tars beer flowed from a sturdy regiment of barrels the court kitchen and the village bakehouse kept pouring forth meats baked boiled and roast there was a pile of loaves like a haystack and they roasted an ox whole on the green and when they found they were burning him raw they fetched the butcher like sensible fellows and dismembered the giant and so roasted him reasonably in the midst of the reveling and feasting vizard and mrs vizard were driven into islip village in the family coach with four horses streaming with ribbons they drove round the green bowing and smiling in answer to the acclamations and blessings of the poor and then to vizard court the great doors flew open the servants male and female lined the hall on both sides and received her bowing and courtesying low on the very spot where she had nearly met her death her husband took her hand and conducted her in state to her own apartment it was open house to all that joyful day and at night magnificent fireworks on the sweep seen from the drawingroom by mrs vizard miss maitland miss gale miss dover and the rosycheeked curate whom she had tied to her apronstrings at two in the morning mr harris showed mr ashmead to his couch both gentlemen went upstairs a little graver than any of our modern judges and firm as a rock but their firmness resembled that of a roof rather than a wall for these dignities as they went made one inverted vso a it is time the womanhater drew to a close for the womanhater is spoiled he begins sarcastic speeches from force of habit but stops short in the middle he is a very happy man and owes it to a woman and knows it he adores her and to love well is to be happy but besides that she watches over his happiness and his good with that unobtrusive but minute vigilance which belongs to her sex and is often misapplied but not so very often as cynics say even the honest friendship between him and the remarkable woman he calls his viragos gives him many a pleasant hour he is still a humorist though cured of his fling at the fair sex his last tolerable hit was at the monosyllabic names of the immortal composers his wife had disinterred in his library says he to parson denison hot from oxford they remind me of the oxford poets in the last century alma novem celebres genuit rhedyeina poetas bubb stubb grubb crabbe trappe brome carey tickell evans as for ina vizard la klosking no longer she has stepped into her new place with her native dignity seemliness and composure at first a few county ladies put their little heads together and prepared to give themselves airs but the beauty dignity and enchanting grace of mrs vizard swept this little faction away like small dust her perfect courtesy her mild but deep dislike of all feminine backbiting her dead silence about the absent except when she can speak kindlythese rare traits have forced by degrees the esteem and confidence of her own sex as for the men they accepted her at once with enthusiasm she and lady uxmoor are the acknowledged belles of the county lady uxmoors face is the most admired but mrs vizard comes next and her satin shoulders statuesque bust and arms and exquisite hand turn the scale with some but when she speaks she charms and when she sings all competition dies she is faithful to music and especially to sacred music she is not very fond of singing at parties and sometimes gives offense by declining music sets fools talking because it excites them and then their folly comes out by the road nature has provided but when mrs vizard has to sing in one key and people talk in five other keys that gives this artist such physical pain that she often declines merely to escape it it does not much mortify her vanity she has so little she always sings in church and sings out too when she is there and plays the harmonium she trains the villagersgirls boys and adultswith untiring good humor and patience among her pupils are two fine voicestom wilder a grand bass and the rosycheeked curate a greater rarity still a genuine countertenor these two can both read music tolerably but the curate used to sing everything however full of joy with a pathetic whine for which vizard chaffed him in vain but mrs vizard persuaded him out of it where argument and satire failed people come far and near to hear the hymns at islip church sung in full harmonytrebles tenors countertenor and bass a traitshe allows nothing to be sung in church unrehearsed the rehearsals are on saturday night and never shirked such is the respect for our dame to be sure our dame fills the stomachs and wets the whistles of her faithful choir on saturday nights on sunday nights there are performances of sacred music in the great dininghall but these are rather more ambitious than those in the village church the performers meet on that happy footing of camaraderie the fine arts create the superior respect shown to mrs vizard being mainly paid to her as the greater musician they attack anthems and services and a trio by the parson the blacksmith and our dame is really an extraordinary treat owing to the great beauty of the voices it is also piquant to hear the female singer constantly six and often ten notes below the male countertenor but then comes wilder with his diapason and the harmony is noble the more so that mrs vizard rehearses her pupils in the swella figure too little practiced in music and nowhere carried out as she does it one night the organist of barford was there they sung kents service in f and mrs vizard still admired it she and the parson swelled in the duet to be a light to lighten the gentiles etc organist approved the execution but said the composition was a meager thing quite out of date we have much finer things now by learned men of the day ah said she bring me one so next sunday he brought her a learned composition and played it to her preliminary to their singing it but she declined it on the spot what said she mr x would you compare this meaningless stuff with kent in f why in kent the dominant sentiment of each composition is admirably preserved his magnificat is lofty jubilation with a free onward rush his dimittis is divine repose after lifes fever but this poor pedants magnificat begins with a mere crash and then falls into the pathetican excellent thing in its place but not in a song of triumph as to his dimittis it simply defies the words this is no christian sunset it is not good old simeon gently declining to his rest content to close those eyes which had seen the worlds salvation this is a tempest and all the windows rattling and the great napoleon dying amid the fury of the elements with tete darmee on his dying lips and battle in his expiring soul no sir if the learned englishmen of this day can do nothing nearer the mark than doleful magnificats and stormy nunc dimittises i shall stand faithful to poor dead kent and his fellowsthey were my solace in sickness and sore trouble in accordance with these views of vocal music and desirous to expand its sphere mrs vizard has just offered handsome prizes in the county for the best service in which the dominant sentiment of the words shall be as well preserved as in kents despised service and another prize to whoever can set any famous short secular poem or poetical passage not in ballad meter to good and appropriate music this has elicited several pieces the composers have tried their hands on drydens ode on the meeting of hector and andromache popes homer on two short poems of tennyson etc etc but it is only the beginning of a good thing the pieces are under consideration vizard says the competitors are trifiers he shall set mr arnolds version of hero and leander to the harp and sing it himself this he intimates will silence competition and prove an era i think so too if his music should happen to equal the lines in value but i hardly think it will because the said vizard though he has taste and ear does not know one note from another so i hope hero and leander will fall into abler hands and in any case i trust mrs vizard will succeed in her worthy desire to enlarge very greatly the sphere and the nobility of vocal music it is a desire worthy of this remarkable character of whom i now take my leave with regret i must own that regret is caused in part by my fear that i may not have done her all the justice i desired i have long felt and regretted that many able female writers are doing much to perpetuate the petty vices of a sex which after all is at present but half educated by devoting three thick volumes to such empty women as biography though a lower art than fiction would not waste three pages on they plead truth and fidelity to nature we write the average woman for the average woman to read say they but they are not consistent for the average woman is under five feet and rather ugly now these paltry women are all beautifulgreek as homer hath it fiction has just as much right to select large female souls as biography or painting has and to pick out a selfish shallow illiterate creature with nothing but beauty and bestow three enormous volumes on her is to make a perverse selection beauty being after all rarer in women than wit sense and goodness it is as false and ignoble in art as to marry a pretty face without heart and brains is silly in conduct besides it gives the female reader a low model instead of a high one and so does her a little harm whereas a writer ought to do goodor try at all events having all this in my mind and remembering how many noble women have shone like stars in every age and every land and feeling sure that as civilization advances such women will become far more common i have tried to look ahead and paint la klosking but such portraiture is difficult it is like writing a statue qui mihi non credit faciat licet ipse periclum mox fuerit studis aequior ille meis harrington vizard esq caught miss fanny dover on the top round but one of the steps of his library she looked down pinkish and said she was searching for tillotsons sermons what on earth can you want of them to improve my mind to be sure said the minx vizard said now you stay there missdont you move and he sent for ina she came directly and he said things have come to a climax my lady is hunting for tillotsons sermons poor denison that was the rosy curates name well said fanny turning red i told you i should why should i be good any longer all the sick are cured one way or other and i am myself again humph said vizard unfortunately for your little plans of conduct the heads of this establishment here present have sat in secret committee and your wings are to be clippedby order of council la said fanny pertly vizard imposed silence with a lordly wave it is a laughable thing but this divine is in earnest he has revealed his hopes and fears to me then he is a great baby said fanny coming down the steps no no we are both too poor and she vented a little sigh not you the vicar has written to vacate now i dont like you much because you never make me laugh but im awfully fond of denison and if you will marry my dear denison you shall have the vicarage it is a fat one oh cousin and said mrs vizard he permits me to furnish it for you you and i will make it a bijou fanny kissed them both impetuously then said she would have a little cry no sooner said than done in due course she was mrs denison and broke a solemn vow that she never would teach girls st matthew like coquettes in general who have had their fling at the proper time she makes a pretty good wife but she has one faultshe is too hard upon girls who flirt mr ashmead flourishes besides his agency she sometimes treats for a new piece collects a little company and tours the provincial theaters he always plays them a week at taddington and with perfect gravity loses six pounds per night then he has a bespeak vizard or uxmoor turn about there is a line of carriages the snobs crowd in to see the gentry vizard pays twenty pounds for his box and takes twenty pounds worth of tickets and joseph is in his glory and stays behind the company to go to islip church next day and spend a happy night at the court after that he says he feels good for three or four days mrs gale now leases the hillstoke farm of vizard and does pretty well she breeds a great many sheep and cattle the high ground and sheltering woods suit them she makes a little money every year and gets a very good house for nothing doctress gale is still all eyes and notices everything she studies hard and practices a little they tried to keep her out of the taddington infirmary but she went almost crying to vizard and he exploded with wrath he consulted lord uxmoor and between them the infirmary was threatened with the withdrawal of eighty annual subscriptions if they persisted the managers caved directly and doctress gale is a steady visitor a few mothers are coming to their senses and sending for her to their unmarried daughters this is the main source of her professional income she has however taken one enormous fee from a bon vivant whose life she saved by esculents she told him at once he was beyond the reach of medicine and she could do nothing for him unless he chose to live in her house and eat and drink only what she should give him he had a horror of dying though he had lived so well so he submitted and she did actually cure that one glutton but she says she will never do it again after forty years of made dishes they ought to be content to die it is bare justice quoth rhoda gale md an apothecary in barford threatened to indict this gallic physician but the other medical men dissuaded him partly from liberality partly from discretion the fine would have been paid by public subscription twenty times over and nothing gained but obloquy the doctress would never have yielded she visits and prescribes and laughs at the law as love is said to laugh at locksmiths to be sure in this country a law is no law when it has no foundation in justice morality or public policy happy in her position and in her friends she now reviews past events with the candor of a mind that loves truth sincerely she went into vizards study one day folded her arms and delivered herself as follows i guess theres something i ought to say to you when i told you about our treatment at edinburgh the wound still bled and i did not measure my words as i ought professing science now i feel a call to say that the edinburgh school was after all more liberal to us than any other in great britain or ireland the others closed the door in our faces this school opened it half at first there was a liberal spirit but the friends of justice got frightened and the unionists stronger we were overpowered at every turn but what i omitted to impress on you is that when we were defeated it was always by very small majorities that was so even with the opinions of the judges which have been delivered since i told you my tale there were six jurists and only seven pettifoggers it was so all through now for practical purposes the act of a majority is the act of a body it must be so it is the way of the world but when an accurate person comes to describe a business and deal with the character of a whole university she is not to call the larger half the whole and make the matter worse than it was that is not scientific science discriminates i am not sorry the doctress offered this little explanation it accords with her sober mind and her veneration of truth but i could have dispensed with it for one in britain when we are hurt we howl and the deuce is in it if the weak may not howl when the strong overpower them by the arts of the weak should that part of my tale rouse any honest sympathy with this english woman who can legally prescribe consult and take fees in france but not in england though she could eclipse at a public examination ninetenths of those who can it may be as well to inform them that even while her narrative was in the press our government declared it would do something for the relief of medical women but would sleep upon it this is on the whole encouraging but still where there is no stimulus of faction or personal interest to urge a measure but only such unconsidered trifles as public justice and public policy there are always two great dangers that the sleep may know no waking that after too long a sleep the british legislator may jump out of bed all in a hurry and do the work ineffectually for nothing leads oftener to reckless haste than long delay i hope then that a few of my influential readers will be vigilant and challenge a full discussion by the whole mind of parliament so that no temporary pettifogging halfmeasure may slip into a thin houselike a weasel into an empty barnand so obstruct for many years legislation upon durable principle the thing lies in a nutshell the legislature has been entrapped it never intended to outlaw women in the matter the persons who have outlawed them are all subjects and the engines of outlawry have been certificates of attendance on lectures and public examinations by closing the lecture room and the examination hall to all womenlearned or unlearneda clique has outlawed a population under the letter not the spirit of a badly written statute but it is for the three estates of the british realm to leave off scribbling statutes and learn to write them and to bridle the egotism of cliques and respect the nation the present form of government exists on that understanding and so must all forms of government in england and it is so easy it only wants a little singleness of mind and common sense years ago certificates of attendance on various lectures were reasonably demanded they were a slight presumptive evidence of proficiency and had a supplementary value because the public examinations were so loose and inadequate but once establish a stiff searching sufficient incorruptible public examination and then to have passed that examination is not presumptive but demonstrative proof of proficiency and swallows up all minor and merely presumptive proofs there is nothing much stupider than anachronism what avail certificates of lectures in our day either the knowledge obtained at the lectures enables the pupil to pass the great examination or it does not if it does the certificate is superfluous if it does not the certificate is illusory what the british legislator if for once he would rise to be a lawgiver should do and that quickly is to throw open the medical schools to all persons for matriculation to throw open all hospitals and infirmaries to matriculated students without respect of sex as they are already open by shameless partiality and transparent greed to unmatriculated women provided they confine their ambition to the most repulsive and unfeminine part of medicine the nursing of both sexes and laying out of corpses both the above rights as independent of sex as other natural rights should be expressly protected by mandamus and suit for damages the lecturers to be compelled to lecture to mixed classes or to give separate lectures to matriculated women for half fees whichever those lecturers prefer before this clause all difficulties would melt like hail in the dog days male modesty is a purely imaginary article set up for a trade purpose and will give way to justice the moment it costs the proprietors fifty per cent i know my own sex from hair to heel and will take my bible oath of that of the foreign matriculated student british or european nothing should be demanded but the one thing which matters one strawviz infallible proofs of proficiency in anatomy surgery medicine and its collaterals under public examination this which is the only real safeguard and the only necessary safeguard to the public and the only one the public ask should be placed in some degree under the sure control of government without respect of cities and much greater vigilance exercised than ever has been yet why under the system which excludes learned women male dunces have been personated by able students and so diplomas stolen again and again the student male or female should have power to compel the examiners by mandamus and other stringent remedies to examine at fit times and seasons in all the paper work of these examinations the name and of course the sex of the student should be concealed from the examiners there is a very simple way of doing it should a law be passed on this broad and simple basis that law will stand immortal with pettifogging acts falling all around according to the custom of the country the larger half of the population will no longer be unconstitutionally juggled under cover of law out of their right to take their secret ailments to a skilled physician of their own sex and compelled to go blushing writhing and after all concealing and fibbing to a male physician the picked few no longer robbed of their right to science reputation and bread the good effect on the whole mind of woman would be incalculable great prizes of study and genius offered to the able few have always a salutary and wonderful operation on the many who never gain them it would be great and glad tidings to our whole female youth to say you need not be frivolous idlers you need not give the colts fifty yards start for the derbyi mean you need not waste three hours of the short working day in dressing and undressing and combing your hair you need not throw away the very seedtime of life on music though you are unmusical to the backbone nor yet on your three cscroquet crochet and coquetry for civilization and sound law have opened to you one great noble and difficult profession with three branches two of which nature intended you for the path is arduous but flowers grow beside it and the prize is great i say that this prize and frequent intercourse with those superior women who have won it would leaven the whole sex with higher views of life than enter their heads at present would raise their selfrespect and set thousands of them to study the great and noble things that are in medicine and connected with it instead of childish things is there really one manly heart that would grudge this boon to a sex which is the nurse and benefactress of every man in his tender and most precarious years realize the hard condition of women among barbarians their lot is unmixed misery with us their condition is better but not what it ought to be because we are but half civilized and so their lot is still very unhappy compared with ours and we are so unreasonable we men cannot go straight ten yards without rewards as well as punishments yet we could govern our women by punishments alone they are eternally tempted to folly yet snubbed the moment they would be wise a million shops spread their nets and entice them by their direst foible their very mothersfor want of medical knowledge in the sexclasp the fatal idiotic corset on their growing bodies though thin as a lath so the girl grows up crippled in the ribs and lungs by her own mother and her life too is in stayscabined cribbed confined unless she can paint or act or write novels every path of honorable ambition is closed to her we treat her as we do our private soldiersthe lash but no promotion and our private soldiers are the scum of europe for that very reason and no other i say that to open the study and practice of medicine to women folk under the infallible safeguard of a stiff public examination will be to rise in respect for human rights to the level of european nations who do not brag about just freedom half as loud as we do and to respect the constitutional rights of many million citizens who all pay the taxes like men and by the contract with the state implied in that payment buy the clear human right they have yet to go down on their knees for it will also import into medical science a new and less theoretical but cautious teachable observant kind of intellect it will give the larger half of the nation an honorable ambition and an honorable pursuit toward which their hearts and instincts are bent by nature herself it will tend to elevate this whole sex and its young children male as well as female and so will advance the civilization of the world which in ages past in our own day and in all time hath and doth and will keep step exactly with the progress of women toward mental equality with men
