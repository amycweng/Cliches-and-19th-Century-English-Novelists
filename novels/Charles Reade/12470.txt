perilous secret chapter i the poor mans child two worn travellers a young man and a fair girl about four years old sat on the towingpath by the side of the trent the young man had his coat off by which you might infer it was very hot but no it was a keen october day and an east wind sweeping down the river the coat was wrapped tightly round the little girl so that only her fair face with blue eyes and golden hair peeped out and the young father sat in his shirt sleeves looking down on her with a loving but anxious look her mother his wife had died of consumption and he was in mortal terror lest biting winds and scanty food should wither this sweet flower too his one remaining joy william hope was a man full of talent selfeducated and wonderfully quick at learning anything he was a linguist a mechanic a mineralogist a draughtsman an inventor item a bit of a farrier and half a surgeon could play the fiddle and the guitar could draw and paint and drive a fourinhand almost the only thing he could not do was to make money and keep it versatility seldom pays but to tell the truth luck was against him and although in a long life every deserving man seems to get a chance yet fortune does baffle some meritorious men for a limited time generally we think good fortune and ill fortune succeed each other rapidly like red cards and black but to some ill luck comes in great long slices and if they dont drink or despair byandby good luck comes continuously and everything turns to gold with him who has waited and deserved well for years fortune was hard on william hope it never let him get his head abovewater if he got a good place the employer died or sold his business if he patented an invention and exhausted his savings to pay the fees no capitalist would work it or some other inventor proved he had invented something so like it that there was no basis for a monopoly at last there fell on him the heaviest blow of all he had accumulated l as a merchants clerk and was in negotiation for a small independent business when his wife whom he loved tenderly sickened for eight months he was distracted with hopes and fears these gave way to dismal certainty she died and left him brokenhearted and poor impoverished by the doctors and pauperized by the undertaker then his crushed heart had but one desireto fly from the home that had lost its sunshine and the very country which had been calamitous to him he had one stanch friend who had lately returned rich from new zealand and had offered to send him out as his agent and to lend him money in the colony hope had declined and his friend had taken the huff and had not written to him since but hope knew he was settled in hull and too goodhearted at bottom to go from his word in his friends present sad condition so william hope paid every debt he owed in liverpool took his child to her mothers tombstone and prayed by it and started to cross the island and then leave it for many a long day he had a bundle with one brush one comb a piece of yellow soap and two changes of linen one for himself and one for his little graceitem his fiddle and a reaping hook for it was a late harvest in the north and he foresaw he should have to work his way and play his way or else beg and he was too much of a man for that his childs face won her many a ride in a wagon and many a cup of milk from humble women standing at their cottage doors now and then he got a days work in the fields and the farmers wife took care of little grace and washed her linen and gave them both clean straw in the barn to lie on and a blanket to cover them once he fell in with a harvesthome and his fiddle earned him ten shillings all in sixpences but on unlucky days he had to take his fiddle under his arm and carry his girl on his back these unlucky days came so often that still as he travelled his small pittance dwindled yet halfway on this journey fortune smiled on him suddenly it was in derbyshire he went a little out of his way to visit his native placehe had left it at ten years old here an old maid his first cousin received grace with rapture and hope pottered about all day reviving his boyish recollections of people and places he had left the village ignorant he returned full of various knowledge and so it was that in a certain despised field all thistles and docks and every known weed which field the tenant had condemned as a sour clay unfit for cultivation william hope found certain strata and other signs which thanks to his mineralogical studies and practical knowledge sent a sudden thrill all through his frame heres luck at last said he my child my child our fortune is made the proprietor of this land and indeed of the whole parish was a retired warrior colonel clifford hope knew that very well and hurried to clifford hall all on fire with his discovery he obtained an interview without any difficulty colonel clifford though proud as lucifer was accessible and stiffly civil to humble folk he was gracious enough to hope but when the poor fellow let him know he had found signs of coal on his land he froze directly told him that two gentlemen in that neighborhood had wasted their money groping the bowels of the earth for coal because of delusive indications on the surface of the soil and that for his part even if he was sure of success he would not dirty his fingers with coal i believe said he the northern nobility descend to this sort of thing but then they have not smelled powder and seen glory and served her majesty i have hope tried to reason with him tried to get round him but he was unassailable as gibraltar and soon cut the whole thing short by saying there thats enough i am much obliged to you sir for bringing me information you think valuable you are travellingon footshort of funds perhaps please accept this trifle andandgoodmorning he retreated at marching pace and the hot blood burned his visitors face an alms but on second thoughts he said well i have offered him a fortune and he gives me ten shillings one good turn deserves another so he pocketed the halfsovereign and bought his little grace a neckhandkerchief blue with white spots and so this unlucky man and his child fought their way from west to east till they reached that place where we introduced them to the reader that was an era in their painful journey because until then hopes only anxiety was to find food and some little comfort for his child but this morning little grace had begun to cough a little dry cough that struck on the fathers heart like a knell her mother had died of consumption were the seeds of that fatal malady in her child if so hardship fatigue cold and privation would develop them rapidly and she would wither away into the grave before his eyes so he looked down on her in an agony of foreboding and shivered in his shirt sleeves not at the cold but at the future she poor girl was like the animals blessed with ignorance of everything beyond the hour and soon she woke her father from his dire reverie with a cry of delight oh whats they said she and beamed with pleasure hope followed the direction of her blue eyes open to their full extent and lo there was a little fleet of swans coming round a bend of the river hope told her all about the royal birds and that they belonged to sovereigns in one district to cities in another meantime the fair birds sailed on and passed stately arching their snowy necks grace gloated on them and for a day or two her discourse was of swans at last when very near the goal misfortunes multiplied they came into a town on a tidal river whence they could hope to drift down to their destination for a shilling or two but here hope spent his last farthing on graces supper at an eatinghouse and had not wherewithal to pay for bed or breakfast at the humble inn here too he took up the local paper praying heaven there might be some employment advertised however mean that so he might feed his girl and not let the fiend consumption take her at a gift no there was nothing in the advertising column but in the body of the paper he found a paragraph to the effect that mr samuelson of hull had built a gigantic steam vessel in that port and was going out to new zealand in her on her trial trip to sail that morning at high tide am and it was now nine how a sentence in a newspaper can blast a man bereavement despair lost lovethey come like lightning in a single line hope turned sick at these few words and down went his head and his hands and he sat all of a heap cold at heart then he began to disbelieve in everything especially in honesty for why if he had only left liverpool in debt and taken the rail he would have reached hull in ample time and would have gone out to new zealand in the new ship with money in both pockets but it was no use fretting starvation and disease impended over his child he must work or steal or something in truth he was getting desperate he picked himself up and went about offering his many accomplishments to humble shopkeepers they all declined him some civilly at last he came to a superior place of business there were large offices and a handsome house connected with it in the rear at the side of the offices were pulleys cranes and all the appliances for loading vessels and a yard with horses and vans so that the whole frontage of the premises was very considerable a brass plate said r bartley shipbroker and commission agent but the man was evidently a shipowner and a carrier besides so this miscellaneous shop roused hopes in our versatile hero he rapidly surveyed the outside and then cast hungry glances through the window of the mans office it was a bowwindow of unusual size through which the proprietor or his employees could see a long way up and down the river through this window hope peered repulses had made him timid he wanted to see the face he had to apply to before he ventured but mr bartley was not there the large office was at present occupied by his clerks one of these was leonard monckton a pale young man with dark hair a nose like a hawk and thin lips the other was quite a young fellow with brown hair hazel eyes and an open countenance many a hard rub puts a point on a man so hope resolved at once to say nothing to that pale clerk so like a kite but to interest the open countenance in him and his hungry child there were two approaches to the large office one to hopes right through a door and a lobby this was seldom used except by the habitues of the place the other was to hopes left through a very small office generally occupied by an inferior clerk who kept an eye upon the work outside however this office had also a small window looking inward this opened like a door when the man had anything to say to mr bartley or the clerks in the large office william hope entered this outer office and found it empty the clerk happened to be in the yard then he opened the inner door and looked in on the two clerks pale and haggard and apprehensive of a repulse he addressed himself to the one nearest him it was the one whose face had attracted him sir can i see mr bartley the young fellow glanced over the visitors worn garments and dusty shoes and said dryly hum if it is for charity this is the wrong shop i want no charity said hope with a sigh i want employment but i do want it very badly my poor little girl and i are starving then that is a shame said the young fellow warmly why you are a gentleman arent you i dont know for that said hope but i am an educated man and i could do the whole business of this place but you see i am down in the world you look like it said the clerk bluntly but dont you be so green as to tell old bartley that or you are done for no no ill show you how to get in here wait till half past one he lunches at one and he isnt quite such a brute after luncheon then you come in like julius caesar and brag like blazes and offer him twenty pounds worth of industry and ability and above all arithmetic and he will say he has no opening and that is a lie and offer you fifteen shillings perhaps if he does ill jump at it said hope eagerly but whether i succeed with him or not take my childs blessing and my own his voice faltered and bolton with a young mans uneasiness under sentiment stopped him oh come old fellow bother all that why we are all stumped in turn then he began to chase a solitary coin into a corner of his waistcoat pocket look here ill lend you a shillingpay me next weekit will buy the kid a breakfast i wish i had more but i want the other for luncheon i havent drawn my screw yet it is due at twelve ill take it for my girl said hope blushing and because it is offered me by a gentleman and like a gentleman granted for the sake of argument said this sprightly youth and so they parted for the time little dreaming either of them what a chain they were weaving round their two hearts and this little business the first link chapter ii the rich mans child the world is very big and contains hundreds of millions who are strangers to each other yet every now and then this big world seems to turn small so many people whose acquaintance we make turn out to be acquaintances of our acquaintances this concatenation of acquaintances is really one of the marvels of social life if one considers the chances against it owing to the size and population of the country as an example of this phenomenon which we have all observed william hope was born in derbyshire in a small parish which belonged nearly all of it to colonel clifford yet in that battle for food which is alas the prosaic but true history of men and nations he entered an office in yorkshire and there made friends with colonel cliffords son walter who was secretly dabbling in trade and matrimony under the name of bolton and this same hope was to come back and to apply for a place to mr bartley mr bartley was brotherinlaw to that same colonel clifford though they were at daggers drawn the pair miss clifford aged thirtytwo had married bartley aged thirtyseven each had got fixed habits and they soon disagreed in two years they parted with plenty of bitterness but no scandal bartley stood on his rights and kept their one child little mary he was very fond of her and as the mother saw her whenever she liked his love for his child rather tended to propitiate mrs bartley though nothing on earth would have induced her to live with him again little mary was two months younger than grace hope and like her had blue eyes and golden hair but what a difference in her condition she had two nurses and every luxury dressed like a princess and even when in bed smothered in lace some womans eye always upon her a hand always ready to keep her from the smallest accident yet all this care could not keep out sickness the very day that grace hope began to cough and alarm her father mary bartley flushed and paled and showed some signs of feverishness the older nurse a vigilant person told mr bartley directly and the doctor was sent for posthaste he felt her pulse and said there was some little fever but no cause for anxiety he administered syrup of poppies and little mary passed a tranquil night next day about one in the afternoon she became very restless and was repeatedly sick the doctor was sent for and combated the symptoms but did not inquire closely into the cause sickness proceeds immediately from the stomach so he soothed the stomach with alkaline mucilages and the sickness abated but next day alarming symptoms accumulated short breathing inability to eat flushed face wild eyes bartley telegraphed to a firstrate london physician he came and immediately examined the girls throat and shook his head then he uttered a fatal worddiphtheria they had wasted four days squirting petty remedies at symptoms instead of finding the cause and attacking it and now he told them plainly he feared it was too latethe fatal membrane was forming and indeed had half closed the airpassages bartley in his rage and despair would have driven the local doctor out of the house but this the london doctor would not allow he even consulted him on the situation now it was declared and as often happens they went in for heroic remedies since it was too late but neither powerful stimulants nor biting draughts nor caustic applications could hinder the deadly parchment from growing and growing the breath reduced to a thread no nourishment possible except by baths of beef tea and similar enemas exhaustion inevitable death certain such was the hopeless condition of the rich mans child surrounded by nurses and physicians when the father of the poor mans child applied to the clerk bolton for that employment which meant bread for his child and perhaps life for her william hope returned to his little grace with a loaf of bread he bought on the road with boltons shilling and fresh milk in a sodawater bottle he found her crying she had contrived after the manner of children to have an accident the room was almost bare of furniture but my lady had found a wooden stool that could be mounted upon and tumbled off and she had done both her parent being away she had bruised and sprained her little wrist and was in the depths of despair ah said poor hope i was afraid something or other would happen if i left you he took her to the window and set her on his knee and comforted her he cut a narrow slip off his pocket handkerchief wetted it and bound it lightly and deftly round her wrist and poured consolation into her ear but soon she interrupted that and flung sorrow to the winds she uttered three screams of delight and pointed eagerly through the window here they be again the white swans hope looked and there were two vessels a brig and a bark creeping down the river toward the sea with white sails bellying to a gentle breeze astern it is experience that teaches proportion the eye of childhood is wonderfully misled in that matter promise a little child the moon and show him the ladder to be used he sees nothing inadequate in the means so grace hope was delighted with her swans but hope who made it his business to instruct her and not deceive her as some thoughtless parents do out of fun the wretches told her gently they were not swans but ships she was a little disappointed at that but inquired what they were doing darling said he they are going to some other land where honest hardworking people can not starve and mark my words darling said heshe pricked her little ears at thatyou and i shall have to go with them for we are poor oh said little grace impressed by his manner as well as his words and nodded her pretty head with apparent wisdom and seemed greatly impressed then her father fed her with bread and milk and afterward laid her on the bed and asked her whether she loved him dearly dearly said she then if you do said he you will go to sleep like a good girl and not stir off that bed till i come back no more i will said she however he waited until she was in an excellent condition for keeping her promise being fast as a church then he looked long at her beautiful face waxlike and eventinted but full of life after her meal and prayed to him who loved little children and went with a beating heart to mr bartleys office but in the short time little more than an hour and a half which elapsed between hopes first and second visit some most unexpected and remarkable events took place bartley came in from his childs dying bed distracted with grief but business to him was the air he breathed and he went to work as usual only in a hurried and bitter way unusual to him he sent out his clerk bolton with some bills and told him sharply not to return without the money and whilst bolton socalled was making his toilette in the lobby his eye fell on his other clerk monckton monckton was poring over the ledger with his head down the very picture of a faithful servant absorbed in his masters work but appearances are deceitful he had a small book of his own nestled between the ledger and his stomach it was filled with hieroglyphics and was his own betting book as for his brownstudy that was caused by his owing l in the ring and not knowing how to get it to be sure he could rob mr bartley he had done it again and again by false accounts and even by abstraction of coin for he had false keys to his employers safe cashbox drawers and desk but in his opinion he had played this game often enough and was afraid to venture it again so soon and on so large a scale he was so absorbed in these thoughts that he did not hear mr bartley come to him to be sure he came softly because of the other clerk who was washing his hands and brushing his hair in the lobby so bartleys hand fell gently but all in a moment on moncktons shoulder and they say the shoulder is a sensitive part in conscious rogues anyway monckton started violently and turned from pale to white and instinctively clapped both hands over his betting book monckton said his employer gravely i have made a very ugly discovery monckton began to shiver periodical errors in the balances and the errors always against me monckton began to perspire not knowing what to say he faltered and at last stammered out are you sure sir quite sure i have long seen reason to suspect it so last night i went through all the books and now i am sure whoever the villain is i will send him to prison if i can only catch him monckton winced and turned his head away debating in his mind whether he should affect indignation and sympathy and pretend to court inquiry or should wait till lunchtime and then empty the cashbox and bolt whilst thus debating these words fell unexpectedly on his ear and you must help me then moncktons eyes turned this way and that in a manner that is common among thieves and a sardonic smile curled his pale thin lip it is my duty said the sly rogue demurely then after a pause but how then mr bartley glanced at bolton in the lobby and not satisfied with speaking under his breath drew this illchosen confidant to the other end of the office why suspect everybody and watch them now theres this clerk bolton i know nothing about him i was taken by his looks have your eye on him i will sir said monckton eagerly he drew a long breath of relief for all that he was glad when a voice in the little office announced a visitor it was a clear peremptory voice short sharp incisive and decisive the clerk called bolton heard it in the lobby and scuttled into the street with a rapidity that contrasted drolly enough with the composure and slowness with which he had been brushing his hair and titivating his nascent whiskers a tall stiff military figure literally marched into the middle of the office and there stood like a sentinel mr bartley could hardly believe his senses colonel clifford said he roughly you are surprised to see me here of course i am may i ask what brings you that which composes all quarrels and squares all accountsdeath colonel clifford said this solemnly and with less asperity he added with a glance at monckton this is a very private matter bartley took the hint and asked monckton to retire into the inner office as soon as he and colonel clifford were alone that warrior still standing straight as a dart delivered himself of certain short sentences each of which seemed to be propelled or indeed jerked out of him by some foreign power seated in his breast my sister your injured wife is no more dead this is very sudden i am very very sorry i colonel clifford looked the word humbug and continued to expel short sentences on her deathbed she made me promise to give you my hand there it is his hand was propelled out caught flying by bartley released and drawn back again all by machinery it seemed she leaves you l in trust for the benefit of her child and yoursmary bartley poor dear eliza the colonel looked as less highbred people do when they say gammon but proceeded civilly though brusquely in dealing with the funds you have a large discretion should the girl die before you or unmarried the money lapses to your nephew my son walter clifford he is a scapegrace and has run away from me but i must protect his just interests so as a mere matter of form i will ask you whether mary bartley is alive bartley bowed his head colonel clifford had not heard she was ill so he continued in that caseand then interrupting himself for a moment turned away to bartleys private table and there emptied his pockets of certain documents one of which he wanted to select his back was not turned more than half a minute yet a most expressive pantomime took place in that short interval the nurse opened a door of communication and stood with a rush at the threshold indeed she would have rushed in but for the stranger she was very pale and threw up her hands to bartley her face and her gesture were more expressive than words then bartley clinging by mere desperate instinct to money he could not hope to keep flew to her drove her out by a frenzied movement of both hands though he did not touch her and spreadeagled himself before the door with his face and dilating eyes turned toward colonel clifford the colonel turned and stepped toward him with the document he had selected at the table bartley went to meet him the colonel gave it to him and said it was a copy of the will bartley took it and colonel clifford expelled his last sentences we have shaken hands let us forget our past quarrels and respect the wishes of the dead with that he turned sharply on both heels and faced the door of the little office before he moved then marched out in about seven steps as he had marched in and never looked behind him for two hundred miles the moment he was out of sight bartley with his wifes will in his hand and ice at his heart went to his childs room the nurse met him crying and said a changemild but fatal words that from a nurses lips end hope he came to the bedside just in time to see the breath hovering on his childs lips and then move them as the summer air stirs a leaf soon all was still and the rich mans child was clay the unhappy father burst into a passion of grief short but violent then he ordered the nurse to watch there and let no one enter the room then he staggered back to his office and flung himself down at his table and buried his head to do him justice he was all parental grief at first for his child was his idol the arms were stretched out across the table the head rested on it the man was utterly crushed whilst he was so the little office door opened softly and a pale worn haggard face looked in it was the father of the poor mans child in mortal danger from privation and hereditary consumption that haggard face was come to ask the favor of employment and bread for his girl from the rich man whose child was clay chapter iii the two fathers hope looked wistfully at that crushed figure and hesitated it seemed neither kind nor politic to intrude business upon grief but if the child was bartleys idol money was his god and soon in his strange mind defeated avarice began to vie with nobler sorrow his child dead his poor little flower withered and her death robbed him of l and indeed of ten times that sum for he had now bought experience in trade and speculation and had learned to make money out of money a heap out of a handful stung by this vulgar torment in its turn he started suddenly up and dashed his wifes will down upon the floor in a fury and paced the room excitedly hope still stood aghast and hesitated to risk his application but presently bartley caught sight of him and stared at him but said nothing then the poor fellow saw it was no use waiting for a better opportunity so he came forward and carried out boltons instructions he put on a tolerably jaunty air and said cheerfully i beg your pardon sir can i claim your attention for a moment what do you want asked bartley but like a man whose mind was elsewhere only employment for my talent sir i hear you have a vacancy for a manager nothing of the sort i am manager hope drew back despondent and his haggard countenance fell at such prompt repulse but he summoned courage and once more acting genial confidence returned to the attack but you dont know sir in how many ways i can be useful to you a grand and complicated business like yours needs various acquirements in those who have the honor to serve you for instance i saw a small engine at work in your yard now i am a mechanic and i can double the power of that engine by merely introducing an extra band and a couple of cogs it will do as it is said bartley languidly and i can do without a manager bartleys manner was not irritated but absorbed he seemed in all his replies to hope to be brushing away a fly mechanically and languidly the poor fly felt sick at heart and crept away disconsolate but at the very door he turned and for his childs sake made another attempt have you an opening for a clerk i can write business letters in french german and dutch and keep books by double entry no vacancy for a clerk was the weary reply well then a foreman in the yard i have studied the economy of industry and will undertake to get you the greatest amount of labor out of the smallest number of men i have a foreman already said bartley turning his back on him peevishly for the first time and pacing the room absorbed in his own disappointment hope was in despair and put on his hat to go but he turned at the window and said you have vans and carts i understand horses thoroughly i am a veterinary surgeon and i can drive fourinhand i offer myself as carman or even hostler i do not want a hostler and i have a carman bartley when he had said this sat down like a man who had finally disposed of the application hope went to the very door and leaned against it his jaw dropped he looked ten years older then with a piteous attempt at cheerfulness he came nearer and said a messenger then im young and very active and never waste my employers time even this humble proposal was declined though hopes cheeks burned with shame as he made it he groaned aloud and his head dropped on his breast his eye fell on the will lying on the ground he went and picked it up and handed it respectfully to bartley bartley stared took it and bowed his head an inch or two in acknowledgment of the civility this gave the poor daunted father courage again now that bartleys face was turned to him by this movement he took advantage of it and said persuasively give me some kind of employment sir you will never repent it then he began to warm with conscious power ive intelligence practicability knowledge and in this age of science knowledge is wealth example i saw a swell march out of this place that owns all the parish i was born in i knew him in a momentcolonel clifford well that old soldier draws his rents when he can get them and never looks deeper than the roots of the grass his cattle crop but i tell you he never takes a walk about his grounds but he marches upon millionscoal sir coal and near the surface i know the signs but i am impotent only fools possess the gold that wise men can coin into miracles try me sir honor me with your sympathy you are a fatheryou have a sweet little girl i hearbartley winced at thatwell so have i and the hole my poverty makes me pig in is not good for her sir she needs the sea air the scent of flowers and bless her little heart she does enjoy them so give them to her and i will give you zeal energy brains and a million of money this for the first time in the interview arrested mr bartleys attention i see you are a superior man said he but i have no way to utilize your services you can give me no hope sir asked the poor fellow still lingering noneand i am sorry for it this one gracious speech affected poor hope so that he could not speak for a moment then he fought for manly dignity and said with a lamentable mixture of sham sprightliness and real anguish thank you sir i only trust that you will always find servants as devoted to your interest as my gratitude would have made me goodmorning sir he clapped his hat on with a sprightly ghastly air and marched off resolutely but ere he reached the door nature overpowered the fathers heart way went boltons instructions away went fictitious deportment and feigned cheerfulness the poor wretch uttered a cry indeed a scream of anguish that would have thrilled ten thousand hearts had they heard it he dashed his hat on the ground and rushed toward bartley with both hands outfor gods sake dont send me awaymy child is starving even bartley was moved your child said he with some little feeling this slight encouragement was enough for a father his love gushed forth a little goldenhaired blueeyed angel who is all the world to me we have walked here from liverpool where i had just buried her mother god help me god help us both many a weary mile sir and never sure of supper or bed the birds of the air have nests the beasts of the field a shelter the fox a hole but my beautiful and fragile girl only four years old sir is houseless and homeless her mother died of consumption sir and i live in mortal fear for now she is beginning to cough and i can not give her proper nourishment often on this fatal journey i have felt her shiver and then i have taken off my coat and wrapped it round her and her beautiful eyes have looked up in mine and seemed to plead for the warmth and food id sell my soul to give her poor fellow said bartley i suppose i ought to pity you but how can i manmanyour child is alive and while there is life there is hope but mine is deaddead he almost shrieked dead said hope horrified dead cried bartley cut off at four years old the very age of yours therego and judge for yourself you are a father i cant look upon my blasted hopes and my withered flower go and see my blueeyed fairhaired darlingclay hastening to the tomb and you will trouble me no more with your imaginary griefs he flung himself down with his head on his desk hope following the direction of his hand opened the door of the house and went softly forward till he met the nurse he told her mr bartley wished him to see the deceased the nurse hesitated but looked at him his sad face inspired confidence and she ushered him into the chamber of mourning there laid out in state was a little figure that seen in the dim light drew a cry of dismay from hope he had left his own girl sleeping and looking like tinted wax here lay a little face the very image of hers only this was pale wax had he looked more closely the chin was unlike his own girls and there were other differences but the first glance revealed a thrilling resemblance hope hurried away from the room and entered the office pale and disturbed oh sir the very image of my own it fills me with forebodings i pity you sir with all my heart that sad sight reconciles me to my lot god help you and he was going away for now he felt an unreasoning terror lest his own child should have turned from colored wax to pale mr bartley stopped him are they so very like said he wonderfully like and again he was going but bartley who had received him so coldly seemed now unwilling to part with him stay said he and let me think the truth is a daring idea had just flashed through that brain of his and he wanted to think it out he walked to and fro in silent agitation and his face was as a book in which you may read strange matter at last he made up his mind but the matter was one he did not dare to approach too bluntly so he went about a little stayyou dont know all my misfortunes i am ambitiouslike you i believe in science and knowledgelike you and if my child had lived you should have been my adviser and my right hand i want such a man as you hope threw up his hands my usual luck said he always a day too late bartley resumed but my childs death robs me of the money to work with and i cant help you nor help myself hope groaned bartley hesitated but after a moment he said timidly unless and then stopped unless what asked hope eagerly i am not likely to raise objections my childs life is at stake well then unless you are really the superior man you seem to be a man of ability andcourage courage thought hope and began to be puzzled however he said modestly that he thought he could find courage in a good cause then you and i are made men said bartley these were stout words but they were not spoken firmly on the contrary mr bartleys voice trembled and his brow began to perspire visibly his agitation communicated itself to hope and the latter said in a low impressive voice this is something very grave mr bartley sir what is it mr bartley looked uneasily all round the room and came close to hope the very walls must not hear what i now say to you then in a thrilling whisper my daughter must not die hope looked puzzled your daughter must take her place now just before this two quick ears began to try and catch the conversation monckton had heard all that colonel clifford said that warriors tones were so incisive but as the matter only concerned mr bartley he merely grinned at the disappointment likely to fall on his employer for he knew mary bartley was at deaths door he said as much to himself and went out for a sandwich for it was his lunchtime but when he returned with stealthy foot for all his movements were catlike he caught sight of bartley and hope in earnest conversation and felt very curious there was something so mysterious in bartleys tones that monckton drew up against the little window pushed it back an inch and listened hard but he could hear nothing at all until hopes answer came to bartleys proposal then the indignant father burst out so that it was easy enough to hear every word i part with my girl not for the worlds wealth what you call yourself a father and would tempt me to sell my own flesh and blood no poverty beggary anything sooner than that my darling we will thrive together or starve together we will live together or die together he snatched up his hat to leave but bartley found a word to make him hesitate he never moved but folded his arms and said so then your love for your child is selfish selfish cried hope so selfish that i would die for her any hour of the day for all that the taunt brought him down a step and bartley still standing like a rock attacked him again if it is not selfish it is blind then he took two strides and attacked him with sudden power who will suffer most if you stand in her light your daughter why she may die hope groaned who will profit most if you are wise and really love her not like a jealous lover but like a father why your daughter she will be taken out of poverty and want and carried to seabreezes and scented meadows her health and her comfort will be my care she will fill the gap in my house and in my heart and will be my heiress when i die but she will be lost to me sighed poor hope not so you will be my right hand you will be always about us you can see her talk to her make her love you do anything but tell her you are her father do this one thing for me and i will do great things for you and for her to refuse me will be to cut your own throat and hersas well as mine hope faltered a little am i selfish said he of course not was the soothing reply no true father isgive him time to think hope clinched his hands in agony and pressed them against his brow it is selfish to stand in her light but part with heri cant i cant of course not who asks you she will never be out of your sight only instead of seeing her sicken linger and die you will see her surrounded by every comfort nursed and tended like a princess and growing every day in health wealth and happiness health wealth and happiness health wealth and happiness these words made a great impression on the still hesitating father he began to make conditions they were all granted heartily if ever you are unkind to her the compact is broken and i claim my own again so be it but why suppose anything so monstrous men do not illtreat children it is only women who adore them that kill them and illuse them accordingly she will be my little benefactress god bless her i may love her more than i ought being yours for my home is desolate without her but that is the only fault you shall ever find with me there is my hand on it hope at the last was taken off his guard and took the proffered hand that is a binding action and somehow he could no longer go back then bartley told him he should live in the house at first to break the parting and from this hour said he you are no clerk nor manager but my associate in business and on your own terms thank you said hope with a sigh now lose no time get her into the house at once while the clerks are away and meantime i must deal with the nurse and overcome the many difficulties stay here is a fivepound note buy yourself a new suit and give the child a good meal but pray bring her here in half an hour if you can then bartley took him to the lobby and let him out in the street whilst he went into the house to buy the nurse and make her his confidante he had a good deal of difficulty with her she was shocked at the proposal and being a woman it was the details that horrified her she cried a good deal she stipulated that her darling should have christian burial and cried again at the doubt but as bartley conceded everything and offered to settle a hundred pounds a year on her so long as she lived in his house and kept his secret he prevailed at last and found her an invaluable ally to dispose of this character for the present we must inform the reader that she proved a woman can keep a secret and that in a very short time she was as fond of grace hope as she had been of mary bartley we have said that colonel cliffords talk penetrated moncktons ear but produced no great impression at the time not so however when he had listened to bartleys proposal hopes answer and all that followed then he put this and colonel cliffords communication together and saw the terrible importance of the two things combined thus as a congenital worm grew with jonahs gourd and was sure to destroy it bartleys bold and elaborate scheme was furnished from the outset with a most dangerous enemy leonard monckton was by nature a schemer and by habit a villain and he was sure to put this discovery to profit he came out of the little office and sat down at his desk and fell into a brownstudy he was not a little puzzled and here lay his difficulty two attractive villainies presented themselves to his ingenious mind and he naturally hesitated between them one was to levy blackmail on bartley the other to sell the secret to the cliffords but there was a special reason why he should incline toward the cliffords and whilst he is in his brownstudy we will let the reader into his secret this artful person had immediately won the confidence of young clifford calling himself bolton and had prepared a very heartless trap for him he introduced to him a most beautiful young womantall dark with oval face and glorious black eyes and eyebrows a slight foreign accent and ingratiating manners he called this beauty his sister and instructed her to win walter clifford in that character and to marry him as she was twentytwo and master clifford nineteen he had no chance with her and they were to be married this very day at the register office manoeuvring monckton then inclined to let bartleys fraud go on and ripen but eventually expose it for the benefit of young walter and his wife who adored this monckton because when a beautiful woman loves an ugly blackguard she never does it by halves but he had no sooner thought out this conclusion than there came an obstacle lucy mullers heart failed her at the last moment and she came into the office with a rush to tell her master so she uttered a cry of joy at sight of him and came at him panting and full of love oh leonard i am so glad you are alone leonard dear leonard pray do not insist on my marrying that young man now it comes to the time my heart fails me the tears stood in her glorious eyes and an honest man would have pitied her and even respected her a little for her compunction though somewhat tardy but her master just fixed his eyes coldly on his slave and said brutally never mind your heart think of your interest the weak woman allowed herself to be diverted into this topic why he is no such great catch i am sure i tell you he is more than ever i have just discovered another l he is heir to and not got to wait for that any longer than i choose lucy stamped her foot i dont care for his money till he came with his money you loved me i love you as much as ever said monckton coldly lucy began to sob no you dont or you wouldnt give me up to that young fool the villain made a cynical reply that not every newgate thief could have matched you fool said he cant you marry him and go on loving me you wont be the first it is done every day to the satisfaction of all parties and to their unutterable shame said a clear stern voice at their back walter clifford coming rapidly in had heard but little but heard enough and there he stood grim and pale a boy no longer these two skunks had made a man of him in one moment they recoiled in dismay and the woman hid her face he turned upon the man first you may be sure so you have palmed this lady off on me as your sister and trapped me and would have destroyed me his lip quivered for they had passed the iron through his heart but he manned himself and carried it off like a soldiers son but if i was fool enough to leave my father i am not fool enough to present to the world your castoff mistress as my wife lucy hid her face in her hands here miss lucy moncktonor whatever your name may behere is the marriage license take that and my contempt and do what you like with them with these words he dashed into bartleys private room and there broke down it was a bitter cup the first in his young life the baffled schemers drank wormwood too but they bore it differently the woman cried and took her punishment meekly the man raged and threatened vengeance no no said lucy it serves us right i wish i had never seen the fellow then you would have kept your word and married me i will marry you now if you can obey me obey you leonard you have been my ruin but only marry me and i will be your slave in everythingyour willing devoted happy slave that is a bargain said monckton coolly ill be even with him i will marry you in his name and in his place this puzzled lucy why in his name said she he did not answer well never mind the name said she so that it is the right manand that is you then moncktons fertile brain teeming with villainies fell to hatching a new plot more felonious than the last he would rob the safe and get clifford convicted for the theft convicted as bolton clifford would never tell his real name and lucy should enter the cliffords house with a certificate of his death and a certificate of his marriage both obtained by substitution and so collar his share of the l and off with the real husband to fresh pastures lucy looked puzzled hers was not a brain to disentangle such a monstrous web monckton reflected a moment what is the first thing let me see humph i think the first thing is to get married yes said lucy with an eagerness that contrasted strangely with his cynical composure that is the first thing and the most understandable and she went dancing off with him as gay as a lark and leaning on him at an angle of fortyfive whilst he went erect and cold like a stone figure marching walter clifford came out in time to see them pass the great window he watched them down the street and cursed themnot loud but deep mooning as usual said a hostile voice behind him he turned round and there was mr bartley seated at his own table young clifford walked smartly to the other side of the table determined this should be his last day in that shop there are the payments said he bartley inspected them about one in five said he dryly thereabouts was the reply consummate indifference you cant have pressed them much well i am not good at dunning what are you good at should be puzzled to say you are not fit for trade that is the highest compliment was ever paid me oh you are impertinent as well as incompetent are you then take a weeks warning mr bolton five minutes would suit me better mr bartley oh indeed say one hour all right sir just time for a city clerks luncheonglass of bitter sandwich peep at punch cigarette and a chat with the barmaid mr walter clifford was a gentleman but we must do him the justice to say that in this interview with his employer he was a very impertinent one not only in words but in the delivery thereof bartley however thought this impertinence was put on and that he had grave reasons for being in a hurry he took down the numbers of the notes clifford had given him and looked very grave and suspicious all the time then he locked up the notes in the safe and just then hope opened the door of the little office and looked in at last said bartley well sir said hope i have only been half an hour and i have changed my clothes and stood witness to a marriage she begged me so hard i was at the door such a beautiful girl i could not take my eyes off her the child said bartley with natural impatience i have hidden her in the yard bring her this moment while the clerks are out hope hurried out and soon returned with his child wrapped up in a nice warm shawl he had bought her with bartleys money bartley took the child from him looked at her face and said little darling i shall love her as my own then he begged hope to sit down in the lobby till he should call him and introduce him to his clerks one of them is a thief im afraid he took the child inside and gave her to his confederate the nurse dear me thought hope only two clerks and one of them dishonest i hope it is not that goodnatured boy oh no impossible and now bartley returned and at the same time monckton came briskly in through the little office at sight of him bartley said oh monckton i gave that fellow bolton a weeks notice but he insists on going directly monckton replied slyly that he was sorry to hear that suspicious eh said bartley so suspicious that if i were youindeed mr bartley i think in justice to me the matter ought to be cleared to the bottom you are right said bartley ill have him searched before he goes fetch me a detective at once bartley then wrote a line upon his card and handed it to monckton directing him to lose no time he then rushed out of the house with an air of virtuous indignation and went to make some delicate arrangements to carry out a fraud which begging his pardon was as felonious though not so prosaic as the one he suspected his young clerk of monckton was at first a little taken aback by the suddenness of all this but he was too clearheaded to be long at fault the matter was brought to a point well he must shoot flying in a moment he was at the safe whipped out a bunch of false keys opened the safe took out the cashbox and swept all the gold it contained into his own pockets and took possession of the notes then he locked up the cashbox again restored it to the safe locked that and sat down at bartleys table he ran over the notes with feverish fingers and then took the precaution to examine bartleys daybook his caution was rewardedhe found that the notes bolton had brought in were numbered he instantly made two parcelsclapped the unnumbered notes into his pocket the numbered ones he took in his hand into the lobby now this lobby must be shortly described first there was a door with a glass window but the window had dark blue gauze fixed to it so that nobody could see into the lobby from the office but a person in the lobby by putting his eye close to the gauze could see into the office in a filmy sort of way this door opened on a lavatory and there were also pegs on which the clerks hung their overcoats then there was a swingdoor leading direct to the street and sideways into a small room indispensable to every office monckton entered this lobby and inserted the numbered notes into young cliffords coat and the false keys into his bag then he whipped back hastily into the office with his craven face full of fiendish triumph he started for the detective but it was bitter cold and he returned to the lobby for his own overcoat as he opened the lobby door the swingdoor moved or he thought so he darted to it and opened it but saw nobody hope having whipped behind the open door of the little room monckton then put on his overcoat and went for the detective he met clifford at the door and wore an insolent grin of defiance for which if they had not passed each other rapidly he would very likely have been knocked down as it was walter clifford entered the office flushed with wrath and eager to leave behind him the mortifications and humiliations he had endured he went to his own little desk and tore up lucy mailers letters and his heart turned toward home he went into the lobby and feeling hot which was no wonder bundled his office overcoat and his brush and comb into his bag he returned to the office for his penknife and was going out all in a hurry when mr bartley met him bartley looked rather stern and said a word with you sir certainly sir said the young man stiffly mr bartley sat down at his table and fixed his eyes upon the young man with a very peculiar look you seem in a very great hurry to go well i am you have not even demanded your salary up to date excuse the oversight i was not made for business you know there is something more to settle besides your salary premium for good conduct no sir mr bolton you will find this no jesting matter there are defalcations in the accounts sir the young man turned serious at once i am sorry to hear that sir said he with proper feeling bartley eyed him still more severely and even cash abstracted good heavens said the young man answering his eyes rather than his words why surely you cant suspect me bartley answered sternly i know i have been robbed and so i suspect everybody whose conduct is suspicious this was too much for a clifford to bear he turned on him like a lion your suspicions disgrace the trader who entertains them not the gentleman they wrong you are too old for me to give you a thrashing so i wont stay here any longer to be insulted he snatched up his bag and was marching off when the door opened and monckton with a detective confronted him no roared bartley furious in turn but you will stay to be examined examined searched then if you like it better no dont do that said the young fellow spare me such a humiliation bartley who was avaricious but not cruel hesitated well said he i will examine the safe before i go further mr bartley opened the safe and took out the cashbox it was empty he uttered a loud exclamation why its a clean sweep a wholesale robbery notes and gold all gone no wonder you were in such a hurry to leave luckily some of the notes were numbered search him no no dont treat me like a thief cried the poor boy almost sobbing if you are innocent why object said monckton satirically you villain cried clifford this is your doing i am sure of it monckton only grinned triumphantly but bartley fired up if there is a villain here it is you he is a faithful servant who warned his employer he then pointed sternly at young bolton and the detective stepped up to him and said curtly now sir if i must he then proceeded to search his waistcoat pockets the young man hung his head and looked guilty he had heard of money being put into an innocent mans pockets and he feared that game had been played with him the detective examined his waistcoat pockets and foundnothing his other pocketsnothing the detective patted his breast and examined his stockingsnothing try the bag said monckton then the poor fellow trembled again the detective searched the bagnothing he took the overcoat and turned the pockets outnothing bartley looked surprised monckton still more so meantime hope had gone round from the lobby and now entered by the small office and stood watching a part of this business viz the search of the bag and the overcoat with a bitter look of irony but my safe must have been opened with false keys cried bartley where are they and the numbered notes said monckton where are they gentlemen said hope may i offer my advice who the devil are you said monckton he is my new partner my associate in business said the politic bartley then deferentially to hope what do you advise you have two clerks i would examine them both examine me cried monckton mr bartley will you allow such an affront to be put on your old and faithful servant if you are innocent why object said young clifford spitefully before bartley could answer the remark struck bartley and he acted on it well it is only fair to mr bolton said he come come monckton it is only a form then he gave the detective a signal and he stepped up to monckton and emptied his waistcoat pockets of eightyfive sovereigns there cried walter clifford there there my own money won at the derby said monckton coolly and only a part of it i am happy to say you will find the remainder in banknotes the detective found several notes bartley examined the book and the notes the derby he was beginning to doubt this clerk who attended that meeting on the sly however he was just though no longer confiding i am bound to say that not one of the numbered notes is here the detective was now examining moncktons overcoat he produced a small bunch of keys how did they come there cried monckton in amazement it was an incautious remark bartley took it up directly and pounced on the keys he tried them on the safe one opened the safe another opened the cashbox meantime the detective found some notes in the pocket of the overcoat and produced them great heavens cried monckton how did they come there oh i dare say you know said the detective bartley examined them eagerly they were the numbered notes you scoundrel he roared these show me where your gold and your other notes came from the whole contents of my safein that villains pockets no no cried monckton in agony its all a delusion some rogue has planted them there to ruin me keep that for the beak said the policeman he is sure to believe it come my bloke i knew who was my bird the moment i clapped eyes on the two taint his first job gents you take my word we shall find his photo in some jail or other in time for the assizes away with him cried bartley furiously as the policeman took him off the baffled villains eye fell on hope who stood with folded arms and looked down on him with lowering brow and the deep indignation of the just and yet with haughty triumph that eloquent look was a revelation to monckton ah he cried it was you hopes only reply was this you double felon false accuser and thief you are caught in your own trap and this he thundered at him with such sudden power that the thief went cringing out and even those who remained were awed but hope never told anybody except walter clifford that he had undone moncktons work in the lobby and then the poor boy fell upon his neck and kissed his hand to run forward a little monckton was tried and made no defense he dared not call hope as his witness for it was clear hope must have seen him commit the theft and attempt the other villainy but the false accusation leaked out as well as the theft a previous conviction was proved and the indignant judge gave him fourteen years thus was bartleys fatal secret in mortal peril on the day it first existed yet on that very day it was saved from exposure and buried deep in a jail bartley set hope over his business and was never heard of for months then he turned up in sussex with a little girl who had been saved from diphtheria by tracheotomy and some unknown quack there was a scar to prove it the tender parent pointed it out triumphantly and railed at the regular practitioners of medicine chapter iv an old servant walter clifford returned home pretty well weaned from trade and anxious to propitiate his father but well aware that on his way to reconciliation he must pass through jobation he slipped into clifford hall at night and commenced his approaches by going to the butlers pantry here he was safe and knew it a faithful old butler of the antique and provincial breed is apt to be more unreasonably paternal than pater himself to this worthy then walter owed a good bed a good supper and good advice better not tackle him till i have had a word with him first next morning this worthy butler who for seven years had been a very good servant and for the next seven years rather a bad one and would now have been a hard master if the colonel had not been too great a tartar to stand it appeared before his superior with an air slightly respectful slightly aggressive and very dogged there is a young gentleman would be glad to speak to you if you will let him who is he asked the colonel though by old johns manner he divined cant ye guess dont know why i should it is your business to announce my visitors oh ill announce him when i am made safe that he will be welcome what isnt he sure of a welcomegood dutiful son like him well sir he deserves a welcome why he is the returning prodigal we are not told that he deserved a welcome what signifieshe got one and scripture is the rule of life for men of our age now we are out of the army i think you had better let him plead his own cause john and if he takes the tone you do he will get turned out of the house pretty quick as you will some of these days mr baker we shant go neither of us said mr baker but with a sudden tone of affectionate respect which disarmed the words of their true meaning he added hanging his head for the first time poor young gentleman afraid to face his own father whats he afraid of asked the colonel roughly of you cursing and swearing at him said john cursing and swearing cried the colonela thing i never do now cursing and swearing indeed you be there you go said old john come colonel be a father what has the poor boy done he has deserteda thing i have seen a fellow shot for and he has left me a prey to parental anxieties and so he has me for that matter but i forgive him anyway i should like to hear his story before i condemn him why hes only nineteen and four months come martinmas besides how do we knowhe may have had some very good reason for going his age makes that probable doesnt it i dare say it was after some girl sir call that a good reason i call it a strong one havent you never found it the colonel was betrayed into winking from sixteen to sixty a woman will draw a man where a horse cant since that is so said the colonel dryly you can tell him to come to breakfast am i to say that from you no you can take that much upon yourself i have known you presume a good deal more than that john well sir said john hanging his head for a moment old servants are like old friendsthey do presume a bit but then raising his head proudly they care for their masters young and old new servants sirwhy this lot that weve got now they would not shed a tear for you if you was to be hanged why should they said the colonel a man is not hanged for building churches come beat a retreat ive had enough of you see theres a good breakfast oh said john ive took care of that when the colonel came down he found his son leaning against the mantelpiece but he left it directly and stood erect for the colonel had drilled him with his own hands ugh said the colonel giving a snort peculiar to himself but he thought how handsome the dog is and was proud of him secretly only he would not show it goodmorning sir said the young man with civil respect your most obedient sir said the old man stiffly after that neither spoke for some time and the old butler glided about like a cat helping both of them especially the young one to various delicacies from the side table when he had stuffed them pretty well he retired softly and listened at the door neither of the gentlemen was in a hurry to break the ice each waited for the other walter made the first remarkwhat delicious tea as good as where you come from inquired colonel clifford insidiously a deal better said walter bythebye said the colonel where do you come from walter mentioned the town you astonish me said the colonel i made sure you had been enjoying the pleasures of the capital my purse wouldnt have stood that sir very few purses can said colonel clifford then in an offhand way have you brought her along with you certainly not said walter off his guard her who why the girl that decoyed you from your fathers roof no girl decoyed me from here sir upon my honor whom are we talking about then who is her her why lucy monckton and who is lucy monckton why the girl i fell in love with and she deceived me nicely but i found her out in time and so you came home to snivel no sir i didnt im not such a muff im too much your son to love any woman long when i have learned to despise her i came home to apologize and to place myself under your orders if you will forgive me and find something useful for me to do so i will my boy theres my hand now out with it what did you go away for since it wasnt a petticoat well sir i am afraid i shall offend you not a bit of it after ive given you my hand come now what was it walter pondered and hesitated but at last hit upon a way to explain sir said he until i was six years old they used to give me peaches from oddington house but one fine day the supply stopped and i uttered a small howl to my nurse old john heard me and told me oddington was sold house garden estate and all colonel clifford snorted walter resumed modestly but firmly i was thirteen i used to fish in a brook that ran near drayton park one day i was fishing there when a brown velveteen chap stopped me and told me i was trespassing trespassing said i i have fished here all my life i am walter clifford and this belongs to my father well said the man ive heerd it did belong to colonel clifford onst but now it belongs to muster mills so you must fish in your own water young gentleman and leave ourn to us as owns it till i was eighteen i used to shoot snipes in a rushy bottom near calverley church one day a fellow in black velveteen and gaiters up to his middle warned me out of that in the name of muster cannon colonel clifford who had been drumming on the table all this time looked uneasy and muttered with some little air of compunction they have plucked my feathers deucedly thats a fact hang that fellow stevens persuading me to keep racehorses its all his fault well sir proceed with your observations well i inquired who could afford to buy what we were too poor to keep and i found these wealthy purchasers were all in trade not one of them a gentleman you might have guessed that said colonel clifford it is as much as a gentleman can do to live out of jail nowadays yes sir said walter cotton had bought one of these estates tallow another and lucifermatches the other plague take them all three roared the colonel well then sir said walter i could not help thinking there must be some magic in trade and i had better go into it i didnt think you would consent to that i wasnt game to defy you so i did a meanish thing and slipped away into a merchants office and made your fortune in three months inquired the colonel no i didnt and dont think trade is the thing for me i saw a deal of avarice and meanness and a thief of a clerk got his master to suspect me of dishonesty so i snapped my fingers at them all and here i am but said the poor young fellow i do wish father you would put me into something where i can make a little money so that when this estate comes to be sold i may be the purchaser colonel clifford started up in great emotion sell clifford hall where i was born and you were born and everybody was born those estates i sold were only outlying properties they were beautiful ones said walter i never see such peaches now as you did when you were six years old suggested the colonel no nor you never will ive been six myself lord knows when it was though but sir i dont see any such trout and no such haunts for snipe do you mean to insult me cried the colonel rather suddenly this is what we are come to now heres a brat of six begins taking notes against his own father and he improves on the scotch poethe doesnt print em no he accumulates them cannily until he is twenty but never says a word he loads his gun up to the muzzle and waits as the years roll on with his linstock in his hand and one fine day at breakfast he fires his treble charge of grapeshot at his own father this was delivered so loudly that john feared a quarrel and to interrupt it put in his head and said mighty innocently did you call sir can i do anything for you sir yes go to the devil john went but not downstairs as suggesteda mere lateral movement that ended at the keyhole well but sir said walter halfreproachfully it was you elicited my views confound your views sir andyour impudence youre in the right and i am in the wrong this admission with a more illused tone than ever its the racehorses ring the bell what sawneys you young fellows are it used not to take six minutes to ring a bell when i was your age walter thus stimulated sprang to the bellrope and pulled it all down to the ground with a single gesture the colonel burst out laughing and that did him good and mr baker answered the bell like lightning he quite forgot that the bell must have rung fifty yards from the spot where he was enjoying the dialogue send me the steward john i saw him pass the window meantime the colonel marched up and down with considerable agitation walter who had a filial heart felt very uneasy and said timidly i am truly sorry father that i answered your questions so bluntly im not then said the colonel i hold him to be less than a man who flies from the truth whether it comes from young lips or old i have faced cavalry sir and i can face the truth at this moment the steward entered jackson said the colonel in the very same tone he was speaking in put up my racehorses to auction by public advertisement but sir jenny has got to run at derby and the brown colt at nottingham and the sixyearold gelding at a handicap at chester and the chestnut is entered for the syllinger next year sell them with their engagements and the trainer sir give him his warning and the jockey discharge him on the spot and take him by the ear out of the premises before he poisons the lot keep one of the stableboys and let my groom do the rest but who is to take them to the place of auction sir nobody ill have the auction here and sell them where they stand submit all your books of account to this young gentleman the steward looked a little blue and walter remonstrated gently to me father why you can cipher cant ye rather it is the best thing i do and you have been in trade havent ye why yes then you will detect plenty of swindles if you find out one in ten above all cut down my expenditure to my income a gentleman of the nineteenth century sharpened by trade can easily do that sell clifford hall id rather live on the rabbits and the pigeons and the blackbirds and the carp in the pond and drive to church in the wheelbarrow so for a time walter administered his fathers estate and it was very instructive oh the petty fraudsthe swindles of agencya term which to be sure is derived from the latin word agere to dothe cobweb of petty commissionsthe flat bribesthe smooth hushmoney walter soon cut the expenses down to the income which was ample and even paid off the one mortgage that encumbered this noble estate at five per cent only four per cent of which was really fingered by the mortgagee the balance went to a gobetween though no gobetween was ever wanted for any solicitor in the country would have found the money in a week at four per cent the old gentleman was delighted and engaged his own son as steward at a liberal salary and so walter clifford found employment and a fair income without going away from home again chapter v marys peril whilst mr bartleys business was improving under hopes management hope himself was groaning under his entire separation from his daughter bartley had promised him this should not be but among hopes good qualities was a singular fidelity to his employers and he was also a man who never broke his word so when bartley showed him that the true parentage of grace hopenow called mary bartleycould never be disguised unless her memory of him was interrupted and puzzled before she grew older and that she as well as the world must be made to believe bartley was her father he assented and it was two years before he ventured to come near his own daughter but he demanded to see her at a distance himself unseen and this was arranged he provided himself with a powerful binocular of the kind that is now used at sea instead of the unwieldy old telescope and the little girl was paraded by the nurse who was in the secret she played about in the sight of this strange spy she was plump she was rosy she was full of life and spirit joy filled the fathers heart but then came a bitter pang to think that he had faded out of her joyous life byandby he could see her no longer for a mist came from his heart to his eyes he bowed his head and went back to his business his prosperity and his solitude these experiments were repeated at times moreover bartley had the tact never to write to him on business without telling him something about his girl her clever sayings her pretty ways her quickness at learning from all her teachers and so on when she was eight years old a foreign agent was required in bartleys business and hope agreed to start this agency and keep it going till some more ordinary person could be intrusted to work it but he refused to leave england without seeing his daughter with his own eyes and hearing her voice however still faithful to his pledge he prepared a disguise he actually grew a mustache and beard for this tender motive only and changed his whole style of dress he wore a crimson necktie and dark green gloves with a plaid suit which combination he abhorred as a painter and our respected readers abominate for surely it was some such perverse combination that made a french dressmaker lift her hands to heaven and say quelle immoralite so then bartley himself took his little girl for a walk and met mr hope in an appointed spot not far from his own house poor hope saw them coming and his heart beat high ah said bartley feigning surprise why its mr hope how do you do hope this is my little girl mary my dear this is an old friend of mine give him your hand the girl looked in hopes face and gave him her hand and did not recognize him fine girl for her years isnt she said bartley healthy and strong and quick at her lessons and whats better still she is a good girl a very good girl papa said the child blushing and hid her face behind bartleys elbow all but one eye with which she watched the effect of these eulogies upon the strange gentleman she is all a father could wish said hope tenderly instantly the girl started from her position and stood wrapt in thought her beautiful eyes wore a strange look of dreamy intelligence and both men could see she was searching the past for that voice bartley drew back that the girl might not see him and held up his finger hope gave a slight nod of acquiescence and spoke no more bartley invited him to take an early dinner and talk business before he left he saw his child more than once indeed bartley paraded her accomplishments she played the piano to hope she rode her little shetland pony for hope she danced a minuet with singular grace for so young a girl she conversed with her governess in french or something very like it and she worked a little sewingmachine all to please the strange gentleman and whatever she was asked to do she did with a winning smile and without a particle of false modesty or the real egotism which is at the bottom of false modesty anybody who knew william hope intimately might almost recognize his daughter in this versatile little mind with its faculty of learning so many dissimilar things hope left for the continent with a proud heart a joyful heart and a sore heart she was lovely she was healthy she was happy she was accomplished but she was his no longer not even in name her love was being gained by a stranger and there was a barrier of iron as well as the english channel between william hope and his own mary bartley it would weary the reader were we to detail the small events bearing on the part of the story which took place during the next five years they might be summed up thus that william hope got a peep at his daughter now and then and making a series of subtle experiments by varying his voice as much as possible confused and nullified her memory of that voice to all appearance in due course however father and daughter were brought into natural contact by the last thing that seemed likely to do it viz by bartleys avarice bartleys legitimate business at home and abroad could now run alone so he invited hope to england to guide him in what he loved better than steady business viz speculation the truth is bartley could execute but had few original ideas hope had plenty and sound ones though not common ones hope directed the purchase of convertible securities on this principle select good ones avoid time bargains which introduce a distinct element of risk and buy largely at every panic not founded on a permanent reason or out of proportion example a great district bank broke the shares of a great district railway went down thirty per cent hope bade his employer and pupil observe that this was rank delusion the dividends of the railway were not lowered one per cent by the failure of that bank nor could they be the shareholders of the bank had shares in the railway and were compelled to force them on the market hence the fall in the shares but said hope those depreciated shares are now in the hands of men who can hold them and will too until they return from this ridiculous to their normal value which is from to invest every shilling you have got i shall bartley invested l and cleared twenty per cent in three months example there was a terrible accident on another railway and part of the line broken up vast repairs needed shares fell twenty per cent out of proportion said hope the sum for repairs will not deduct from the dividends onetenth of the annual sum represented by the fall and in three months fear of another such disaster will not keep a single man woman child bullock pig or coal truck off that line put the pot on bartley put the pot on and made fifteen per cent hope said to bartley when an english speculator sends his money abroad at all he goes wild altogether he rushes at obscure transactions and lends to peru or guatemala or tierra del fuego or some shaky place he knows nothing about the insular maniac overlooks the continent of europe instead of studying it and seeking what countries there are safe and others risky now why overlook prussia it is a country much better governed than england especially as regards great public enterprises and monopolies for instance the directors of a prussian railway can not swindle the shareholders by false accounts and passing off loans for dividends against the frauds of directors the english shareholder has only a sham security he is invited to leave his home and come two hundred miles to the directors home and vote in person he doesnt do it why should he in prussia the government protects the shareholder and inspects the accounts severely so much for the superior system of that country now take a map here is hamburg the great port of the continent and berlin the great continental centre and there is one railway only between the two what english railway can compare with this the shares are at but they must go to in time unless the prussian government allows another railway and that is not likely and if so you will have two years to back out this is the best permanent investment of its class that offers on the face of the globe bartley invested timidly but held for years and the shares went up over before he sold do not let your mind live in an island if your body does was a favorite saying of william hope and we recommend it impartially to britons and bornese on one of hopes visits bartley complained he had nothing to do i can sit here and speculate i want to be in something myself i think i will take a farm just to occupy me and amuse me it will not amuse you unless you make money by it suggested hope and nobody can do that nowadays farms dont pay ploughing and sowing dont pay but brains and money pay wherever found together what on a farm why not sir you have only to go with the times observe the condition of produce grain too cheap for a farmer because continents can export grain with little loss fruit dear meat dear because cattle can not be driven and sailed without risk of life and loss of weight agricultural labor rising and in winter unproductive because to farm means to plough and sow and reap and mow and lose money but meet those conditions breed cattle sheep and horses and make the farm their feedingground give fifty acres to fruit have a little factory on the land for winter use and so utilize all your farm hands and the village women who are cheaper laborers than town brats and i think you will make a little money in the form of money besides what you make in gratuitous eggs poultry fruit horses to ride and cart things for the houseitems which seldom figure in a farmers books as money but we stricter accountants know they are ill do it said bartley if youll be my neighbor and work it with me and watch the share market at home and abroad hope acquiesced joyfully to be near his daughter and they found a farm in sussex with hills for the sheep short grass for colts plenty of water enough arable land and artificial grasses for their purpose and a grand sunny slope for their fruit trees fruit bushes and strawberries with which last alone they paid the rent then said hope farm laborers drink an ocean of beer now look at the retail price of beer eighty per cent over its cost and yet deleterious which tells against your labor as an employer of labor the main expense of a farm you want beer to be slightly nourishing and very inspiriting not somniferous so they set up a malthouse and a brewhouse and supplied all their own hands with genuine liquor on the truck system at a moderate but remunerative price and the grains helped to feed their pigs hopes principle was this sell no produce in its primitive form if you change its form you make two profits do you grow barley malt it and infuse it and sell the liquor for two small profits one on the grain and one on the infusion do you grow grass turn it into flesh and sell for two small profits one on the herb and one on the animal and really when backed by money the results seemed to justify his principle hope lived by himself but not far from his child and often when she went abroad his loving eyes watched her every movement through his binocular which might be described as an operaglass ten inches long with a small field but telescopic power grace hope whom we will now call mary bartley since everybody but her father who generally avoided her name called her so was a wellgrown girl of thirteen healthy happy beautiful and accomplished she was the germ of a woman and could detect who loved her she saw in hope an affection she thought extraordinary but instinct told her it was not like a young mans love and she accepted it with complacency and returned it quietly with now and then a gush for she could gush and why not far from us and from our friends be the frigid philosophyof a girl who cant gush hope himself was loyal and guarded and kept his affection within bounds and a sore struggle it was he never allowed himself to kiss her though he was sore tempted one day when he bought her a creamcolored pony and she flung her arms round his neck before mr bartley and kissed him eagerly but he was so bashful that the girl laughed at him and said half pertly excuse the liberty but if you will be such a duck why you must take the consequences said bartley pompously you must not expect middleaged men to be as demonstrative as very young ladies but he has as much real affection for you as you have for him then he has a good deal papa said she sweetly both the men were silent and mary looked to one and the other and seemed a little puzzled the great analysts that have dealt microscopically with commonplace situations would revel in this one and give you a curious volume of small incidents like the above and vivisect the fathers heart with patient skill but we poor dramatists taught by impatient audiences to move on and taught by those great professors of verbosity our female novelists and ninetenths of our male that it is just possible for masterly inactivity alias sluggish narrative creeping through sorry flags and rushes with one lily in ten pages to become a bore are driven on to salient facts and must trust a little to our readers intelligence to ponder on the singular situation of mary bartley and her two fathers one morning mary bartley and her governess walked to a neighboring town and enjoyed the sacred delight of shopping they came back by a shortcut which made it necessary to cross a certain brook or rivulet called the lyn this was a rapid stream and in places pretty deep but in one particular part it was shallow and crossed by large steppingstones twothirds of which were generally abovewater the village girls including mary bartley used all to trip over these stones and think nothing of it though the brook went past at a fine rate and gradually widened and deepened as it flowed till it reached a downright fall after that running no longer down a decline it became rather a languid stream mary and her governess came to this ford and found it swollen by recent rains and foaming and curling round the steppingstones and their tops only were out of the water now the governess objected to pass this current well but said mary the other way is a mile round and papa expects us to be punctual at meals and i am oh so hungry dear miss everett i have crossed it a hundred times but the water is so deep it is deeper than usual but see it is only up to my knee i could cross it without the stones you go round dear and ill explain against you come home not until ive seen you safe over that you will soon see said the girl and fearing a more authoritative interference she gathered up her skirts and planted one dainty foot on the first steppingstone another on the next and so on to the fourth and if she had been a boy she would have cleared them all but holding her skirts instead of keeping her arms to balance herself and wearing idiotic shoes her heels slipped on the fifth stone which was rather slimy and she fell into the middle of the current with a little scream to her amazement she found that the stream though shallow carried her off her feet and though she recovered them she could not keep them but was alternately up and down and driven along all the time floundering oh then she screamed with terror and the poor governess ran screaming too and making idle clutches from the bank but powerless to aid then as the current deepened the poor girl lost her feet altogether and was carried on toward the deep water flinging her arms high and screaming but powerless at first she was buoyed up by her clothes and particularly by a petticoat of some material that did not drink water but as her other clothes became soaked and heavy she sank to her chin and death stared her in the face she lost hope and being no common spirit she gained resignation she left screaming and said to everett pray for me but the next moment hope revived and fear with itthis is a law of naturefor a man bareheaded and his hair flying came galloping on a barebacked pony shouting and screaming with terror louder than both the women he urged the pony furiously to the stream then the beast planted his feet together and with the impulse thus given hope threw himself over the ponys head into the water and had his arm round his child in a moment he lashed out with the other hand across the stream but it was so powerful now as it neared the lasher that they made far more way onward to destruction than they did across the stream still they did near the bank a little but the lasher roared nearer and nearer and the stream pulled them to it with iron force they were close to it now then a willow bough gave them one chance hope grasped it and pulled with iron strength from the bough he got to a branch and finally clutched the stem of the tree just as his feet were lifted up by the rushing water and both lives hung upon that willowtree the girl was on his left arm and his right arm round the willow grace said he feigning calmness put your arm around my neck mary yes dear said she firmly now dont hurry yourselftheres no danger move slowly across me and hold my right arm very tight she did so now take hold of the bank with your left hand but dont let go of me yes dear said the little heroine whose fear was gone now she had hope to take care of her then hope clutched the tree with his left hand pushed mary on shore with his right and very soon had her in his arms on terra firma but now came a change that confounded mary bartley to whom a man was a very superior being only not always intelligible the brave man fell to shaking like an aspen leaf the strong man to sobbing and gasping and kissing the girl wildly oh my child my child then mary of course must gulp and cry a little for sympathy but her quickchanging spirit soon shook it off and she patted his cheek and kissed him and then began to comfort him if you please good dear kind mr hope said she la dont go on like that you were so brave in the water and now the danger is over ive had a ducking that is all ha ha ha and the little wretch began to laugh hope looked amazed neither his heart nor his sex would let him change his mood so swiftly oh my child said he how can you laugh you have been near eternity and if you had been lost what should io god mary turned very grave yes said she i have been near eternity it would not have mattered to youyou are such a good manbut i should have caught it for disobedience but dear mr hope let me tell you that the moment you put your arm round me i felt just as safe in the water as on dry land so you see i have had longer to get over it than you have that accounts for my laughing no it doesnt i am a giddy giggling girl with no depth of character and not worthy of all this affection why does everybody love me they ought to be ashamed of themselves hope told her she was a little angel and everybody was right to love her indeed they deserved to be hanged if they did not mary fixed on the word angel if i was an angel she said i shouldnt be hungry and i am awfully oh please come home papa is so punctual mr hope are you going to tell papa because if you are just you take me and throw me in again id rather be drowned than scolded this with a defiant attitude and flashing eyes no no said hope i will not tell him to vex him and get you scolded then let us run home she took his hand and he ran with her like a playmate and oh the fathers heart leaped and glowed at this sweet companionship after danger and terror when they got near the house mary bartley began to walk and think she had a very thinking countenance at times and hope watched her and wondered what were her thoughts she was very grave so probably she was thinking how very near she had been to the other world standing on the doorstep whilst he stood on the gravel she let him know her thoughts all her life and even at this tender age she had very searching eyes they were gray now though they had been blue she put her hands to her waist and bent those searching eyes on william hope mr hope said she in a resolute sort of way my dear said he eagerly you love me better than papa does thats all and having administered this information as a dry fact that might be worth looking into at leisure she passed thoughtfully into the house chapter vi sharp practice hope paid a visit to his native place in derbyshire and his poor relations shared his prosperity and blessed him and mr bartley upon his report for hope was one of those choice spirits who praise the bridge that carries them safe over the stream of adversity he returned to sussex with all the news and amongst the rest that colonel clifford had a farm coming vacant walter clifford had insisted on a higher rent at the conclusion of the term but the tenant had demurred bartley paid little attention at the time but byandby he said did you not see signs of coal on colonel cliffords property that i did and on this very farm and told him so but he is behind the age i have no patience with him take one of those old iron ramrods that used to load the old musket and cover that ramrod with prejudices a foot and a half deep and there you have colonel clifford well but a tenant would not be bound by his prejudices a tenant a tenant takes no right to mine under a farm lease he would have to propose a special contract or to ask leave and colonel clifford would never grant it there the conversation dropped but the matter rankled in bartleys mind without saying any more to hope he consulted a sharp attorney the result was that he took mary bartley with him into derbyshire he put up at a little inn and called at clifford hall he found colonel clifford at home and was received stiffly but graciously he gave colonel clifford to understand that he had left business all the better said colonel clifford sharply and taken to farming ugh said the other with his favorite snort at this moment who should walk into the room but walter clifford bartley started and stared walter started and stared mr bolton said bartley scarcely above a whisper but colonel clifford heard it and said brusquely bolton no why this is walter clifford my son and my man of businesswalter this is mr bartley proud to make your acquaintance sir said the astute bartley ignoring the past walter was glad he took this line before colonel clifford not that he forgave mr bartley that old affront the reader knows of the judicious bartley read his face and as a first step toward propitiation introduced him to his daughter walter was amazed at her beauty and grace coming from such a stock he welcomed her courteously but shyly she replied with rare affability and that entire absence of mockmodesty which was already a feature in her character to be sure she was little more than fifteen though she was full grown and looked nearer twenty bartley began to feel his way with colonel clifford about the farm he told him he was pretty successful in agriculture thanks to the assistance of an experienced friend and then he said half carelessly bythebye they tell me you have one to let is that so walter said colonel clifford have you a farm to let not at present sir but one will be vacant in a month unless the present tenant consents to pay thirty per cent more than he has done might i see that farm mr walter asked bartley certainly said walter i shall be happy to show you over it then he turned to mary i am afraid it would be no compliment to you ladies are not interested in farms oh but i am since papa is and mr hope and then on our farm there are so many dear little young things little calves little lambs and little pigs little pigs are ducksvery little ones i mean and there is nearly always a young colt about that eats out of my hand not like a farm the idea then i will show you all over ours you and your papa said walter warmly he then asked mr bartley where he was to be found and when bartley told him at the dun cow he looked at mary and said oh mary understood in a moment and laughed and said we are very comfortable i assure you we have the parlor all to ourselves and there are samplers hung up and oh such funny pictures and the landlady is beginning to spoil me already nobody can spoil you mary said mr bartley you ought to know papa for you have been trying a good many years not very many miss bartley said colonel clifford graciously then he gave half a start and said here am i calling her miss when she is my own niece and now i think of it she cant be half as old as she looks i remember the very day she was born my dear you are an impostor bartley changed color at this chance shaft but colonel clifford explained you pass for twenty and you cant be more thanlet me see i am fifteen and four months said mary and i do take people incruelly well said colonel clifford you see you cant take me in i know your date so come and give your old ruffian of an uncle a kiss that i will cried mary and flew at colonel clifford and flung both arms round his neck and kissed him oh papa said she i have got an uncle now a hero too and me that is so fond of heroes only this is my firstout of books mary my dear said bartley you are too impetuous please excuse her colonel clifford now my dear shake hands with your cousin for we must be going mary complied but not at all impetuously she lowered her long lashes and put out her hand timidly and said goodby cousin walter he held her hand a moment and that made her color directly you will come over the farm can you ride have you your habit no cousin but never mind that i can put on a long skirt a skirt but after all it does not matter a straw what you wear mary was such a novice that she did not catch the meaning of this on the spot but halfway to the inn and in the middle of a conversation her cheeks were suddenly suffused with blushes a young man had admired her and said so very likely that was the way with young men no doubt they were bolder than young women but somehow it was not so very objectionable in them that short interview was a little era in marys young life walter had fixed his eyes on her with delight had held her hand some seconds and admired her to her face she began to wonder a little and flutter a little and to put off childhood next day punctual to the minute walter drove up to the door in an open carriage drawn by two fast steppers he found mr bartley alone and why because at sight of walter mary for the first time in her life had flown upstairs to look at herself in the glass before facing the visitor and to smooth her hair and retouch a bow etc underrating as usual the power of beauty and overrating nullities bartley took this opportunity and said to young clifford i owe you an apology and a most earnest one can you ever forgive me walter changed color even this humble allusion to so great an insult was wormwood to him he bit his lip and said no man can do more than say he is sorry i will try to forget it sir that is as much as i can expect said bartley humbly but if you only knew the art the cunning the apparent evidence with which that villain monckton deluded me that i can believe and permit me one observation before we drop this unhappy subject forever if you had done me the honor to come to me as walter clifford why then strong and misleading as the evidence was i should have said appearances are deceitful but no clifford was ever disloyal this artful speech conquered walter clifford he blushed and bowed a little haughtily at the compliment to the cliffords but his sense of justice was aroused you are right said he i must try and see both sides if a man sails under false colors he mustnt howl if he is mistaken for a pirate let us dismiss the subject forever i am walter clifford nowat your service at that moment mary bartley came in beaming with youth and beauty and illumined the room the cousins shook hands and walters eyes glowed with admiration after a few words of greeting he handed mary into the drag her father followed and he was about to drive off when mary cried out oh i forgot my skirt if i am to ride the skirt was brought down and the horses that were beginning to fret dashed off a smart little groom rode behind and on reaching the farm they found another with two saddlehorses one of them a small gentle arab gelding had a sidesaddle they rode all over the farm and inspected the buildings which were in excellent repair thanks to walters supervision bartley inquired the number of acres and the rent demanded walter told him bartley said it seemed to him a fair rent still he should like to know why the present tenant declined perhaps you had better ask him said walter i should wish you to hear both sides that is like you said bartley but where does the shoe pinch in your opinion well he tells me in sober earnest that he loses money by it as it is but when he is drunk he tells his boon companions he has made seven thousand pounds here he has one or two grass fields that want draining but i offer him the pipes he has only got to lay them and cut the drains my opinion is that he is the slave of habit he is so used to make an unfair profit out of these acres that he can not break himself of it and be content with a fair one i dare say you have hit it said bartley well i am fond of farming but i dont live by it and a moderate profit would content me walter said nothing the truth is he did not want to let the farm to bartley bartley saw this and drew mary aside should not you like to come here my child yes papa if you wish it and you know its dear mr hopes birthplace well then tell this young fellow so i will give you an opportunity that was easily managed and then mary said timidly cousin walter we should all three be so glad if we might have the farm three said he who is the third oh somebody that everybody likes and i love it is mr hope such a duck i am sure you would like him hope is his name william yes it is do you know him asked mary eagerly i have reason to know him he did me a good turn once and i shall never forget it just like him cried mary he is always doing people good turns he is the best the truest the cleverest the dearest darling dear that ever stepped and a second father to me and cousin this village is his birthplace and he didnt say much but it was he who told us of this farm and he would be so pleased if i could write and say we are to have the farmcousin walter says so she turned her lovely eyes brimming with tenderness toward her cousin walter and he was done for of course you shall have it he said warmly only you will not be angry with me if i insist on the increased rent you know cousin i have a father too and i must be just to him to be sure you must dear said mary incautiously and the word penetrated walters heart as if a woman of twentyfive had said it all of a sudden and for the first time when they got home mary told mr bartley he was to have the farm if he would pay the increased rent that is all right said bartley then tomorrow we can go home so soon said mary sorrowfully yes said bartley firmly the rest had better be done in writing why mary what is the use of staying on now we are going to live here in a month or two i forgot that said mary with a little sigh it seemed so ungracious to get what they wanted and then turn their backs directly she hinted as much very timidly but bartley was inexorable and they reached home next day mary would have liked to write to walter and announce their safe arrival but nature withheld her she was a child no longer bartley went to the sharp solicitor and had a long interview with him the result was that in about ten days he sent walter clifford a letter and the draft of a lease very favorable to the landlord on the whole but cannily inserting one unusual clause that looked inoffensive it came by post and walter read the letter and told his father whom it was from what does the fellow say grunted colonel clifford he says we are doing very well here but hope says a bailiff can now carry out our system and he is evidently sweet on his native place and thinks the proposed rent is fair and even moderate as for me my life used to be so bustling that i require a change now and then so i will be your tenant hope says i am to pay the expense of the lease so i have requested arrowsmith cox to draw it i have no experience in leases they have drawn hundreds i told them to make it fair if they have not send it back with objections oh oh said colonel clifford he draws the lease does he then look at it with a microscope walter laughed i should not like to encounter him on his own ground but here he is a fish out of water he must be however i will pass my eye over it where the farmer generally overreaches us if he draws the lease is in the clauses that protect him on leaving he gets part possession for months without paying rent and he hampers and fleeces the incoming tenant so that you lose a years rent or have to buy him out now let me see that will be at the end of the documentno it is exceedingly fair this one show it to our man of business and let him study every line set an attorney to catch an attorney of course i shall submit it to our solicitor said walter this was done and the experienced practitioner read it very carefully he pronounced it unusually equitable for a farmers lease however said he we might suggest that he does all the repairs and draining and that you find the materials and also that he insures all the farm buildings but you can hardly stand out for the insurance if he objects theres no harm trying stay here is one clause that is unusual the tenant is to have the right to bore for water or to penetrate the surface of the soil and take out gravel or chalk or minerals if any i dont like that clause he might quarry and cut the farm in pieces ah theres a proviso that any damage to the surface or the agricultural value shall be fully compensated the amount of such injury to be settled by the landlords valuer or surveyor oh come if you can charge your own price that cant kill you in short the draft was approved subject to certain corrections these were accepted the lease was engrossed in duplicate and in due course signed and delivered the old tenant left abusing the cliffords and saying it was unfair to bring in a stranger for he would have given all the money bartley took possession walter welcomed hope very warmly and often came to see him he took a great interest in hopes theories of farming and often came to the farm for lessons but that interest was very much increased by the opportunities it gave him of seeing and talking to sweet mary bartley not that he was forward or indiscreet she was not yet sixteen and he tried to remember she was a child unfortunately for that theory she looked a ripe woman and this very walter made her more and more womanly whenever walter was near she had new timidity new blushes fewer gushes less impetuosity more reserve sweet innocent she was set by nature to catch the man by the surest way though she had no such design oh it was a pretty subtle piece of nature and each sex played its part bold advances of the man with internal fear to offend mock retreats of the girl with internal throbs of complacency and life invested with a new and growing charm to both leaving this pretty little pastime to glide along the flowery path that beautifies young lives to its inevitable climax we go to a matter more prosaic yet one that proved a source of strange and stormy events hope had hardly started the farm when bartley sent him off to belgiumto study coal mines chapter vii the course of true love mr hope left his powerful operaglass with mary bartley one day that walter called she was looking through it at the landscape and handed it to him he admired its power mary told him it had saved her life once oh said he how could that be then she told him how hope had seen her drowning a mile off with it and ridden a barebacked steed to her rescue god bless him cried walter he is our best friend might i borrow this famous glass oh said mary i am not going into any more streams i am not so brave now as i used to be please lend it me for all that of course i will if you wish it strange to say after this whether mary walked out or rode out she very often met mr walter clifford he was always delighted and surprised she was surprised three times and said so and after that she came to lower her lashes and blush but not to start each meeting was a pure accident no doubt only she foresaw the inevitable occurrence they talked about everything in the world except what was most on their minds their soft tones and expressive eyes supplied that little deficiency one day he caught her riding on her little arab the groom fell behind directly after they had ridden some distance in silence walter broke out how beautifully you ride me cried mary why i never had a lesson in my life that accounts for it let a lady alone and she does everything more gracefully than a man but let some cad undertake to teach her she distrusts herself and imitates the snob if you could only see the women in hyde park who have been taught to ride and compare them with yourself i should learn humility no it would make you vain if anything could you seem inclined to do me that good turn come pray what do these poor ladies do to offend you so ill tell you they square their shoulders vulgarly they hold the reins in their hands as if they were driving and they draw the reins to their waists in a coarse absurd way they tighten both these reins equally and saw the poor devils mouth with the curb and the snaffle at one time now you know mary the snaffle is a mild bit and the curb is a sharp one so where is the sense of pulling away at the snaffle when you are tugging at the curb why it is like the fellow that made two holes at the bottom of the doora big one for the cat to come through and a little one for the kitten but the worst of all is they show the caddess so plainly caddess what is that goddess you mean i suppose no i mean a cad of the feminine gender they seem bursting with affectation and elated consciousness that they are on horseback that shows they have only just made the acquaintance of that animal and in a london ridingschool now you hold both reins lightly in the left hand the curb loose since it is seldom wanted the snaffle just feeling the animals mouth and you look right and left at the people you are talking to and dont seem to invite one to observe that you are on a horse that is because you are a lady and a horse is a matter of course to you just as the ground is when you walk upon it the sensible girl blushed at his praise but she said dryly how meritorious cousin walter i have heard that flattery is poison i wont stay here to be poisonedso she finished the sentence in action and with a movement of her body she started her arab steed and turned her challenging eye back on walter and gave him a handgallop of a mile on the turf by the roadside and when she drew bridle her cheeks glowed so and her eyes glistened that walter was dazzled by her bright beauty and could do nothing but gaze at her for ever so long if hope had been at home mary would have been looked after more sharply but if she was punctual at meals that went a long way with robert bartley however the accidental and frequent meetings of walter and mary and their delightful rides and walks were interfered with just as they began to grow into a habit there arrived at clifford hall a formidable personin female eyes especiallya beautiful heiress julia clifford greatniece and ward of colonel clifford very tall graceful with dark gray eyes and black eyebrows the size of a leech that narrowed to a point and met in finer lines upon the bridge of a nose that was gently aquiline but not too large as such noses are apt to be a large expressive mouth with wonderful rows of ivory and the prettiest little black down fine as a hair on her upper lip and a skin rather dark but clear and glowing with the warm blood beneath it completed this noble girl she was nineteen years of age colonel clifford received her with warm affection and oldfashioned courtesy but as he was disabled by a violent fit of gout he deputed walter to attend to her on foot and horseback miss clifford accustomed to homage laid walter under contribution every day she was very active and he had to take her a walk in the morning and a ride in the afternoon he winced a little under this at first it kept him so much from mary but there was some compensation julia clifford was a ladylike rider and also a bold and skillful one the first time he rode with her he asked her beforehand what sort of a horse she would like oh anything said she that is not vicious nor slow a hack or a hunter oh a hunter if i may perhaps you will do me the honor to look at them and select you are very kind and i will he took her to the stables and she selected a beautiful black mare with a coat like satin there said walter despondingly i was afraid you would fix on her she is impossible i cant ride her myself vicious not in the least well then here an old groom touched his hat and said curtly too hot and fidgety miss id as lieve ride of a boiling kettle walter explained the poor thing is the victim of nervousness which i call them as rides her the victims suggested the ancient groom be quiet george she would go sweetly in a steeplechase if she didnt break her heart with impatience before the start but on the road she is impossible if you make her walk she is all over lather in five minutes and shed spoil that sweet habit with flecks of foam my lady has a way of tossing her head and covering you all over with white streaks she wants soothing suggested miss clifford nay miss she wants bleeding o sundays and sweating over the fallows till she drops o weekdays but if she was mine id put her to work a coalcart for six months that would larn her i will ride her said miss clifford calmly her or none saddle her george said walter resignedly ill ride goliah black bess shant plead a bad example goliah is as meek as moses miss clifford he is a gigantic mouse id as lieve ride of a dead man said the old groom mr george said the young lady you seem hard to please may i ask what sort of animal you do like to ride well miss summat between them two when i rides i likes to be at peace if i wants work theres plenty in the yard if i wants fretting and fuming i can go home im a married man ye know but when i crosses a horse i looks for a smart trot and a short stepper or an easy canter on a bit of turf and not to be set to hard labor asticking my heels into goliah nor getting a bloody nose every now and then from black bess athrowing back her uneasy head when i do but lean forward in the saddle i be an old man miss and i looks for peace on horseback if i cant get it nowhere else all this was delivered whilst saddling black bess when she was ready miss clifford asked leave to hold the bridle and walk her out of the premises as she walked her she patted and caressed her and talked to her all the timetold her they all misunderstood her because she was a female but now she was not to be tormented and teased but to have her own way then she asked george to hold the mares head as gently as he could and walter to put her up she was in the saddle in a moment the mare fidgeted and pranced but did not rear julia slackened the reins and patted and praised her and let her go she made a run but was checked by degrees with the snaffle she had a beautiful mouth and it was in good hands at last when they had ridden a few miles they came to a very open country and julia asked demurely if she might be allowed to try her off the road all right said walter and miss julia with a smart decision that contrasted greatly with the meekness of her proposal put her straight at the bank and cleared it like a bird they had a famous gallop but this judicious rider neither urged the mare nor greatly checked her she moderated her black bess came home that day sweating properly but with a marked diminution of lather and foam miss clifford asked leave to ride her into the stableyard and after dismounting talked to her and patted her and praised her an hour later the pertinacious beauty asked for a carrot from the garden and fed black bess with it in the stable by these arts a very light hand and tact in riding she soothed black besss nerves so that at last the very touch of her habit skirt or her hand or the sound of her voice seemed to soothe the poor nervous creature and at last one day in the stable bess protruded her great lips and kissed her fair rider on the shoulder after her manner all this interested and amused walter clifford but still he was beginning to chafe at being kept from miss bartley when one morning her servant rode over with a note dear cousin walterwill you kindly send me back my opera glass i want to see what is going on at clifford hall yours affectionately mary bartley walter wrote back directly that he would bring it himself and tell her what was going on at clifford hall so he rode over and told her of julia cliffords arrival and how his father had deputed him to attend on her and she took up all his time it was beginning to be a bore on the contrary said mary i dare say she is very handsome that she is said walter please describe her a very tall dark girl with wonderful eyebrows and she has broken in black bess that some of us men could not ride in comfort mary changed color she murmured no wonder the hall is more attractive than the farm and the tears shone in her eyes oh mary said walter reproachfully how can you say that what is julia clifford to me i cant tell said mary dryly i never saw you together through my glasses you know walter laughed at this innuendo you shall see us together tomorrow if you will bless one of us with your company i might be in the way that is not very likely will you ride to hammond church tomorrow at about ten and finish your sketch of the tower i will bring miss clifford there and introduce you to each other this was settled and mary was apparently quite intent on her sketch when walter and julia rode up and walter said that is my cousin mary bartley may i introduce her to you of course what a sweet face so the ladies were introduced and julia praised marys sketch and mary asked leave to add her to it hanging with pensive figure over a tombstone julia took an admirable pose and mary with her quick and facile fingers had her on the paper in no time walter asked her in a whisper what she thought of her model i like her said mary she is rather pretty rather pretty why she is an acknowledged beauty a beauty the idea long black thing then they rode all together to the farm there mary was all innocent hospitality and the obnoxious julia kissed her at parting and begged her to come and see her at the hall mary did call and found her with a young gentleman of short stature who was devouring her with his eyes but did not overflow in discourse having a slight impediment in his speech this was mr percy fitzroy julia introduced him and where are you staying percy inquired she at the dddun cow what is that walter explained that it was a small hostelry but one that was occasionally honored by distinguished visitors miss bartley staid there three days i hhope to stay more than that said little percy with an amorous glance at julia miss clifford took mary to her room and soon asked her what she thought of him then anticipating criticism she said there was not much of him but he was such a duck he dresses beautifully was marys guarded remark however when walter rode home with her being now relieved of his attendance on julia she was more communicative said she i never knew before that a man could look like fresh cambric dear me his head and his face and his little whiskers his white scarf his white waistcoat and all his clothes and himself seem just washed and ironed and starched i looked round for the bandbox never mind said walter he is a great addition my duties devolve on him and i shall be free tohow her eyes shone and her voice mellowed when she spoke to him confess now love is a beautiful thing i can not say not experienced in beautiful things and mary looked mighty demure of course not what am i thinking of you are only a child a little more than that please at all events love beautified her i saw no difference she was always a lovely girl why you said she was a long black thing oh that was beforeshe looked engaged after this young fitzroy was generally miss cliffords companion in her many walks and walter clifford had a delightful time with mary bartley her nurse discovered how matters were going but she said nothing from something bartley let fall years ago she divined that bartley was robbing walter clifford by substituting hopes child for his own and she thought the mischief could be repaired and the sin atoned for if he and mary became man and wife so she held her tongue and watched the servants at the hall watched the whole game and saw how the young people were pairing and talked them over very freely the only person in the dark was colonel clifford he was nearly always confined to his room however one day he came down and found julia and percy together she introduced percy to him the colonel was curt but grumpy and percy soon beat a retreat the colonel sent for walter to his room he did not come for some time because he was wooing mary bartley colonel cliffords first word was who was that little stuttering dandy i caught spooning your julia only percy fitzroy only percy fitzroy never despise your rivals sir always remember that young women are full of vanity and expect to be courted all day long i will thank you not to leave the field open a single day till you have secured the prize what prize sir what prize you ninny why the beautiful girl that can buy back oddington and drayton peaches and fruit and all they are both to be sold at this moment what prize why the wife i have secured for you if you dont go and play the fool and neglect her walter clifford looked aghast julia clifford said he pray dont ask me to marry her not ask youbut i do ask you and what is more i command you would you revolt again against your father who has forgiven you and break my heart now i am enfeebled by disease julia clifford is your wife or you are my son no more chapter viii the course of true love the next time walter clifford met mary bartley he was gloomy at intervals the observant girl saw he had something on his mind she taxed him with it and asked him tenderly what it was oh nothing said he dont tell me said she mind nothing escapes my eye come tell me or we are not friends oh come mary that is hard not in the least i take an interest in you bless you for saying so and so if you keep your troubles from me we are not friends nor cousins mary nor anything else well dear mary sooner than not be anything else to you i will tell you and yet i dont like well then if i must it is that dear old wrongheaded father of mine he wants me to marry julia clifford mary turned pale directly i guessed as much said she well she is young and beautiful and rich and it is your duty to obey your father but i cant oh yes you can if you try but i cant try why not cant you guess no well then i love another girl as opposite to her as light is to darkness mary blushed and looked down complimentary to julia she said i pity her opposite for julia is a fine highminded girl ah mary you are too clever for me of course i mean the opposite in appearance as ugly as she is pretty no but she is a dark girl and i dont like dark girls it was a dark girl that deceived me so heartlessly years ago ah and made me hate the whole sex or only the brunettes the whole lot cousin walter i thank you in the name of that small company until i saw you and you converted me in one day only to the blondes only to one of them my sweet mary the situation is serious you whose eye nothing escapesyou must have seen long ago how i love you never mind what i have seen walter said mary whose bosom was beginning to heave very well said walter then i will tell you as if you didnt know it i admired you at first sight every time i was with you i admired you and loved you more and more it is my heaven to see you and to hear you speak whether you are grave or gay saucy or tender it is all one charm one witchcraft i want you for my wife and my child and my friend mary my love my darling how could i marry any woman but you and you could you marry any man but me to break the heart that beats only for you this and the voice of love now ardent now broken with emotion were more than sweet saucy mary could trifle with her head drooped slowly upon his shoulder and her arm went round his neck and the tremor of her yielding frame and the tears of tenderness that flowed slowly from her fair eyes told walter clifford without a word that she was won he had the sense not to ask her for words what words could be so eloquent as this he just held her to his manly bosom and trembled with love and joy and triumph she knew too that she had replied and treated her own attitude like a sentence in rather a droll way but for all that said she i dont mean to be a wicked girl if i can help this is an age of wicked young ladies i soon found that out in the newspapers that and science are the two features and i have made a solemn vow not to be one of themquery a science or a naughty girlmaking mischief between father and son no more you shall dear said walter leave it to me we must be patient and all will come right oh ill be true to you dear if that is all said mary and if you would not mind just temporizing a little for my sake who love you temporize said mary eagerly with all my heart ill temporize till we are all dead and buried oh that will be too long for me said walter oh never do things by halves said the ready girl if his tongue had been as prompt as hers he might have said that temporizing was doing things by halves but he let her have the last word and perhaps he lost nothing for she would have had that whether or no so this day was another era in their love girls after a time are not content to see they are beloved they must hear it too and now walter had spoken out like a man and mary had replied like a woman they were happy and walked hand in hand purring to one another instead of sparring any more on his return home walter found julia marching swiftly and haughtily up and down upon the terrace of clifford hall and he could not help admiring the haughty magnificence of her walk the reason soon appeared she was in a passion she was always tall but now she seemed lofty and to combine the supple panther with the erect peacock in her ireful march such a fine woman as julia really awes a man with her carriage at such a time the poor soul thinks he sees before him the indignation of the just when very likely it is only what in a man would be called petulance anything the matter miss clifford said he obsequiously no sir very stiffly can i be of any service no you can not and then swifter than any weathercock ever turned you are a good creature why should i be rude to you i ought to be ashamed of myself it is that little wretch not our friend fitzroy why what other little wretch is there about we are all grenadiers and maypoles in this house except him well let him go i dare say somebody elsehumand uncle clifford has told me more than once i ought to look higher i couldnt well look lower than five feet nothing ha ha ha i told him so that was cruel dont scold me i wont be lectured by any of you of course it was dear poor little percy oh oh oh and after all this thunder there was a little rain by a law that governs atmosphere and woman impartially seeing her softened and having his own reasons for wishing to keep fitzroy to his duty walter begged leave to mediate if possible and asked if she would do him the honor to confide the grievance to him of course i will said julia he is angry with colonel clifford for not wishing him to stay here and he is angry with me for not making uncle clifford invite him as if i could i should be ashamed to propose such a thing the truth is he is a luxurious little fellow and my society outofdoors does not compensate him for the cookery at the dun cow there let him go but i want him to stay then that is very kind of you isnt it said walter slyly and i must make him stay somehow now tell me isnt he a little jealous a little jealous why he is eaten up with it he is petrie de jalousie then said walter timidly and hesitating at every word you cant be angry if i work on him a little would there be any great harm if i were to say that nobody can see you without admiring you that i have always respected his rights but that if he abandons them julia caught it in a moment she blushed and laughed heartily oh you good sly thing said she and it is the truth for i am as proud as he is vain and if he leaves me i will turn round that moment and make you in love with me walter looked queer this was a turn he had not counted on do you think i couldnt sir said she sharply it is not for me to limit the power of beauty said walter meekly say the power of flattery i could cajole any man in the worldif i chose then you are a dangerous creature and i will make fitzroy my shield im off to the dun cow you are a duck said this impetuous beauty so there she took him round the neck with both hands and gave him a most delicious kiss why he must be mad replied the recipient bluntly she laughed at that and he went straight to the dun cow he found young fitzroy sitting rather disconsolate and opened his errand at once by asking him if it was true that they were to lose him percy replied stiffly that it was true what a pity said walter i ddont think i shall be mmuch mmissed said percy rather sullenly i know two people who will miss you i ddont know one two i assure youmiss clifford and myself come mr fitzroy i will not beat about the bush i am afraid you are mortified and i must say justly mortified at the coolness my father has shown to you but i assure you that it is not from any disrespect to you personally oh indeed said percy ironically no quite the reversehe is afraid of you that is a gggood joke no let me explain fathers are curious people if they are ever so disinterested in their general conduct they are sure to be a little mercenary for their children now you know miss clifford is a beauty who would adorn clifford hall and an heiress whose money would purchase certain properties that join ours you understand yes said the little man starting up in great wrath i understand and its abominable i ththought you were my friend and a mman of hhonor so i am and that is why i warn you in time if you quarrel with miss clifford and leave this place in a pet just see what risks we both run you and i my father will be always at me and i shall not be able to insist on your prior claim he will say you have abandoned it julia will take the huff and you know beautiful women will do strange thingsmad thingswhen once pique enters their hearts she might turn round and marry me you forget sir you are a man of honor but not a man of stone now my dear fitzroy be reasonable suppose that peerless creature went in for female revenge why the first thing she would do would be to make me love her whether i chose or no she wouldnt give me a voice in the matter she would flatter me she would cajole me she would transfix my too susceptible heart with glances of fire and bewitching languor from those glorious eyes dd ahem cried percy turning green walter had no mercy i heard her say once she could make any man love her if she chose so she could said percy ruefully she made me i had an awful ppprejudice against her but there was no resisting then dont subject me to such a trial stick to her like a man so i will bbut it is a mmmortifying position im a man of family we came in with the cconquest and are respected in our ccounty and here i have to meet her on the sly and live at the ddun cow where the cuisine is wretched abbbominable having thus impregnated his mind with that soothing sentiment jealousy walter told him he had a house to let on the estatequite a gentlemans house only a little dilapidated with a fine lawn and garden only neglected into a wilderness but all the better for you said he you have plenty of money and no occupation perhaps that is what leads to these little quarrels it will amuse you to repair the crib and restore the lawn why there is a brook runs through itit isnt every lawn has thatand there used to be waterlilies floating and peonies nodding down at them from the bank a paradise she adores flowers you know why not rent that house from me you will have constant occupation and amusement you will become a rival potentate to my governor you will take the shine out of him directly you have only to give a ball and then all the girls will worship you julia clifford especially for she could dance the devil to a standstill percys eyes flashed when can i have the place said he eagerly in half an hour ill draw you a three months agreement got any paper of course not julia is so near what are those playingcards what do you play patience all by yourself no wonder you are quarrelsome nothing else to bestow your energy on percy denied this imputation the cards were for pistol practice he shot daily at the pips in the yard it is the fiend ennui that loads your pistols and your temper too didnt i tell you so walter then demanded the ace of diamonds and on its face let him the house and premises on a repairing lease for three years rent l a year which was a good bargain for both parties since percy was sure to lay out a thousand pounds or two on the property and to bind julia more closely to him who was worth her weight in gold ten times over walter had brought the keys with him so he drove percy over at once and gave him possession and to do the little fellow justice the moisture of gratitude stood in his eyes when they parted walter told julia about it the same night and her eyes were eloquent too the next day he had a walk with mary bartley and told her all about it she hung upon him and gazed admiringly into his eyes all the time and they parted happy lovers mr bartley met her at the gate mary said he gravely who was that i saw with you just now cousin walter i feared so you are too much with him mary turned red and white by turns but said nothing bartley went on you are a good child and i have always trusted you i am sure you mean no harm but you must be more discreet i have just heard that you and that young man are looked upon as engaged lovers they say it is all over the village of course a father is the last to hear these things does mrs easton know of this oh yes papa and approves it stupid old woman she ought to be ashamed of herself oh papa said mary in deep distress why what objection can there be to cousin walter none whatever as a cousin but every objection to intimacy does he court you i dont know papa i suppose he does does he seek your love he does not say so exactly come mary you have never deceived me does he love you i am afraid he does and if you reject him he will be very unhappy and so shall i i am truly sorry to hear it mary for there are reasons why i can not consent to an engagement between him and you what reasons papa it would not be proper to disclose my reasons but i hope mary that it will be enough to say that colonel clifford has other views for his son and i have other views for my daughter do you think a blessing will attend you or him if you defy both fathers no no said poor mary we have been hasty and very foolish but oh papa have you not seen from the first oh why did you not warn me in time then i could have obeyed you easily now it will cost me the happiness of my life we are very unfortunate poor walter he left me so full of hope what shall i do what shall i do it was mary bartleys first grief she thought all chance of happiness was gone forever and she wept bitterly for walter and herself bartley was not unmoved but he could not change his nature the sum he had obtained by a crime was dearer to him than all his more honest gains he was kind on the surface but hard as marble go to your room my child said he and try and compose yourself i am not angry with you i ought to have watched you but you are so young and i trusted to that woman mary retired sobbing and he sent for mrs easton mrs easton said he for the first time in all these years i have a fault to find with you what is that sir if you please young clifford has been courting that child and you have encouraged it nay sir said the woman i have not done that she never spoke to me nor i to her well then you never interfered no sir no more than you did because i never observed it till today how could i know that sir everybody else observed it mr hope would have been the first to see it if he had been in your place this sudden thrust made bartley wince and showed him he had a tougher customer to deal with than poor mary you cant bear to be found fault with easton said he craftily and i dont wonder at it after fourteen years fidelity to me i take no credit for that said the woman doggedly i have been paid for it no doubt but i dont always get the thing i pay for then let bygones be bygones but just assist me now to cure the girl of this folly sir said the woman firmly it is not folly it is wisest and best for all and i cant make up my mind to lift a finger against it do you mean to defy me then no sir i dont want to go against you nor yet against my own conscience whats left ont i have seen a pretty while it must come to this and i have written to my sister sally she keeps a small hotel at the lakes she is ready to have me and im not too old to be useful to her im worth my board ill go there this very day if you please im as true to you as i can be sir for i see by miss mary crying so you have spoken to her and so now she is safe to come to me for comfort and if she does i shall take her part you may be sure for i love her like my own child here the dogged voice began to tremble but she recovered herself and told him she would go at once to her sister gilbert that lived only ten miles off and next day she would go to the little hotel at the lakes and leave him to part two true lovers if he could and break both their hearts she should wash her hands of it bartley asked a moment to consider shall we be friends still if you leave me like that surely after all these years you will not tell your sister you will not betray me never sir said she what for to bring those two together why it would part them forever i wonder at you a gentleman and in business all your life yet you dont seem to see through the muddy water as i do that is only a plain woman she then told him her clothes were nearly all packed and she could start in an hour you shall have the break and the horses said he with great alacrity everything transpires quickly in a small house and just as she had finished packing in came mary in violent distress what is it true are you going to leave me now my heart is broken oh nurse nurse this was too much even for stouthearted nancy easton oh my child my child she cried and sat down on her box sobbing violently mary infolded in her arms and then they sat crying and rocking together papa does not love me as i do him sobbed mary turning bitter for the first time he breaks my heart and sends you away the same day for fear you should comfort me no my dear said mrs easton you are wrong he does not send me away i go by my own wish oh nurse you desert me then you dont know what has happened oh yes i do i know all about it and im leaving because i cant do what he wishes you see it is this way miss maryyour father has been very good to me and i am his debtor i must not stay here and help you to thwart himthat would be ungratefuland yet i cant take his side against you master has got reasons why you should not marry walter clifford and he told me so himself said mary ah but he didnt tell you his reasons no no more must i but miss mary ill tell you this i know his reasons well his reasons why you should not marry walter clifford are my reasons why you should marry no other man oh nurse oh you dear good angel so when friends differ like black and white tis best to part im going to my sister gilbert this afternoon and tomorrow to my sister sally at her hotel oh nurse must you must you i shall have not a friend to advise or console me till mr hope comes back oh i hope that wont be long now mrs easton dropped her hands upon her knees and looked at mary bartley what miss mary would you go to mr hope in such a matter as this surely you would not have the face not take my breaking heart to mr hope cried mary with a sudden flood of tears you might as well tell me not to lay my trouble before my god dear dear mr hope who saved my life in those deep waters and then cried over me darling dear i think more of that than of his courage do you think i am blind he loves me better than my own father does and it is not a young mans love it is an angels not cry to him when i am in the deep waters of affliction i could not write of such a thing to him for blushing but the moment he returns i shall find some way to let him know how happy i have been how brokenhearted i am and that papa has reasons against him and they are your reasons for him and that you are both afraid to let me know these curious reasonsme the poor girl whose heart is being made a football of in this house oh oh oh dont cry miss mary said nurse easton tenderly and pray dont excite yourself so why i never saw you like this before had i ever the same reason you have only known the happy thoughtless child they have made a woman of me now and my peace is gone i must not defy my father and i will not break poor walters heartthe truest heart that ever beat not tell dear mr hope ill tell him everything if im cut in pieces for it and her beautiful eyes flashed lightning through her tears hum said mrs easton under her breath and looking down at her own feet and pray what does hum mean asked mary fixing her eyes with prodigious keenness on the womans face well i dont suppose hum means anything said mrs easton still looking down doesnt it said mary with such a face as that it means a volume and ill make it my business to read that volume hum and mr hope shall help me chapter ix lovers parted walter little dreaming the blow his own love had received made percy write julia an apology and an invitation to visit his new house if he was forgiven julia said she could not forgive him and would not go walter said put on your bonnet and take a little drive with me oh with pleasure said julia slyly so then walter drove her to the new house without a word of remonstrance on her part and fitzroy met her radiant and walter slipped away round a corner and when he came back the quarrel had dissolved he had brought a hamper with all the necessaries of lifetablecloth napkins knives forks spoons cold pie salad and champagne they lunched beside the brook on the lawn the lovers drank his health and julia appointed him solemnly to the post of peacemaker for said she you have shown great talent that way and i foresee we shall want one for we shall be always quarrelling shant we percy no nnever again then you mustnt be jealous im not i ddespise jjealousy im above it oh indeed said julia dryly come dont begin again you two said walter orno champagne now what a horrid threat said julia ill be good for one in short they had a merry time and walter drove julia home both were in high spirits in the hall walter found a short note from mary bartley dear dear walteri write with a bleeding heart to tell you that papa has only just discovered our attachment and i am grieved to say he disapproves of it and has forbidden me to encourage your love that is dearer to me than all the world it is very hard it seems so cruel but i must obey do not make obedience too difficult dear walter and pray pray do not be as unhappy as i am he says he has reasons but he has not told me what they are except that your father has other views for you but indeed with both parents against us what can we do forgive me the pain this will give you ask yourself whether it gives me any less you were all the world to me now everything is dull and distasteful what a change in one little day we are very unfortunate but it can not be forever and if you will be constant to me you know i shall to you i could not change ah walter i little thought when i said i would temporize how soon i should be called on to do it i cant write any more for crying i do nothing but cry ever since papa was so cruel but i must obey your loving sorrowful mary this letter was a chilling blow to poor walter he took it into his own room and read it again and again it brought the tears into his own eyes and discouraged him deeply for a time but of course he was not so disposed to succumb to authority as the weaker vessel was he wrote back my own lovedont grieve for me i dont care for anything so long as you love me i shall resist of course as for my father i am going to marry julia to percy fitzroy and so end my governors nonsense as for your father i do not despair of softening him it is only a check it is not a defeat who on earth can part us if we are true to each other god bless you dearest i did not think you loved me so much your letter gives me comfort forever and only disappointment for a time dont fret sweet love it will be all right in the end your grateful hopeful love till death walter mary opened this letter with a beating heart she read it with tears and smiles and utter amazement she knew so little about the male character that this way of receiving a knockdown blow astonished and charmed her she thought to herself no wonder women look up to men they will have their own way they resist of course how sensible we give in right or wrong what a comfort i have got a man to back me and not a poor sorrowing despairing obeying thing like myself so she was comforted for the minute and settled in her own mind that she would be good and obedient and walter should do all the fighting but letters soon cease to satisfy the yearning hearts of lovers unnaturally separated walter and mary lived so near each other yet now they never met bartley took care of that he told mary she must not walk out without a maid or ride without a servant and he gave them both special orders he even obliged her with his own company though that rather bored him under this severe restraint marys health and spirits suffered and she lost some of her beautiful color walters spirits were kept up only by anger julia clifford saw he was in trouble and asked him what was the matter oh nothing that would interest you said he rather sullenly excuse me said she i am always interested in the troubles of my friends and you have been a good friend to me it is very good of you to think so well then yes i am unhappy i am crossed in love is it that fair girl you introduced me to when out riding yes she is lovely miss clifford she is an angel ha ha we are all angels till we are found out who is the man what man that she prefers to my good walter she deserves a good whipping your angel much obliged to you miss clifford but she prefers no man to your good walter though i am not worthy to tie her shoes why we are devoted to each other well you neednt fly out at me i am your friend as you will see make me your confidante explain please how can you be crossed in love if theres no other man its her father he has discovered our love and forbids her to speak to me her father said julia contemptuously is that all that for her father you shall have her in spite of fifty fathers if it had been a lover now i should have talked to him not to you said walter with his eyes flashing be quiet walter as it is not a lover nor even a mother you shall have the girl and a very sweet girl she is will you accept me for your ally women are wiser than men in these things and understand one another oh miss clifford said walter this is good of you of course it will be a great blessing to us both to have your sympathy and assistance well then said julia begin by telling mehave you spoken to her father no then that is the very first thing to be done come order our horses we will ride over directly i will call on miss bartley and you on mister now mind you must ignore all that has passed and just ask his permission to court his daughter whilst you are closeted with him the young lady and i will learn each others minds with a celerity you poor slow things have no idea of i see one thing said walter that i am a child in such matters compared with you what decision what promptitude then imitate it young man order the horses directly and she stamped her foot impatiently walter turned to the stables without another word and julia flew upstairs to put on her ridinghabit bartley was in his study with a map of the farm before him and two respectable but rather rough men in close conference over it these were practical men from the county of durham whom he had ferreted out by means of an agent men who knew a great deal about coal they had already surveyed the farm and confirmed hopes opinion that coal lay below the surface of certain barren fields and the question now was as to the exact spot where it would be advisable to sink the first shaft bartley was heart and soul in this and elevated by love of gain far above such puny considerations as the happiness of mary bartley and her lover she poor girl sat forlorn in her little drawingroom and tried to draw a bit and tried to read a bit and tried to reconcile a new german symphony to her ear as well as to her judgment which told her it was too learned not to be harmonious though it sounded very discordant but all these efforts ended in a sigh of despondency and in brooding on innocent delights forbidden and a prospect which to her youth and inexperience seemed a wilderness robbed of the sun whilst she sat thus pensive and sad there came a sudden rush and clatter of hoofs and miss clifford and walter clifford reined up their horses under the very window mary started up delighted at the bare sight of walter but amazed and puzzled the next moment her quick intelligence told her this was some daring manoeuvre or other and her heart beat high walter opened the door and stood beside it affecting a cold ceremony miss bartley i have brought miss clifford to call on you at her request my own visit is to your father where shall i find him in his study murmured miss bartley walter returned and the two ladies looked at each other steadily for one moment and took stock of one anothers dress looks character and souls with supernatural rapidity then mary smiled and motioned her visitor to a seat and waited miss clifford made her approaches obliquely at first i ought to apologize to you for not returning your call before this at any rate here i am at last you are most welcome miss clifford said mary warmly now the ice is broken i want you to call me julia may i you may and you must if i call you mary why you know we are cousins at least i suppose so we are both cousins of walter clifford so we must be cousins to each other and she fixed her eyes on her fair hostess in a very peculiar way mary returned this fixed look with such keen intelligence that her gray eyes actually scintillated mary i seldom waste much time before i come to the point walter clifford is a good fellow he has behaved well to me i had a quarrel with mine and walter played the peacemaker and brought us together again without wounding my pride byandby i found out walter himself was in grief about you it was my turn wasnt it i made him tell me all he wasnt very willing but i would know i see his love is making him miserable and so is yours dear oh yes so i took it on me to advise him i have made him call on your father fathers sometimes poohpooh their daughters affections but when the son of colonel clifford comes with a formal proposal of marriage mr bartley can not poohpooh him mary clasped her hands but said nothing julia flowed on and the next thing is to comfort you you seem to want a good cry dear yes i ddo then come here and take it no sooner said than done marys head on julias shoulder and julias arm round marys waist are you better dear oh so much it is a comfort isnt it well now listen to me fathers sometimes delay a girls happiness but they dont often destroy it they dont go and break her heart as some mothers do a mother that is resolved to have her own way brings another man forward fathers are too simple to see that is the only way and then a designing mother cajoles the poor girl and deceives her and does a number of things a man would call villainies dont you fret your heart out for so small a thing as a fathers opposition you are sure to tire him out if he loves you and if he doesnt love you or loves money better why then he is not a worthy rival to my cousin walter for that man really loves you and would marry you if you had not a penny so would percy fitzroy marry me and that is why i prefer him to the grenadiers and plungers with silky mustaches and half an eye on me and an eye and a half on my money many other things passed between these two but what we have endeavored to repeat was the cream of julias discourse and both her advice and her sympathy were for the time a wonderful comfort to the lovesick solitary girl but our business is with walter clifford as soon as he was announced mr bartley dismissed his rugged visitors and received walter affably though a little stiffly walter opened his business at once and told him he had come to ask his permission to court his daughter he said he had admired her from the first moment and now his happiness depended on her and he felt sure he could make her happy not of course by his money but by his devotion then as to making a proper provision for her here bartley stopped him my young friend said he there can be no objection either to your person or your position but there are difficulties and at present they are serious ones your father has other views but mr bartley said walter eagerly he must abandon them the lady is engaged well then said bartley it will be time to come to me when he has abandoned those views and also overcome his prejudices against me and mine but there is another difficulty my daughter is not old enough to marry and i object to long engagements everything therefore points to delay and on this i must insist bartley having taken this moderate ground remained immovable he promised to encourage no other suitor but in return he said he had a right to demand that walter would not disturb his daughters peace of mind until the prospect was clearer in short instead of being taken by surprise the result showed bartley quite prepared for this interview and he baffled the young man without offending him he was cautious not to do that because he was going to mine for coal and feared remonstrances and wanted walter to take his part or at least to be neutral knowing his love for mary so they parted good friends but when he retailed the result to julia clifford she shook her head and said the old fox had outwitted him soon after knitting her brows in thought for some time she said she is very young much younger than she looks i am afraid you will have to wait a little and watch but said walter in dismay am i not to see her or speak to her all the time i am waiting id see both fathers hanged first if i was a man said julia in short under the courageous advice of julia clifford walter began to throw himself in marys way and look disconsolate that set mary pining directly and julia found her pale and grieving for walter and persuaded her to write him two or three lines of comfort she did and that drew pages from him unfortunately he did not restrain himself but flung his whole heart upon paper and raised a tumult in the innocent heart of her who read his passionate longings she was so worked upon that at last one day she confided to julia that her old nurse was going to visit her sister mrs gilbert who lived only ten miles off and she thought she should ride and see her when asked julia carelessly oh any day next week said mary carelessly wednesday if it is fine she will not be there till monday does she know asked julia oh yes and left because she could not agree with papa about it and dear she said a strange thinga very strange thing she knew papas reasons against him and they were her reasons for him fancy that said julia your father told you what the reasons were no he wouldnt they both treat me like a child you mean they pretend to she added i see one thing there is some mystery behind this i wonder what it is ten to one it is money i am only twenty but already i have found out that money governs the world let me seeyour mother was a clifford she must have had money did she settle any on you i am sure i dont know ten to one she did and your father is your trustee and when you marry he must show his accounts and cash up there that is where the shoe pinches mary was distressed oh dont say so dear i cant bear to think that of papa you make me very unhappy forgive me dear said julia i am too bitter and suspicious some day i will tell you things in my own life that have soured me moneyi hate the very word she said clinching her teeth she urged her view no more but in her own heart she felt sure that she had read mr bartley aright why he was a trader into the bargain as for mary when she came to think over this conversation her own subtle instinct told her that stronger pressure than ever would now be brought on her her timidity her maiden modesty and her desire to do right set her on her defense she determined to have loving but impartial advice and so she overcame her shyness and wrote to mr hope even then she was in no hurry to enter on such a subject by letter so she must commence by telling him that her father had set a great many people most of them strangers to dig for coal that cross old thing colonel clifford had been heard to sneer at her dear father and say unkind and disrespectful thingsthat the love of money led to loss of money and that papa might just as well dig a well and throw his money into that she herself was sorry he had not waited for mr hopes return before undertaking so serious a speculation warmed by this preliminary she ventured into the delicate subject and told him the substance of what we have told the reader only in a far more timid and suggestive way and implored him to advise her by return of post if possibleor why not come home papa had said only yesterday i wish hope was here she got an answer by return of post it disappointed her on the whole mr hope realized the whole situation though she had sketched it faintly instead of painting it boldly he was all sympathy and he saw at once that he could not himself imagine a better match for her than walter clifford but then he observed that mr bartley himself offered no personal objection but wished the matter to be in abeyance until she was older and colonel cliffords objection to the connection should be removed or softened that might really be hoped for should miss clifford marry mr fitzroy and really in the mean time he hope could hardly take on him to encourage her in impatience and disobedience he should prefer to talk to bartley first with him he should take a less hesitating line and set her happiness above everything in short he wrote cautiously he inwardly resolved to be on the spot very soon whether bartley wanted him or not but he did not tell mary this mary was disappointed how kind and wise he is she said to juliatoo wise next wednesday morning mary bartley rode to mrs gilbert and was received by her with courtesy but with a warm embrace by mrs easton after a while the latter invited her into the parlor saying there is somebody there but no one knows this however though hardly unexpected set marys heart beating and when the parlor door was opened mrs easton stepped back and mary was alone with walter clifford then might those who oppose an honest and tender affection have learned a lesson it was no longer affection only it was passion walter was pale agitated eager he kissed her hands impetuously and drew her to his bosom she sobbed there he poured inarticulate words over her and still held her panting to his beating heart even when the first gush of love subsided a little he could not be so reasonable as he used to be he was wild against his own father hers and every obstacle and implored her to marry him at once by special license and leave the old people to untie the knot if they could then mary was astonished and hurt a clandestine marriage mr clifford said she i thought you had more respect for me than to mention such a thing then he had to beg her pardon and say the separation had driven him mad then she forgave him then he took advantage of her clemency and proceeded calmly to show her it was their only chance then mary forgot how severely she had checked him and merely said that was the last thing she would consent to and bound him on his honor never to mention to julia clifford that he had proposed such a thing walter promised that readily enough but stuck to his point and as marys pride was wounded and she was a girl of great spirit though lovesick she froze to him and soon after said she was very sorry but she must not stay too long or papa would be angry she then begged him not to come out of the parlor or the servant would see him that is a trifle said walter i am going to obey you in greater things than that ah mary mary you dont love me as i love you no walter said mary i do not love you as you love me for i respect you then her lip trembled and her eyes filled with tears walter fell on his knees and kissed her skirt several times then ended with her hand oh dont harbor such a thought as that said he she sobbed but made no reply they parted good friends but chilled that made them both unhappy to think of it was only two or at the most three days after this that as mary was walking in the garden a nosegay fell at her feet she picked it up and immediately found a note half secreted in it the next moment it was entirely secreted in her bosom she sauntered indoors and scudded upstairs to her room to read it the writer told her in a few agitated words that their fathers had met and he must speak to her directly would she meet him for a moment at the garden gate at nine oclock that evening no no no cried mary as if he was there she was frightened suppose they should be caught the shamethe disgrace but oh the temptation well then how wrong of him to tempt her she must not go there was no time to write and refuse but she must not go she would not go and in this resolution she persisted nine oclock struck and she never moved then she began to picture walters face of disappointment and his unhappiness at ten minutes past nine she tied a handkerchief round her head and went there he was at the gate pale and agitated he did not give her time to scold him pray forgive me he said but i saw no other way it is all over mary unless you love me as i love you dont begin by doubting me she said tell me dear it is soon told our fathers have met at that wretched pit and the foreman has told me what passed between them my father complained that mining for coal was not husbandry and it was very unfair to do it and to smoke him out of house and home unfortunately the wind was west and blew the smoke of the steamengine over his lawn your father said he took the farm under that express stipulation colonel clifford said no the condition was smuggled in then smuggle it out said mr bartley oh if it had only ended there mary but they were both in a passion and must empty their hearts colonel clifford said he had every respect for you but had other views for his son mr bartley said he was thankful to hear it for he looked higher for his daughter higher in trade i suppose said my father the lord mayors nephew well said mr bartley i would rather marry her to money than to mortgages and the end of it was they parted enemies for life no no not for life for life mary it is an old grudge revived indeed the first quarrel was only skinned over dont deceive yourself we have nothing to do but disobey them or part and you can say that walter oh have a little patience so i would said walter if there was any hope but there is none there is nothing to wait for but the death of our parents and by that time i shall be an elderly man and you will have lost your bloom and wasted your youthfor what no i feel sometimes this will drive me mad or make me a villain i am beginning to hate my own father and everybody else that thwarts my love how can they earn my hate more surely no mary i see the future as plainly as i see your dear face so pale and shocked i cant help it if you will marry me and so make sure i will keep it secret as long as you like i shall have got you whatever they may say or do but if you wont ill leave the country at once and get peace if i cant get love leave the country said mary faintly what good would that do i dont know perhaps bring my father to his senses for one thing andwho knowsperhaps you will listen to reason when you see i cant wait for the consent of two egotistsfor that is what they both arethat have no real love or pity for you or me ah said mary with a deep sigh i see even men have their faults and i admired them so they are impatient selfish yes if it is selfish to defend ones self against brutal selfishness i am selfish and that is better than to be a slave to egotists and lie down to be trodden on as you would do come mary for pitys sake decide which you love bestyour father who does not care much for you or me who adore you and will give you a life of gratitude as well as love if you will only see things as they are and always will be and trust yourself to me as my dear dear blessed adored wife i love you best said mary and i hope it is not wicked but i love him too though he does say wait and i respect myself and i dare not defy my parent and i will not marry secretly that is degrading and oh walter think how young i am and inexperienced and you that are so much older and i hoped would be my guide and make me better is it you who tempt me to clandestine meetings that i blush for and a clandestine marriage for which i should despise myself walter turned suddenly calm for these words pricked his conscience you are right said he i am a blackguard and you are an angel of purity and goodness forgive me i will never tempt nor torment you again for pitys sake forgive me you dont know what mens passions are forgive me with all my heart dear said mary crying gently he put both arms suddenly round her neck and kissed her wet eyes with a sigh of despair then he seemed to tear himself away by a great effort and she leaned limp and powerless on the gate and heard his footsteps die away into the night they struck chill upon her foreboding heart for she felt that they were parted chapter x the gordian knot walter however would not despair until he had laid the alternative before his father he did so firmly but coolly his father irritated by the scene with bartley treated walters proposal with indignant scorn walter continued to keep his temper and with some reluctance asked him whether he owed nothing not even a sacrifice of his prejudices to a son who had never disobeyed him and had improved his circumstances come sir said he when the happiness of my life is at stake i venture to lay aside delicacy and ask you whether i have not been a good son and a serviceable one to you yes walter said the colonel with this exception then now or never give me my reward ill try said the grim colonel but i see it will be hard work however ill try and save you from a mesalliance a mesalliance sir why she is a clifford the deuce she is as much a clifford as i am that is news to me why one of her parents was a clifford and your own sister and one of mine was an irish woman yes an oryan not a trader not a smallcoal man like the marquis of londonderry sir and the earl of durham come father dont sacrifice your son and his happiness and his love for you to notions the world has outlived commerce does not lower a gentleman nor speculation either in these days the nobility and the leading gentry of these islands are most of them in business they are all shareholders and often directors of railways and just as much traders as the old coach proprietors were they let their land and so do you to the highest bidder not for honor or any romantic sentiment but for money and that is trade mr bartley is his own farmer well so was mr coke of norfolk and the queen made him a peer for itwhat a sensible sovereign are rothschild and montefiore shunned for their speculations by the nobility whom do their daughters marry trade rules the world and keeps it from stagnation genius writes or paints or plays hamletfor money and is respected in exact proportion to the amount of money it gets charity holds bazars and sells at one hundred per cent profit and nearly every new church is a trade speculation is my happiness and hers to be sacrificed to the chimeras and crotchets that everybody in england but you has outlived all this replied the unflinching sire i have read in the papers and my son shall not marry the daughter of a trader and cad who has insulted me grossly but that i presume you dont object to this stung walter so that he feared to continue the discussion i will not reply said he you drive me to despair i leave you to reflect perhaps you will prize me when you see me no more with this he left the room packed up his clothes went to the nearest railway off to london collected his funds crossed the water and did not write one word to clifford hall except a line to julia left england heartbroken the victim of two egotists and my sweet marys weak conscientiousness god forgive me i am angry even with her but i dont doubt her love this missive and the general consternation at clifford hall brought julia full gallop to mary bartley they read the letter together and julia was furious against colonel clifford but mary interposed i am afraid said she that i am the person who was most to blame why what have you done he said our case was desperate and waiting would not alter it and he should leave the country unless unless what how can i advise you if you have any concealments from me well then it was unless i would consent to a clandestine marriage and you refusedvery properly and i refusedvery properly one would thinkand what is the consequence i have driven the man i love away from his friends as well as from me and now i begin to be very sorry for my properness but you dont blush for it as you would for the other the idea to be married on the sly and to have to hide it from everybody and to be found out at last or else be suspected of worse things what worse things never you mind child your womanly instinct is better than knowledge or experience and it has guided you straight if you had consented i should have lost my respect for you and then as the small view of a thing is apt to enter the female head along with the big view she went on with great animation and then for a young lady to sneak into a church without her friends with no carriages no favors no wedding cake no bishop no proper dress not even a bridal veil fit to be seen why it ought to be the great show of a girls life and she ought to be a public queen at all events for that one day for ten to one she will be a slave all the rest of her life if she loves the fellow she paused for breath one moment and it isnt as if you were low people why it reminds me of a thing i read in some novel a city clerk or some such person took a walk with his sweetheart into the country and all of a sudden he said why there is something hard in my pocket what is it i wonder a plain gold ring does it fit you try it on polly why it fits you i declare then keep it till further orders then they walked a little further why what is this two pairs of white gloves try the little pair on and i will try the big ones stop i declare heres a church and the bells beginning to ring why who told them that ive got a special license in my pocket hallo there are two fellows hanging about best men witnesses or some such persons i should not wonder i think i know one of them and here is a parson coming over a stile what an opportunity for us now just to run in and get married come on old girl lend me that wedding ring a minute ill give it you back again in the church no thank you mr walter we love you very dearly but we are ladies and we respect ourselves in short julia confirmed mary bartley in her resolution but she could not console her under the consequences walter did not write a line even to her she couldnt but fear that he was really in despair and would cure himself of his affection if he could she began to pine the roses faded gradually out of her cheeks and mr bartley himself began at last to pity her for though he did not love her he liked her and was proud of her affection another thing hope might come home now any day and if he found the girl sick and pining he might say this is a breach of contract he asked mary one day whether she wouldnt like a change i could take you to the seaside said he but not very cordially no papa said mary why should you leave your mine when everything is going so prosperously i think i should like to go to the lakes and pay my old nurse a visit and she would talk to you of walter clifford yes papa said mary firmly she would and thats the only thing that can do me any good well mary said bartley if she could be content with praising him and regretting the insuperable obstacles and if she would encourage you to be patientthere let me think of it things went hard with colonel clifford he felt his sons desertion very bitterly though he was too proud to show it he now found out that universally as he was respected it was walter who was the most beloved both in the house and in the neighborhood one day he heard a multitude shouting and soon learned the reason bartley had struck a rich vein of coal and tons were coming up to the surface colonel clifford would not go near the place but he sent old baker to inquire and baker from that day used to bring him back a number of details some of them especially galling to him by degrees and rapid ones bartley was becoming a rival magnate the poor came to him for the slack or very small coal and took it away gratis they flattered him and to please him spoke slightingly of colonel clifford which they had never ventured to do before but soon a circumstance occurred which mortified the old soldier more than all he was sole proprietor of the village and every house in it with the exception of a certain beerhouse flanked by an acre and a half of ground this beerhouse was a great eyesore to him he tried to buy this small freeholder out but the man saw his advantage and demanded lnearly treble the real value walter however by negotiating in a more friendly spirit had obtained a reduction and was about to complete the purchase for l but when walter left the country the proprietor never dreamed of going again to the haughty colonel he went to bartley and bartley bought the property in five minutes for l and paid a deposit to clinch the contract he completed the purchase with unheardof rapidity and set an army of workmen to raise a pit village or street of eighty houses they were ten times better built than the colonels cottages not one of them could ever be vacant they were too great a boon to the miners nor could the rent be in arrears with so sharp a hand as the mineowner the beerhouse was to be perpetuated and a nucleus of custom secured from the miners partly by the truck system and partly by the superiority of the liquor for bartley announced at once that he should brew the beer all these things were too much for a man with gout in his system colonel clifford had a worse attack of that complaint than ever it rose from his feet to other parts of his frame and he took to his bed in that condition a physician and surgeon visited him daily and his lawyer also was sent for and was closeted with him for a long time on more than one occasion all this caused a deal of speculation in the village and as a system of fetch and carry was now established by which the rival magnates also received plenty of information though not always accurate about each other mr bartley heard what was going on and put his own construction upon it just when mr hope was expected to return came a letter to mary to say that he should be detained a day or two longer as he had a sore throat and fever but nothing alarming three or four days later came a letter only signed by him to say he had a slight attack of typhoid fever and was under medical care mary implored mr bartley to let her go to him he refused and gave his reasons which were really sufficient and now he became more unwilling than ever to let her visit mrs easton this was the condition of affairs when one day an old man with white hair dressed in black and looking almost a gentleman was driven up to the farm by colonel cliffords groom and asked in an agitated voice if he might see miss mary bartley her visitors were so few that she was never refused on speculation so john baker was shown at once into her drawingroom he was too much agitated to waste time oh miss bartley said he we are in great distress at the hall mr walter has gone and not left his address and my poor master is dying mary uttered an unfeigned exclamation of horror ah miss said the old man god bless you you feel for us im not on the old mans side miss im on mr walters side in this as i was in the other business but now i see my poor old master lying pale and still not long for this world i do begin to blame myself i never thought that he would have taken it all to heart like this but there the only thing now is to bring them together before he goes we dont know his address miss we dont know what country he is in he sent a line to miss clifford a month ago from dover but that is all but in course he writes to youthat stands to reason youll give me his address miss wont you and we shall all bless you mary turned pale and the tears streamed down her eyes oh sir said she id give the world if i could tell you i know who you are my poor walter has often spoken of you to me mr baker one word from you would have been enough i would have done anything for you that i could but he has never written to me at all i am as much deserted as any of you and i have felt it as deeply as any father can but never have i felt it as now what the father to die and his sons hand not in his no looks of love and forgiveness to pass between them as the poor old man leaves this world its ambitions and its quarrels and perhaps sees for the first time how small they all are compared with the love of those that love us and the peace of god then this ardent girl stretched out both her hands o god if my frivolous life has been innocent dont let me be the cause of this horrible thing dont let the father die without comfort nor the son without forgiveness for a miserable girl who has come between them and meant no harm this eloquent burst quite overpowered poor old john baker he dropped into a chair his white head sunk upon his bosom he sobbed and trembled and for the first time showed his age what on earth is the matter said mr bartleys voice as cold as an icicle at the door mary sprang toward him impetuously oh papa she cried colonel clifford is dying and we dont know where walter is we cant know wait a little said bartley in some agitation my letters have just come in and i thought i saw a foreign postmark he slipped back into the hall brought in several letters selected one and gave it to mary this is for you from marseilles he then retired to his study and without the least agitation or the least loss of time returned with a book of telegraph forms meanwhile mary tore the letter open and read it eagerly to john baker grand hotel noailles marseilles may my own dear lovei have vowed that i will not write again to tempt you to anything you think wrong but it looks like quarrelling to hide my address from you only i do beg of you as the only kindness you can do me now never to let it be known by any living creature at clifford hall yours till death walter mr bartley entered with the telegraph forms and said to mary sharply where is he mary told him well write him a telegram it shall be at the railway in half an hour at marseilles theoretically in one hour practically in four mary sat down and wrote her telegram pray come to clifford hall your father is dangerously ill show it to me said bartley and on perusing it a womans telegram dont frighten him too much leave him the option to come or stay he tore it up and said now write a business telegram and make sure of the thing you want come home directlyyour father is dying old baker started up god bless you sir says he and god bless you miss and make you happy one day ill take it myself as my trap is at the door he bustled out and his carriage drove away at a great rate mr bartley went quietly to his study to business without another word and mary leaned back a little exhausted by the scene but a smile almost of happiness came and tarried on her sweet face for the first time these many days as for old john baker he told his tale triumphantly at the hall and not without vanity for he was proud of his good judgment in going to mary bartley to the old housekeeper a most superior woman of his own age and almost a lady he said something rather remarkable which he was careful not to bestow on the young wags in the servants hall mrs milton says he i am an old man and have knocked about at home and abroad and seen a deal of life but ive seen something today that i never saw before ay john surely and what ever was that ive seen an angel pray to god and i have seen god answer her from that day mary had two stout partisans in clifford hall mr bartleys views about mary now began to waver it occurred to him that should colonel clifford die and walter inherit his estates he could easily come to terms with the young man so passionately devoted to his daughter he had only to say i can make no allowance at present but ill settle my whole fortune upon mary and her children after my death if youll make a moderate settlement at present and walter would certainly fall into this and not demand accounts from marys trustee so now he would have positively encouraged mary in her attachment but one thing held him back a little he had learned by accident that the last entail of clifford hall and the dependent estates dated two generations back so that the entail expired with colonel clifford and this had enabled the colonel to sell some of the estates and clearly gave him power now to leave clifford hall away from his son now the people who had begun to fetch and carry tales between the two magnates told him of the lawyers recent visits to clifford hall and he had some misgivings that the colonel had sent for the lawyer to alter his will and disinherit in whole or in part his absent and rebellious son all this taken together made mr bartley resolve to be kinder to mary in her love affair than he ever had been but still to be guarded and cautious mary my dear said he i am sure youll be on thorns till this young man comes home perhaps now would be a good time to pay your visit to mrs easton oh papa how good of you but its twenty miles i believe to where she is staying at the lakes no no said mr bartley shes staying with her sister gilbert quite within a drive are you sure papa quite sure my dear she wrote to me yesterday about her little pension the quarter is just due what do you allow her a pension certainly my dear or rather i pay her little stipend as before how surprised you look mary why im not like that old colonel intolerant of other peoples views when they advance them civilly that woman helped me to save your life in a very great danger and for many years she has been as careful as a mother and we are not so to say at daggers drawn about walter clifford why i only demand a little prudence and patience both from you and from her now tell me is there proper accommodation for you in mrs gilberts house oh yes papa it is a farmhouse now but it was a grand place theres a beautiful spare room with an orielwindow well then you secure that and write today to have a blazing fire and the bed properly aired as well as the sheets and you shall go tomorrow in the fourwheel and you can take her her little stipend in a letter this sudden kindness and provision for her health and happiness filled marys heart to overflowing and her gratitude gushed forth upon mr bartleys neck the old fox blandly absorbed it and took the opportunity to say of course it is understood that matters are to go no further between you and walter clifford oh i dont mean that youre to make him unhappy or drive him to despair only insist upon his being patient like yourself everything comes sooner or later to those that can wait oh papa cried mary youve said more to comfort me than mrs easton or anybody can but i feel the change will do me good i am oh so grateful so mary wrote her letter and went to mrs easton next day after the usual embraces she gave mrs easton the letter and was duly installed in the state bedroom she wrote to julia clifford to say where she was and that was her way of letting walter clifford know walter himself arrived at clifford hall next day worn anxious and remorseful and was shown at once to his fathers bedside the colonel gave him a wasted hand and said dear boy i thought youd come weve had our last quarrel walter walter burst into tears over his fathers hand and nothing was said between them about their temporary estrangement the first thing walter did was to get two professional nurses from derby and secure his father constant attention night and day and above all nourishment at all hours of the night when the patient would take it on the afternoon after his arrival the colonel fell into a sound sleep then walter ordered his horse and in less than an hour was at mrs gilberts place chapter xi the knot cutanother tied the farmhouse the gilberts occupied had been a family mansion of great antiquity with a moat around it it was held during the civil war by a stout royalist who armed and garrisoned it after a fashion with his own servants this had a different effect to what he intended it drew the attention of one of cromwells generals and he dispatched a party with cannon and petards to reduce the place whilst he marched on to join cromwell in enterprises of more importance the detachment of roundheads summoned the place the royalist to show his respect for their authority made his kitchen wench squeak a defiance from an upper window from which she bolted with great rapidity as soon as she had thus represented the valor of the establishment and when next seen it was in the cellar wedged in between two barrels of beer the men went at it hammer and tongs and in twentyfour hours a good many cannonballs traversed the building a great many stuck in the walls like plums in a christmas pudding the doors were blown in with petards and the principal defenders with a few wounded roundheads were carried off to cromwell himself whilst the house itself was fired and blazed away merrily cromwell threatened the royalist gentleman with death for defending an untenable place i didnt know it was untenable said the gentleman how could i till i had tried you had the fate of fortified places to instruct you said cromwell and he promised faithfully to hang him on his own ruins the gentleman turned pale and his lips quivered but he said well mr cromwell ive fought for my royal master according to my lights and i can die for him you shall sir said mr cromwell about next morning mr cromwell who had often a cool fit after a hot one and was a very big man take him altogether gave a different order the fool thought he was doing his duty turn him loose the fool in question was so proud of his battered house that he left it standing there bullets and all and built him a house elsewhere king charles the second had not landed a month before he made him a baronet and one tenant after another occupied a portion of the old mansion two staterooms were roofed and furnished with the relics of the entire mansion and these two rooms the present baronets surveyor occupied at rare intervals when he was inspecting the large properties connected with the baronets estate mary bartley now occupied these two rooms connected by foldingdoors and she sat pensive in the orielwindow of her bedroom young ladies cling to their bedrooms especially when they are pretty and airy suddenly she heard a scurry and patter of a horses hoof reined up at the side of the house she darted from the window and stood panting in the middle of the room the next minute mrs easton entered the sittingroom all in a flutter and beckoned her mary flew to her he is here i thought he would be will you meet him downstairs no here mrs easton acquiesced rapidly closed the foldingdoors and went out saying try and calm yourself miss mary miss mary tried to obey her but walter rushed in impetuously pale worn agitated yet enraptured at the first sight of her and mary threw herself round his neck in a moment and he clasped her fluttering bosom to his beating heart and this was the natural result of the restraint they had put upon a passionate affection for what says the dramatist destouches improving upon horace so that in england his immortal line is given to moliere chassez le naturel il revient au galop the next thing was they held each other at armslength and mourned over each other oh my poor mary how ill you look oh my poor walter how pale and worn its all my fault said mary no its all mine said walter and so they blamed themselves and grieved over each other and vowed that come what might they would never part again but lo and behold walter went on from that to say and that we may never part again let us marry at once and put our happiness out of the reach of accidents what said mary defy your father upon his dying bed oh no said walter that i could not do i mean marry secretly and announce it after his decease if i am to lose him and why not wait till after his decease said mary because then the laws of society would compel us to wait six months and in that six months some infernal obstacle or other would be sure to occur and another would be sure to follow i am a great deal older than you and i see that whoever procrastinates happiness risks it and whoever shillyshallies with it deserves to lose it and generally does where young ladies are concerned logic does not carry all before it and so mary opposed all manner of feminine sentiments and ended by saying she could not do such a thing then walter began to be mortified and angry then she cunningly shifted the responsibility and said she would consult mrs easton then consult her in my presence said walter mary had not bargained for that she had intended to secure mrs easton on her side and then take her opinion however as walters proposal was fair she called mrs easton and they put the case to her and asked her to give her candid opinion mrs easton however took alarm at the gravity of the proposal and told them both she knew things that were unknown to both of them and it was not so easy for her to advise well but said walter if you know more than we do you are the very person that can advise all i know is that if we are not married now i shall have to wait six months at least and if i stay here mr bartley and i shall quarrel and he will refuse me mary and if i go abroad again i shall get knocked on the head or else mary will pine away again and bartley will send her to madeira and we shall lose our happiness as all shillyshallying fools do mrs easton made no reply to this though she listened attentively to it she walked to the window and thought quietly to herself then she came back again and sat down and after a pause she said very gravely knowing all i know and seeing all i see i advise you two to marry at once by special license and keep it secret from every one who knows youbut myselftill a proper time comes to reveal it and its borne in upon me that that time will come before long even if colonel clifford should not die this bout which everybody says he will oh nurse said mary faintly i little thought that youd be against me against you miss mary said mrs eastern with much feeling i admire mr walter very much as any woman must with eyes in her head and i love him for loving of you so truly and like a man for it does not become a man to shillyshally but i never saw him till he was a man but you are the child i nursed and prayed over and trembled for in sickness and rejoiced over in health and left a good master because i saw he did not love you so well as i did these words went to marys heart and she flew to her nurse and hung weeping round her neck her tears made the manly but tenderhearted walter give a sort of gulp mary heard it and put her white hand out to him he threw himself upon his knees and kissed it devotedly and the coy girl was won from this hour walter gave her no breathingtime he easily talked over old baker and got him to excuse his short absence he turned his hunters into roadsters and rode them very hard he got the special license he squared a clergyman at the head of the lake who was an old friend of his and fond of fees and in three days after her consent mary and mrs easton drove a fourwheeled carriage walter had lent them to the little hotel at the lakes walter had galloped over at eleven oclock and they all three took a little walk together walter clifford and mary bartley returned from that walk man and wife chapter xii the clandestine marriage walter clifford and mary sat at a late breakfast in a little inn that looked upon a lake which appeared to them more lovely than the lake of thun or of lucerne he beamed steadily at her with triumphant rapture she stole looks at him of wonder admiration and the deepest love as they had nothing now to argue about they only spoke a few words at a time but these were all musical with love to them as we dramatists say entered mrs easton with signs of hurry miss mary said she mrs mary suggested walter meekly mrs mary blew him a kiss ay ay said mrs easton smiling of course you will both hate me but i have come to take you home mistress mary home said mary why this feels like home no doubt said mrs easton but for all that in half an hour we must start the married couple remonstrated with one accord but mrs easton was firm i dreamed said she that we were all found outand thats a warning mr walter you know that youll be missed at clifford hall and didnt ought to leave your father another day and you miss mary do but think what a weight i have taken upon my shoulders and dont put off coming home for i am almost shaking with anxiety and for sure and certain my dream it was a warning and theres something in the wind they were both so indebted to this good woman that they looked at each other piteously but agreed walter rang the bell and ordered the fourwheeler and his own nag mary one little walk in that sweet garden yes dear said mary and in another moment they were walking in the garden intertwined like the ivy and the oak and purring over their present delights and glowing prospects in the mean time mrs easton packed up their things walters were enrolled in a light rug with straps which went upon his saddle they left the little inn mary driving when they had gone about two miles they came to crossroads please pull up said mrs easton then turning to walter who was riding ridiculously close to marys whip hand isnt that the way to clifford hall its one way said he but i dont mean to go that way how can i its only three miles more round by your house nurse said mary appealingly ay ay poor things said mrs easton well well dont loiter anyway i shall not be my own woman again till were safe at the farm so they drove briskly on and in about an hour more they got to a long hill whence they could see the gilberts farm there nurse said mary pouting a little now i hope youre content for we have got safe home and he and i shall not have a happy day together again oh yes you will and many happy years said mrs easton well yes i dont feel so fidgety now oh cried mary all of a sudden why theres our gray mare coming down the hill with the dogcart whos that driving her its not papa i declare its mr hope come home safe and sound dear mr hope oh now my happiness is perfect mr hope screamed mrs easton drive faster for heavens sake turn your horse sir and gallop away from us as hard as you can well but mrs easton objected walter mrs easton stood up in the carriage man alive she screamed you know nothing and i know a deal begone or you are no friend of mine youll make me curse the hour that i interfered go darling said mary kindly and so decidedly that he turned his horse directly gave her one look of love and disappointment and galloped away mary looked pale and angry and drove on in sullen silence mrs easton was too agitated to mind her angry looks she kept wiping the perspiration from her brow with her handkerchief and speaking in broken sentences if we could only get there firstfool not to teach my sister her lesson before we went shes such a simpletoncant you drive faster why nurse said mary dont be so afraid of mr hope its not him im afraid of its papa yon dont know what youre talking about child mr bartley is easily blinded i wont tell you why it isnt so with mr hope oh if i could only get in to have one word with my simple sister before he turns her inside out this question was soon decided hope drove up to the door whilst mary and mrs eastern were still some distance off and hidden by a turn in the road when they emerged again into sight of the farm they just caught sight of hopes back and mrs gilbert curtseying to him and ushering him into the house drive into the stableyard said mrs easton faintly he mustnt see your travelling basket anyway she told the servant to put the horse into the stable immediately and the basket into the brewhouse then she hurried mary up the back stairs to her room and went with a beating heart to find mr hope and her sister mrs gilbert though a simple and unguarded woman could read faces like the rest and she saw at once that her sister was very much put out by this visit of mr hope and wanted to know what had passed between her and him this set the poor woman all in a flutter for fear she should have said something injudicious and thereupon she prepared to find out if possible what she ought to have said what mr hope said mrs easton well mary will be glad and have you been long home sir came last night said hope she hasnt been well i hear what is the matter and he looked very anxious well sir said mrs easton very guardedly she certainly gave me a fright when she came here she looked quite pale but whether it was that she wanted a changebut whatever it was it couldnt be very serious you shall judge for yourself sister go to miss marys room and tell her mrs easton in giving this instruction frowned at her sister as much as to say now dont speak but go when she was gone the next thing was to find out if the woman had made any foolish admission to mr hope so she waited for him she had not long to wait hope said i hardly expected to see you your sister said you were from home well sir said mrs easton we were not so far off but we did come home a little sooner than we intended and i am rare glad we did for miss mary wouldnt have missed you for all the views in the county with that she made an excuse and left him she found her sister in marys room they were comparing notes now said she to mrs gilbert you tell me every word you said to mr hope about miss mary and me well i said you were not at home and that is every word he didnt give me time to say any more for questioning of me about her health thats lucky said mrs easton dryly thank heaven theres no harm done he shant see the carriage dear me nurse said mary all this time im longing to see him well you shall see him if you wont own to having been a night from home mary promised and went eagerly to mr hope it did not come natural to her to be afraid of him and she was impatient for the day to come when she might tell him the whole story the reception he gave her was not of a nature to discourage this feeling his pale facefor he had been very illflushed at sight of her his eyes poured affection upon her and he held out both hands to her this the pale girl they frightened me about said he why youre like the roses in july thats partly with seeing of you sir said mrs easton quietly following but we do take some credit to ourselves too for miss mary was rather pale when she came here a week ago but la young folks want a change now and then nurse said mary i really was not well and you have done wonders for me and i hope you wont think me ungrateful but i must go home with mr hope hopes countenance flushed with delight and mrs easton saw in a moment that marys affection was cooperating with her prudence i thought that would be her first word sir said she why of course you will miss there dont you take any trouble well pack up your things and put them in the dogcart but you must eat a morsel both of you before you go theres a beautiful piece of beef in the pot not oversalted and some mealy potatoes and suet dumplings you sit down and have your chat whilst polly and i get everything ready for you then mary asked mr hope so many questions with such eager affection that he had no time to ask her any and then she volunteered the home news especially of colonel cliffords condition and then she blushed and asked him if he had said anything to her father about walter clifford not much said mr hope you are very young mary and its not for me to interfere and i wont interfere but if you want my opinion why i admire the young man extremely i always liked him he is a straightforward upright manly goodhearted chap and has lots of plain good senseheaven knows where he got it this eulogy was interrupted by mary putting a white hand and a perfect nose upon hopes shoulder and kissing the cloth thereon what said hope tenderly and yet half sadlyfor he knew that all middleaged men must now be secondhave i found the way to your heart you always knew that mr hope said mary softly especially since my escapade in that horrid brook their affectionate chat was interrupted by a stout servant laying a snowy cloth and after her sailed in mrs gilbert with a red face and pride unconcealed and justifiable carrying a grand dish of smoking hot boiled beef set in a very flower bed so to speak of carrots turnips and suet dumplings the servant followed with a brown basin almost as big as a ewer filled with mealy potatoes whose jackets hung by a thread around this feast the whole party soon collected and none of them sighed for russian soups or french ragouts for the fact is that under the title of boiled beef there exist two things one of which without any great impropriety might be called junk but this was the powdered beef of our ancestors a huge piece just slightly salted in the house itself so that the generous juice remained in it but the piquant slices with the mealy potatoes made a delightful combination the glasses were filled with homebrewed ale sparkling and clear and golden as the finest madeira they all ate manfully stimulated by the genial hostess even mary outshone all her former efforts and although she couldnt satisfy mrs gilbert she declared she had never eaten so much in all her life this set good mrs gilberts cheeks all aglow with simple honest satisfaction hope drove mary home in the dogcart he was a happy man but she could hardly be called a happy woman she was warm and cold by turns she had got her friend back and that was a comfort but she was not treating him with confidence indeed she was passively deceiving him and that chilled her but then it would not be for long and that comforted her and yet even when the day should come for the great doors of clifford hall to fly open to her would not a sad reproachful look from dear mr hope somewhat imbitter her cup of happiness deceit and even reticence did not come so natural to her as they do to many women she was not weak and she was frank though very modest mr bartley met them at the door and owing to hopes presence was more demonstrative than usual he seemed much pleased at marys return and delighted at her appearance well said he i am glad i sent you away for a week we have all missed you my dear but the change has set you up again i never saw you look better now you are well we must try and keep you well we must leave the reader to imagine the mixed feelings with which mrs walter clifford laid her head upon the pillow that night and we undertake to say that the female readers at all events will supply this blank in our narrative much better than we could though we were to fill a chapter with that subject alone passion is a terrible enemy to mere affection walter clifford loved his father dearly yet for twentyfour hours he had almost forgotten him but the moment he turned his horses head toward clifford hall uneasiness and something very like remorse began to seize him suppose his father had asked for him and wondered where he was and felt himself deserted and abandoned in his dying moments he spurred his horse to a gallop and soon reached clifford hall as he was afraid to go straight to his fathers room he went at once to old baker and said in an agitated voice one word johnis he alive yes sir he is said john gravely and rather sternly has he asked for me more than once or twice sir walter sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands this softened the old servant whose manner till then had been sullen and grim you need not fret mr walter said he its all right in course i know where you have been walter looked up alarmed i mean in a general way said the old man you have been acourting of an angel i know her sir and i hope to be her servant some day and if you was to marry any but her id leave service altogether and so would rhoda milton but mr walter sir theres a time for everything i hope youll forgive me for saying so however you are here now and i was wideawake and i have made it all right sir thats impossible said walter how could you make it right with my poor dear father if in his last moments he felt himself neglected but he didnt feel himself neglected i dont understand you said walter well sir said old baker im an old servant and i have done my duty to father and son according to my lights i told him a lie a lie john said walter a thundering lie said john rather aggressively i dont know as i ever told a greater lie in all my life i told him you was gone up to london to fetch a doctor walter grasped john bakers hand god bless you old man said he for taking that on your conscience well you shant have yourself to reproach for my fault i know a firstclass gout doctor in london he has cured it more than once ill wire him down this minute youll dispatch the message and ill go to my father the message was sent and when the colonel awoke from an uneasy slumber he saw his son at the foot of the bed gazing piteously at him my dear boy said he faintly and held out a wasted hand walter was pricked to the heart at this greeting not a word of remonstrance at his absence i fear you missed me father said he sadly that i have said the old man but i dare say you didnt forget me though you werent by my side the highminded old soldier said no more and put no questions but confided in his sons affection and awaited the result of it from that hour walter clifford nursed his father day and night dr garner arrived next day he examined the patient and put a great many questions as to the history and progress of the disorder up to that date and inquired in particular what was the length of time the fits generally endured here he found them all rather hazy ah said he patients are seldom able to assist their medical adviser with precise information on this point yet its very important well can you tell me how long this attack has lasted they told him that within a day or two then now said he the most important question of all what day did the pain leave his extremities the patient and john baker had to compare notes to answer this question and they made it out to be about twenty days then he ought to be as dead as a herring whispered the doctor after this he began to walk the room and meditate with his hands behind him open those top windows said he now draw the screen and give his lungs a chance no draughts must blow upon him you know then he drew walter aside do you want to know the truth well then his life hangs on a thread the gout is creeping upward and will inevitably kill him if we cant get it down nothing but heroic remedies will do that and its three to five against them what do you say i dare noti dare not pray put the question to him i will said the doctor and accordingly he did put it to him with a good deal of feeling and gentleness and the answer rather surprised him weak as he was colonel cliffords dull eye flashed and he half raised himself on his elbow what a question to put to a soldier said he why let us fight to be sure i thought it was twenty to onefive to three i have often won the rubber with five to three against me ah said dr garner these are the patients that give the doctor a chance then he turned to baker have you any good champagne in the housenot sweet and not too dry and full of fire irroys carte dor suggested the patient entering into the business with a certain feeble alacrity that showed his gout had not always been unconnected with imprudence in diet baker was sent for the champagne it was brought and opened and the patient drank some of it fizzing when he had drank what he could his eyes twinkled and he said thats a hair of a dog that has often bitten me the wine soon got into his weakened head and he dropped asleep another draught when he wakes said the doctor but from a fresh bottle well finish this one to your health in the servants hall said honest john baker dr garner staid there all night keeping up the patients strength with eggs and brandy and everything in short except medicine and he also administered champagne but at much longer intervals at one oclock next day the patient gave a dismal groan walter and the others started up in alarm good said the doctor calmly now ill go to bed call me if theres any fresh symptom at six oclock old baker burst in the room sir sir he have swore at me twice the lord be praised excellent said the doctor now tell me what disagrees with him most after champagne why green chartreuse to be sure said old baker then give him a tablespoonful said the doctor get me some hot water which first inquired baker the patient to be sure said dr garner soon after this the doctor stood by his patients side and found him writhing and to tell the truth he was using bad language occasionally though he evidently tried not to dr garner looked at his watch i think theres time to catch the evening train why said walter surely you would not desert us this is the crisis is it not its something more than that said the doctor the disease knows its old place it has gone back to the foot like a shot and if you can keep it there the patient will live hes not the sort of patient that strikes his colors while theres a bastion left to defend these words pleased the old colonel so that he waved a feeble hand above his head then groaned most dismally and ground his teeth to avoid profanity the doctor with exquisite gentleness drew the clothes off his feet and sent for a lot of fleecy cotton or wool and warned them all not to touch the bed nor even to approach the lower part of it and then he once more proposed to leave and gave his reasons now look here you know i have done my part and if i give special instructions to the nurses they can do the rest im rather dear and why should you waste your money dear said walter warmly youre as cheap as dirt and as good as gold and the very sight of you is a comfort to us theres a fast train at ten ill drive you to the station after breakfast myself your feesthey are nothing to us we love him and we are the happiest house in christendom we that were the saddest well said the doctor you north countrymen are hearty people ill stay till tomorrow morningindeed ill stay till the afternoon for my london day will be lost anyway he staid accordingly till three oclock left his patient out of all present danger and advised walter especially against allowing colchicum to be administered to him until his strength had recovered there is no medicinal cure for gout said he pain is a mere symptom and colchicum soothes that pain not by affecting the disease but by stilling the action of the heart well if you still the action of that heart there youll kill him as surely as if you stilled it with a pistol bullet knock off his champagne in three or four days and wheel him into the sun as soon as you can with safety fill his lungs with oxygen and keep all worry and disputes and mental anxiety from him if you can dont contradict him for a month to come the colonel had a terrible bout of it so far as pain was concerned but after about a fortnight the paroxysms intermitted the appetite increased everybody was his nurse everybody including julia clifford humored him percy fitzroy was never mentioned and the name of bartley religiously avoided the colonel had got a fright and was more prudent in his diet and always in the open air walter left him only at odd times when he could hope to get a hasty word with mary and tell her how things were going and do all that man could do to keep her heart up and reconcile her to the present situation returning from his wife one day and leaving her depressed by their galling situation though she was never peevish but very sad and thoughtful he found his father and julia clifford in the library julia had been writing letters for him she gave walter a deprecatory look as much as to say what i am doing is by compulsion and you wont like it colonel clifford didnt leave the young man in any doubt about the matter he said walter you heard me speak of bell the counsel who leads this circuit i was once so fortunate as to do him a good turn and he has not forgotten it he will sleep here the day after tomorrow and he will go over that blackguards lease he has been in plenty of mining cases i have got a sort of half opinion out of him already he thinks it contrary to the equity of contracts that minerals should pass under a farm lease where the surface of the soil is a just equivalent to the yearly payment but the old fox wont speak positively till he has read every syllable of the lease however it stands to reason that its a fraud it comes from a man who is all fraud but thank god i am myself again he started up erect as a dart ill have him off my lands ill drag him out of the bowels of the earth him and all his clan with this and other threats of the same character he marched out of the room striking the floor hard with his stick as he went and left julia clifford amazed and walter clifford aghast at his vindictive fury chapter xiii the serpent let loose walter clifford was so distressed at this outburst and the prospect of actual litigation between his father and his sweethearts father that julia clifford pitied him and after thinking a little said she would stop it for the present she then sat down and in five minutes the docile pen of a female letterwriter produced an ingratiating composition impossible to resist she apologized for her apparent insincerity but would be candid and confide the whole truth to mr bell then she told him that colonel clifford had only just been saved from death by a miracle and a relapse was expected in case of any great excitement or irritation such as a doubtful lawsuit with a gentleman he disliked would certainly cause the proposed litigation was for various reasons most distressing to his son and successor walter clifford and would mr bell be so very kind as to put the question off as long as possible by any means he thought proper walter was grateful and said what a comfort to have a lady on ones side i would rather have a gentleman on mine said julia laughing mr bell wrote a discreet reply he would wait till the assizessix weeks delayand then write to the colonel postponing his visit this he did and promised to look up cases meantime but these two allies not only baffled their irascible chief they also humored him to the full they never mentioned the name of bartley and they kept percy fitzroy out of sight in spite of his remonstrances and in a word they made the colonels life so smooth that he thought he was going to have his own way in everything and he improved in health and spirits for you know it is an old saying always get your own way and youll never die in a pet and then what was still a tottering situation was kept on its legs by the sweet character and gentle temper of mary bartley we have already mentioned that she was superior to most women in the habit of close attention to whatever she undertook this was the real key to her facility in languages history music drawing and calisthenics as her professor called female gymnastics the flexible creatures limbs were in secret steel she could go thirty feet up a slack rope hand over hand with wonderful ease and grace and hang by one hand for ten minutes to kiss the other to her friends so the very day she was surprised into consenting to marry walter secretly she sat down to the marriage service and learned it all by heart directly and understood most of it by this means she realized that now she had another man to obey as well as her father so now when walter pressed her for secret meetings she said submissively oh yes if you insist she even remarked that she concluded clandestine meetings were the natural consequence of a clandestine marriage she used to meet her husband in the day when she could and often for five minutes under the moon and she even promised to spend two or three days with him at the lakes if a safe opportunity should occur but for that she stipulated that mr hope must be absent walter asked her why she was more afraid of mr hope than of her father her eyes seemed to look inward dimly and at first she said she didnt know but after pondering the matter a little she said because he watches me more closely than papa and that is becauseyou wont tell anybody no not a soul upon your honor not a soul dearest upon my honor well then because he loves me more oh come said walter incredulously but mary would neither resign her opinion nor pursue a subject which puzzled and grieved her we have now indicated the peaceful tenor of things in derbyshire for a period of some months we shall have to show byandby that elements of discord were accumulating under the surface but at present we must leave derbyshire and deal very briefly with another tissue of events beginning years ago and running to a date three months at least ahead of colonel cliffords recovery the reader will have no reason to regret this apparent interruption our tale hitherto has been rather sluggish but it is in narrative as it is in nature when two streams unite their forces the current becomes broader and stronger leonard monckton was sent to pentonville and after some years transferred to portland in both places he played the game of an old hand always kept his temper and carnied everybody especially the chaplain and the turnkeys these last he treated as his only masters and if they gave him short weight in bread or meat catch him making matters worse by appealing to the governor toward the end of his time at pentonville he had some thought of suicide but his spirits revived at portland where he was cheered by the conversation of other villains their name was legion but as he never met one of them again except ben burnley all those miscreants are happily irrelevant and the reader need not fear an introduction to them unless he should find himself garroted in some dark street or suburb or his home rifled some dark and windy night as for ben burnley he was from the north country imprisoned for conspiracy and manslaughter in an attack upon nonunion miners toward the end of his time he made an attack upon a warder and got five years more then monckton showed him he was a fool and explained to him his own plan of conduct and bade him observe how popular he was with the warders and reaped all the favor they dared to show him he treated me like a dog said the man sullenly i saw it said leonard and if i had been you i would have said nothing but waited till my time was out and then watched for him till he got his day out and settled his hash that is the way for your sort as for me killing is a poor revenge it is too soon over do you think i dont mean to be revenged on that skunk bartley and above all on that scoundrel hope who planted the swag in my pockets and let me into this hole for fourteen years then with all his selfcommand he burst into a torrent of curses and his pale face was ghastly with hate and his eyes glared with demoniac fire for hell raged in his heart just then a warder approached and to burnleys surprise who did not see him coming monckton said gently and therefore my poor fellow do just consider that you have broken the law and the warders are only doing their duty and earning their bread and if you were a warder tomorrow youd have to do just what they do ay said the warder in passing you may lecture the bloke but you will not make a silk purse out of a sows ear that was true but nevertheless the smooth villain monckton obtained a great ascendency over this rough shockheaded ruffian burnley and he got into no more scrapes he finished his two sentences and left before monckton this precious pair revealed to each other certain passages in their beautiful lives moncktons were only halfconfidences but burnley told monckton he had been concerned with others in a burglary at stockton and also in the death of an overseer in a mine in wales and gave the particulars with a sort of quaking gusto and washing his hands nervously in the tainted air all the time to be sure the overseer had earned his fate he had himself been guilty of a crimehe had been true to his employer the grateful burnley left portland at last and promised faithfully to send word to a certain friend of moncktons in london where he was and what he was doing meantime he begged his way northward from portland for the southern provinces were a dead letter to him moncktons wife wrote to him as often as the rules of the jail permitted and her letters were full of affection and of hope that their separation would be shortened she went into all the details of her life and it was now a creditable one young women are educated practically in germany and lucy was not only a good scholar and almost a linguist but excellent at all needlework and better still could cut dresses and other garments in the best possible style after one or two inferior places she got a situation with an english countess and from that time she was passed as a treasure from one member of the aristocracy to another and received high stipends and presents of at least equal value being a german she put by money and let her husband know it but in the seventh year of her enforced widowhood her letters began to undergo subtle changes one after another first there were little exhibitions of impatience then there were signs of languor and a diminution of gush then there were stronger protestations of affection than ever then there were mixed with these protestations queries whether the truest affection was not that which provided for the interests of the beloved person then in the eighth year of moncktons imprisonment she added to remarks of the above kind certain confessions that she was worn out with anxieties and felt her lonely condition that youth and beauty did not last forever that she had let slip opportunities of doing herself substantial service and him too if he could look at things as coolly now as he used to and she began to think she had done wrong this line once adopted was never given up though it was accompanied once or twice with passionate expressions of regret at the vanity of longcherished hopes then came a letter or two more in which the fair writer described herself as torn this way and that way and not knowing what to do for the best and inveighed against fate then came a long silence then came a short letter imploring him if he loved her as she loved him to try and forget her except as one who would always watch over his interests and weep for him in secret crocodile said monckton with a cold sneer all this showed him it was his interest not to lose his hold on her so he always wrote to her in a beautiful strain of faith affection and constancy but this part of the comedy was cut short by the lady discontinuing the correspondence and concealing her address for years ah said monckton she wants to cure me that cock wont fight my beauty a month before he was let loose upon society came a surprisea letter from his wife directing him to call at the office of a certain solicitor in serjeants inn fleet street when he would receive l upon his personal receipt and a similar sum from time to time provided he made no attempt to discover her or in any way disturb her life oh leonard said she you ruined me once pray do not destroy me again you may be sure i am not happy but i am in peace and comfort and i am old enough to know their value dear leonard i offer them both to you pray pray do not despise them and whatever you do do not offend against the law again you see how strong it is monckton read this with calm indifference he did not expect a woman to give him a pension unconditionally or without some little twaddle by way of drawback he called on the lawyer and sent in his name he was received by the lawyer in person and eyed very keenly i am directed to call here for l sir said he yes mr monckton i believe the payment is conditional no sir not the first l it is the future payments that are to depend upon my conniving at my wifes infidelity and with that he handed him the letter the lawyer perused it and said you are right sir the l shall be paid to you immediately but we must request you to consider that our client is your friend and acts by our advice and that it will not be either graceful or delicate to interpret her conduct to her discredit my good sir said monckton with one of his cynical sneers every time your client pays me l put on the receipt that black is white in matters of conjugal morality and ill sign the whole acknowledgment finding he had such a serpent to deal with the lawyer cut the dialogue short and paid the money however as monckton was leaving he said you can write to us when you want any more and would it be discreet of me to ask where we can address you why not said monckton i have nothing to conceal however all i can tell you at present is that i am going to hull to try and find a couple of rogues to hull he went breathing avarice and vengeance this dangerous villain was quite master of bartleys secret and hopes to be sure when hope first discovered him in bartleys office he was puzzled at the sudden interference of that stranger he had only seen hopes back until this and moreover hope had been shabbily dressed in black cloth hard worn whereas he was in a new suit of tweed when he exposed moncktons villainy but this was explained at the trial and monckton instructed his attorney to crossexamine hope about his own great fraud but counsel refused to do so either because he disbelieved his client or thought such a crossexamination would be stopped or set the court still more against his client monckton raged at this and of course said he had been bought by the other side but now he was delighted that his enemies secret had never been inquired into and that he could fall on them both like a thunderbolt he was at hull next day and rambled about the old shop and looked in at the windows all new faces and on the doorplate atkinson co then he went in and asked for mr bartley name not known why he used to be here i was in his employ no nobody knew mr bartley could he see mr atkinson certainly mr atkinson would be there at two oclock monckton after some preamble asked whether he had not succeeded in this business to mr robert bartley no he had bought the business from mrs duplex a widow residing in this town and he happened to know that her husband had taken it from whitaker a merchant at boston is he alive sir i believe so and very well known monckton went off to whitaker and learned from him that he had bought the business from bartley but it was many years ago and he had never heard of the purchaser since that day monckton returned to london baffled what was he to do go to a secretinquiry office advertise that if mr robert bartley late of hull would write to a certain agent he would hear of something to his advantage he did not much fancy either of these plans he wanted to pounce on bartley or hope or both then he argued thus bartley has got lots of money now or he would not have given up business ten to one he lives in london or visits it i will try the park well he did try the park both at the riding hour and the driving hour he saw no bartley at either time but one day in the ladys mile as he listlessly watched the carriages defile slowly past him with every now and then a jam there crawled past him a smart victoria and in it a beautiful woman with glorious dark eyes and a lovely little boy the very image of her it was his wife and her son monckton started but the lady gave no sign of recognition she bowed but it was to a gentleman at moncktons side who had raised his hat to her with marked respect what a beautiful crechaar said a little swell to the gentleman in question you know her very slightly who is she a duchess no a stockbrokers wife mrs braham why she is a known beauty that was enough for monckton he hung back a little and followed the carriage he calculated that if it left the park at hyde park corner or the marble arch he could take a hansom and follow it when the victoria got clear of the crowd at the corner mrs braham leaned forward a moment and whispered a word to her coachman instantly the carriage dashed at the chesterfield gate and into mayfair at such a swift trot that there was no time to get a cab and keep it in sight monckton lighted a cigarette clever girl said he satirically she knew me and never winked the next day he went to the lawyer and said i have a little favor to ask you sir the lawyer was on his guard directly but said nothing an interviewin this officewith mrs braham the lawyer winced but went on his guard again directly client of ours yes sir braham braham said the lawyer affecting to search the caverns of professional memory stockbrokers wife where do they live what dont you know place of businessthreadneedle street place of bigamyportman square i have no authority to grant a personal interview with any such person but you have no power to hinder one and it is her interest the meeting should take place here and the stockbroker be out of it the lawyer reflected will you promise me it shall be a friendly interview you will never go to her husband her stockbroker you mean not i if she comes to me here when i want her will that be often i think not i have a better card to play than mrs braham i only want her to help me to find certain people shall we say twelve oclock tomorrow the lawyer called on mrs braham and after an agitated and tearful interview persuaded her to keep the appointment consider said he what you gain by making our office the place of meeting establish that at once its a point of defense the meeting took place in the lawyers private room and mrs braham was so overcome that she nearly fainted then she was hysterical and finally tears relieved her when she came to this point monckton who had looked upon the whole exhibition as a mere preliminary form observed by females said come lucy dont be silly i am not here to spoil your little game but to play my own the question is will you help me to make my fortune oh that i will if you will not break up my home not such a fool my dear catch me killing a milkcow you give me a percentage on your profits and im dumb then all you want is more money that is all and i shall not want that in a months time i have brought l leonard she said timidly sensible girl hand it over two white hands trembled at the strings of a little bag and took out ten crisp notes leonard took them with satisfaction there said he this will last me till i have found bartley and hope and made my fortune hope said mrs braham oh pray keep clear of him pray dont attack him again he is such an able man i will not attack him again to be defeated forewarned forearmed indeed if i am to bleed bartley i dont know how i can be revenged on hope that is the cruel thing but dont you trouble about my business lucy unless said he with a sneer you can tell me where to find them and so save me a lot of money well leonard said lucy it cant be so very hard to find hope you know where that young man lives that youthat i oh walter clifford yes of course i know where he lives at clifford hall in derbyshire well leonard hope saved him from prison and ruined you that young man had a good heart he would not forget such a kindness he may not know where mr bartley lives but surely he will know where hope is lucy said leonard you are not such a fool as you were it is a chance at all events ill go down to that neighborhood directly ill have a firstrate disguise and spy about and pick up all i can and you will never say anything or do anything tooh leonard im a bad wife i never can be a good one now to anybody but im a good mother and i thought god had forgiven me when he sent me my little angel you will never ruin his poor mother and make her darling blush for her curse me if i do said leonard betrayed into a moments warmth but he was soon himself again there said he ill leave the little bloke my inheritance perhaps you dont know im heir to a large estate in westmoreland no end of land and half a lake and only eleven lives between the estate and me i will leave my great expectations to that young bloke whats his christian name augustus and whats his fathers name jonathan leonard then left all his property real and personal and all that should ever accrue to him to augustus braham son of jonathan braham and left lucy braham sole executrix and trustee then he hurried into the outer office signed this document and got it witnessed the clerks proposed to engross it what for said he this is the strongest form all in the same handwriting as the signature forgery made easy are your engrossed wills he took it in to mrs braham and read it to her and gave it her he meant it all as a joke he read it with a sneer but the mothers heart overflowed she put it in her bosom and kissed his hand oh leonard said she god bless you now i see you mean no ill to me and mine you dont love me enough to be angry with me but it all comes back to me a woman cant forget her first now promise me one thing dont give way to revenge or avarice you are so wise when you are cool but no man can give way to his passions and be wise why run any more risks he is liberal to me and im not extravagant i can allow you more than i said and wrong nobody monckton interrupted her thus there old girl you are a good sort you always were but not bleed that skunk bartley and not be revenged on that villain hope id rather die where i stand for they have turned my blood to gall and lighted hell in my heart this many a year of misery he held out his hand to her it was cold she grasped it in her warm soft palm and gave him one strange searching look with her glorious eyes and so they parted next day at dusk there arrived at the dun cow an elderly man with a large carpetbag and a strapped bundle of patternstweed kersey velveteen and corduroys he had a short gray mustache and beard very neat and appeared to be a commercial traveller in the evening he asked for brandy old rum lemons powdered sugar a kettle and a punchbowl a huge one relic of a past age was produced he mixed delicious punch and begged the landlady to sit down and taste it she complied and pronounced it firstrate he enticed her into conversation she was a rattling gossip and told him first her own grievances here was the village enlarging and yet no more custom coming to her because of the beerhouse the very mention of this obnoxious institution moved her bile directly a pretty gentleman said she to brew his own beer and undersell a poor widow that have been here all her days and her father before her but the colonel wont let me be driven out altogether no more will mr walter he do manage for the old gentleman now monckton sipped and waited for the name of hope but it did not come the good lady deluged him with the things that interested her she was to have a bit of a farm added on to the dun cow it was to be grass land and not much labor wanted she couldnt undertake that was it likely but for milking of cows and making butter or cheese that she was as good at as here and there one and if she could have the custom of the miners for her milk but la sir said she ill go bail as that there bartley will take and set up a dairy against me as he have a beer shop bartley said monckton inquiringly ay sir him as owns the mine and the beer shop and all worse luck for me bartley who is he oh one of those chaps that rise from nothing nowadays came here to farm but that was a blind the colonel says sunk a mine he did and built a pit village and turns everything into brass money but there you are a stranger sir what is all this to you why it is very interesting said monckton mistress i always like to hear the whole history of every place i stop at especially from a sensible woman like you that sees to the bottom of things do have another glass why i should be as dull as ditchwater now if i had not your company la sir im sure you are welcome to my company in a civil way and for the matter of that you are right life is life and theres plenty to be learned in a publicdo but open your eyes and ears have another glass with me i am praised for my punch you deserve it sir better was never brewed she sipped and sipped and smacked her lips till it was all gone this glass colored her cheeks brightened her eyes and even loosened her tongue though that was pretty well oiled by nature well sir said she you are a bird of passage here today and gone tomorrow and it dont matter much what i tell you so long as i dont tell no lies there will be a row in this village having delivered this formidable prophecy the coy dame pushed her glass to her companion for more and leaning back cozily in the oldfashioned highbacked chair observed the effect of her thunderbolt monckton rubbed his hands im glad of it said he genially that is to say provided my good hostess does not suffer by it im much beholden to you sir said the lady you are the civilestspoken gentleman i have entertained this many a day heres your health and wishing you luck in your business and many happy days well spent my service to you sir the same to you maam well sir in regard to a row between the gentlefolksnot that i call that there bartley onejudge for yourself you are a man of the world and a man of business and an elderly man apparently at all events i am older than you madam that is as may be said mrs dawson dryly we haint got the parish register here and all the better for me so once more i say judge for yourself well madam said monckton i will try if you will oblige me with the facts that is reasonable said mrs dawson loftily but after some little consideration the facts i will declare and not a lie among em that will be a novelty thought her cynical hearer but he held his tongue and looked respectfully attentive colonel clifford said mrs dawson hates bartley like poison and bartley him the colonel vows he will have him off the land and out of the bowels of the earth and he have sent him a lawyers letter for everything leaks out in this village along of the servants chattering bartley he dont value a lawyers letter no more than that he defies the colonel and theyll go at it hammer and tongs at the sizes and spend a mint of money in law thats one side of the question but theres another master walter is deep in love with miss mary who is she who is she why bartleys daughter to be sure not as id believe it if i hadnt known her mother for she is no more like him in her looks or her ways than a tulip is to a dandelion she is the loveliest girl in the county and better than shes bonny you dont catch her drawing bridle at her papas beerhouse and she never passes my picture its oh mrs dawson i am so thirsty a glass of your good cider please and a little hay and water for deersfoot thats her way bless your silly heart she aint dry and deersfoot hes full of beans and his coats like satin but thats miss marys way of letting me know that shes my customer and nobody elses in the town god bless her and send her many happy days with the man of her heart and that is walter clifford for she is just as fond of him as he is of her i seen it all from the first day twas love at first sight and still agrowing to this day them old fogies may tear each other to pieces but they wont part such lovers as those theres not a girl in the village that doesnt run to look at them and admire them and wish them joy ay and you mark my words they are young but they have got a spirit both of them miss mary she looks you in the face like a lion and a dove all in one they may lead her but they wont drive her and walter hes a clifford from top to toe nothing but death will part them two thems the facts sir without a lie which now im awaiting for judgment mrs dawson said monckton solemnly since you do me the honor to ask my opinion i say that out of these facts a row will certainly arise and a deadly one it must sir and will hope will have to take a side tis no use his trying to be everybodys friend this time though thats his natural character poor chap moncktons eyes flashed fire but he suppressed all appearance of excitement and asked who mr hope was mrs dawson brightened at the very name of her favorite and said who is will hope why the cleverest man in derbyshire for one thing but he is that bartleys righthand man worse luck he is inspector of the mine and factotum he is the handiest man in england he invents machines and makes fiddles and plays em and mends all their clocks and watches and wheelbarrows and charges em naught he makes hisself too common i often tell him so says i why dost let em all put on thee so serve thee right if i was to send thee my pots and pans to mend and so do says he directly theres no art in it if you can make the sawder and i can do that by the dick and harry and one day i said to him do take a look at this fine new cow of mine as cost me twentyfive good shillings and a quart of ale what ever is the matter with her she looks like the skin of a cow flattened against the board so says he nay shes better drawn than nine in ten but she wants light and shade send her to my workshop ay ay says i thy workshop is like the churchyard we be all bound to go there one day or tother well sir if you believe me when they brought her home and hung her again she almost knocked my eye out there was three or four more women looking on and i mind all on us skreeked a bit and our hands went up in the air as if one string had pulled the lot and says bet morgan the carters wife lord sake gie me a bucket somebody and let me milk her nay but thou shalt milk me said i and a pint of fourpenny i gave her then and there for complimenting of my cow will hope hes everybodys friend he made the colonel a crutch with his own hands which the colonel can use no other now walter swears by him miss mary dotes on him he saved her life in the river when she was a girl the very miners give him a good word though he is very strict with them and as for bartley its my belief he owes all his good luck to will hope and to think he was born in this village and left it a poor lad ay and he came back here one day as poor as job seems but tother day with his bundle on his back and his poor little girl in his hand i dare say i fed them both with whatever was going poor bodies what was she like a poor little wizened thing she had beautiful golden hair though like miss bartleys something but lighter have you ever seen her since no and i never shall who knows nay sir i asked him after her one day when he came home for good he never answered me and he turned away as if i had stung him she has followed her mother no doubt and so now she is gone hes welltodo and that is the way of it sir god sends mouths where there is no meat and meat where theres no mouths but he knows best and sees both worlds at once we can only see this onethats full of trouble monckton now began to yawn for he wanted to be alone and think over the schemes that floated before him now you are sleepy sir said mrs dawson ill go and see your bed is all right he thanked her and filled her glass she tossed it off like a man this time and left him to doze in his chair doze indeed never did a mans eyes move to and fro more restlessly every faculty was strung to the utmost at first as all the dramatis personae he was in search of came out one after another from that gossips tongue he was amazed and delighted to find that instead of having to search for one of them in one part of england and another in another he had got them all ready to his hand but soon he began to see that they were too near each other and some of them interwoven and all the more dangerous to attack he saw one thing at a glance that it would be quite a mistake to settle a plan of action that is sometimes a great advantage in dealing with the unguarded but it creates a stiffness here all must be supple and fitted with watchful tact to the situation as it rose everything would have to be shot flying then as to the immediate situation reader did ever you see a careful setter run suddenly into the middle of a covey who were not on their feet nor close together but a little dispersed and reposing in high cover in the middle of the day no human face is ever so intense or human form more rigid he knows that one bird is three yards from his nose another the same distance from either ear and in short that they are all about him and to frighten one is to frighten all his tail quivers and then turns to steel like his limbs his eyes glare his tongue fears to pant it slips out at one side of his teeth and they close on it then slowly slowly he goes down noiseless as a cat and crouches on the long covert whether turnips rape or clover even so did this designing cur crouch in the dun cow the loyal quadruped is waiting for his master and his anxiety is disinterested the biped cur was waiting for the first streak of dawn to slip away to some more distant and safe hidingplace and sallyport than the dun cow kept by a woman who was devoted to hope to walter and to mary and had all her wits about hermotherwit included chapter xiv the serpent monckton slipped away at the dawn and was off to derby to prepare firstrate disguises at derby going through the local papers he found lodgings offered at a farmhouse to invalids fresh milk and eggs homemade bread etc the place was within a few miles of clifford hall monckton thought this would suit him much better than being too near when his disguises were ready he hired a horse and dogcart by the month and paid a deposit and drove to the place in question he put some shadow under his eyes to look more like an invalid he had got used to his own cadaverous tint so that seemed insufficient the farmers wife looked at him and hesitated well sir said she with a blush we takes em in to cure not to not to bury said monckton dont you be alarmed i have got no time to die im too busy why i have been much worse than this i am convalescent now ye dont say so sir said she well i see your heart is good the first time he had ever been told that and so ive a mind to risk it then she quickly clapped on ten shillings a week more for color and he was installed he washed his face and then the woman conceived hopes of him and expressed them in rustic fashion well said she dirt is a disguise now i look at you you have got more mischief to do in the world yet i do believe a deal more i hope said he it now occurred to him all of a sudden that really he was not in good health and that he had difficulties before him which required calm nerves and that nerves are affected by the stomach so not to throw a chance away he had the sense and the resolution to devote a few days to health and unwholesome meditation this is a discordant world even vices will not always pull the same way here was a sinister villain distracted between avarice and revenge and sore puzzled which way to turn of course he could expose the real parentage of mary bartley and put both bartley and hope to shame and then the cliffords would make bartley disgorge the l but he monckton would not make a shilling by that and it would be a weak revenge on bartley who could now spare l and no revenge at all on hope for hope was now welltodo and would most likely be glad to get his daughter back then on the other hand he could easily frighten bartley into giving him l to keep dark but in that case he must forego his vengeance on hope this difficulty had tormented monckton all along but now mrs dawson had revealed another obstacle young clifford and mary in love with each other what mrs easton saw as a friend with her good motherwit this man saw in a moment as an enemy viz that this new combination dwarfed the l altogether monckton had no idea that his unknown antagonist nurse easton had married the pair but the very attachment as the chatterbox of the dun cow described it was a bitter pill to him who could have foreseen this said he its devilish we did not ourselves intend our readers to feel it so or we would not have spent so much time over it but as regards that one adjective mr monckton is a better authority than we are he had a document with him that skillfully used might make mischief for a time between these lovers but he foresaw there could be no permanent result without the personal assistance of mrs braham that he could have commanded fourteen years ago but now he felt how difficult it would be he would have to threaten and torment her almost to madness before she would come down to derbyshire and declare that this walter clifford was the walter clifford of the certificate and that she was his discarded wife but monckton was none the less resolved she should come if necessary leaving him varius distractum vitiis and weighing every scheme with its pros and cons and like a panther crouching and watching before he would make his first spring we will now bring our other characters up to the same point and that will not take us long for during the months we have skipped there were not many events and mrs dawson has told the readers some of them and the rest were only detached incidents the most important in our opinion were that colonel clifford resumed his determination to marry julia clifford to walter and poohpoohed fitzroy entirely declaring him to be five feet nothing and therefore far below the military standard that hope rented a cottage of walter about three hundred yards from the mine and not upon the land that was leased to bartley that there was a long detached building hard by which walter divided for him and turned into an office with a large window close to the ground and a workshop with a doorway and an aperture for a window but no window nor door that hope got more and more uneasy about the l and observed to bartley that they must be robbing somebody of it without the excuse they once had he for his part would work to disgorge his share bartley replied that the money would have gone to a convent if he had not saved it from so vile a fate this said the astute bartley because one day hope who had his opinions on everything inveighed against a convent and said no private prisons ought to exist in a free country so bartleys ingenious statement stunned hope for a minute but did not satisfy his conscience hope went to london for a week and mary spent four days with her husband at a hotel near the lake but not the one held by mrs eastons sister this change was by advice of mrs easton on this occasion mary played the woman she requested walter to get her some orange blossoms and she borrowed a diamond bracelet of julia and sat down to dinner with her husband in evening dress and dazzled him with her lovely arms and bust and her diamond bracelet and eyes that outshone it she seemed ever so much larger as well as lovelier and walter gazed at her with a sort of loving awe and she smiled archly at him and it was the first time she had really enjoyed her own beauty or even troubled her head much about it they condensed a honeymoon into these four days and came home compensated for their patience and more devoted than ever but whilst they were away colonel clifford fired his attorney at mr bartley and when mary came home bartley who had lately connived at the love affair told mary this and forbade her strictly to hold any more intercourse with walter clifford this was the state of things when the hare with many friends and only one enemy returned to his cottage late in the afternoon but before night everybody knew he had come home and next morning they were all at him in due order no sooner was he seated in his workshop studying the lines of a new machine he was trying to invent than he was startled from intense thought into the attitude of hogarths enraged musician by cries of mr hope mr hope mr hope and there was a little lot of eager applicants first a gypsy boy with long black curls and continuous genuflections and a fiddle and doleful complaints that he could not play it and that it was the fiddles fault well it is for once said hope why you little duffer dont you see the bridge is too low he slackened the string removed the bridge fitted on a higher one tuned it and handed it over there said he play us one of the tunes of egypt the rogues march eh and mizzle the supple oriental grinned and made obeisances pretended not to know the rogues march to the henhouse and went off playing johnny comes marching home bridewell to wit then did miss cliffords french maid trip forward smirking with a parasol to mend desolee de vous deranger monsieur hope mais notre demoiselle est au desespoir oh ces parasols anglais connu said hope voyons ca and in a minute repaired the article and the girl spread it and went off wriggling and mincing with it so that there was a pronounced horselaugh at her minauderies then advanced a rough young english nurse out of a farmhouse with a child that could just toddle she had left an enormous doll with hope for repairs and the child had given her no peace for the last week luckily the doll was repaired and handed over the mite in whose little bosom maternal feelings had been excited insisted on carrying her child the consequence was that at about the third step they rolled over one another and to spectators at a little distance it was hard to say which was the parent and which the offspring them the strapping lass in charge seized roughly and at the risk of dislocating their little limbs tossed into the air and caught one on each of her own robust arms and carried them off stupidly irritatedfor want of a grain of humorat the goodnatured laugh this caused and looking as if she would like to knock their little heads together under cover of this an old man in a broad hat and seemingly infirm crept slowly by and looked keenly at hope but made no application only while taking stock of hope his eyes flashed wickedly and much too brightly for so old a man as he appeared he did not go far he got behind a tree and watched the premises then a genuine old man and feeble came and brought hope his clock to mend hope wound it up and it went to perfection the old man had been a stout fellow when hope was a boy but now he was weak especially in the upper story hope saw at once that the young folk had sent him there for a joke and he did not approve it gaffer said he this will want repairing every eight days but dont you come here any more ill call on you every week and repair it for auld lang syne whilst he toddled away and hope retired behind his lathe to study his model in peace monckton raged at the sight of him and his popularity ay said he you are a genius you can model a steamengine or mend a doll and you outwitted me and gave me fourteen years but you will find me as ingenious as you at one thing and thats revenge and now a higher class of visitors began to find their way to the general favorite the first was a fair young lady of surpassing beauty she strolled pensively down the green turf cast a hasty glance in at the workshop and not seeing hope concluded he was a little tired after his journey and had not yet arrived she strolled slowly down then and seated herself in a large garden chair stuffed that hope had made and placed there for colonel clifford that worthy frequented the spot because he had done so for years and because it was a sweet turfy slope and there was a wonderful beechtree his father had made him plant when he was five years old it had a gigantic silvery stem and those giant branches which die crippled in a beech wood but really belong to the isolated tree as one virgil discovered before we were born mary bartley then lowered her parasol and settled into the colonels chair under the shade patulae fagiof the widespreading beechtree she sat down and sighed monckton eyed her from his lurkingplace and made a shrewd guess who she was but resolved to know presently hope caught a glimpse of her and came forward and leaned out of the window to enjoy the sight of her he could do that unobserved for he was a long way behind her at a sharp angle he was still a widower and this his only child and lovely as an angel and he had seen her grow into ripe loveliness from a sick girl he had sinned for her and saved her he had saved her again from a more terrible death he doted on her and it was always a special joy to him when he could gloat on her unseen then he had no need to make up an artificial face and hide his adoration from her but soon a cloud came over his face and his paternal heart he knew she had a lover and she looked like a girl who was waiting pensively for him she had not come there for him whom she knew only as her devoted friend at this thought the poor father sighed marys quick senses caught that and she turned her head and her sweet face beamed you are there after all mr hope hope was delighted why it was him she had come to see after all he came down to her directly radiant and then put on a stiff manner he often had to wear out of fidelity to bartley who did not deserve it this is early for you to be out miss bartley of course it is said she but i know it is the time of day when you are kind to anybody that comes and mend all their rubbish for them and i could kill them for their impudence in wasting your time so and i am as bad as the rest for here i am wasting your time in my turn yes dear mr hope you are so kind to everybody and mend their things i want you to be kind to me and mendmy prospects for me hopes impulse was to gather into his arms and devour with kisses this sweet specimen of womanly tenderness frank inconsistency naivete and archness as he could not do that he made himself extra stiff your prospects miss bartley why they are brilliant heiress to all the growing wealth and power around you wealth and power said the girl what is the use of them if our hearts are to be broken oh mr hope papa is so unkind he has forbidden me to speak to him then gravely that command comes too late i fear it does said hope i have long suspected something suspected said mary turning pale what that you and walter clifford yes said mary trembling inwardly but commanding her face areengaged mary drew a long breath what makes you think so said she looking down well there is a certain familiarityno that is too strong a word but there is more ease between you than there was ever since i came back from belgium i have seen that the preliminaries of courtship were over and you two looked on yourselves as one mr hope said this good arch girl and left off panting you are a terrible man papa is eyes and no eyes you frighten me but not very much for you would not watch me so closely if you did not love mea little not a little miss bartley mary please mary i have seen you a sickly child i have been anxiouswho would not i have seen you grow in health and strength and every virtue and seen me tumble into the water and frighten you out of your senses and theres nothing one loves like a downright pest especially if she loves us and i do love you mr hope dearly dearly and i promise to be a pest to you all your days ah here he comes at last she made two eager steps to meet him then she said oh i forgot and came back again and looked prodigiously demure and innocent walter came on with his usual rush crying mary how good of you mary put her fingers in her ears no no no we are forbidden to communicate then imitating a stiff man of businessfor she was a capital mimic when she choseany communication you may wish to honor me with must be addressed to this gentleman mr hope he will convey it to me and it shall meet with all the attention it deserves walter laughed and said thats ingenious of course it is ingenuous said mary subtly thats my character to a fault well young people said hope i am not sure that i have time to repeat verbal communications to keen ears that heard them and i think i can make myself more useful to you walter your father has set his lawyer on to mr bartley and what is the consequence mr bartley forbids mary to speak to you and the next thing will be a summons lawsuit and a great defeat and loss to your father and you mr bartley sent me the lawyers letter he hopes to get out of a clear contract by pleading a surprise now you must go to the lawyerit is no use arguing with your father in his present heatand you must assure him there has been no surprise why i called on colonel clifford years ago and told him there was coal on that farm and i almost went on my knees to him to profit by it you dont say that mr hope i do say it and i shall have to swear it you may be sure mr bartley will subpoena me if this wretched squabble gets into court but what did my father say to you he was kind and courteous to me i was poor as a rat and dusty with travelon foot and he was a fine gentleman as he always is when he is not in too great a passion he told me more than one landowner had wasted money in this county groping for coal he would not waste his money nor dirty his fingers but he thanked me for my friendly zeal and rewarded me with ten shillings oh cried walter and hid his face in his hands as for mary she put her hand gently but quietly on hopes shoulder as if to protect him from such insults why children said hope pleased at their sympathy but too manly to hunt for it it was more than he thought the information worth and i assure you it was a blessed boon to me i had spent my last shilling and there i was trapesing across the island on a wildgoose chase with my reapinghook and my fiddle and my poor little grace that ithat i marys hand went a moment to his other shoulder and she murmured through her tears you have got me then hope was happy again and indeed the simplest woman can find in a moment the very word that is balm of gilead to a sorrowful man however hope turned it off and continued his theme the jury he said would pounce on that ten shillings as the colonels true estimate of his coal and he would figure in the case as a dog in the manger who grudged bartley the profits of a risky investment he had merely sneered at and not opposed until it turned out well and also disregarded the interests of the little community to whom the mine was a boon no said hope tell your lawyer that i am bartleys servant but love equity i have proposed to bartley to follow a wonderful seam of coal under colonel cliffords park we have no business there so if the belligerents will hear reason i will make bartley pay a royalty on every ton that comes to the surface from any part of the mine and that will be l a year to the cliffords take this to the lawyer and tell him to unfix that heros bayonet or he will charge at the double and be the death of his own moneyand yours walter threw up his hands with amazement and admiration what a head said he fiddledee said mary what a heart in a word a phoenix said hope dryly praise is sweet especially behind ones back so pray go on unless you have something better to say to each other and hope retired briskly into his office but when the lovers took him at his word and began to strut up and down hand in hand and murmur loves music into each others ears he could not take his eyes off them and his thoughts were sad she had only known that young fellow a few months yet she loved him passionately and he would take her away from her father before she even knew all that father had done and suffered for her when the revelation did come she would perhaps be a wife and a mother and then even that revelation would fall comparatively flat besides his exceptional grief he felt the natural pang of a father at the prospect of resigning her to a husband hard is the lot of parents and above all of a parent with one child whom he adores many other creatures love their young tenderly and their young leave them but then the infancy and youth of those creatures are so short in a few months the young shift for themselves forgetting and forgotten but with our young the helpless periods of infancy and youth are so long parental anxiety goes through so many trials and so various and they all strike roots into the parents heart yet after twenty years of love and hope and fear comes a handsome young fellow a charming highwayman to a parents eye and whisks her away after two months courtship then oh ye young curb for a moment your blind egotism and feel a little for the parents who have felt so much for you you rather like william hope so let him help you to pity your own parents see his sad face as he looks at the love he is yet too unselfish to discourage to save that tender root a sickly child he transplanted it from his own garden and still tended it with loving care for many a year another gathers the flower he watched and tended and trembled over the tender nestling the young bird is trying her wings before his eyes soon she will spread them and fly away to a newer nest and a younger bosom in this case however the young people had their troubles too and their pretty courtship was soon interrupted by an unwelcome and unexpected visitor who as a rule avoided that part for the very reason that colonel clifford frequented it however he came there today to speak to hope mr bartley for he it was would have caught the lovers if he had come silently but he was talking to a pitman as he came and marys quick ears heard his voice round the corner papa cried she oh dont let him see us hide where anywherein herequick and she flew into hopes workshop which indeed offered great facilities for hiding however to make sure they crouched behind the lathe and a huge plank of beautiful mahogany hope was very proud of as soon as they were hidden mary began to complain in a whisper this comes of our clandestine m our very life is a falsehood concealment is tortureand degradation i dont feel it i call this good fun oh walter good fun for shame hush bartley bustled on to the green called hope out and sat down in colonel cliffords chair hope came to him and bartley who had in his hand some drawings of the strata in the coal mine handed the book to hope and said i quite agree with you that is the seam to follow theres a fortune in it then you are satisfied with me more than satisfied i have something to ask in return i am not likely to say no my good friend was the cordial reply thank you well then there is an attachment between mary and young clifford bartley was on his guard directly her happiness is at stake that gives me a right to interfere and say be kind to her am i not kind to her was any parent ever kinder but i must be wise as well as kind colonel clifford can disinherit his son at this point the young people ventured to peep and listen taking advantage of the circumstance that both hope and bartley were at some distance with their backs turned to the workshop so they both heard hope say withdraw your personal opposition to the match and the other difficulty can be got over if you want to be kind to a young woman it is no use feeding her ambition and her avarice for these are a mans idols a womans is love mary wafted the speaker a furtive kiss to enrich that dear child after your death thirty years hence and break her heart in the flower of her youth is to be unkind to her and if you are unkind to her our compact is broken unkind to her said bartley what male parent has ever been more kind more vigilant sentimental weakness is another matter my affection is more solid can i oblige you in anything that is business mr bartley said hope you can not divert me from the more important question business is secondary to that dear girls happiness however i have more than once asked you to tell me who is the loser of that large sum which as you and i have dealt with it has enriched you and given me a competence thats my business said bartley sharply for you never fingered a shilling of it so if the pittance i pay you for conducting my business burns your pocket why send it to rothschild and having made this little point bartley walked away to escape further comment and hope turned on his heel and walked into his office and out at the back door directly and proceeded to his duties in the mine but he was much displeased with bartley and his looks showed it the coast lay clear the lovers came cautiously out and silently too for what they had heard puzzled them not a little mary came out first and wore a very meditative look she did not say a word till they got to some little distance from the workshop then she half turned her head toward walter who was behind her and said i suppose you know we have done a contemptible thinglistening well said walter it wasnt good form but added he we could hardly help it of course not said mary we have been guilty of a concealment that drives us into holes and corners and all manner of meannesses must be expected to follow well we have listened and i am very glad of it for it is plain we are not the only people who have got secrets now tell me please what does it all mean well mary said walter to tell the truth it is all greek to me except about the money i think i could give a guess where that came from there now cried mary that is so like you gentlemen moneymoneymoney never mind the money part leave that to take care of itself can you explain what mr hope said to papa about me mr hope is a very superior man and papas adviser in business but after all he is in papas employment papa pays him then how comes he to care more about my happiness than papa doesand say so why you begged him to intercede yes said mary but not to threaten papa not to say if you are unkind to mary our compact is broken then she pondered awhile then she turned to walter and said what sort of compact is that a compact between a father and another gentleman that a father shall not be unkind to his own daughter did you ever hear of such a thing i cant say i ever did did you ever hear tell of such a thing well now you put it to me i dont think i ever did and yet you could run off about money whats money this compact is a great mystery its my business from this hour to fathom that mystery please let me think marys face now began to show great power and intensity her eyes seemed to veil themselves and to turn down their glances inward walter was struck with the intensity of that fair brow those remarkable eyes and that beautiful face they seemed now to be all strung up to concert pitch he kept silent and looked at his wife with a certain reverence for to tell the truth she had something of the pythian priestess about her when she concentrated her whole mind on any one thing in this remarkable manner at last the oracle spoke mr hope has been deceiving me with some good intention he pretends to be subservient to papa but he is the master how he comes to be master i dont know but so it is walter if it came to a battle royal mr hope would side not with papa but with me thats important if true said walter dryly its true said mary and its important then she turned suddenly round on him how did you feel when you ran into that workshop and we both crouched and hid like criminals or slaves well said walter hanging his head to tell the truth i took a comic view of the business i cant do that said mary i respect my husband and cant bear him to hide from the face of any mortal man and i am proud of my own love and indignant to think that i have condescended to hide it it is a shame said walter and i hope we shant have to hide it much longer oh bother how unfortunate heres my father what are we to do ill tell you said mary resolutely you must speak to him at once and win him over to our side tell him julia is going to marry percy fitzroy on the first of next month then tell him all that mr hope said you were to tell the lawyer and then tell him what you have made me believe that you love me better than your life and that i love you better still and that no power can part us if you can soften him mr hope shall soften papa but if he is too headstrong to be softened faltered walter then said mary you must defy my papa and i shall defy yours after a moments thought she said walter i shall stay here till he sees me and you together then he wont be able to run off about his mines and his lawsuits and such rubbishy things his attention will be attracted to our love and so you will have it out with him whilst i retire a little waynot farand meditate upon mr hopes strange words and ponder over many things that have happened within my recollection true to this policy the spirited girl waited till colonel clifford came on the green and then made walter as perfect a courtesy as ever graced a minuet at the court of louis le grand walter took off his hat to her with chivalric grace and respect colonel clifford drew up in a stiff military attitude which flavored rather of the parade or the field of battle than the court either of the great monarch or of little cupid chapter xv the secret in danger hum said the colonel dryly a petticoat et cetera suggested walter meekly and we think he was right for a petticoat has never in our day been the only garment worn by females nor even the most characteristic fishermen wear petticoats and dont wear bonnets who is she sir asked the grim colonel your niece father said walter mellifluously and the most beautiful girl in derbyshire the colonel snorted but didnt condescend to go into the question of beauty why did my niece retire at sight of me was his insidious inquiry well said walter meekly the truth is some mischiefmaking fool has been telling her that you have lost all natural affection for your dead sisters child the stout colonel staggered for a moment snorted and turned it off you and she are very often together it seems all the better for me said walter stoutly and all the worse for me retorted the colonel and as men gravitate toward their leading grievance he went off at a tangent what do you think my feelings must be to see my son my only son spooning the daughter of my only enemy of a knave who got on my land on pretense of farming it but instead of that he burrowed under the soil like a mole sir and now the place is defiled with coal dust the roads are black the sheep are black the daisies and buttercups are turning black theres a smut on your nose walter i forbid you to spoon his daughter upon pain of a fathers curse my real niece julia is a lady and an heiress and the beauty of the county she is the girl for you and how about the seventh commandment inquired walter putting his hands in his pockets oh said the colonel indifferently you must mind your eye like other husbands but in our walk of life its the mans fault if the woman falls out of the ranks thats not what i mean said walter what do you mean then if you mean anything at all i mean this father she marries percy fitzroy in three weeks so if i fix my affections on her up to the date of the wedding shall i not be tempted to continue and will not a foolish attachment to another mans sweetheart end in a vicious attachment to another mans wife once more was the colonel staggered for a moment and ohas the ladies sayis it not gratifying to find that where honest reasons go for nothing humbug can obtain a moments hearing the colonel admitted there was something in that but even humbug could not divert him long from his mania the only thing to be done said he is to cut him out between this and then why he stands five feet nothing thats the advantage he has over me suggested walter she is five feet eight or thereabouts so he is just the height of her heart the colonel burst out laughing you are no fool said he thats the second good thing you have said these three years i forget what the other was but i remember it startled me at the time you are a wit and you will cut out that manikin or you are no son of mine dont say that father said walter and cutting out why thats a naval operation not military i am not the son of an admiral no equivocation sir the forces assist one another at a pinch how can i cut him outtheres no room he is tied to her apron strings untie him then at this moment whether because hope attracted everybody in the course of the day or because talking about people draws them to the place by some subtle agency who should appear in sight but miss julia clifford and little fitzroy wooing her so closely that really he did seem tied to her apron strings there said walter now use your eyes father look at this amorous pair do you really think it possible for a fellow to untie those two quite possible said the colonel walter said he sententiously theres a little word in the english language which is one of the biggest i will spell it to you try nobody knows what he can do till he gives that word a fair trial it was far more impossible to scale the rock of gibraltar but our infantry did it and there we are with all europe grinding their teeth at us whats a woman compared with gibraltar however as you seem to be a bit of a muff ill stand sentinel whilst you cut him out the colonel then retired into a sort of ambuscadeat least he mingled with a small clump of three scotch firs and stood amongst them so rectilinear he might have passed for the fourth stump walter awaited the arrival of the foe but in a spirit which has seldom conducted men to conquest and glory for if the english infantry had deviated so far from their insular habits as to admire the spaniards you may be sure that gibraltar rock at this day would be a part of the continent and not a detached fragment of great britain in a word walter at sight of the lovers was suddenly seized with sentimental sympathy they both seemed to him so beautiful in their way the man was small but his heart was not he stuck to the woman like a man and poured hot love into her ears and almost lost the impediment in his speech the woman pretended to be cooler but she half turned her head toward him and her halfclosed eyes and heightened color showed she was drinking every word her very gayety though it affected nonchalance revealed happiness to such as can read below the surface of her sex the colonels treacherous ally after gazing at them with marked approval and saying i couldnt do it better myself which was surely a great admission for a lover to make slipped quietly into hopes workshop not to spoil sporta juvenile idea which we recommend to older persons and to such old maids as have turned sour the great majority of old maids are matchmakers whatever cant may keep saying and writing to the contrary no wonder at all said percy who was evidently in the middle of some amorous speech you are the goddess of my idolatry what ardent expressions you do use said julia smiling of ccourse i do im over head and ears in love julia surveyed his proportions and said thats not very deep but percy had got used to this kind of wit and did not mind it now he replied with dignity its as deepas the ocean and as impperttturbable confound it theres your cousin you are not jealous of him mr imperturbable are you asked julia slyly jealous said percy changing color rather suspiciously certainly not hang him walter finding he was discovered and feeling himself in the way came out at the back behind them and said never mind me you two far be it from me to deprive the young of their innocent amusements whilst making this little speech he was going off on the points of his toes intending to slip off to clifford hall and tell his father that both cutting out and untying had proved impossible but to his horror the colonel emerged from his ambuscade and collared him then took place two short contemporaneous dialogues julia id never marry a jealous man percy i never could be jealous im above it impossible for a nature like mine to be jealous colonel clifford well why dont you cut him out walter they seem so happy without it colonel clifford you are a muff ill do it for you forward colonel clifford then marched down and seated himself in the chair hope had made for him julia saw him and whispered percy ah heres uncle clifford he is going to marry me to walter never mindyou are not jealous percy turned yellow well said colonel clifford to all whom it might concern this certainly is the most comfortable chair in england these fools of upholsterers never make the bottom of the chair long enough but mr hope has made this to run under a gentlemans knees and support him hes a clever fellow julia my dear theres a garden chair for you come and sit down by me julia gave a sly look at percy and went to colonel clifford she kissed him on the forehead to soften the coming negative and said to tell you the truth dear uncle i have promised to go down a coal mine see im dressed accordingly go down a coal mine said the colonel contemptuously what fool put that idea in your head fitzroy strutted forward like a bantamcock i did sir coal is a very interesting product ay to a cook to every english ggentleman i disown that imputation for one of being an english ggentleman there was a general titter at this sly hit no sir said the colonel angrilyof taking an interest in coal well but said percy with a few slight hesitations not to ttake an interest in ccoal is not to take an interest in the nnation for this nnation is ggreat not by its ppowerful fleet nor its little bbbit of an army a snort from the colonel nor its raw mmilitia but by its mmmanufactures these depend on machines that are driven by steampower and the steamengines are coalfed and were made in coalfed furnaces our machines do the work of five hundred million hands and you see coal keeps them going the machinery will be imitated by other nations but those nations can not create coalfields should those ever be exhausted our ingenuity will be imitated by larger nations our territory will remain small and we shall be a secondrate power so i say that every man who reads and thinks about his own ccountry ought to be able to say i have been dddown a coal mine well said the colonel loftily and cant you say you have been down a coal mine i could say that and sit here well sir you have been reading the newspapers and learning them off by heart as if they were the epistle and gospel of course you must go down a coal mine but if you do have a little mercy on the fair and go down by yourself in the mean while walter you can take your cousin and give her a walk in the woods and show her the primroses now julia was surprised and pleased at percys good sense and she did not care whether he got it from the newspapers or where he got it from it was there so she resisted and said coldly and firmly thank you uncle but i dont want the primroses and walter does not want me come percy dear and so she marched off but she had not gone many steps before having a great respect for old age she ordered percy in a whisper to make some apology to her uncle percy did not much like the commission however he went back and said very civilly this is a free country but i am afraid i have been a little too free in expressing my opinion let me hope you are not annoyed with me i am never annoyed with a fool said the implacable colonel this was too much for any little man to stand that is why you are always on such good terms with yourself said percy as red as a turkeycock the colonel literally stared with amazement hitherto it had been for him to deliver bayonet thrusts not to receive them julia pounced on her bantamcock and with her left hand literally pulled him off the premises and shook her right fist at him till she got him out of sight of the foe then she kissed him on both cheeks and burst out laughing and indeed she was so tickled that she kept laughing at intervals whether the immediate subject of the conversation was grave or gay it is hard not to laugh when a very little fellow cheeks a very big one even walter though he admired as well as loved his father hung his head and his shoulders shook with suppressed risibility colonel clifford detected him in this posture and in his wrath gave his chair a whack with his staff that brought master walter to the position of a private soldier when the drillsergeant cries attention did you hear that sir said he i did said walter cheeky little beggar but you know father you were rather hard upon him before his sweetheart and a little pot is soon hot there was nothing to be hot about said the colonel naively but that is neither here nor there you are ten times worse than he is he is only a prating pedantic puppy but you are a muff sir a most unmitigated muff to stand there mumchance and let such an article as that carry off the prize oh father said walter why will you not see that the prize is a living woman a woman with a will of her own and not a french eagle or the figurehead of a ship now do listen to reason not a word said the colonel marching off but excuse me said walter i have another thing far more important to speak to you about this unhappy lawsuit thats no business of yours and i dont want your opinion of it there is no more fight in you than there is in a hensparrow i decline your company and your pacific twaddle i have no patience with a muff and the colonel marched off leaving his son planted there as the french say walter however was not long alone the interview had been watched from a distance by mary she now stole noiselessly on the scene and laid her white hand upon her husbands shoulder before he was aware of her the sight of her was heaven to him but her first question clouded his happy face well dear have you propitiated him walter hung his head sorrowfully and said hardly anything he has been blustering at me all the time and insists upon my cutting out percy whether i can or not and marrying julia whether she chooses or not then we must do what i said indeed there is no other course we must own the truth concealment and deceit will not mend our folly oh hang it mary dont call it folly forgive me dear but it was the height of folly not that i mean to throw the blame on youthat would be ungenerous but the truth is you had no business to marry me and i had no business to marry you only thinkmemary bartleya clandestine marriage and then our going to the lakes again and spending our honeymoon together just like other couplesthe recklessnessthe audacity oh what happiness it was walter very naturally pounced upon this unguarded and naive conclusion of marys selfreproaches yes said he eagerly let us go there again next week not next week not next month not next year nor ever again until we have told all the world well mary said walter its for you to command and me to obey i said so before and i say so now if you are not ashamed of me how can i be ashamed of you you say the word and i will tell my father at dinnertime before julia clifford and john baker and request them to tell everybody they know that i am married to a woman i adore and there is nobody i care for on earth as i do for her and nothing i value compared with her love and her esteem mary put her arm tenderly around her husbands neck and now it was with her as it is often with generous and tenderhearted women when all opposition to their wishes is withdrawn they begin to see the other side my dearest said mary i couldnt bear you to sacrifice your prospects for me why mary said walter what would my love be worth if it shrank from selfsacrifice i really think i should feel more pleasure than pain if i gave up friends kindred hope everything that is supposed to make life pleasant for you and so would i for you said mary and oh walter women have presentiments and something tells me that fate has great trials in store for you or for me perhaps for both yes you are right the true measure of love must be selfsacrifice and if there is to be selfsacrifice oh let the selfsacrifice fall on me for i can not think any man can love a woman quite so deeply as i love youmy darling he had only time to draw her sweet forehead to his bosom whilst her arm encircled his neck when in came an ordinary love by way of contrast julia clifford and percy came in walking three yards apart percy had untied the apron strings without walters assistance ah said she you two are not like us i am ashamed to interrupt you but they would not let us go down the mine without an order from mr hope really i think mr hope is king of this country not that we have wasted our time for he has been quarrelling with me all the way there and back oh mr fitzroy said mary bartley miss bartley said percy very civilly i never qqquarrel i merely disdistinguished between right and wrong i shall make you the judge i gave her a didiamond brbracelet which came down from my ancestors she did me the honor to accept it and she said it should never leave her day nor night oh cried julia that i never did i can not afford to stop my circulation altogether its much too little then she flew at him suddenly your ancestors were pigmies percy drew himself up to his full height and defied the insinuation they were giants in chain armor said he what said julia without a moments hesitation the ladies or was it the knights that wore bracelets some french writer says the tongue of a woman is her sword and percy fitzroy found it so he could no more answer this sudden thrust than he could win the high leap at lillie bridge he stood quivering as if a polished rapier had really been passed clean through him mary was too kindhearted to laugh in his face but she could not help turning her head away and giggling a little at last percy recovered himself enough to say the truth is you have gone and given it to somebody else oh you wickedbadheartedyou that couldnt be jealous by this time percy was himself again and said with some reason that invectives were not arguments produce the bracelet and so i can said julia stoutly give me time oh said percy if its a mere question of time there is no more to be said youll find the bracelet in time and in time i shall feel once more that confidence in you which induced me to confide to you as to another self that precious family relic which i value more than any other material object in the world then percy whose character seemed to have changed retired with stiff dignity and an air of indomitable resolution neither julia nor mary had ever seen him like that before julia was unaffectedly distressed oh mary why did i ever lend it to you now mary knew very well where the bracelet was but she was ashamed to say she stammered and said you know dear it is too small much too small and my arm is bigger than yours there said julia you have broken the clasp mary colored up to the eyes at her own disingenuousness and said hastily but ill have it mended directly ill return it tomorrow at the latest i shall be wretched till you do said julia eagerly i suppose you know what i want it for now why said mary of course i do to soothe his wounded feelings soothe his feelings cried julia scornfully and how about mine no the only thing i want it for now is to fling it in his face his soul is as small as his body hes a little mean suspicious jealous fellow and im very glad to have lost him she flounced off all on fire looking six feet high and got quite out of sight before she began to cry then the truth came out mary absorbed in conjugal bliss had left it at the hotel by the lakes she told walter oh hang it said walter thats unlucky you will never see it again oh yes i shall said mary they are very honest people at that inn and i have written about it and told them to keep it safe unless they have an opportunity of sending it walter reflected a moment take my advice mary said he let me gallop off this afternoon and get it oh yes walter said mary thank you so much that will be the best way at this moment loud and angry voices were heard coming round the corner and mary uttered a cry of dismay for her discriminating ear recognized both those voices in a moment she clutched walters shoulder oh walter its your father and mine quarrelling how unfortunate that they should have met what shall we do hide in hopes office the french window is open quick then cried mary and darted into the office in a moment walter dashed in after her when she got safe into cover she began to complain this comes of concealmentwe are always being driven into holes and corners i rather like them with you said the unabashed walter it matters little what had passed out of sight between bartley and colonel clifford for what the young people heard now was quite enough to make what sir lucius otrigger calls a very pretty quarrel bartley hitherto known to mary as a very oily speaker shouted at the top of his voice in arrogant defiance youre not a child are you you are old enough to read papers before you sign them the colonel shouted in reply i am old sir but i am old in honor i did not expect that any decent tradesman would slip a clause into a farm lease conveying the minerals below the surface to a farmer it was a fraud sir but theres law for fraud my lawyer shall be down on you tomorrow your chimneys disgorge smoke all over my fields you shall disgorge your dishonest gains ill have you off my land sir ill tear you out of the bowels of the earth you are a sharper and a knave at this bartley roared at him louder still so that both the young people winced as they crouched in the recess of the window you foulmouthed slanderer ill indict you for defamation and give you twelve months in one of her majestys jails no you wont roared the colonel i know the law my comments on your character are not written and signed like your knavish lease its a privileged communicationvillain there are no witnessessharper by jupiter there are though he had caught sight of a male figure just visible at the side of the window who is it my son my daughter cried bartley catching sight of mary come out sir said the colonel no longer loudly but trembling with emotion come here mary said bartley sternly at this moment who should open the back door of the office but william hope walter said the colonel with the quiet sternness more formidable than all his bluster have not i forbidden you to court this mans daughter said bartley to mary havent i forbidden you to speak to this ruffians son then being a cad who had lost his temper he took the girl by the wrist and gave her a rough pull across him that sent her effectually away from walter she sank into the colonels seat and burst out crying with shame pain and fright brute said the colonel but the thing was not to end there hope strode in amongst them with a pale cheek and a lowering brow as black as thunder his first words were do you call yourself a father not one of them had ever seen hope like that and they all stood amazed and wondered what would come next chapter xvi reminiscencesthe false accuserthe secret exploded the secret hung on a thread hope after denouncing bartley as we have described was rushing across to mary and what he would have said or done in the first impulse of his wrath who can tell but the quickwitted bartley took the alarm and literally collared him my good friend said he you dont know the provocation it is the affront to her that has made me forget myself affronts to myself from the same quarter i have borne with patience but now this insolent man has forbidden his son to court her and that to her face as if we wanted his son or him havent i forbidden the connection we are agreed for once said the colonel and carried his son off bodily sore against his will yes shrieked bartley after him only i did it like a gentleman and did not insult the young man to his face for loving my daughter let me hear what mary says was hopes reply mr hope said mary did you ever know papa to be hard on me before he is vexed because he feels i am lowered we have both been grossly insulted and he may well be in a passion but i am very unhappy and she began to cry again my poor child said bartley coaxingly talk it all over with mr hope he may be able to comfort you and indeed to advise me for what can i do when the man calls me a sharper a villain and a knave before his son and my daughter is it possible said hope beginning to relent a little it is true replied mary bartley then drew hope aside and said see what confidence i place in you now show me my trust is not misplaced then he left them together hope came to mary and said tenderly what can i say or do to comfort you mary shook her head i asked you to mend my prospects but you cant do that they are desperate you can do nothing for me now but comfort me with your kind voice and mend my poor wristha ha ha oh oh hysterical what cried hope in sudden alarm is it hurt is it sprained mary recovered her composure oh no said she only twisted a little papa was so rough hope went into a rage again perdition cried he ill go and end this once for all you will do nothing of the kind said the quickwitted girl oh mr hope would you break my heart altogether quarrelling with papa be reasonable i tell you he couldnt help it that old monster insulted him so it hurts for all that said she naively and held him out a lovely white wrist with a red mark on it hope inspected it poor little wrist said he i think i can cure it then he went into his office for something to bind it with but he had spoken those few words as one speaks to an afflicted child there was a mellow softness and an undisguised paternity in his tonesand what more natural the girl being in pain but marys ear was so acute that these tones carried her out of the present situation and seemed to stir the depths of memory she fell into a little reverie and asked herself had she not heard a voice like that many years ago she was puzzling herself a little over this when hope returned with a long thin band of white indian cotton steeped in water and taking her hand gently began to bind her wrist with great lightness and delicacy and as he bound it he said there the pain will soon go mary looked at him full and said slowly i believe it will then very thoughtfully it didbefore these three simple words struck hope as rather strange it did before said he and stared at her why when was that mary said in a hopeless sort of way i dont know when but long before your time before my time mary what are you older than me and he smiled sweetly on her one would think not but let me ask you a question mr hope yes mary have you lived two lives said hope solemnly i have lived through great changes but only one life well then said mary i have lived two or more likely it was one life only some of it in another worldmy other world i mean hope left off binding her wrist and said i dont understand you but his heart began to pant the words that passed between them were now so strange that both their voices sank into solemnity and had an acute observer listened to them he would have noticed that these two mellow voices had similar beauties and were pitched exactly in the same key though there was of course an octave between them understand me how should you it is all so strange so mysterious i have never told a soul but i will tell you you wont laugh at me laugh at you only fools laugh at what they dont understand why mary i hang on every word you say with breathless interest dear mr hope well then i will tell you sometimes in the silent night when the present does not glare at one the past comes back to me dimly and i seem to have lived two lives one long one shorttoo short my long life in a comfortable house with servants and carriages and all that my short life in different places not comfortable places but large places all was free and open and there was always a kind voice in my earlike yours and a tender touchlike yours hope was restraining himself with difficulty and here he could not help uttering a faint exclamation to cover it he took her wrist again and bending his head over it he said almost in a whisper and the face marys eyes turned inward and she seemed to scan the past the face said shethe face i can not recall but one thing i do remember clearly this is not the first time my wristyesand it was my right wrist toohas been bound up so tenderly he did it for me in that other world just as you do in this one hope now thrilled all over at this most unexpected revelation but though he glowed with delight and curiosity he put on a calm voice and manner and begged her to tell him everything else she could remember that had happened in that other life finding him so serious so sympathetic and so interested put this remarkable girl on her mettle she began to think very hard and show that intense power of attention she had always in reserve for great occasions then you must not touch me nor speak to me said she the past is such a mist he obeyed and left off binding her wrist and now he literally hung upon her words then she took one step away from him her bright eyes veiled themselves and seemed to see nothing external but looked into the recesses of the brain her forehead her hand her very body thought and we must try though it is almost hopeless to convey some faint idea of her manner and her words letmesee then she paused i rememberwhite swans a pause were they swans or ships they floated down the river to the sea she paused and the kind voice beside me said darling papa never calls me darling yes yes whispered hope almost panting darling we must go with them to some other land for we are poor she paused and thought hard poor we must have been very poor i can see that now that i am rich she paused and thought hard but all was peace and love there were two of us yet we seemed one then in a moment mary left the past her eyes resigned the film of thought and shone with the lustre of her great heart and she burst at once into that simple eloquence which no hearer of hers from john baker to william hope ever resisted ah sweet memories treasures of the past why are you so dim and wavering and this hard world so clear and glaring it seems cut out of stone oh if i had a fairys wand id say vanish fine house and servantsvanish wealth and luxury and strife and you come back to me sweet hours of peaceand povertyand love her arms were stretched out with a grace and ardor that could embellish even eloquence when a choking sob struck her ear she turned her head swiftly and there was william hope his hands working his face convulsed and the tears running down his cheeks like the very rain it was no wonder think of it the child he adored yet had parted with to save her from dire poverty remembered that sad condition to ask for it back again because of his love that made it sweet to her after all these years of comfort and of late he had been jealous and saw or thought he had no great place in her heart and never should have ah it is a rarity to shed tears of joy the thing is familiarly spoken of but the truth is that many pass through this world of tears and never shed one such tear the few who have shed them can congratulate william hope for this blissful moment after all he had done and suffered but the sweet girl who so surprised that manly heart and drew those heavenly tears had not the key she was shocked surprised distressed she burst out crying directly from blind womanly sympathy and then she took herself to task oh mr hope what have i done ah i have touched some chord of memory wicked selfish girl to distress you with my dreams distress me cried hope these tears you have drawn from me are pearls of memory and drops of balm to my sore tried heart i too have lived and struggled in a bygone world i had a lovely child she made me rich in my poverty and happy in my homelessness she left me poor mr hope then i went abroad drudged in foreign mines came home and saw my child again in you i need no fairys wand to revive the past you are my fairyyour sweet words recall those bygone scenes and wealth ambition all i live for now vanish into smoke the years themselves roll back and all is once more peaceand povertyand love dear mr hope said mary and put her forehead upon his shoulder after a while she said timidly dear mr hope now i feel i can trust you with anything then she looked down in charming confusion my reminiscencesthey are certainly a great mystery but i have another secret to confide to you if i am permitted is the consent of some other person necessary not exactly necessary mr hope but advisable mary nodded her head then take your time said hope he took out his watch and said i want to go to the mine my righthand man reports that a ruffian has been caught lighting his pipe in the most dangerous part after due warning i must stop that game at once or we shall have a fatal accident but i will be back in half an hour you can rest in my office if you are here first it is nice and cool hope hurried away on his errand and mary was still looking after him when she heard horses feet and up came walter clifford escaped from his father he slipped off his horse directly at sight of mary and they came together like steel and magnet oh walter said mary we are not so unfortunate as we were just now we have a powerful friend where are you going in such hurry that is a good joke why did you not order me to the lakes oh yes for julias bracelet i forgot all about that very likely but it is not my business to forget your orders dear walter but dearest things of more importance have happened since then we have been insulted oh how we have been insulted that we have said walter and nobody knows the truth not yet and our secret oppresses metorments medegrades me pray dont say that forgive me i cant help saying it i feel it so bitterly now dear i will walk a little way with you and tell you what i want you to do this very day and you will be a darling as you always are and consent then mary told how mr hope had just shown her singular affection next she reminded him of the high tone mr hope had taken with her father in their hearing why said she there is some mysterious compact about me between papa and him i dont think i shall ever have the courage to ask him about that compact for then i must confess that i listened but it is clear we can depend upon mr hope and trust him so now dear i want you to indulge your little wife and let me take mr hope into our confidence to marys surprise and disappointment walters countenance fell i dont know said he after a pause unfortunately its not mr bartley only thats against us well but dear said mary the more people there are against us the more we need one powerful friend and champion now you know mr hope is a man that everybody loves and respects even your father walter just said gloomily i see objections for all that but do as you please marys tender heart and loving nature couldnt accept an unwilling assent she turned her eyes on walter a little reproachfully thats the way to make me do what you please i dont intend it so said walter when a husband and wife love each other as we do they must give in to each other thats not what we said at the altar oh the marriage service is rather onesided i promised very different things to get you to marry me and i mean to stand by them if you are impatient at all of this secrecy tell mr hope i cant now said mary a little bitterly why not since i consent an unwilling consent is no consent mary you are too tyrannical how can i downright like a thing i dont like i yield my will to yours theres a certain satisfaction in that i really can say no more then say no more said mary almost severely at all events give me a kiss at parting mary gave him that directly but it was not a warm one he galloped away upon his errand and as she paced slowly back toward mr hopes office she was a good deal put out what should she say to mr hope now she could not defy walters evident wishes and make a clean breast of the matter then she asked herself what was walters objection she couldnt conceive why he was afraid to trust mr hope it was a perfect puzzle to her indeed this was a most unfortunate dialogue between her and walter for it set her mind speculating and guessing at walters mind and thinking all manner of things just at the moment when an enemy smooth as the old serpent was watching for an opportunity to make mischief and poison her mind leonard monckton who had long been hanging about waiting to catch her alone met her returning from walter clifford and took off his hat very respectfully to her and said miss bartley i think mary lifted her eyes and saw an elderly man with a pale face and dark eyebrows and a cast of countenance quite unlike that of any of her friends his face repelled her directly and she said very coldly yes sir but i have not the pleasure of knowing you and she quietly passed on monckton affected not to see that she was declining to communicate with him he walked on quietly and said and i have not seen you since you were a child but i had the honor of knowing your mother you knew my mother sir knew her and respected her what was she like sir she was tall and rather dark not like you so i have heard said mary well sir said she for his voice was ingratiating and had modified the effect of his criminal countenance as you knew my mother you are welcome to me the artist in deceit gave a little sigh and said thats more than i dare hope for i am here upon a most unpleasant commission but for my respect for your mother i would not have undertaken it for really my acquaintance with the other lady is but slight mary looked a little surprised at this rigmarole and said but this commission what is it miss bartley said he solemnly yet gravely i have been requested to warn you against a gentleman who is deceiving you who is that said mary on her guard directly it is a mr walter clifford walter clifford said mary you are a slanderer he is incapable of deceit the rogue pretended to brighten up well i hope so said he and i told the lady as much he comes from a most honorable stock so then he has told you about lucy monckton lucy monckton cried mary no who is she miss bartley said the villain very gravely and solemnly she is his wife his wife sir cried mary contemptuouslyhis wife you must be mad ill hear no more against him behind his back then threatening her tormentor he will be home again this evening he has only ridden to the lake hotel you shall repeat this to his face if you dare it will be my painful duty said the serpent meekly his wife said mary scornfully but her lips trembled his wife replied monckton calmly a respectable woman whom it seems he has deserted these fourteen years my acquaintance with her is slight but she is in a good position and indeed wealthy and has never troubled him however she heard somehow he was courting you and as i often visit derby upon business she requested me to come over here and warn you in time and do you think said mary scornfully i shall believe this from a stranger hardly said monckton with every appearance of candor mrs walter clifford directed me to show you his marriage certificate and hers the marriage certificate cried mary turning pale yes said monckton they were married at the registry office on the th june and he put his hand in his breast pocket to search for the certificate he took this opportunity to say you must not fancy that there is any jealousy or ill feeling after fourteen years desertion but she felt it her duty as a woman the certificate said marythe certificate he showed her the certificate she read the fatal words walter clifford the rest swam before her eyes and to her the world seemed at an end she heard as in a dream the smooth voice of the false accuser saying with a world of fictitious sympathy i wish i had never undertaken this business mrs walter clifford doesnt want to distress you she only felt it her duty to save you dont give way there is no great harm done unless you were to be deluded into marrying him and what then inquired mary trembling monckton appeared to be agitated at this question oh dont speak of it said he you would be ruined for life and he would get seven years penal servitude and that is a sentence few gentlemen survive in the present day when prisons are slaughterhouses there i have discharged the most disagreeable office i ever undertook in my life but at all events you are warned in time then he bowed most respectfully to her and retired exhaling his pentup venom in a diabolical grin she poor victim stood there stupefied pierced with a poisoned arrow and almost in a state of collapse then she lifted her hands and eyes for help and saw hopes study in front of her everything swam confusedly before her she did not know for certain whether he was there or not she cried to that true friend for help mr hopei am losti am in the deep waters of despairsave me once more save me thus speaking she tottered into the office and sank all limp and powerless into a chair unable to move or speak but still not insensible and soon her brow sank upon the table and her hands spread themselves feebly out before her it was all villainous spite on moncktons part he did not for a moment suppose that his lie could long outlive walter cliffords return but he was getting desperate and longing to stab them all unfortunately fate befriended the villains malice and the husband and wife did not meet again till that diabolical poison had done its work monckton retired put off his old mans disguise behind the firtrees and went toward another of his hidingplaces an enormous oaktree which stood in the hedge of hopes cottage garden the subtle villain had made this hollow tree an observatory and a sort of sallyport whence he could play the fiend the people at the hotel were as mary told julia clifford very honest people they showed percy fitzroys bracelet to one or two persons and found it was of great value this made them uneasy lest something should happen to it under their charge so the woman sent her husband to the neighborhood of clifford hall to try and find out if there was a lady of that name who had left it the husband was a simple fellow very unfit to discharge so delicate a commission he went at first as a matter of course to the publichouse they directed him to the hall but he missed it and encountered a gentleman whose quick eye fell upon the bracelet for the foolish man had shown it to so many people that now he was carrying it in his hand and it blazed in the meridian sun this gentleman said what have you got there well sir said the man it was left at our hotel by a young couple from these parts handsome couple they were sir and spending their honeymoon let me see it said mr bartley for he was the gentleman he had come back in some anxiety to see whether hope had pacified mary or whether he must exert himself to make matters smooth with her again whilst he was examining the bracelet who should appear but percy fitzroy the owner not that he came after the bracelet on the contrary that impetuous young gentleman had discovered during the last two hours that he valued miss cliffords love a great deal more than all the bracelets in the world for all that he was delighted at the unexpected sight of his property why thats mine said he its an heirloom i lent it to miss julia clifford and when i asked her for it today she could not produce it oho said mr bartley what do the ladies of the house of clifford go in for clandestine marriages certainly not sir said fitzroy dont you know the difference between a wedding ring and a bracelet then he turned to the man here is a sovereign for your trouble my man now give me my bracelet to his surprise the hotelkeeper put it behind his back instead of giving it to him nay said he shaking his head knowingly you are not the gentleman that spent the honeymoon with the lady as owns it my mistress said i was not to give it into no hands but hers this staggered percy dreadfully and he looked from one to another to assist him in solving the mystery bartley came to the assistance of his understanding but with no regard to the feelings of his heart its clear enough what it means sir your sweetheart is playing you false that went through the truelovers heart like a knife and poor little percy leaned in despair against hopes workshop window transfixed by the poisoned arrow of jealousy at this moment the voice of colonel clifford was heard loud and ringing as usual julia clifford had decoyed him there in hopes of falling in with percy and making it up and to deceive the good colonel as to her intentions she had been running him down all the way so the colonel was heard to say in a voice for all the village to hear jealous is he and suspicious then you take my advice and give him up at once you will easily find a better man and a bigger after delivering this like the word of command upon parade the colonel was crossing the turf a yard or two higher up than hopes workshop when the spirit of revenge moved bartley to retort upon his insulter hy colonel clifford the colonel instantly halted and marched down with julia on his arm like a gamecock when another rooster crows defiance and what can you have to say to me sir was his haughty inquiry to take you down a peg you rode the high horse pretty hard today the spotless honor of the cliffords eh then it was fixed bayonets and no quarter have the cliffords ever dabbled in trade or trickery coal merchants coal heavers and coal whippers may defile our fields with coal dust and smoke but they can not defile our honor the men are brave as lions and the women as chaste as snow sneered bartley i dont know about lions and snow i have often seen a lion turn tail and the snow is black slush wherever you are but the cliffords being gentlemen are brave and being ladies are chaste oh indeed hissed bartley then how comes it that your niece therewhose name is miss clifford i believespent what this good man calls a honeymoon with a young gentleman at this good mans inn here the good man in question made a faint endeavor to interpose but the gentlefolks by their impetuosity completely suppressed him its a falsehood cried julia haughtily you scurrilous cad roared the colonel and shook his staff at him and seemed on the point of charging him but bartley was not to be put down this time he snatched the bracelet from the man and held it up in triumph and left this bracelet there to prove it was no falsehood then julia got frightened at the evidence and the terrible nature of the accusation oh cried she in great distress can any one here believe that i am a creature so lost i have not seen the bracelet these two months i lent ittoah here she is mary save me from shame you know i am innocent mary who was standing at the window in hopes study came slowly forward pale as death with her own trouble to do an act of womanly justice miss clifford said she languidly as one to whom all human events were comparatively indifferentmiss clifford lent the bracelet to me and i left it at that mans inn this she said right in the middle of them all the hotelkeeper took the bracelet from the unresisting hand of bartley touched his hat and gave it to her there mistress said he i could have told them you was the lady but they would not let a poor fellow get a word in edgeways he retired with an obeisance mary handed the bracelet to julia and then remained passive a dead silence fell upon them all and a sort of horror crept over mary bartley at what must follow but come what might no power should induce her to say the word that should send walter clifford to jail for seven years bartley came to her she trembled and her hands worked what are you saying you fool he whispered the lady that left the bracelet was there with a gentleman mary winced then bartley said sternly who was your companion i must not say you will say one thing said bartley or i shall have no mercy on you are you secretly married then a single word flashed across marys almost distracted mindselfsacrifice she held her tongue cant you speak are you a wife he now began to speak so loud in his anger that everybody heard it mary crouched a little and worked her hands convulsively under the torture but she answered with such a doggedness that evidently she would have let herself be cut to pieces sooner than said more idontknow you dont know roared bartley mary paused and then with iron doggedness idontknow this apparent insult to his commonsense drove bartley almost mad you have given these cursed cliffords a triumph over me he cried you have brought shame to my door but it shall never pass the threshold here the colonel uttered a contemptuous snort this drove bartley wild altogether he rushed at the colonel and shook his fist in his face you stand there sneering at my humiliation now see the example i can make then he was down upon mary in a moment and literally yelled at her in his fury go to your paramour girl go where you will you never enter my door again and he turned his back furiously upon her this terrible denunciation overpowered poor marys resolution she clung to him in terror oh mercy mercy papa ill explain to you have pity on your child bartley flung her so roughly from him that she nearly fell you are my child no more but at that moment in strode william hope looking seven feet high and his eyes blazing liar and hypocrite he roared she never was your child then changing to a tone of exquisite love and stretching out both his hands to mary she is mine mary being now between the two men turned swiftly first to one then to the other and with womans infallible eye knew her own flesh and blood in that halfmoment she uttered a cry of love and rapture that went through every heart that heard it and she flung herself in a moment upon her fathers bosom he whirled her round like a feather on to his right arm then faced both her enemies clifford and bartley with haughty defiance head thrown back and eyes that flashed black lightning in defense of his child chapter xvii lovers quarrels it was a living picture the father protecting his child like an eagle bartley cooled in a moment and hanging his head apart gloomy and alarmed at the mad blunder rage had betrayed him into colonel clifford amazed and puzzled and beginning to see the consequences of all this julia clasping her hands in rapture and thrilling interest at so romantic an incident fitzroy beaming with delight at his sweetheart being cleared and to complete the picture the villainous face of leonard monckton disguised as an old man showed itself for a moment sinister and gloomy for now all hope of pecuniary advantage to him was gone and nothing but revenge was on the cards and he could not see his way clear to that but hope was no posturemaker he turned the next moment and said a word or two to all present yes this is grace hope my daughter we were very poor and her life was in danger i saw nothing else but that my love was stronger than my conscience i gave her to that man upon a condition which he has now broken he saved her life and was kind to her i thanked him i thank him still and i did my best to repay him but now he has trusted to appearances and not to her he has belied and outraged her publicly but i am as proud of her as ever and dont believe appearances against her character and her angel face and no more do i cried julia clifford eagerly i know her shes purity itself and a better woman than i shall ever be thank you miss clifford said hope in a broken voice god bless you come grace and share my humble home at all events it will shelter you from insult and so the pair went lovingly away grace clinging to her father comforted for the moment but unable to speak and entered hopes little cottage it was but a stonesthrow from where they stood this broke up the party and my house is yours said colonel clifford to julia i did not believe appearances against a clifford with these words he took two steps toward his niece and held out his arm she moved toward him percy came forward radiant to congratulate her she drew up with a look of furious scorn that made him recoil and she marched proudly away with her uncle he bestowed one parting glance of contempt upon the discomfited bartley and marched his niece proudly off more determined than ever that she should be his daughter but for once he was wise enough not to press that topic he let her indignation work alone moreover though he was a little wrongheaded and not a little pigheaded he was a nobleminded man and nothing noble passed him unobserved or unappreciated that bartleys daughter said he to julia ay when roses spring from dunghills and eagles are born of sparrowhawks brave girlbrave girl oh uncle said julia i am so glad you appreciate her appreciate her said the colonel what should i be worth if i did not why these are the women that win waterloo in the persons of their sons that girl could never breed a coward nor a cheat then his incisive voice mellowed suddenly poor young thing said he with manly emotion i saw her come out of that room pale as death to do another woman justice shes no fool though that ruffian called her one she knew what she was doing yet for all her womans heart she faced disgrace as unflinchingly as if it was only death it was a great action a noble action a just action and a manly action but done like a very woman where the two sexes meet like that in one brave deed its grand i declare it warms an old soldiers heart and makes him thank god there are a few creatures in the world that do humanity honor as the colonel was a man that stuck to a topic when he got upon it this was the main of his talk all the way to clifford hall he even remarked to his niece that so far as his observations of the sex extended great love of justice was not the leading feature of the female mind other virtues he ventured to think were more prominent so everybody says was julias admission everybody is right for once said the colonel they entered the house together and miss clifford went up to her room there she put on a new bonnet and a lovely shawl recently imported from paris who could this be for she sauntered upon the lawn till she found herself somehow near the outward boundary where there was a gate leading into the park as she walked to and fro by this gate she observed out of the tail of her eye of course the figure of a devoted lover creeping toward her whether this took her by surprise or whether the lovely creature was playing the part of a beautiful striped spider waiting for her fly the reader must judge for himself percy came to the gate she walked past him twice coming and going with her eyes fixed upon vacancy she passed him a third time he murmured in a pleading voice julia she neither saw nor heard so attractive had the distant horizon become percy opened the gate and came inside and stood before her the next time she passed she started with surprise what do you want here said she to speak to you how dare you speak to me after your vile suspicions well but julia how dare you call me julia well miss clifford wont you even hear me not a word its through you poor dear mary and i have both been insulted by that wretch of a father of hers which father i said wretch to whom does that term apply except to mr bartley and with sudden vigor to you then you think i am as bad as old bartley said percy firing up no i dont ah said percy glad to find there was a limit but julia explained i think you are a great deal worse you pretend to love me and yet without the slightest reason you doubt me what did i doubt i thought you had parted with my bracelet to another person and so you had i never doubted your honor oh yes you did i saw your face i am not rrresponsible for my face yes you are you had no business to look brokenhearted and miserable and distrustful and abominable it was your business face and all to distrust appearances and not me appearances were so strong that not to look mmiserable would have been to seem indifferent there is no love where there is no jealousy oh said julia he has let that out at last after denying it a hundred times now i say there is no true love without respect and confidence and this doesnt exist where there is jealousy and all about a trumpery bracelet anything but trumpumpumpery it came down from my ancestors you never had any your behavior shows that i tell you it is an heirloom it was given to my mother by oh we know all about that said julia this bracelet did an egyptian to my mother give but you are not going to play othello with me i shouldnt have a very gentle desdemona no you wouldnt candidly no man shall ever bully and insult me and then wake me out of my first sleep to smother me because my maid has lost one of his handkerchiefs at the wash he burst out laughing at this and tried to inveigle her into goodhumor say no more about it said he and ill forgive you forgive me you little wretch cried julia why havent you the sense to see that it is serious this time and my patience is exhausted and that our engagement is broken off and i never mean to see you againexcept when you come to my wedding your wedding cried percy turning pale with whom thats my business you leave that to me sir hold out your handboth hands here is the ancestral braceletit shall pinch me no longer neither my wrist nor my heart heres the brooch you gave mei wont be pinned to it any longer nor to you neither and there is your bunch of charms and there is your bundle of lovelettersstupid ones they are and she crammed all the aforesaid treasures into his hands one after the other so this was what she went to her room for percy looked down on his handful ruefully my very letters there was no jealousy in them they were full of earnest love fuller of bad spelling said the relentless girl then she went into details you spell abominable with two msand thats abominable you spell ridiculous with a kand thats ridicklous so after this dont you presume to speak to me for i shall never speak to you again very well then said percy i too will be silent forever oh i dare say said julia a chatterbox like you even chatterboxes are silent in the grave suggested percy and if we are to part like this forever today tomorrow i shall be no more well you could not be much less said julia but with a certain shamefaced change of tone that perhaps if percy had been more experienced might have given him a ray of hope well said he i know one lady that would not treat these presents with quite so much contempt oh i have seen her said julia spitefully she has been setting her cap at you for some time its miss susan beckleya fine conquestgreat fat redhaired thing auburn yes allburn scarlet carrots flamme denfer well go and give her my leavings yourself and your ancestralpaste well said percy gloomily i might do worse you never really loved me you were always like an enemy looking out for faults you kept postponing our union for something to happen to break it off but i wont be any womans slave ill use one to drive out the other none of you shall trample on me then he burst forth into singing nobody stammers when he sings shall i wasting in despair sigh because a womans fair shall my cheeks grow pale with care because anothers rosy are if she be not kind to me what care i how fair she be this resolute little gentleman passed through the gate as he concluded the verse waved his hand jauntily by way of everlasting adieu and went off whistling the refrain with great spirit and both hands in his pockets you impudent cried julia almost choking then authoritatively percymr fitzroy then coaxingly percy dear percy heard and congratulated himself upon his spirit thats the way to treat them said he to himself well said he with an air of indifference and going slowly back to the gate what is it now said he a little arrogantly she soon let him know directly he was quite within reach she gave him a slap in the face that sounded like one plank falling upon another and marched off with an air of royal dignity as if she had done the most graceful and ladylike thing in all the world how happy are those choice spirits who can always preserve their dignity percy retired red as fire and one of his cheeks retained that high color for the rest of the day chapter xviii apologies we must now describe the place to which hope conducted his daughter and please do not skip our little description it is true that some of our gifted contemporaries paint italian scenery at prodigious length a propos de bottes and others show in many pages that the rocks and the sea are picturesque objects even when irrelevant true that others gild the evening clouds and the western horizon merely to please the horizon and the clouds but we hold with pope that the proper study of mankind is man and that authors pictures are bores except as narrow frames to big incidents the true model we think for a writer is found in the opening lines of marmion where the castle at eventide its yellow lustre its drooping banner its mailclad warders reflecting the western blaze the tramp of the sentinel and his lowhummed song are flung on paper with the broad and telling touch of rubens not from an irrelevant admiration of old castles and the setting sun but because the human figures of the story are riding up to that sungilt castle to make it a scene of great words and deeds even so though on a much humbler scale we describe hopes cottage and garden merely because it was for a moment or two the scene of a remarkable incident never yet presented in history or fiction this cottage then was in reality something between a villa and a cottage it resembled a villa in this that the rooms were lofty and the windows were casements glazed with plate glass and very large walter clifford had built it for a curate who proved a bird of passage and the said walter had a horror of low rooms for he said i always feel as if the ceiling was going to flatten me to the floor owing to this the bedroom windows which looked westward on the garden were a great height from the ground and the building had a gothic character still there was much to justify the term cottage the door which looked southward on the road was at the side of the building and opened not into a hall but into the one large sittingroom which was thirty feet long and twentyfive feet broad and instead of a plaster ceiling there were massive joists which hope had gilded and painted till they were a sight to behold another cottage feature the walls were literally clothed with verdure and color in front huge creeping geraniums jasmine and virginia creepers hid the brickwork and the western walls to use the words of a greater painter than ourselves were quite overcanopied with lush woodbine with sweet muskroses and with eglantine in the next place the building stood in a genuine cottage garden it was close to the road the southern boundary was plain oak paling made of upright pieces which hope had varnished so that the color was now a fine amber the rest of the boundary was a quickset hedge in the western division of which stood an enormous oaktree hollow at the back and the garden was fair with humble flowerspinks sweetwilliams crimson nasturtiums double daisies lilies and tulips but flower beds shared the garden with friendly cabbages potatoes onions carrots and asparagus to this humble but pleasant abode hope conducted his daughter and insisted upon her lying down on the sofa in the sittingroom then he ordered the woman who kept the house for him to prepare the spare bedroom which looked into the garden and to cut some of the sweetsmelling flowers he himself had much to say to his daughter and above all to demand her explanation of the awkward circumstances that had been just revealed but she had received a great shock and like most manly men he had a great consideration for the weakness of women and his paternal heart said let her have an hour or two of absolute repose before i subject her to any trial whatever so he opened the window to give her air enjoining her most strictly not to move and even to go to sleep if she could and then he put on his shooting coat with large inside pocket to go and buy her a little winea thing he never touched himselfand what other humble delicacies the village afforded he walked briskly away from his door without the least idea that all his movements were watched from a hidingplace upon his own premises no other than the great oaktree hollow and open at the back in which leonard monckton had bored two peepholes and was now ensconced there watching him hope had not gone many yards from his own door when he was confronted by one of those ruffians who by their way of putting it are the eternal butt of iniquitous people and iniquitous things namely honest men curse them and the law confound it this was no other than that ben burnley who being a miner had stuck halfway between devonshire and durham and had been some months in bartleys mine he opened on hope in a loud voice and dialect which we despair of conveying with absolute accuracy mr hope sir they wont let me go down t mine no youre discharged who by by me what for for smoking in the mine in spite of three warnings me smoking in t mine who telt you yon lie you were seen to pick the lock of your davylamp and that put the mine in danger then you were seen to light your pipe at the bare light and that put it in worse peril thats a lie what maks yer believe my skins nowt to me its all one as it is to them liars that would rob me of my bread out of clean spite its the truth and proved by four honest witnesses there are a hundred and fifty men and twenty ponies in that mine and their lives must not be sacrificed by one twolegged brute that wont hear reason you are discharged and paid so be good enough to quit the premises and find work elsewhere and lord help your employer whoever he is hope would waste no more time over this fellow he turned his back and went off briskly on his more important errand burnley shook his fist at him and discharged a volley of horrible curses after him whilst he was thus raging after the man that had done his duty he heard a satirical chuckle he turned his head and behold there was the sneering face of his fellow jailbird monckton burnley started yes mate said monckton it is me and what sort of a pal are you that couldnt send me a word to portland that you had dropped on to this rascal hope you knew i was after him you might have saved me the trouble you selfish brute burnley submitted at once to the ascendency of monckton he hung his head and muttered i am no scholard to write to folk you grudged a joey to a bloke to write for you now i suppose you expect me to be a good pal to you again all the same why not said burnley he is poison to you as well as to me he gave you twelve years penal you told me so at portland lets be revenged on him what else do you think i am here for you fool but empty revenge thats childs play the question is can you do what you are told ay if i see a chance of revenge why i always did what you told me very well then theres nothing ripe yet yer dont mean i am to wait a year for my revenge you will have to wait an opportunity revenge is like other luxuries theres a time for it do you think i am such a fool as to go in for blindfold revenge and get lagged or stretched not for joseph nor for you either benjamin ill tell you what though i think this will be a busy day it must be a busy day that old fox bartley has found out his blunder before now and hell try something on then the cliffords they wont go to sleep on it i dont know what yer talking about says burnley remain in your ignorance ben the best instrument is a blind instrument you shall have your revenge soon or late let it be soon then in the meantime said monckton have you got any money got my wages that will do for you today go to the publichouse and get halfdrunk halfdrunk halfdrunk dont i speak plain miners said burnley candidly never get halfdrunk in t county durham they are that the best part of their time then you get halfdrunk neither more nor less or ill discharge you as hope has done and that will be the worst discharge of the two for you when you are halfdrunk come here directly and hang about this place no you had better be under that tree in the middle of the field there and pretend to be sleeping off your liquor come mizzle when he had packed off burnley he got back into his hidingplace and only just in time for hope came back again upon the wings of love and grace whose elastic nature had revived saw him coming and came out to meet him hope scolded her urgently why had she got off the sofa when repose was so necessary for her you are mistaken dear father said she i am wonderfully strong and healthy i never fainted away in my life and my mind will not let me rest at presenti have been longing so for my father ah precious word murmured hope keep saying that word to me darling oh the years that i have pined for it dear father we will make up for all those years oh papa let us not part again never never not even for a day my child we never will what am i saying i shall have to give you back to one who has a stronger claim than ito your husband my husband said mary turning pale yes said hope for you know you have a husband oh i heard a few words there before i interfered but it is not to me youll say i dont know that was good enough for bartley and a lot of strangers come grace dear take my arm have no concealments from me trust to a fathers infinite love even if you have been imprudent or betrayed but thats a thing i shall never believe except from your lips take a turn with me my child since you can not lie down and rest a little air and gentle movement on your fathers arm and close to your fathers heart will be the next best thing for you then they walked to and fro like lovers why grace my child said he of course i understand it all no doubt you promised to keep your marriage secret or had some powerful reason for withholding it from strangers and indeed why should you reveal such a secret to insolence or to mere curiosity but you will tell the truth to me your father and your best friend you will tell me you are a wife father said mary trembling and her eyes roved as if she was looking out for the means of flight hope saw this look and it made him sick at heart for he had lived too long and observed too keenly not to know that innocence and purity are dangers and are more often protected by the safeguards of society than by themselves oh my child said he anything is better than this suspense why do you not answer me why do you torture me are you walter cliffords wife mary began to pant and sob oh papa have patience with me you do not know the danger wait till he comes back i dare not i can not then by heaven he shall he dropped her arm and his countenance became terrible she clung to him directly no no wait till i have seen him he will be back this very evening do not judge hastily and oh papa as you love your child do not act rashly i shall act firmly was hopes firm reply you have come from a sham father to a real one and you will be protected as well as loved this lover has forbidden you to confide in your father he did not know that i was your father but that makes no difference it looks very ugly and if he has wronged you he shall do you justice or i will have his life oh papa screamed mary his life why mine is bound up with it i fear so said hope but whats our life to us without our honor especially to a woman he is the true cain that destroys a pure virgin then he put both his hands on her shoulder and said look at me grace she looked at him full with eyes as brave as a lions and as gentle as a gazelles in a moment his senses enlightened him beyond the power of circumstances to deceive its a lie said he men are always lying and circumstances deceiving there is no blush of shame upon these cheeks no sin nor frailty in these pure eyes you are his wife i am cried grace unable to resist any longer thank god cried hope and father and daughter were locked that moment in a tender embrace yes papa you shall know all and then i shall have to fall on my knees and ask you not to punish one i lovefora fault committed years ago you will have pity on us both walter and i were married at the altar and i am his wife in the eyes of heaven but oh papa i fear i am not his lawful wife not his lawful wife child why what nonsense i would to heaven it was but this morning i learned for the first time that he had been married before oh it was years ago but she is alive impossible he could not be so base papa said mary very gravely i have seen the certificate the certificate said hope in dismay what certificate of the registry office it was shown me by a gentleman she sent expressly to warn me she had no idea that walter and i were married but she had heard somehow of our courtship i try to thank her and i tried and always will to save him from a prison and his family from disgrace and sacrifice yourself cried hope in agony i love him said mary and you must spare him i will have justice for my child grace was in such terror lest her father should punish walter that she begged him to consider whether in sacrificing herself she really had not been unintentionally wise what could she gain by publishing that she had married another womans husband i have lost my husband said she but i have found my father oh take me away and let me rest my broken heart upon yours far from all who know me every wound seems to be cured in this world and if time wont cure this my wound even with my fathers help the grave will oh misery cried hope do i hear such words as these from my child just entering upon life and all its joys hush papa said grace there is that man that man was mr bartley he looked very much distressed and proceeded at once to express his penitence chapter xix a woman outwits two men oh mary what can i say i was simply mad stung into fury by that foulmouthed ruffian mary i am deeply sorry and thoroughly ashamed of my violence and my cruelty and i implore you to think of the very many happy years we have spent together without an angry wordnot that you ever deserved one let us silence all comments return to me as the head of my house and the heiress of my fortune you will bind mr hope to me still more strongly he shall be my partner and he will not be so selfish as to ruin your future ay said hope thats the same specious argument you tempted me with twelve years ago but she was a helpless child then she is a woman now and can decide for herself as for me i will not be your partner i have a small royalty on your coal and that is enough for me but grace shall do as she pleases my child will you go to the brilliant future that his wealth can secure you or share my modest independence which will need all my love to brighten it think before you answer your own future life depends upon yourself with this he turned his back and walked for some distance very stoutly then leaned upon the palings with his back toward grace but even a back can speak and the young lady looked at him and her eyes filled then she turned them toward bartley and those clear eyes dried as if the fire in the heart had scorched them in the first place sir said she with a cold and cutting voice very unusual to her my name is not mary it is grace and be assured of this if there was not another roof in all the world to shelter me if i was helpless friendless and fatherless i would die in the nearest ditch rather than set my foot in the house from which i was thrust out with shame and insult such as no lady ever yet forgave but thank heaven i am not at your mercy at all he to whom nature has drawn me all these years is my fatheroh papa come to me is it for you to stand aloof it is into your hands with all the trust and love you have earned so well from your poor grace i give my love my veneration and my heart and soul forever then she flung herself panting on his bosom and he cried over her the next moment he led her to the house where he made her promise to repose now after this fresh trial and indeed he would have followed her but bartley implored him so piteously for the sake of old times not to refuse him one word more that he relented so far as to come out to him though he felt it was a waste of time he said mr bartley its no use nothing can undo this mornings work our paths lie apart from something walter clifford let fall one day i suspect he is the person you robbed and induced me to rob of a large fortune well what is he to you have pity upon me be silent and name your own price wrong walter clifford with my eyes open he is the last man in the world that i would wrong in money matters i have got a stern account against him and i will begin it by speaking the truth and giving him back his own here the interview was interrupted by an honest miner one jim perkins he came in hurriedly and like people of that class thrust everybody elses business out of his way you are wanted at the mine mr hope the shoring of the old works is giving way and theres a deal of water collecting in another part ill come at once said hope the mens lives must not be endangered have the cage ready jim walked away hope turned to bartley pray understand mr bartley that this is my last visit to your mine one moment hope cried bartley in despair we have been friends so long surely you owe me something i do well then ill make you rich for life if you will but let mary return to me and only just be silent speak neither for me nor against me surely that is not much for an old friend to ask what is your answer that i will speak the truth and keep my conscience and my child this answer literally crushed bartley his very knees knocked together he leaned against the palings sick at heart he saw that colonel clifford would extort not only walters legacy but what the lawyers call the mesne profits that is to say the interest and the various proceeds from the fraud during fourteen years whilst he was in this condition of bodily collapse and mental horror a cold cynical voice dropped icicles so to speak into his ear in a fix governor eh the girl wont come back and hope wont hold his tongue bartley looked round in amazement and saw the cadaverous face and diabolical sneer of leonard monckton fourteen years and evil passions had furrowed that bloodless cheek but there was no mistaking the man it was a surprise to bartley to see him there and be spoken to by a knave who had tried to rob him but he was too full of his immediate trouble to think much of minor things what do you know about it said he roughly ill tell you said monckton coolly he then walked in a most leisurely way to the gate that led into the meadow whose eastern boundary was hopes quickset hedge and he came in the same leisurely way up to mr bartley and leaned his back with his hands behind him with perfect effrontery against the palings i know all said he i overheard you in your office fourteen years ago when you changed children with hope bartley uttered an exclamation of dismay and ive been hovering about here all day and watched the little game and now i am fly and no mistake bartley threw up his hands in dismay then its all over i am doubly ruined i can not hope to silence you both dont speak so loud governor why not said bartley others will if i dont he lowered his voice for all that and wondered what was coming listen to me said monckton exchanging his cynical manner for a quiet and weighty one bartley began to wonder and look at him with a sort of awe the words now dropped out of moncktons thin lips as if they were chips of granite so full of meaning was every syllable and bartley felt it its not so bad as it looks there are only two men that know you are a felon bartley winced visibly now one of those men is to be boughtbartley lifted his head with a faint gleam of hope at thatand the otherhas gonedown a coalmine what good will that do me the villain paused and looked bartley in the face that depends suppose you were to offer me what you offered hope and suppose hopewas neverto come upagain no such luck said bartley shaking his head sorrowfully luck said monckton contemptuously we make our own luck do you see that vagabond lying under the tree thats ben burnley ah said bartley the ruffian hope discharged the same and a man that is burning to be revenged on him hes your luck mr bartley i know the man and what he has done in a mine before today then he drew near to bartleys ear and hissed into it these fearful words send him down the mine promise him five hundred poundsif william hopenever comes up againand william hope never will bartley drew back aghast assassination he cried and by a generous impulse of horror he half fled from the tempter but monckton followed him up and laid his hand upon his shoulder hush said he you are getting too near that window and it is open let me see theres nobody inside he looked in there was nobody grace was upstairs but it did so happen that she came into the room soon after nothing of the kind accident accidents will happen in mines and talking of luck this mine was declared dangerous this very day no no groaned bartley trembling in every limb its a horrible crime i dare not risk it it is but a risk the alternative is certain you will be indicted for fraud by the cliffords bartley groaned theyll live in your home theyll revel in your money while you wear a cropped headand a convict dressin a stone cell at portland no never screamed bartley man man you are tempting me to my perdition i am saving you just considerwhere is the risk it is only an accident and who will suspect you men dont ruin their own mines here just let me call him bartley made a faint gesture to forbid it but monckton pretended to take that as an assent hy ben he cried come here no no cried bartley ill have nothing to do with him well said monckton then dont but hear what he has got to say hell tell you how easily accidents happen in a mine then burnley came in but stood at some distance bartley turned his back upon them both and edged away from them a little but monckton stood between the two men determined to bring them together ben said he mr bartley takes you on again at my request no thanks to mr hope no curse him i know that talking of that ben how was it that you got rid of that troublesome overseer in the welsh colliery ben started and looked aghast for a moment but soon recovered himself and told his tale of blood with a strange mixture of satisfaction and awe washing his hands in the air nervously all the time well you see sir we put some guncotton in a small canister with a fuse cut to last fowr minutes and hid it in one of the old workings the men had left then they telt t overseer they thowt t water was coming in by quickly he got there just in time and what with t explosion firedamp and fallen coal we never saw t overseer again dear me said monckton and mr hope has gone down the mine expressly to inspect old workings is it not a strange coincidence now if such an accident was to befall mr hope its my belief mr bartley would give you five hundred pounds bartley made no reply the perspiration was pouring down his face and he looked a picture of abject guilt and terror monckton looked at him and decided for him he went softly like a cat to ben burnley and said if an accident does occur and that man never comes up again you are to have five hundred pounds five hundred pounds shouted ben i do t job nay nay but said he and his countenance fell they will not let me go down the mine the diabolical agent went catlike to bartley please give me a written order to let this man go to work again in the mine bartley trembled and hesitated but at last took out his pocketbook and wrote on a leaf take burnley on again r bartley whilst writing it his hand shook and when it was written he would not tear it out he panted and quivered and was as pale as ashes and said no no its a deathwarrant i can not and his trembling hand tried to convey the notebook back to his pocket but it fell from his shaking fingers and monckton took it up and quietly tore the leaf out and took it across to burnley in spite of a feeble gesture the struggling wretch made to detain him he gave ben the paper and whispered be off before he changes his mind youll hear of an accident in the mine before the day is over said burnley and he went off without a grain of remorse under the double stimulus of revenge and lucre hell do it cried monckton triumphantly and hope will end his days in the bartley mine these words were hardly out of his lips when grace hope walked out of the house pale and with her eyes gleaming and walked rapidly past them she had nothing on her head but a white handkerchief that was tied under her chin her appearance and her manner struck the conspirators with terror bartley stood aghast but the more resolute villain seized her as she passed him she was not a bit frightened at that but utterly amazed it was a public road how dare you touch me you villain she cried let me go ah i shall know you again with your face like a corpse and your villainous eyes let me go or ill have you hung where are you going said bartley trembling to my father he is not your father it is a conspiracy you must come home with me never cried mary and by a sudden and violent effort she flung monckton off but bartley mad with terror seized her that moment and that gave monckton time to recover and seize her again by the arm you are not of age cried bartley you are under my authority and you shall come home with me no no cried mary help help murder help she screamed and struggled so violently that with all their efforts they could hardly hold her then the devil monckton began to cry louder still shes mad shes mad help to secure a mad woman this terrified grace hope she had read of the villainies that had been done under cover of that accusation which indeed has too often prevented honest men from interfering with deeds of lawless violence but she had all her wits about her womans wit included she let them drag her past the cottage door then she cried out with delight ah here is my father they followed the direction of her eye and relaxed their grasp instantly she drew her hands vigorously downward got clear of them gave them each a furious push that sent them flying forward then darted back through the open door closed it and bolted it inside just as monckton recovering himself quickly dashed furiously against itin vain the quickwitted villain saw the pressing danger in a moment to the back door or we are lost he yelled bartley dashed round to that door with a cry of dismay but grace was before him just half a minute she ran through the house alas the infernal door was secure the woman had locked it when she went out grace came flying back to the front and drew the bolt softly but as she did so she heard a hammering and found the door was fast unluckily hopes toolbasket was on the windowledge and monckton drove a heavy nail obliquely through the bottom of the door and it was immovable then mary slipped with catlike step to the window and had her hand on the sill to vault clean out into the road she was perfectly capable it being one of her calisthenic exercises but here again her watchful enemy encountered her he raised his hammer as if to strike her handthough perhaps he might not have gone that lengthbut she was a woman and drew back at that cruel gesture instantly he closed the outside shutters he didnt trouble about the window but these outside shutters he proceeded to nail up and as the trap was now complete he took his time and by a natural reaction from his fears he permitted himself to exult a little thank you mr hope for the use of your tools rattat there my little bird youre caged rattattat did you really thinkrattattwo menrattattatwere to be beaten by one woman the prisoner thus secured he drew aside with justifiable pride to admire his work this action enabled him to see the side of the cottage he had secured so cleverly in front and behind and there was grace hope coming down from her bedroom window she had tied two crimson curtains together by a useful knot which is called at sea a fishermans bend fastened one end to the bed or something and she was coming down this extemporized rope hand over hand alternately with as much ease and grace as if she were walking down marble steps monckton flung his arm and body wildly over the paling and grabbed her with his finger ends she gave a spang with her heels against the wall and took a bold leap away from him into a tulipbed ten feet distant at least he yelled to bartley to the garden and not losing a moment flung his leg over the paling to catch her with bartleys help in this new trap mary dashed off without a moments hesitation at the quickset hedge she did not run up to it and hesitate like a woman for it was not to be wriggled through she went at it with the momentum and impetus of a racehorse and through it as if it was made of blottingpaper leaving a wonderfully small hole but some shreds of her dress and across the meadow at a pace that neither bartley nor monckton men past their prime could hope to rival even if she had not got the start they gazed aghast at one another at the premises so suddenly emptied as if by magic at the crimson curtain floating like a banner and glowing beautifully amongst the green creepers and at that flying figure with her hair that glittered in the sun and streamed horizontal in the wind with her velocity flying to the mine to save william hope and give these baffled conspirators a life of penal servitude chapter xx calamity the baffled conspirators saw grace hope bound over a stile like a deer and dash up to the mine then there was a hurried colloquy and some men were seen to start from the mine and run toward hopes cottage what actually took place was this she arrived panting and begged to be sent down the mine at once the deputy said you cannot miss without an order from mr hope i am his daughter sir said she he has claimed me from mr bartley this day at that word the man took off his hat to her let me down this instant theres a plot to fire the mine and destroy my dear father a plot to fire the mine said the man all aghast why who by hy cage ready there one burnley but hes bribed by a stranger send me down to warn my father but you run and seize that villain you can not mistake him he wears a light suit of tweed all one color he has very black eyebrows and a face like a corpse and a large gold ring on the little finger of his right hand you will find him somewhere near my fathers cottage neither you nor i have a moment to lose then the deputy called three more men and made for hopes cottage while grace went down in the cage bartley fled in mortal terror to his own house and began to pack up his things to leave the country monckton withdrew to the clump of firtrees and from that thin shelter watched the mine intending to levant as soon as he should see hope come up safe and sound but when he saw three or four men start from the mine and run across to him he took the alarm and sought the thicker shelter of a copse hard by it was a very thick cover good for temporary concealment but he soon found it was so narrow that he couldnt emerge from it on either side without being seen at once and his quick wit told him that grace had denounced him and probably described him accurately to the miners he was in mortal terror but not unprepared for this sort of danger the first thing he did was to whip off his entire tweed suit and turn it inside out he had had it made on purpose it was a thin tweed doubled with black kerseymere so that this change was a downright transformation then he substituted a black tie for a colored one whipped out a little mirror and his haresfoot etc browned and colored his cheek put on an admirable gray wig whiskers mustache and beard and partly whitened his eyebrows and hobbled feebly out of the little wood an infirm old man presently he caught sight of his gold ring ah said he she is a sharp girl perhaps she noticed that in the struggle he took it off and was going to put it in his pocket but thought better of that and chucked it into a ditch then he made for the village the pursuers hunted about the house and of course didnt find him but presently one of them saw him crossing a meadow not far off so they ran toward him and hailed him hy mister he went feebly on and did not seem to hear then they hailed him again and ran toward him then he turned and stopped and seeing men running toward him took out a large pair of round spectacles and put them on to look at them by this artifice that which in reality completed his disguise seemed but a natural movement in an old man to see better who it was that wanted him what be you doing here said the man well my good man said monckton affecting surprise i have been visiting an old friend and now im going home again i hope i am not trespassing is not this the way to the village they told me it was thats right enough said the deputy but by the way you come you just have seen him no sir said monckton i havent seen anybody except one gentleman that came through that wood there as i passed it what was he like sir well i didnt take particular notice and he passed me all in a hurry that would be the man said the deputy had he a very pale face not that i remarked he seemed rather heated with running how was he dressed sir oh like many of the young people all of one pattern light or dark light i think was it a tweed suit i almost think it was what had he been doinganything wrong he seemed to me to be rather scaredlike which way did he go sir i think he made for that great house sir come on said the deputy and he followed this treacherous indication hot in pursuit monckton lost no time he took off twenty years and reached the dun cow as an old acquaintance he hired the one vehicle the establishment possessed and was off like a shot to derby thence he dispatched a note to his lodgings to say he was suddenly called to town but should be back in a week not that he ever intended to show his face in that neighborhood again nevertheless events occasioned that stopped both his flight and bartleys and yet broke up their unholy alliance it was hopes final inspection of the bartley mine and he took things in order months ago a second shaft had been sunk by his wise instructions and but for bartleys parsimony would have been now completed hope now ascertained how many feet it was short and noted this down for bartley then still inspecting he went to the other extremity of the mine and reached a sort of hall or amphitheatre much higher than the passages this was a centre with diverging passages on one side but closed on the other two of these passages led by oblique routes to those old works the shoring of which had been reported unsafe this amphitheatre was now a busy scene empty trucks being pushed off full trucks being pushed on all the men carrying lighted lanterns that wavered and glinted like wills of the wisp presently a bell rung and a portion of the men to whom this was a signal left off work and began to put on their jackets and to await the descent of the cage to take them up in parties at this moment hope met to his surprise a figure that looked like ben burnley he put up his lamp to see if he was right and ben burnley it was the ruffian had the audacity to put up his lamp as if to scrutinize the person who examined him did i not discharge you said hope ay lad said ben but your master put me on again with that he showed bartleys order and signature hope bit his lips but merely said he will rue it burnley sidled away but hope cried to one or two men who were about keep a sharp lookout on him my men your lives are not safe whilst hes in the mine burnley leaned insolently against a truck and gave the men nothing to observe the next minute in bustled the honest miner at whose instance hope had come down the mine and begged him to come and visit the shoring at once hope asked if there were any other men there the miner replied in the negative very well then said hope ill just take one look at the water here and ill be at the shoring in five minutes unfortunately this unwary statement let burnley know exactly what to do he had already concealed in the woodwork a canister of dynamite and a fuse to it to last about five minutes he now wriggled away under cover of hopes dialogue and lighted the fuse then he came flying back to get safe out of the mine and leave hope in his deathtrap but in the meantime grace hope came down in the cage and caught sight of her father and came screaming to him father father you here my child theres a plot to murder you a man called burnley is to cause an explosion at the old works just as you visit them an explosion cried hope and firedamp about one explosion will cause fiftyring the bellhere men danger then there was a rush of men ben burnley is firing the mine there was a yell of fury but a distant explosion turned it to one of dismay hope caught his daughter up in his arms and put her into a cavity fly men to the other part of the mine he cried there was a louder explosion in ran burnley terrified at his own work and flying to escape hope sprang out upon him no you dontliving or dead you are the last to leave this mine burnley struggled furiously but hope dashed him down at his feet just as a far more awful explosion than all took place one side of that amphitheatre fell in and the very earth heaved the corner part of the shaft fell in upon the cage and many poor miners who were hoping to escape by it but those escaped for the present who obeyed hopes order and fled to another part of the mine and when the stifling vapors drifted away there stood hope pale as death but strong as iron with the assassin at his feet and poor grace crouching and quivering in her recess their fate now awaited these three a speedy death by chokedamp or a slow death by starvation or a rescue from the outside under circumstances of unparalleled difficulty since there was but one shaft completed and that was now closed by a mountain of debris chapter xxi buried alive the explosions so tremendously loud below were but muffled sounds at the pits mouth but alas these muffled sounds and one flash of lurid flame that shot up into the air told the tale of horror to every experienced pitman and his wife and the cry of a whole village went up to heaven the calamity spread like wildfire it soon found its way to clifford hall and the deputy ran himself with the news to mr bartley bartley received it at first with a stony glare and trembled all over then the deputy lowering his voice said sir the worst of it is there is foul play in it there is good authority to say that ben burnley fired the mine to destroy his betters and he has done it for mr hope and miss hope that is miss bartley that was are both there he added in a broken voice and if they are not buried or stifled it will be hard work to save them the mine is a ruin bartley delivered a wild scream and dashed out of the house at once he did not even take his hat but the deputy more selfpossessed took one out of the hall and followed him bartley hurried to the mine and found that several stout fellows had gone down with their pickaxes and other tools to clear the shaft but that it must be terribly slow work so few men could work at a time in that narrow space bartley telegraphed to derby for a more powerful steamengine and experienced engineers and set another gang to open the new shaft to the bottom and see if any sufferers could be saved that way whatever he did was wise but his manner was frenzied none of his people thought he had so much feeling and more than one of the quaking women gave him a kind word he made no reply he did not even seem to hear he wandered about the mine all night wringing his hands and at last he was taken home almost by force humanity overpowered prejudice and colonel clifford came to the mine to see if he could be of any use to the sufferers he got hold of the deputy and learned from him what bartley was doing he said he thought that was the best course as there would be division of labor but said he i am an old campaigner and i know that men can not fight without food and this work will be a fight how will you house the newcomers there are fortyseven men missing and the new men can sleep in their cottages thats so said the colonel but there are the wives and the children i shall send sleeping tents and eating tents and provisions enough to feed a battalion fortyseven lives said he pityingly ay sir said the deputy and such lives some of them for mr hope and miss mary bartleyleastways that is not her name now shes mr hopes daughter why what has she to do with it i am sorry to say sir she is down the mine god forbid said the colonel that noble girl dead or in mortal danger she is sir and lowering his voice by foul play then seeing the colonel greatly shocked and moved he said and i ought not to keep it from you you are our nearest magistrate the young lady told me at the pit mouth she is mr hopes daughter and so she is and she said there was a plot to destroy her father in the mine by exploding the old workings he was going to visit one ben burnley was to do it a blackguard that has a spite against mr hope for discharging him but there was money behind him and a villain that she described to usblack eyebrows a face like a corpse and dressed in a suit of tweed one color we hoped that she might have been mistaken or she might have warned mr hope in time but now it is to be seen that there was no mistake and she had not time to warn him the deed is done and a darker deed was never done even in the dark colonel clifford groaned after a while he said seize that ben burnley at once or he will soon leave this place behind him no he wont said the deputy he is in the mine that is one comfort and if he comes out alive his life wont be worth much with the law on one side of the blackguard and judge lynch on tother the first thing said the colonel is to save these precious lives god help us and them he then went to the railway and wired certain leading tradesmen in derby for provisions salt and fresh on a large scale and for new tents he had some old ones stored away in his own house he also secured abundance of knives forks plates buckets pitchers and jugs and in short he opened a commissariat he inquired for his son walter and why he was so late he could learn nothing but that walter had mounted a hunter and left word with baker that he should not be home till eight oclock john said the colonel solemnly i am in great trouble and walter is in worse i fear let nobody speak to him about this accident at the mine till he has seen me walter clifford rode to the lake hotel to inquire after the bracelet the landlady told him she had sent her husband over with it that day confound it said walter why he wont know who to take it to oh its all right sir said she my sam wont give it to the wrong person you may be sure how do i know that said walter and pray who did you tell him to give it to why to the lady as was here with you and how the deuce is he to find her he does not know her name its a great pity you could not keep it till i came well sir you was so long acoming thats true said walter let us make the best of it i shall feed my horse and get home as quickly as i can however he knew he would be late and thought he had better go straight home he sent a telegram to mary bartley landlord gone to you with bracelet and this he signed with the name of the landlady but no address he was afraid to say more though he would have liked to put his wife upon her guard but he trusted to her natural shrewdness he mounted his horse and went straight home but he was late for dinner and that vexed him a little for it was a matter colonel clifford was particular about he dashed up to his bedroom and began to dress all in a hurry john baker came to him wearing a very extraordinary look and after some hesitation said i would not change my clothes if i were you mr walter oh said walter i am too late you know in for a penny in for a pound but sir said old john the colonel wants to speak to you in the drawingroom now walter was excited with the events of the day irritated by the affront his father had put upon him and mary strung up by hard riding etc he burst out well i shall not go to him i have had enough of thisbadgered and bullied and my sweetheart affrontedand now i suppose i am to be lectured again you say i am not well and bring my dinner up here no mr walter said the old man gravely i must not do that sir dont you think as you are to be scolded or the angel you love affronted all that is over forever there has been many a strange thing happened since you rode out of our stable last but i wish you would go to the colonel and let him tell you all however i suppose i may tell you so much as this that your sweetheart is not mary bartley at all she is mr hopes daughter what cried walter in utter amazement there is no doubt about it sir said the old man and i believe it is all out about you and her but that would not matter for the colonel he takes it quite different from what you might think he swears by her now i dont know really how that came about sir for i was not there but when i was dressing the colonel he said to me john shes the grandest girl in england and an honor to her sex and there is not a drop of bartleys blood in her oh he has found that out said walter then ill go to him like a bird dear old fellow so that is what he wanted to tell me no said john baker gravely no said walter what then its trouble trouble said walter puzzled ay my poor young master said baker tenderlysore trouble such trouble as a fathers heart wont let me or any man break to you while he lives to do it i know my master ever since that fellow bartley came here we have seen the worst of him now we shall see the best of him go to him dear master walter dont waste time in talking to old john baker go to your father and your friend walter clifford cast a look of wonder and alarm on the old man and went down at once to the drawingroom his father was standing by the fire he came forward to him with both hands and said my son father said walter in a whisper what is it have you heard nothing nothing but good news fatherthat you approve my choice ah john told you that yes sir and did he tell you anything else no sir only that some great misfortune is upon me and that i have my fathers sympathy you have said the colonel and would to god i had known the truth before she is not bartleys daughter at all she is hopes daughter her virtue shines in her face she is noble she is selfdenying she is just she is brave and no doubt she can account for her being at the lake hotel in company with some man or other whatever that lady says will be the truth thats not the trouble walter all that has become small by comparison but shall we ever see her sweet face again or hear her voice father said walter trembling you terrify me this sudden change in your voice that i never heard falter before some great calamity must have happened tell me the worst at once walter said the old man stand firm do not despair for there is hope thank god for that father now tell me all walter there has been an explosion in the minea fearful explosion the shaft has fallen in there is no getting access to the mine and all the poor souls confined there are in mortal peril those who are best acquainted with the mine do not think that many of them have been destroyed by the ruin but they tell me these explosions let loose poisonous gases and so now those poor souls are all exposed to three deadly perilschokedamp firedamp and starvation its pitiable said walter but surely this is a calamity to bartley and to the poor miners but not to any one that i love and that you have learnt to respect my son said the colonel solemnly the mine was fired by foul play is it possible it is believed that some rival owner or else some personal enemy of william hope bribed a villain to fire some part of the mine that hope was inspecting great heavens said walter can such villains exist poor poor mr hope who would think he had an enemy in the world alas said the colonel that is not all his daughter it seems overheard the villain bribing the ruffian to commit this foul and terrible act and she flew to the mine directly she dispatched some miners to seize that hellish villain and she went down the mine to save her father ah said walter trembling all over she has never been seen since the colonels head sank for a moment on his breast walter groaned and turned pale she came too late to save him she came in time to share his fate walter sank into a chair and a deadly pallor overspread his face his forehead and his very lips the colonel rushed to the door and called for help and in a moment john baker and mrs milton and julia clifford were round poor walters chair with brandy and ether and salts and every stimulant he did not faint away strong men very seldom do at any mere mental shock the color came slowly back to his cheeks and his pale lips and his eyes began to fill with horror the weeping women and even the stout colonel viewed with anxiety his return to the full consciousness of his calamity be brave cried colonel clifford be a soldiers son dont despair fight nothing has been neglected even bartley is playing the man he has got another engine coming up and another body of workmen to open the new shaft as well as the old one god bless him said walter and i have an experienced engineer on the road and the things civilians always forgettents and provisions of all sorts we will set an army to work sooner than your sweetheart poor girl shall lose her life by any fault of ours my sweetheart cried walter starting suddenly from his chair there dont cling to me women no man shall head that army but i my sweetheart god help meshes my wife chapter xxii remorse in a work of this kind not only the external incidents should be noticed but also what may be called the mental events we have seen a calamity produce a great revulsion in the feelings of colonel clifford but as for robert bartley his very character was shaken to the foundation by his crime and its terrible consequences he was now like a man who had glided down a soft sunny slope and was suddenly arrested at the brink of a fathomless precipice bartley was cunning selfish avaricious unscrupulous in reality so long as he could appear respectable but he was not violent nor physically reckless still less cruel a deed of blood shocked him as much as it would shock an honest man yet now through following his natural bent too far and yielding to the influence of a remorseless villain he found his own hands stained with bloodthe blood of a man who after all had been his best friend and had led him to fortune and the blood of an innocent girl who had not only been his pecuniary benefactress for a time but had warmed and lighted his house with her beauty and affection busy men whose views are all external are even more apt than others to miss the knowledge of their own minds this man to whom everything was business had taken for granted he did not actually love grace hope why she was another mans child but now he had lost her forever he found he had mistaken his own feelings he looked round his gloomy horizon and realized too late that he did love her it was not a great and penetrating love like william hopes he was incapable of such a sentiment but what affection he had to bestow he had given to this sweet creature his house was dark without her he was desolate and alone and horrible to think of the instrument of her assassination this thought drove him to frenzy and his frenzy took two forms furious excitement and gloomy despair this was now his life by night and day for sleep deserted him at the mine his measures were all wise but his manner very wild the very miners whispered amongst themselves that he was going mad at home on the contrary he was gloomy with sullen despair he was in this latter condition the evening after the explosion when a visitor was announced thinking it was some one from the mine he said faintly admit him and then his despondent head dropped on his breast indeed he was in a sort of lethargy worn out with his labors his remorse and his sleeplessness in that condition his ear was suddenly jarred by a hard metallic voice whose tone was somehow opposed to all the voices with which goodness and humanity have ever spoken well governor heres a slice of luck bartley shivered is that the devil speaking to me he muttered without looking up no said monckton jauntily only one of his servants and your best friend my friend said bartley turning his chair and looking at him with a sort of dull wonder ay said monckton your friend the man that found you brains and resolution and took you out of the hole and put hope and his daughter in it instead no not his daughter she did that for us she was so clever yes said bartley wildly it was you who made me an assassin but for you i should only have been a knave now i am a murdererthanks to you come governor said monckton no use looking at one side of the picture you tried other things first you made him liberal offers you know but he would have war to the knife and he has got it he is buried at the bottom of that shaft god forbid and you are all right i am in hell shrieked bartley well come out of it said monckton and lets talk sense ii read the news at derby just as i was starting for london i have been as near the mine as i thought safe they seem to be very busy clearing out both shaftstwo steamengines constant relays of workmen who has got the job in hand i have said bartley well thats clever of you to throw dust in their eyes and put our little game off your own shoulders you want to save appearances you know you can not save william hope i can save him and i will save him god will have mercy on a penitent assassin as he once had upon a penitent thief monckton stared at him and smiled who has been talking to youthe parson my own conscience i abhor myself as much as i do you you black villain ah said monckton with a wicked glance thats how a man patters before he splits upon his pals to save his own skin now look here old man before you split on me ask yourself who had the greatest interest in this job you silenced a dangerous enemy but what have i gained you ought to square with me first as you promised if you split upon me before that you will put yourself in the hole and leave me out of it villain and fool said bartley these trifles do not trouble me now if hope and my dear mary are found dead in that mine ill tell how they came by their death and ill die by my own hand monckton said nothing but looked at him keenly and began at last to feel uneasy a shaft is but a narrow thing bartley rejoined why should they be buried alive lets get to them before they are starved to death we may save them yet why you fool theyll denounce us what do i care i would save them both tonight if i was to stand in the dock tomorrow and swing on the gallows next week or end your days in a prison id take my chance said bartley desperately ill undo my crime if i can no punishment can equal the agony i am in now thanks to you you villain then turning on him suddenly and showing him the white of his eyes like a maniac or a dangerous mastiff he hissed out you think nothing of the lives of better men perhaps you dont value your own oh i beg your pardon said monckton thats a very different thing oh you do value your own foul life at any amount of money said monckton then why do you risk it excuse me governor thats a thing i make a point of not doing i risk my instruments not my head ben burnley to wit you are risking it now said bartley looking still more strangely at him how so pray said monckton getting a little uneasy for this was not the bartley he had known till then bartley took the poker in his hand and proceeded to poke the fire but somehow he did not look at the fire he looked askant at monckton and he showed the white of his eyes more and more monckton kept his eye upon him and put his hand upon the handle of the door ill tell you said bartleyby coming here to tempt provoke and insult the wretch whose soul you destroyed by forcing me to assassinate the best man and the sweetest girl in england when there were vipers and villains about whom its a good action to sweep off gods earth villain ill teach you to come like a fool and madden a madman i was only a rogue you have made me a man of blood all the worse for you i have murdered them ill execute you and with these words he bounded on him like a panther monckton tore the doors open and dashed out but a furious blow fell before he was quite clear of the doorway with such force was it delivered that the blunt metal cut into the edge of the door like a sword the jamb was smashed and even monckton who received but onefourth of the blow fell upon his hands and knees into the hall and was stunned for a moment but fearing worse staggered out of the hall door which luckily for him was open and darting into a little grove of shrubs that was close by grovelled there in silence bleeding like a pig and waiting for his chance to escape entirely but the quaking reptile ran no further risk bartley never followed him beyond his own room he had been goaded into a maniacal impulse and he returned to his gloomy sullenness walters declaration made so suddenly before four persons startled them greatly for a momentbut only for a moment julia was the first to speak we might have known it she said mary bartley is a young lady incapable of misconduct she is prudence virtue delicacy and purity in person the man she was with at that place was sure to be her husband and who should that be but walter whom she loved then the servants looked anxiously at their master to see how he took this startling revelation well the colonel stood firm as if he was at the head of a column in the field he was not the man to retreat from any position he said all we have to do is to save her then my house and arms are open to my sons wife god bless you father cried walter in a broken voice and god bless you dear cousin yes its no time for words and he was gone in a moment now milton said the colonel he wont sleep here till the work is done and he wont sleep at all if we dont get a bed for him near the mine you order the break out and go to the dun cow and do what you can for him that i will sir ill take his own sheets and bedding with me i wont trust that womanshe talks too much and if you please sir ill stay there a day or two myself for maybe i shall coax him to eat a morsel of my cooking and to lie down a bit when he would not listen to a stranger youre a faithful creature said the colonel rather aggressively not choosing to break down so are you john and it is at these moments we find out our friends in the house and confound you i forbid you both to snivel said he still louder then more gravely how do we know many a stormy day ends well this calamity may bring happiness and peace to a divided house colonel clifford prophesied right walter took the lead of a working gang and worked night and day resting two hours only in the twentyfour and even that with great reluctance outside the scene was one of bustle and animation little white tents for the strange workmen to sleep in dotted the green and two snowy refreshment tents were pitched outside the dun cow that establishment had large brick ovens and boilers and the landlady and the women she had got to help her kept the tables always groaning under solid fare that never once flagged being under the charge of that old campaigner colonel clifford the landlady tried to look sad at the occasion which called forth her energy and talents but she was a woman of business and her complacency oozed through her ah it was not so at the pit mouth the poor wives whose husbands were entombed below alive or dead hovered and fluttered about the two shafts with their aprons to their eyes and eager with their questions deadly were their fears their hopes fainter and fainter as day after day went by and both gangs working in so narrow a space made little progress compared with their own desires and the prayers of those who trembled for the result it was a race and a struggle of two gallant parties and a short description of it will be given but as no new incidents happened for six days we shall preserve the chronological order of events and now relate a daring project which was revived in that interval monckton and bartley were now enemies sin had united crime and remorse had disunited them monckton registered a vow of future vengeance upon his late associate but in the meantime taking a survey of the present circumstances he fell back upon a dark project he had conceived years ago on the very day when he was arrested for theft in bartleys office perhaps our readers their memory disturbed by such a number of various matters as we have since presented to them may have forgotten that project but what is about to follow will tend to revive their recollection monckton then wired to mrs brahams lawyer demanding an immediate interview with that lady he specified the hour the lawyer went to her directly the matter being delicate he found her in great distress and before he could open his communication she told him her trouble she said that her husband she feared was going out of his mind he groaned all night and never slept and in the daytime never spoke there had been just then some surprising falls and rises in foreign securities and the shrewd lawyer divined at once that the stockbroker had been doing business on his own account and got pinched so he said my dear madam i suspect it is business on the exchange he will get over that but there is something that is immediately pressing and he then gave her moncktons message now her nerves were already excited and this made matters worse she cried and trembled and became hysterical and vowed she would never go near leonard monckton again he had never loved her had never been a friend to her as jonathan braham had no said she if he wants money take and sell my jewels but i shall stay with my husband in his trouble he is not your husband said the lawyer quietly and this man is your husband and things have come to my knowledge lately which it would be imprudent at present to disclose either to him or you but we are old friends you can not doubt that i have your interest at heart no i dont doubt that said lucy hastily and held out her hand to him well then said he be persuaded and meet the man no i will not do that said she i am not a good woman i know but it is not for want of the wish i will not play double any more and from that nothing he could say could move her the lawyer returned to his place and when monckton called next day he told him he was sorry to say mr braham was ill and in trouble and the lady couldnt meet him she would make any reasonable sacrifice for his convenience except that and i said monckton insist upon that and nothing else the lawyer endeavored to soften him and hinted that he would advance money himself sooner than his client should be tormented but monckton was inflexible he said it is about a matter that she can not communicate to you nor can i however i am obliged to you for your information she wont leave her stockbroker eh well then i know where to find her and he took up his hat to go no pray dont do that said mr middleton earnestly let me try her again she has had time to sleep over it try her said monckton sternly and if you are her friend take her husbands side in this one thing its the last time i shall trouble her i am her friend said the lawyer and if you must know i rather wish her to meet you and get it over will you come here again at five oclock all right said monckton monckton was struck with lawyer middletons manner and went away puzzling over it whats his little game i wonder said he the lawyer went posthaste to his clients house he found her in tears she handed him an open letter braham was utterly ruined and besides that had done something or other he did not care to name he was off to america leaving her what money she could find in the house and the furniture which he advised her to sell at once before others claimed it in short the man was wild with fear and at present thought but little of anybody but himself then the lawyer set himself to comfort her as well as he could and renewed his request that she would give monckton a meeting yes said she wearilyit is no use trying to resist him he can come here the lawyer demurred to that no said he keep your own counsel dont let him know you are deserted and ruined make a favor of coming but come and a word in your earhe can do more for you than braham can or will ever do again so dont you thwart him if you can help she was quick enough to see there was something weighty behind and she consented he took her back with him only she was such a long time removing the traces of tears and choosing the bonnet she thought she should look best in that she made him twenty minutes late and rather cross it is a way women have of souring that honeycomb a man when the trio met at the office the husband was pale the wife dull and sullen its the last time i shall trouble you lucy said monckton as you please leonard and i want you to make my fortune you have only to tell me how quite incredulously you must accompany me to derbyshire or else meet me at derby whichever you please oh dont be alarmed i dont ask you to travel with me as man and wife it doesnt much matter i suppose said lucy doggedly well you are accommodating ill be considerate no doubt you will said lucy then turning her glorious eyes full upon him whats the crime the crime said monckton looking all about the room to find it what crime the crime im wanted for all your schemes are criminal you know well youre complimentary its not a crime this time its only a confession ah what am i to confessbigamy the idea no you are to confessin a distant part of england what you can deny in london next daythat on a certain day you married a gentleman called walter clifford ill say that on the eleventh day of june i married a gentleman who was called walter clifford this was lucys reply and given very doggedly bravo and will you stand to it if the real walter clifford says it is a lie lucy reflected no i will not well well we shall have time to talk about that when can you start give me three days all right you wont keep me there long after i have done this wicked thing no no i will send you home with flying colors and you shall have your share of the plunder id rather go into service again and work my fingers to the bone since you have such a contempt for money perhaps youll stand fifty pounds i have no money with me but ill ask mr middleton to advance me some she opened the door and asked one of the clerks if she could see the principal for a moment he came to her directly she then said to him he wants fifty pounds could you let me have it for him oh said the lawyer cheerfully i shall be happy to lend mr monckton fifty or a hundred pounds upon his own note of hand they both stared at him a little but a blank note of hand was immediately produced drawn and signed at six months date for l s and the lawyer gave monckton his check for l husband and wife then parted for a time monckton telegraphed to his lodgings to say that his sister would come down with him for country air and would require good accommodation but would pay liberally in most mining accidents the shafts are clear and the debris that has to be picked through to get to the entombed miners is attacked with this advantage that a great number of men have room to use their arms and pickaxes and the stuff has not to be sent up to the surface but in this horrible accident both gangs of workers were confined to a small area and small cages and the stuff had to be sent up to the surface bartley who seemed to live only to rescue the sufferers by his own fault provided miles of rope and had small cages knocked together so that the debris was continually coming up from both the shafts and one great source of delay was averted but the other fatal cause of delay remained and so daylight came and went and the stars appeared and disappeared with incredible rapidity to poor walter and the other gallant workers before they got within thirty feet of the pit those who worked in the old shafts having looser stuff to deal with gained an advance of about seven feet upon the other working party and this being reported to walter he went down the other shaft to inspire the men by words and example he had not been down two hours when one of the miners cried hold hard they are working up to us and work was instantly suspended for a moment then sure enough the sounds of pickaxes working below were just audible there was a roar of exultation from the rescuing party and a man was sent up with his feet in a bucket and clinging to a rope to spread the joyful tidings but the work was not intermitted for more than a moment and in a few hours it became necessary to send the cage down and suspend the work to avoid another accident the thin remaining crust gave way the way was clear lamps were sent down and the saving party were soon in the mine with a sight before them never to be forgotten the few men who stood erect with picks in their hands were men of rare endurance and even they began to fall exhausted with fatigue and hunger five times their number lay dotted about the mine prostrated by privation and some others alas were dead none of the poor fellows were in a condition to give a rational answer though walter implored them to say where hope was and his daughter these poor pale wretches the shadows of their former selves were sent up in the cages with all expedition and received by bartley who seemed to forget nothing for he had refreshment tents ready at the pit mouth meantime walter and others whose hearts were with him ran wildly through the works and groped on their knees with their lamps to find hope and his daughter but they were not to be found and nine miners beside them were missing including ben burnley then walter came wildly up to the surface wringing his hands with agony and crying they are lost they are lost no cried bartley they must not be lost they shall not be lost one man has come to himself i gave him portwine and brandy then he dragged the young man into the tent there was stout jim davies propped up and held but with a great tumbler of brandy and port in his hand now my man said or rather screamed bartley tell him where hope is and marythat ioh god oh god master said jim faintly i was in the hall with mr hope and the lady when the first explosion came most of us ran past the old shaft and got clear a few was caught by the falling shaft for i looked back and saw it but i never saw master hope among them if he was he is buried under the shaft but i do really think that he was that taken up with his girl and that darned villain that fired the mine as hes like to be in the hall either alive or dead he could say no more but fell into a sort of doze the result of the powerful stimulant on his enfeebled frame and empty stomach then bartley with trembling hands brought out a map of the mine and showed walter where the second party had got to see said he they are within twenty feet of the bottom and the hall is twentythree feet high hope measured it give up working downward pick into the sides of that hall for in that hall i see them at night sometimes they are alive sometimes they are dead sometimes they are dying i shall go mad i shall go mad with this he went raging about giving the wildest orders with the looks and tones of a madman in a minute he had a cage ready for walter and twenty freshlit lamps and down went walter with more men and pickaxes as soon as he got out of the cage he cried wildly stop that men and do as i do he took a sweep with his pick and delivered a horizontal blow at the clay on that side of the shaft bartley had told him to attack his pickaxe stuck in it and he extricated it with difficulty nay master cried a miner who had fallen in love with him drive thy pick at t coal walter then observed that above the clay there was a narrow seam of coal he heaved his pick again but instead of striking it half downward as he ought to have done he delivered a tremendous horizontal blow that made the coal ring like a church bell and jarred his own stout arms so terribly that the pick fell out of his numbed hand then the man who had advised him saw that he was disabled for a time and stepped into his place but in that short interval an incident occurred so strange and thrilling that the stout miners uttered treble cries like women and then one mighty hah burst like a diapason from their manly bosoms chapter xxiii buried alivethe three deadly perils seven miners were buried under the ruins of the shaft but although masses of coal and clay fell into the hall from the side nearest to the explosions and blocked up some of the passages nobody was crushed to death there only the smoke was so stifling that it seemed impossible to live that smoke was lighter than the air its thick pall lifted by degrees and revealed three figures grace hope by happy instinct had sunk upon the ground to breathe in that stifling smoke hope who had collared ben burnley had sunk to the ground with him but still clutched the assassin these were the three left alive in the hall and this was their first struggle for life as soon as it was possible to speak hope took up his lamp which had fallen and holding it up high he cried grace my child where are you she came to him directly he took her in his arms and thanked god for this great preservation then he gave burnley a kick and ordered him to the right hand of the hall youll keep to that side he said and think of what you have done your victims will keep this side and comfort each other till honest men undo your work you villain burnley crouched and wriggled away like a whipped hound and flung himself down in bitter despair oh papa said grace we have escaped a great danger but shall we ever see the light of day of course we shall child be sure that great efforts will be made to save us miners have their faults but leaving other men to perish is not one of them there are no greater heroes in the world than those rough fellows with all their faults what you and i must do at once is to search for provisions and lamps and tools if there are no poisonous gases set free it is a mere question of time my poor child has a hard life before her but only live and we shall be rescued these brave words comforted grace as they were intended to do and she accompanied her father down the one passage which was left open after the explosion fortunately this led to a new working and before he had gone many yards hope found a lamp that had been dropped by some miner who had rushed into the hall as the first warning came hope extinguished the light and gave it to grace that will be twentyfour hours light to us said he but oh what i want to find is food there must be some left behind papa said grace i think i saw a miner throw a bag into an empty truck when the first alarm was given back back my child cried hope before that villain finds it he did not wait for her but ran back and he found ben burnley in the neighborhood of that very truck but burnley sneaked off at his approach hope looking into the truck found treasuresa dozen new sacks a heavy hammer a small bag of nails a can of tea and a bag with a loaf in it and several broken pieces of bread he put his lamp out directly for he had lucifermatches in his pocket and he hid the bag of bread then he lighted his lamp again and fastened it up by a nail in the centre of the hall there said he to burnley thats to light us both equally when it goes out you must hang up yours in its place thats fair said burnley humbly there were two trucks on hopes side of the hallthe empty one in question and one that was full of coal both stood about two yards from hopes side of the hall hope turned the empty truck and brought it parallel to the other then he nailed two sacks together and fastened them to the coal truck and the debris then he laid sacks upon the ground for grace to lie on and he kept two sacks for himself and two in reserve and he took two and threw them to ben burnley i give you two and i keep two myself said he but my daughter shall have a room to herself even here and if you molest her ill brain you with this hammer i dont want to molest her said burnley it aint my fault shes here then there was a gloomy silence and well there might be the one lamp twinkling faintly against the wall did but make darkness visible and revealed the horror of this dismal scene the weary hours began to crawl away marked only by hopes watch for in this living tomb summer was winter and day was night the horrors of entombment in a mine have we think been described better than any other calamity which befalls living men inspired by this subject novelists have gone beyond themselves journalists have gone beyond themselves and without any affectation we say we do not think we could go through the dismal scene before us in its general details without falling below many gifted contemporaries and adding bulk without value to their descriptions the true characteristic feature of this sad scene was not we think the alternations of hope and despair nor the gradual sinking of frames exhausted by hunger and thirst but the circumstance that here an assassin and his victims were involved in one terrible calamity and as one day succeeded to another and the hoped for rescue came not the hatred of the assassin and his victims was sometimes at odds with the fellowship that sprang out of a joint calamity about twelve hours after the explosion burnley detected hope and his daughter eating and moistening their lips with the tea and a spoonful of brandy that hope had poured into it out of his flask to keep it from turning sour what havent you a morsel for me said the ruffian in a piteous voice hope gave a sort of snarl of contempt but still he flung a crust to him as he would to a dog then after some slight hesitation grace rose quietly and took the smaller can and tilled it with tea and took it across to him there said she and may god forgive you he took it and stared at her it aint my fault that you are here said he but she put up her hand as much as to say no idle words two whole days had now elapsed the food though economized was all gone burnleys lamp was flickering and utter darkness was about to be added to the horrors which were now beginning to chill the hopes with which these poor souls had entered on their dire probation hope took the alarm seized the expiring lamp trimmed it and carried it down the one passage that was open this time he did not confine his researches to the part where he could stand upright but went on his hands and knees down the newest working at the end of it he gave a shout of triumph and in a few minutes returned to his daughter exhausted and blackened all over with coal but the lamp was now burning brightly in his hand and round his neck was tied a can of oil oh my poor father said grace is that all you have discovered thank god for it said hope you little know what it would be to pass two more days here without light as well as without food the next day was terrible the violent pangs of hunger began to gnaw like vultures and the thirst was still more intolerable the pangs of hunger intermitted for hours at a time and then returned to intermit again they exhausted but did not infuriate but the rage of thirst became incessant and maddening ben burnley suffered the most from this and the wretch came to hope for consolation wheres the sense of biding here said he to be burned to deeth wi drought lets flood the mine and drink or be drooned how can i flood the mine said hope yow know best maister said the man why how many tons of water did ye draw from yon tank every day we conduct about five tons into a pit and we send about five tons up to the surface daily then how much water will there be in the tank now hope looked at his watch and said there was a good deal of water in the tank when you blew up the mine there must be about thirty tons in it now well then said burnley you that knows everything help me brust the wall o tank its thin enow hope reflected if we let in the whole body of water said he it would shatter us to pieces and crush us against the wall of our prison and drown us before it ran away through the obstructed passages into the new workings fortunately we have no pickaxe and can not be tempted to selfslaughter this silenced burnley for the day and he remained sullenly apart still the idea never left his mind the next day toward evening he asked hope to light his own lamp and come and look at the wall of the tank not without me whispered grace i see him cast looks of hatred at you they went together and burnley bade hope observe that the water was trickling through in places a drop at a time it could not penetrate the coaly veins nor the streaks of clay but it oozed through the porous strata certain strips of blackish earth in particular and it trickled down a drop at a time hope looked at this feature with anxiety for he was a man of science and knew by the fate of banked reservoirs great and small the strange explosive power of a little water driven through strata by a great body pressing behind it youll see it will brust itsen said burnley exultantly and the sooner the better for me for ill never get alive out on t mine yow blowed me to the men and theyll break every bone in my skin hope did not answer this directly there dont go to meet trouble my man said he give me the can grace now burnley hold this can and catch every drop till it is full why it will take hauf a day to fill it objected burnley and it will be hauf mud when all is done ill filter it said hope you do as you are bid he darted to a part of the mine where he had seen a piece of charred timber he dragged it in with him and asked grace for a pockethandkerchief she gave him a clean cambric one he took his pocketknife and soon scraped off a little heap of charcoal and then he sewed the handkerchief into a bagfor the handy man always carried a needle and thread slowly slowly the muddy water trickled into the little can and then the bag being placed over the larger can slowly slowly the muddy water trickled through hopes filter and dropped clear and drinkable into the larger can in that dead life of theirs with no incidents but torments and terrors the hours passed swiftly in this experiment hope sat upon a great lump of coal his daughter kneeled in front of him gazing at him with love confidence reverence and burnley kneeled in front of him too but at a greater distance with wolfish eyes full of thirst and nothing else at last the little can was twothirds full of clear water hope took the large iron spoon which he had found along with the tea and gave a full spoonful to his daughter my child said he let it trickle very slowly over your tongue and down your throat it is the throat and the adjacent organs which suffer most from thirst he then took a spoonful himself not to drink after an assassin he then gave a spoonful to burnley with the same instructions and rose from his seat and gave the can to grace and said the rest of this pittance must not be touched for six hours at least burnley instead of complying with the wise advice given him tossed the liquid down his throat with a gesture and then dashing down the spoon said ill have the rest ont if i die for it and made a furious rush at grace hope she screamed faintly and hope met him full in that incautious rush and felled him like a log with a single blow burnley lay there with his heels tapping the ground for a little while then he got on his hands and knees and crawled away to the farthest corner of his own place and sat brooding that night when grace retired to rest hope lay down at her feet with his hammer in his hand and when one slept the other watched for they feared an attack toward the morning of the next day graces quick senses heard a mysterious noise in burnleys quarter she woke her father directly he went to the place and he found burnley at work on his knees tearing away with his hands and nails at the ruins of the shaft apparently fury supplied the place of strength for he had raised quite a large heap behind him and he had laid bare the feet up to the knees of a dead miner hope reported this in a hushed voice to grace and said solemnly poor wretch hes going mad i fear oh no said grace that would be too horrible whatever should we do keep him to his own side that is all said hope but objected grace in dismay if he is mad he wont listen and he will come here and attack me if he does said hope simply i must kill him thats all burnley however in point of fact kept more and more aloof for many hours he never left his work till he laid bare the whole body of that miner and found a pickaxe in his dead hand this he hid and reserved it for deadly uses he was not clear in his mind whether to brain hope with it and so be revenged on him for having shut him up in that mine or whether to peck a hole in the tank and destroy all three by a quicker death than thirst or starvation the savage had another and more horrible reason for keeping out of sight maddened by thirst he had recourse to that last extremity better men have been driven to he made a cut with his claspknife in the breast of the dead miner and tried to swallow jellied blood this horrible relief never lasts long and the penalty follows in a few hours but in the meantime the savage obtained relief and even vigor from this ghastly source and seeing hope and his daughter lying comparatively weak and exhausted he came and sat down at a little distance in front of them that was partly done to divert hope from examining his shambles and his unnatural work maister said he how long have we been here six days and more said hope six days said grace faintly for her powers were now quite exhaustedand no signs of help no hope of rescue do not say so grace rescue in time is certain and therefore while we live there is hope ay said burnley for you tew but not for me yow telt the men that i fired t mine and if one of those men gets free theyll all tear me limb from jacket why should i leave one grave to walk into another but for yow i should have been away six days agone man said hope can not you see that my hand was but the instrument it was the hand of heaven that kept you back cease to blame your victims and begin to see things as they are and to repent even if you escape could the white faces ever fade from your sight or the dying shrieks ever leave your ear of the brave men you so foully murdered repent monster repent burnley was not touched but he was scared by hopes solemnity and went to his own corner muttering and as he crouched there there came over his dull brain what in due course follows the horrible meal he had madea feverish frenzy in the meantime grace who had been lying half insensible raised her head slowly and said in a low voice water water oh my girl said hope in despair ill go and get enough to moisten your lips but the last scrap of food has gone the last drop of oil is burning away and in an hour we shall be in darkness and despair no no father said grace not while there is water there beautiful water but you can not drink that unfiltered it is foul it is poisonous not that papa said grace far beyond thatlook see that clear river sparkling in the sunlight how bright and beautiful it shines look at the waving trees upon the other side the green meadows and the bright blue sky and theretherethereare the great white swans no no i forgot they are not swans they are ships sailing to the bright land you told me of where there is no suffering and no sorrow then hope to his horror began to see that this must be the very hallucination of which he had read a sweet illusion of green fields and crystal water which often precedes actual death by thirst and starvation he trembled he prayed secretly to god to spare her and not to kill his newfound child his darling in his arms byandby grace spoke again but this time her senses were clear how dark its grown she said ah we are back again in that awful mine then with the patient fortitude of a woman when once she thinks the will of the almighty is declared she laid her hand upon his shoulder and she said soothingly dear father bow to heavens will then she held up both her feeble arms to himkiss me fatherfor we are to die with these firm and patient words she laid her sweet head upon the ground and hoped and feared no more but the man could not bow like the woman he kissed her as she bade him and laid her gently down but after that he sprang wildly to his feet in a frenzy and raged aloud as his daughter could no longer hear him no no he cried this thing can not be they have had seven days to get to us ah but there are mountains and rocks of earth and coal piled up between us we are buried alive in the bowels of the earth well and shouldnt i have blasted a hundred rocks and picked through mountains to save a hundred lives or to save one such life as this no matter whose child she was ah you poor scum you came to me whenever you wanted me and you never came in vain but now that i want you you smoke your pipes and walk calmly over this living tomb i lie in well call yourselves men and let your friends perish i am a man and i can die then he threw himself wildly on his knees over his insensible daughter but my child oh god look down upon my child do pray see the horror of it the horror and the hellish injustice she has but just found her father she is just beginning life its not her time to die why you know she only came here to save her father heavens blessing is the right of pious children its promised in gods word they are to live long upon earth not to be cut off like criminals then he rose wildly and raged about the place flinging his arms on high so that even burnley though his own reason was shaken cowered away from the fury of a stronger mind men and angels cry out against it he screamed in madness and despair can this thing be can heaven and earth look calmly on and see this horror are men all ingratitude is god all apathy a blow like a hammer striking a church bell tinkled outside the wall and seemed to come from a great distance to him who like the rugged elijah had expostulated so boldly with his maker and his maker who is not to be irritated forgave him that blow seemed at first to ring from heaven he stood still and trembled like a leaf he listened the sound was not repeated ah said he it was an illusion like hers but for all that he seized his hammer and darted to the back of the hall and mounting on a huge fragment of coal struck the seam high above his head he gave two blows at longish intervals and then three blows in quick succession grace heard and began to raise herself on her hands in wonder outside the wall came two leisurely blows that seemed a mile off though they were not ten feet and then three blows in quick succession my signal echoed yelled hope do you hear child my signal answered thank god thank god thank god he fell on his knees and cried like a child the next minute burning with hope and joy he was by graces side with his arms round her you cant give way now fight on a few minutes more death i defy you i am a father i tear my child from your clutches with this he raised her in his arms with surprising vigor it was graces turn to shake off all weakness under the great excitement of the brain yes ill live she cried ill live for you oh the gallant men hear hear the pickaxes at work an army is coming to our rescue father the god you doubted sends them and some hero leads them the words had scarcely left her lips when hope set her down in fresh alarm an enemys pickaxe was at work to destroy them burnley was picking furiously at the weak part of the tank shrieking they will tear me to pieces there is no hope in this world nor the next for me madman cried hopehell let the water in before they can save us he rushed at burnley and seized him but his frenzy was gone and burnleys was upon him after a short struggle burnley flung him off with prodigious power hope flew at him again but incautiously and the savage lowering his head drove it with such fury into hopes chest that he sent him to a distance and laid him flat on his back utterly breathless grace flew to him and raised him he was not a man to lose his wits to the truck he gasped or we are lost ill flood the mine ill flood the mine yelled burnley hope made his daughter mount a large fragment of coal we have already mentioned and from that she sprang to the truck and with her excitement and with her athletic power she raised herself into the full truck and even helped her father in after her but just as she got him on to the truck and while he was still only on his knees that section of the wall we have called the tank rent and gaped under burnleys pickaxe and presently exploded about six feet from the ground and a huge volume of water drove masses of earth and coal before it and came roaring like a solid body straight at the coal truck and drove it against the opposite wall smashed the nearest side in and would have thrown grace off it like a feather but hope kneeling and clinging to the side held her like a vise grace screamed violently immediately there was a roar of exultation outside from the hitherto silent workers for that scream told that the woman was alive too the wife of the brave fellow who had won all their hearts and melted away the icy barrier of class three gigantic waves struck the truck and made it quiver the first came halfway up the second came full twothirds the third dashed the senseless body of ben burnley with bleeding head and broken bones against the very edge of the truck then surged back with him into a whirling vortex grace screamed continuously she gave herself up now for lost and the louder she screamed the louder and the nearer the saving party shouted and hurrahed no do not fear cried hope you shall not die love is stronger than death the words were scarce out of his mouth when the point of a steel pick came clean through the stuff another followed above it then another then another and then another holes were made then gaps then larger gaps then a mass of coal fell in furious picksa portion of the mine knocked awayand there stood in a red blaze of lamps held up the gallant band roaring shouting working led by a stalwart giant with bare arms begrimed and bleeding face smoked hair and eyebrows black with coaldust and eyes flaming like red coals he sprang with one fearless bound down to the coaltruck and caught up his wife in his arms and held her to his panting bosom ropes ladder everythingand they were saved while the corpse of the assassin whirled round and round in the subsiding eddies of the black water and as that water ran away into the mine lay coated with mud at the feet of those who had saved his innocent victims chapter xxiv strange complications exert all the powers of your mind and conceive if you can what that mother felt whose only son sickened and after racking her heart with hopes and fears died before her eyes and was placed in his coffin and carried to his rest yet one in the likeness of a man bade the bearers stand still then with a touch made the coffin open the dead come back blooming with youth and health and handed him to his mother that picture no mortal mind can realize but the effort will take you so far as this you may imagine what walter clifford felt when almost at the climax of despair he received from that living tomb the good and beautiful creature who was the light of his eyes and the darling of his heart how he gloated on her how he murmured words of comfort and joy over her as the cage carried her and hope and him up again into the blessed sunshine and there what a burst of exultation and honest rapture received them everybody was there the news of hopes signal had been wired to the surface an old original telegraph had been set up by colonel clifford and its arms set flying to tell him that old campaigner was there with his spring break and mattresses and an able physician bartley was there pale and old and trembling and crying he fell on his knees before hope and grace she drew back from him with repulsion but he cried out no matter no matter they are saved they are saved walter carried her to his father and left bartley kneeling then he dashed back for hope who did not move and found him on his knees insensible a piece of coal driven by one of the mens picks had struck him on the temple the gallant fellow had tried to hide his hurt with his handkerchief but the handkerchief was soaked with blood and the man exhausted by hunger violent emotions and this last blow felt neither his trouble nor his joy he was lifted with tender pity into the break and the blood stanched and stimulants applied by the doctor but grace would have his head on her bosom and her hand in walters fortunately the doctor was no other than that physician who had attended colonel clifford in his dangerous attack of internal gout we say fortunately for patients who have endured extremities of hunger have to be treated with very great skill and caution gentle stimulants and mucilages must precede solid food and but a little of anything be taken at a time doctor garner began his treatment in the very break the first spoonful of egg and brandy told upon grace hope her deportment had been strange she had seemed confused at times and now and then she would cast a look of infinite tenderness upon walter and then again she would knit her brow and seem utterly puzzled but now she gave walter a look that brought him nearer to her and she said with a heavenly smile you love me best better than the other then she began to cry over her father better than the other said walter aloud what other be quiet said the doctor do you really think her stomach can be empty for six days and her head be none the worse come my dear another spoonful good girl now et me look at you mr walter why what is the matter with him said the colonel i never saw him look better in all my life indeed red spots on his cheekbones ditto on his temples and his eyes glaring excitement and happiness said walter the doctor took no notice of him he has been outraging nature said he and she will have her revenge we are not out of the wood yet colonel clifford and you had better put them all three under my command i do my good friend i do said colonel clifford eagerly it is your department and i dont believe in two commanders they drew up at the great door of clifford hall it seemed to open of itself and there were all the servants drawn up in two lines they all showed eager sympathy but only john baker and mrs milton ventured to express it god bless you all said colonel clifford but it is our turn now they are all in the doctors hands my whole household obey him to the letter it is my order doctor garner this is mrs milton my housekeeper you will find her a good lieutenant mrs milton said the doctor sharply warm baths in three rooms and to bed with this lot carry mr hope up he is my first patient bring me eggs milk brandy new portwine cook sir hammer three chickens to pieces with your rollingpin then mince them then chuck them into a big pot with cold water stew them an hour and then boil them to a jelly strain and serve meantime send up three slices of mutton half raw we will do a little chewing not much the patients submitted like lambs only walter grumbled a little but at last confessed to a headache and sudden weariness julia clifford took special charge of grace hope the doctor of william hope and colonel clifford sat by walter congratulating soothing and encouraging him until he began to doze doctor garners estimate of his patients proved correct the next day walter was in a raging fever hope remained in a pitiable state of weakness and grace who in theory was the weaker vessel began to assist julia in nursing them both to be sure she was all whipcord and steel beneath her delicate skin and had always been active and temperate and then she was much the youngest and the constitutions of such women are anything but weak still it was a most elastic recovery from a great shock but the more her body recovered its strength and her brain its clearness the more was her mind agitated and distressed her first horrible anxiety was for walters life the doctor showed no fear but that might be his way it was a raging fever with all the varieties that make fever terrible to behold he was never left without two attendants and as hope was in no danger now though pitiably weak and slowly convalescent grace was often one of walters nurses so was julia clifford he sometimes recognized them for a little while and filled their loving hearts with hope but the next moment he was off into the world of illusions and sometimes could not see them often he asked for grace most piteously when she was looking at him through her tears and trying hard to win him to her with her voice on these occasions he always called her mary one unlucky day that grace and julia were his only attendants he became very restless and wild said he had committed a great crime and the scaffold was being prepared for him hark said he dont you hear the workmen curse their hammers their eternal tiptapping goes through my brain the scaffold what would the old man say a clifford hung never ill save him and myself from that then he sprang out of bed and made a rush at the window it was open unluckily and he had actually got his knee through when grace darted to him and seized him screaming to julia to help her julia did her best especially in the way of screaming graces muscle and resolution impeded the attempt no more slowly gradually he got both knees upon the windowsill but the delay was everything in came a professional nurse she flung her arms round walters waist and just hung back with all her weight as she was heavy though not corpulent his more active strength became quite valueless weight and position defeated him hopelessly and at last he sank exhausted into the nurses arms and she and grace carried him to bed like a child of course when it was all over half a dozen people came to the rescue the woman told what had happened the doctor administered a soothing draught the patient became very quiet then perspired a little then went to sleep and the cheerful doctor declared that he would be all the better for what he called this little outbreak but grace sat there quivering for hours and colonel clifford installed two new nurses that very evening they were pensioners of hissoldiers who had been invalided from wounds but had long recovered and were neither of them much above forty they had some experience and proved admirable nursesquiet silent vigilant as sentinels that burst of delirium was the climax walter began to get better after that but a long period of convalescence was before him and the doctor warned them that convalescence has its very serious dangers and that they must be very careful and above all not irritate nor even excite him all this time torments of another kind had been overpowered but never suppressed in poor graces mind and these now became greater as walters danger grew less and less what would be the end of all this here she was installed to her amazement in clifford hall as walters wife and treated all of a sudden with marked affection and respect by colonel clifford who had hitherto seemed to abhor her but it was all an illusion the whole house of cards must come tumbling down some day some days before the event last described hope had said to her my child this is no place for you and me no more it is papa said grace i know that too well then why did you let them bring us here papa said grace i forgot all about that forgot it it seems incredible does it not but what i saw and felt thrust what i had only heard out of my mind oh papa you were insensible poor dear but if you had only seen walter clifford when he saved us i took him for some giant miner he seemed ever so much bigger than the gentleman i loveday and i shall love him to my dying day whether or not he hasbut when he sprang to my side and took me with his bare bleeding arms to his heart that panted so i thought his heart would burst and mine too could i feel another woman between us all that might be true but it was unreal that he loved me and had saved me that was real and when we sat together in the carriage your poor bleeding head upon my bosom and his hand grasping mine and his sweet eyes beaming with love and joy what could i realize except my fathers danger and my husbands mighty love i was all present anxiety and present bliss his sin and my alarms seemed hundreds of miles off and doubtful and even since i have been here see how greater and nearer things have overpowered me your deadly weaknessyou who were strong poor dearoh let me kiss you dear darlingtill you had saved your child walters terrible danger oh my dear father spare me how can a poor weak woman think of such different woes and realize and suffer them all at once spare me dear father spare me let me see you stronger let me see him safe and then let us think of that other cruel thing and what we ought to say to colonel clifford and what we ought to do and where we are to go my poor child said hope faintly with tears in his eyes i say no more take your own time grace did not abuse this respite so soon as the doctor declared walter out of immediate danger and indeed safe if cautiously treated she returned of her own accord to the miserable subject that had been thrust aside after some discussion they both agreed that they must now confide their grief to colonel clifford and must quit his home and make him master of the situation and sole depository of the terrible secret for a time hope wished to make the revelation and spare his daughter that pain she assented readily and thankfully this was a womans first impulseto put a man forward but byandby she had one of her fits of hard thinking and saw that such a revelation ought not to be made by one straightforward man to another but with all a womans soothing ways besides she had already discovered that the colonel had a great esteem and growing affection for her and in short she felt that if the blow could be softened by anybody it was by her her father objected that she would encounter a terrible trial from which he could save her but she entreated him and he yielded to her entreaty though against his judgment when this was settled nothing remained but to execute it then the woman came uppermost and grace procrastinated for one insufficient reason and another however at last she resolved that the very next day she would ask john baker to get her a private interview with colonel clifford in his study this resolution had not been long formed when that very john baker tapped at mr hopes door and brought her a note from colonel clifford asking her if she could favor him with a visit in his study grace said yes mr baker i will come directly as soon as baker was gone she began to bemoan her weak procrastination and begged her fathers pardon for her presumption in taking the matter out of his hands you would not have put it off a day now see what i have done by my cowardice hope did not see what she had done and the quickwitted young lady jumping at once at a conclusion opened her eyes and said why dont you see some other person has told him what it was so important he should hear first from me ah it is the same gentleman that came and warned me he has heard that we are actually married for it is the talk of the place and he told me she would punish him if he neglected her warning oh what shall i do you go too fast grace dear dont run before trouble like that come go to colonel clifford and you will find it is nothing of the kind grace shook her head grandly experience had given her faith in her own instincts as people call themthough they are subtle reasonings the steps of which are not put forwardand she went down to the study grace my dear said the colonel i think i shall have a fit of the gout oh no said grace we have trouble enough it gets less every day my dear that is one comfort but what i meant was that our poor invalids eclipse me entirely in your good graces that is because you are a true woman and an honor to your sex but i should like to see a little more of you well all in good time i didnt send for you to tell you that sit down my girl it is a matter of business grace sat down keenly on her guard though she did not show it in the least colonel clifford resumed you may be sure that nothing has been near my heart for some time but your danger and my dear sons still i owe something to other sufferers and the poor widows whose husbands have perished in that mine have cried to me for vengeance on the person who bribed that burnley i am a magistrate too and duty must never be neglected i have got detectives about and i have offered five hundred guineas reward for the discovery of the villain one jem davies described him to me and i put the description on the placard and in the papers but now i learn that daviess description is all secondhand he had it from you now i must tell you that a description at secondhand always misses some part or other as a magistrate i never encourage jack to tell me what jill says when i can get hold of jill you are jill my dear so now please verify jacks description or correct it however the best way will be to give me your own description before i read you his i will said grace very much relieved well then he was a man not over forty thin and with bony fingers an enormous gold ring on the little finger of his right hand he wore a suit of tweed all one color rather tight and a vulgar neckhandkerchief almost crimson he had a face like a corpse and very thin lips but the most remarkable things were his eyes and his eyebrows his eyes were never still and his brows were very black and not shaped like other peoples they were neither straight like julia cliffords for instance nor arched like walters that is to say they were arched but all on one side each brow began quite high up on the temple and then came down in a slanting drop to the bridge of the nose and lower than the bridge there if you will give me a pencil i will draw you one of his eyebrows in a minute she drew the eyebrow with masterly ease and rapidity why that is the eyebrow of mephistopheles and so it is said grace naively no wonder it did not seem human to me i am sorry to say it is human you can see it in every convict jail but said he how came this villain to sit to you for his portrait he did not sir but when he was struggling with me to keep me from rescuing my father what did the ruffian lay hands on you that he did and so did mr bartley but the villain was the leader of it all and while he was struggling with me you were taking stock of him well they talk of a jews eye give me a womans my dear the secondhand description is not worth a button i must write fresh notices from yours and above all instruct the detectives you have given me information that will lead to that mans capture as for the gold ring and the tweed suit they disappeared into space when my placard went up you may be sure of that and a felon can paint his face but his eyes and eyebrows will do him they are the mark of a jailbird i am a visiting justice and have often noticed the peculiarity draw me his eyebrows and we will photograph them in derby and my detectives shall send copies to scotland yard and all the convict prisons well have him the colonel paused suddenly in his triumphant prediction and said but what was that you let fall about bartley he was no party to this foul crime why he has worked night and day to save you and hope indeed you both owe your lives to him indeed yes he set the men on to save you within ten minutes of the explosion he bought rope by the mile and great iron buckets to carry up the debris that was heaped up between you and the working party he raved about the pit day and night lamenting his daughter and his friend and why i say he saved you twas he who advised walter i had this from walter himself before his fever came on he advised and implored him not to attempt to clear the whole shaft but to pick sideways into the mine twenty feet from the ground he told walter that he never really slept at night and in his dreams saw you in a part of the mine he calls the hall now walter says that but for this advice they would have been two days more getting to you we should have been dead said grace gravely then she reflected colonel clifford said she i listened to that villain and mr bartley planning my fathers destruction certainly every word mr bartley said was against it he spoke of it with horror yet somehow or other that wretched man obtained from him an order to send the man burnley down the mine and what will you think when i tell you that he assisted the villain to hinder me from going to the mine then she told him the whole scene and how they shut her up in the house and she had to go down a curtain and burst through a quickset hedge but all the time she was thinking of walters bigamy and how she was to reveal it and she related her exploits in such a cold languid manner that it was hardly possible to believe them colonel clifford could not help saying my dear you have had a great shock and you have dreamt all this certainly you are a fine girl and broadshouldered i admire that in man or womanbut you are so delicate so refined so gentle grace blushed and said languidly for all that i am an athlete an athlete child yes sir mr bartley took care of that he would never let me wear a corset and for years he made me do calisthenics under a master calisthenics that is a fine word for gymnastics then with a double dose of languor i can go up a loose rope forty feet so it was nothing to me to come down one the hedge was the worst thing but my father was in danger and my blood was up she turned suddenly on the colonel with a flash of animation you used to keep racehorses walter told me the colonel stared at this sudden turn that i did said he and a pretty penny they cost me well sir is not a racehorse a poor mincing thing until her blood gets up galloping by jove you are right said he she steps like a cat upon hot bricks but the comparison is not needed whatever statement mrs walter clifford makes to me seriously is gospel to me who already know enough of her to respect her lightest word pray grant me this much that bartley is a true penitent for i have proof of it in this drawer ill show it you no no please not said grace in no little agitation let me take your word for that as you have taken mine oh sir he is nothing to me compared with what i thought you wished to say to me but it is i who must find the courage to say things that will wound you and me still more colonel clifford pray do not be angry with me till you know all but indeed your house is not the place for my father or for me why not madam said the colonel stiffly since you are my daughterinlaw she did not reply ah said he coloring high and rising from his chair he began to walk the room in some agitation you are right said he i once affronted you cruelly unpardonably still pray consider that you passed for bartleys daughter that was my objection to you and then i did not know your character but when i saw you come out pale and resolved to sacrifice yourself to justice and another woman that converted me at once ask julia what i said about you i must interrupt you said grace i can not let such a man as you excuse yourself to a girl of eighteen who has nothing but reverence for you and would love you if she dared then all i can say is that you are very mysterious my dear and i wish you would speak out i shall speak out soon enough said grace solemnly now i have begun colonel clifford you have nothing to reproach yourself with no more have i for that matter yet we must both suffer she hesitated a moment and then said firmly you do me the honor to approve my conduct in that dreadful situation did you hear all that passed did you take notice of all i said i did said colonel clifford i shall never forget that scene nor the distress nor the fortitude of her i am proud to call my daughter grace put her hands before her face at these kind words and he saw the tears trickle between her white fingers he began to wonder and to feel uneasy but the brave girl shook off her tears and manned herself if we may use such an expression then sir said she slowly and emphatically though quietly did you not think it strange that i should say to my father i dont know he asked me before you all are you a wife twice i said to my fatherto him i thought was my fatheri dont know can you account for that sir the colonel replied i was so unable to account for it that i took julia cliffords opinion on it directly as we were going home and what did she say oh she said it was plain enough the fellow had forbidden you to own the marriage and you were an obedient wife and like women in general strong against other people but weak against one so that is a womans reading of a woman said grace she will sacrifice her honor and her fathers respect and court the worlds contempt and sully herself for life to suit the convenience of a husband for a few hours my love is great but it is not slavish or silly do you think sir that i doubted for one moment walter clifford would own me when he came home and heard what i had suffered did i think him so unworthy of my love as to leave me under that stigma hardly then why should i blacken mrs walter clifford for an afternoon just to be unblackened at night this is good sense said the colonel and the thing is a mystery can you solve it you may be sure i canand woe is mei must she hung her head and her hands worked convulsively sir said she after a pause suppose i could not tell the truth to all those people without subjecting the man i lovedand i love him now dearer than everto a terrible punishment for a mere folly done years ago which now has become something much worse than follybut how through his unhappy love for me these are dark words said the colonel how am i to understand them dark as they are said grace do they not explain my conduct in that bitter trial better than julia cliffords guesses do better than anything that has occurred since mrs walter clifford said the colonel with a certain awe i see there is something very grave here and that it affects my son i begin to know you you waited till he was out of danger but now you do me the honor to confide something to me which the world will not drag out of you so be it i am a man and a soldier i have faced cavalry and i can face the truth what is it colonel clifford said grace trembling like a leaf the truth will cut you to the heart and will most likely kill me now that i have gone so far you may well say tell it me but the words once past my lips can never be recalled oh what shall i do what shall i do the struggle overpowered her and almost for the first time in her life she turned half faint and yet hysterical and such was her condition that the brave colonel was downright alarmed and rang hastily for his people he committed her to the charge of mrs milton it seemed cruel to demand any further explanation from her just then so brave a girl who had gone so far with him would be sure to tell him sooner or later meantime he sat sombre and agitated oppressed by a strange sense of awe and mystery and vague misgiving while he brooded thus a footman brought him in a card upon a salver the reverend alleyn meredith do i know this gentleman said the colonel i think not sir said the footman what is he like like a beneficed clergyman sir colonel clifford was not in the humor for company but it was not his habit to say not at home when he was at home and being a magistrate he never knew when a stranger sent in his card that it might not be his duty to see him so he told the footman to say that he was in point of fact engaged but was at this gentlemans service for a few minutes the footman retired and promptly ushered in a clergyman who seemed the model of an archdeacon or a wealthy rector sleek and plump without corpulence neat boots clothes black and glossy waistcoat up to the throat neat black gloves a snowy tie a face shaven like an egg hair and eyebrows grizzled cheeks rubicund but not empurpled as one who drank only his pint of port but drank it seven days in the week nevertheless between you and us this sleek rosy personage archdeacon or rural dean down to the ground was leonard monckton padded to the nine and tinted as artistically as any canvas in the world the first visit monckton had paid to this neighborhood was to the mine he knew that was a dangerous visit so he came at night as a decrepit old man he very soon saw two things which discouraged farther visits one was a placard describing his crime in a few words and also his person and clothes and offering guineas reward as his pallor was specified he retired for a minute behind a tent and emerged the color of mahogany he then pursued his observations and in due course fell in with the second warning this was the body of a man lying upon the slack at the pit mouth the slack not having been added to for many days was glowing very hot and fired the night the body he recognized immediately for the white face stared at him it was ben burnley undergoing cremation to this the vindictive miners had condemned him they had sat on his body and passed a resolution and sworn he should not have christian burial so they managed to hide his corpse till the slack got low and then they brought him up at night and chucked him like a dog on to the smouldering coal onehalf of him was charred away when monckton found him but his face was yet untouched two sturdy miners walked to and fro as sentinels armed with hammers and firmly resolved that neither law nor gospel should interfere with this horrible example even monckton the man of iron nerves started back with a cry of dismay at the sight and the smell one of the miners broke into a hoarse uneasy laugh yow neednt to skirl old man he cried yons not a man hes nobbut a murderer hes fired t mine and made widows and orphans by t score ay said the other but theres a worse villain behoind that found t brass for t job and tempted this one well catch him yet ah then well not trouble judge nor jury nor hangman neether the wretches said monckton what fire a mine no punishment is enough for them with this sentiment he retired and never went near the mine again he wired for a pal of his and established him at the dun cow these two were in constant communication moncktons friend was a very clever gossip and knew how to question without seeming curious and the gossiping landlady helped him so between them monckton heard that walter was down with a fever and not expected to live and that hope was confined to his bed and believed to be sinking encouraged by this state of things monckton made many artful preparations and resolved to levy a contribution upon colonel clifford at this period of his manoeuvres fortune certainly befriended him wonderfully he found colonel clifford alone and likely to be alone and at the same time prepared by grace cliffords half revelation and violent agitation to believe the artful tale this villain came to tell him chapter xxv retribution monckton during his long imprisonment at dartmoor came under many chaplains and he was popular with them all because when they inquired into the state of his soul he represented it as humble penitent and purified two of these gentlemen were highchurch and he noticed their peculiarities one was a certain halfmusical monotony in speaking which might be called by a severe critic singsong perhaps they thought the intoning of the service in a cathedral could be transferred with advantage to conversation so now to be strictly in character this personage not only dressed highchurch but threw a sweet musical monotony into the communication he made to colonel clifford and if the reader will compare this his method of speaking with the matter of his discourse he will be sensible of a singular contrast after the first introduction monckton intoned very gently that he had a communication to make on the part of a lady which was painful to him and would be painful to colonel clifford but at all events it was confidential and if the colonel thought proper would go no further i think sir you have a son whose name is walter i have a son and his name is walter said the colonel stiffly i think sir said musical monckton that he left your house about fourteen years ago and you lost sight of him for a time that is so sir he entered the service of a mr robert bartley as a merchants clerk i doubt that sir i fear sir sighed monckton musically that is not the only thing he did which has been withheld from you he married a lady called lucy muller who told you that cried the colonel its a lie i am afraid not said the meek and tuneful ecclesiastic i am acquainted with the lady a most respectable person and she has shown me the certificate of marriage the certificate of marriage cried the colonel all aghast yes sir and this is not the first time i have given this information in confidence mrs walter clifford who is a kindhearted woman and has long ceased to suffer bitterly from her husbands desertion requested me to warn a young lady whose name was miss mary bartley of this fact i did so and showed her the certificate she was very much distressed and no wonder for she was reported to be engaged to mr walter clifford but i explained to miss bartley that there was no jealousy hostility or bitterness in the matter the only object was to save her from being betrayed into an illegal act and one that would bring ruin upon herself and a severe penalty upon mr walter clifford colonel clifford turned very pale but he merely said in a hoarse voice go on sir well sir said monckton i thought the matter was at an end and having discharged a commission which was very unpleasant to me i had at all events saved an innocent girl from tempting mr walter clifford to his destruction and ruining herself i say i thought and hoped so but it seems now that the young lady has defied the warning and has married your son after all mrs walter clifford has heard of it in derby and she is naturally surprised and i am afraid she is now somewhat incensed before we go any further sir said colonel clifford i should like to see the certificate you say you showed to miss bartley i did sir said monckton and here it isthat is to say an attested copy but of course sooner or later you will examine the original colonel clifford took the paper with a firm hand and examined it closely have you any objection to my taking a copy of this said he keenly of course not said monckton indeed i dont see why i should not leave this document with you it will be in honorable hands the colonel bowed then he examined the document i see sir said he the witness is william hope may i ask if you know this william hope i was not present at the wedding sir said monckton so i can say nothing about the matter from my own knowledge but if you please i will ask the lady why didnt she come herself instead of sending you asked the colonel distrustfully thats just what i asked her and she said she had not the heart nor the courage to come herself i believe she thought as i was a clergyman and not directly interested i might be more calm than she could be and give a little less pain thats all stuff if she is afraid to come herself she knows its an abominable falsehood bring her here with whatever evidence she has got that this walter clifford is my son and then we will go into this matter seriously monckton was equal to the occasion you are quite right sir said he and what business has she to put me forward as evidence of a transaction i never witnessed i shall tell her you expect to see her and that it is her duty to clear up the affair in person suppose it should be another mr walter clifford after all when shall i bring her supposing i have sufficient influence bring her tomorrow as early as you can well you know ladies are not early risers will twelve oclock do twelve oclock tomorrow sir said the colonel the sham parson took his leave and drove away in a wellappointed carriage and pair for we must inform the reader that he had written to mr middleton for another l not much expecting to get it and that it had come down by return of post in a draft on a bank in derby stout colonel clifford was now a very unhappy man the soul of honor himself he could not fully believe that his own son had been guilty of perfidy and crime but how could he escape doubts and very grave doubts too the communication was made by a gentleman who did not seem really to know more about it than he had been told but then he was a clergyman with no appearance of heat or partiality he had been easily convinced that the lady herself ought to have come and said more about it and had left an attested copy of the certificate in his colonel cliffords hands with a sort of simplicity that looked like one gentleman dealing with another one thing however puzzled him sore in this certificatethe witness being william hope william hope was not a very uncommon name but still somehow that one and the same document should contain the names of walter clifford and william hope roused a suspicion in his mind that this witness was the william hope lying in his own house so weak and ill that he did not like to go to him and enter upon such a terrible discussion as this he sent for mrs milton and asked her if mrs walter clifford was quite recovered mrs milton reported she was quite well and reading to her father the colonel went upstairs and beckoned her out my child said he i am sorry to renew an agitating subject but you are a good girl and a brave girl and you mean to confide in me sooner or later can you pity the agitation and distress of a father who for the first time is compelled to doubt his sons honor i can said grace ah something has happened since we parted somebody has told you that man with a certificate what then said the colonel is it really true did he really show you that certificate he did and warned you not to marry walter he did and told me walter would be put into prison if i did and would die in prison for a gentleman can not live there nowadays oh sir dont let anybody know but you and me and my father he wont hurt him for my sake he has wronged me cruelly but ill be torn to pieces before ill own my marriage and throw him into a dungeon come to my arms you pearl of goodness and nobility and unselfish love cried colonel clifford how can i ever part with you now i know you there dont let us despair lets fight to the last i have one question to submit to you of course you examined the certificate very carefully i saw enough to break my heart i saw that on a certain day many years ago one lucy muller had married walter clifford and who witnessed the marriage asked the colonel eyeing her keenly oh i dont know that said grace when i came to walter clifford everything swam before my eyes it was all i could do to keep from fainting away i tottered into my fathers study and as soon as i came to myself what had i to do why to creep out again with my broken heart and face such insultsall it is a wonder i did not fall dead at their feet my poor girl said colonel clifford then he reflected a moment have you the courage to read that document again and to observe in particular who witnessed it i have said she he handed it to her she took it and held it in both hands though they trembled who is the witness the witness said grace is william hope is that your father its my fathers name said grace beginning to turn her eyes inward and think very hard but is it your father do you think no sir it is not was he in that part of the world at the time did he know bartley the clergyman who brought me this certificate the clergyman yes my dear it was a clergyman apparently a rector and he told me are you sure he was a clergyman quite sure he had a white tie a broadbrimmed hat a clergyman all over dont go off on that did your father and my son know each other in hull that they did you are right said grace this witness was my father see that now but if sodont speak to me dont touch me let me thinkthere is something hidden here and mrs walter clifford showed her fatherinlaw that which we have seen in her more than once but it was quite new and surprising to colonel clifford there she stood her arms folded her eyes turned inward her every feature and even her body seemed to think the result came out like lightning from a cloud its all a falsehood said she a falsehood said colonel clifford yes a falsehood upon the face of it my father witnessed this marriage and therefore if the bridegroom had been our walter he would never have allowed our walter to court me for he knew of our courtship all along and never once disapproved of it then do you think it is a mistake said the colonel eagerly no i do not said grace i think it is an imposture this man was not a clergyman when he brought me the certificate he was a man of business a plain tradesman a man of the world he had a colored necktie and some rather tawdry chains did he speak in a kind of singsong not at all his voice was clear and cutting only he softened it down once or twice out of what i took for good feeling at the time hes an impostor and a villain dear sir dont agitate poor walter or my dear father with this vile thing she handed him back the certificate it has been a knife to both our hearts we have suffered together you and i and let us get to the bottom of it together we shall soon do that said the colonel for he is coming here tomorrow again all the better with the lady what lady the lady that calls herself mrs walter clifford indeed said grace quite taken aback they must be very bold oh for that matter said the colonel i insisted upon it the man seemed to know nothing but from mere hearsay he knew nothing about william hope the witness so i told him he must bring the woman and to be just to the man he seemed to think so too and that she ought to do her own business she will not come said grace rather contemptuously he was obliged to say she would just to put a face upon it tomorrow hell bring an excuse instead of her then have your detectives about for he is a villain and dear sir please receive him in the drawingroom then i will find some way to get a sight of him myself it shall be done said the colonel i begin to think with you at all events if the lady does not come i shall hope it is all an imposture or a mistake with this understanding they parted and waited in anxiety for the morrow but now their anxiety was checkered with hope tomorrow bade fair to be a busy day colonel clifford little dreaming the condition to which his son and his guest would be reduced had invited jem davies and the rescuing parties to feast in tents on his own lawn and drink his homebrewed beer and they were to bring with them such of the rescued miners as might be in a condition to feast and drink copiously when he found that neither hope nor his son could join these festivities he was very sorry he had named so early a day but he was so punctilious and precise that he could not make up his mind to change one day for another so a great confectioner at derby who sent out feasts was charged with the affair and the colonels own kitchen was at his service too that was not all bartley was coming to do business this had been preceded by a letter which colonel clifford it may be remembered had offered to show grace clifford the letter was thus worded colonel clifforda penitent man begs humbly to approach you and offer what compensation is in his power i desire to pay immediately to walter clifford the sum of l i have so long robbed him of with five per cent interest for the use of it it has brought me far more than that in money but money i now find is not happiness the mine in which my friend has so nearly been destroyedand his daughter who now too late i find is the only creature in the world i lovethat mine is now odious to me i desire by deed to hand it over to hope and yourself upon condition that you follow the seams wherever they go and that you give me such a share of the profits during my lifetime as you think i deserve for my enterprise this for my life only since i shall leave all i have in the world to that dear child who will now be your daughter and perhaps never deign again to look upon the erring man who writes these lines i should like if you please to retain the farm or at all events a hundred acres round about the house to turn into orchards and gardens so that i may have some employment far from trade and its temptations for the remainder of my days in consequence of this letter a deed was drawn and engrossed and bartley had written to say he would come to clifford hall and sign it and have it witnessed and delivered about nine oclock in the evening one of the detectives called on colonel clifford to make a private communication his mate had spotted a swell mobsman rather a famous character with the usual number of aliases but known to the force as mark waddy he was at the dun cow and possessing the gift of the gab in a superlative degree had made himself extremely popular they had both watched him pretty closely but he seemed not to be there for a job but only on the talking lay probably soliciting information for some gang of thieves or other he had been seen to exchange a hasty word with a clergyman but as mark waddys acquaintances were not amongst the clergy that would certainly be some pal that was in something or other with him what a shrewd girl that must be said the colonel i beg your pardon colonel said the man not seeing the relevancy of this observation oh nothing said the colonel only i expect a visit tomorrow at twelve oclock from a doubtful clergyman just hang about the lawn on the chance of my giving you a signal thus while monckton was mounting his batteries his victims were preparing defenses in a sort of general way though they did not see their way so clear as the enemy did colonel cliffords drawingroom was a magnificent room fifty feet long and thirty feet wide a number of french windows opened on to a noble balcony with three short flights of stone steps leading down to the lawn the central steps were broad the side steps narrow there were four entrances to it two by double doors and two by heavily curtained apertures leading to little subsidiary rooms at twelve oclock next day what with the burst of color from the potted flowers on the balcony the white tents and the flags and streamers and a clear sunshiny day gilding it all the room looked a palace of pleasure and no stranger peeping in could have dreamed that it was the abode of care and about to be visited by gloomy penitence and incurable fraud the first to arrive was bartley with a witness he was received kindly by colonel clifford and ushered into a small room he wanted another witness so john baker was sent for and bartley and he were closeted together reading the deed etc when a footman brought in a card the reverend alleyn meredith and written underneath with a pencil in a female hand mrs walter clifford admit them said the colonel firmly at this moment grace who had heard the carriage drive up to the door peeped in through one of the heavy curtains we have mentioned has she actually come said she she has indeed said the colonel looking very grave will you stay and receive her oh no said grace horrified but ill take a good look at her through this curtain i have made a little hole on purpose then she slipped into the little room and drew the curtain the servant opened the door and the false rector walked in supporting on his arm a dark woman still very beautiful very plainly dressed but well dressed agitated yet selfpossessed be seated madam said the colonel after a reasonable pause he began to question her you were married on the eleventh day of june to a gentleman of the name of walter clifford i was sir may i ask how long you lived with him the lady buried her face in her hands the question took her by surprise and this was a womans artifice to gain time and answer cleverly but the ingenious monckton gave it a happy turn poor thing poor thing said he he left me the next day said lucy and i have never seen him since here monckton interposed he fancied he had seen the curtain move excuse me said he i think there is somebody listening and he went swiftly and put his head through the curtain but the room was empty for meantime grace was so surprised by the ladys arrival by her beauty which might well have tempted any man and by her air of respectability that she changed her tactics directly and she was gone to her father for advice and information in spite of her previous determination not to worry him in his present condition what he said to her can be briefly told elsewhere what he ordered her to do was to return and watch the man and not the woman during lucys hesitation which was somewhat long a clergyman came to the window looked in and promptly retired seeing the colonel had company this however was only a modest curate alias a detective he saw in half a moment that this must be mark waddys pal but as the police like to go their own way he would not watch the lawn himself but asked jem davies with whom he had made acquaintance to keep an eye upon that with his fellows for there was a jailbird in the house then he went round to the front door by which he felt sure his bird would make his exit he had no earthly right to capture this ecclesiastic but he was prepared if the colonel who was a magistrate gave him the order and not without but we are interrupting colonel cliffords interrogatories madam what makes you think this disloyal person was my son indeed sir i dont know said the lady and looking around the room with some signs of distress i begin to hope it was not your son he was a tall young man almost as tall as yourself he was very handsome with brown hair and brown eyes and seemed incapable of deceit have you any letters of his asked the colonel i had a great many sir said she but i have not kept them all have you one said the colonel sternly oh yes sir said lucy i think i must have nearer twenty but what good will they be said she affecting simplicity why my dear madam said monckton colonel clifford is quite right the handwriting may not tell you anything but surely his own father knows it i think he is offering you a very fair test i must tell you plainly that if you dont produce the letters you say you possess i shall regret having put myself forward in this matter at all gently sir said the colonel she has not refused to produce them lucy put her hand in her pocket and drew out a packet of letters but she hesitated and looked timidly at monckton after his late severity am i bound to part with them certainly not said monckton but you can surely trust them for a minute to such a man as colonel clifford i am of opinion said he that since you can not be confronted with this gentlemans son though that is no fault of yours these letters bythebye it would have been as well to show to me ought now at once to be submitted to colonel clifford that he may examine both the contents and the handwriting then he will know whether it is his son or not and probably as you are fair with him he will be fair with you and tell you the truth colonel clifford took the letters and ran his eye hastily over two or three they were filled with the ardent protestations of youth and a love that evidently looked toward matrimony and they were written and signed in a handwriting he knew as well as his own he said solemnly these letters are written and were sent to miss lucy muller by my son walter clifford then almost for the first time in his life he broke down and said god forgive him god help him and me the honor of the cliffords is an empty sound lucy monckton rose from her chair in genuine agitation her better angel tugged at her heartstrings forgive me sir oh forgive me she cried bursting into tears then she caught a bitter threatening glance of her bad angel fixed upon her and she said to monckton i can say no more i can do no more it was fourteen years agoi cant break peoples hearts hush it up amongst you i have made a hero weep his tears burn me i dont care for the man ill go no further you sir have taken a deal of trouble and expense i dare say colonel clifford will compensate you i leave the matter with you no power shall make me act in it any more monckton wrote hastily on his card and said quite calmly well i really think madam you are not fit to take part in such a conference as this compose yourself and retire i know your mind in the matter better than you do yourself at this moment and i will act accordingly she retired and drove away to the dun cow which was the place monckton had appointed when he wrote upon the card colonel clifford said monckton all that is a womans way when she is out of sight of you and thinks over her desertion and her unfortunate conditionneither maid wife nor widowshe will be angry with me if i dont obtain her some compensation she deserves compensation said the colonel gravely especially if she holds her tongue said monckton whether she holds her tongue or not said the colonel i dont see how i can hold mine and you have already told my daughterinlaw a separation between her and my son is inevitable the compensation must be offered and god help me im a magistrate if only to compound the felony surely said monckton it can be put upon a wider footing than that let me think and he turned away to the open window but when he got there he saw a lot of miners clustering about now he had no fear of their recognizing him since he had not left a vestige of the printed description but the very sight of them and the memory of what they had done to his dead accomplice made him shudder at them henceforth he kept away from the window and turned his back to it i think with you sir said he mellifluously that she ought to have a few thousands by way of compensation you know she could claim alimony and be a very blister to you and yours but on the other hand i do think as an impartial person that she ought to keep this sad secret most faithfully and even take her maiden name again whilst monckton was making this impartial proposal bartley opened the door and was coming forward with his deed when he heard a voice he recognized and partly by that partly by the fellows thin lips he recognized him and said monckton that villain here monckton said colonel clifford that is not his name it is meredith he is a clergyman bartley examined him very suspiciously and monckton during this examination looked perfectly calm and innocent meantime a note was brought to colonel clifford from grace papa was the witness he is quite sure the bridegroom was not our walter he thinks it must have been the other clerk leonard monckton who robbed mr bartley and put some of the money into dear walters pockets to ruin him but papa saved him dont let him escape colonel cliffords eye flashed with triumph but he controlled himself say i will give it due attention said he im busy now and the servant retired now sir said he is this a case of mistaken identity or is your name leonard monckton colonel clifford said the hypocrite sadly i little thought that i should be made to suffer for the past since i came here only on an errand of mercy yes sir in my unregenerate days i was leonard monckton i disgraced the name but i repented and when i adopted the sacred calling of a clergyman i parted with the past name and all i was that mans clerk and so said he spitefully and forgetting his singsong was your son walter clifford was that not so mr bartley dont speak to me sir said bartley i shall say nothing to gratify you nor to affront colonel clifford speak the truth sir said colonel clifford never mind the consequences well then said bartley very unwillingly they were clerks in my office and this one robbed me one thing at a time said monckton did i rob you of twenty thousand pounds as you robbed mr walter clifford his voice became still more incisive and the curtain of the little room opened a little and two eyes of fire looked in do you remember one fine day your clerk walter clifford asking you for leave of absenceto be married bartley turned his back on him contemptuously but colonel clifford insisted on his replying yes he did said bartley sullenly but said the colonel quietly he thought better of it and soyou married her yourself this bayonet thrust was so keen and sudden that the villains selfpossession left him for once his mouth opened in dismay and his eyes roving to and fro seemed to seek a door to escape but there was worse in store for him the curtains were drawn right and left with power and there stood grace clifford beautiful but pale and terrible she marched toward him with eyes that rooted him to the spot and then she stopped now hear me for he has tortured me and tried to kill me look at his white face turning ghastly beneath his paint at the sight of me look at his thin lips and his devilish eyebrows and his restless eyes this is the man that bribed that wretch to fire the mine these last words ringing from her lips like the trumpet of doom were answered as swiftly as gunpowder explodes at a lighted torch by a furious yell and in a moment the room seemed a forest of wild beasts a score of raging miners came upon him from every side dragging tearing beating kicking cursing yelling he was down in a moment then soon up again then dragged out of the room nails fists and heavy boots all going stripped to the shirt screaming like a woman a dozen assailants rolled down the steps with him in the midst of them he got clear for a moment but twenty more rushed at him and again he was torn and battered and kicked police police he cried and at last the detectives who came to seize him rushed in and colonel clifford too with the voice of a stentor cried the law respect the law or you are ruined men and so at last the law he had so dreaded raised what seemed a bag of bones nothing left on him but one boot and fragments of a shirt ghastly bleeding covered with bruises insensible and to all appearance dead after a short consultation they carried him by colonel cliffords order to the dun cow where lucy it may be remembered was awaiting his triumphant return chapter xxvi strange turns and yet this catastrophe rose out of a mistake when the detective asked jem davies to watch the lawn he never suspected that the clergyman was the villain who had been concerned in that explosion but davies a man of few ideas and full of his own wrong took for granted as such minds will that the policeman would not have spoken to him if this had not been his affair so he and his fellows gathered about the steps and watched the drawingroom they caught a glimpse of monckton but that only puzzled them his appearance was inconsistent with the only description they had gotin fact opposed to it it was grace cliffords denunciation trumpettongued that let loose savage justice on the villain never was a womans voice so fatal or so swift to slay she would have undone her work she screamed she implored but it was all in vain the fury she had launched she could not recall as for bartley words can hardly describe his abject terror he crouched he shivered he moaned he almost swooned and long after it was all over he was found crouched in a corner of the little room and his very reason appeared to be shaken judge lynch had passed him but too near the freezing shadow of retribution chilled him colonel clifford looked at him with contemptuous pity and sent him home with john baker in a close carriage lucy monckton was in the parlor of the dun cow waiting for her master the detectives and some outdoor servants of clifford hall brought a short ladder and paillasses and something covered with blankets to the door lucy saw but did not suspect the truth they had a murmured consultation with the landlady during this mark waddy came down and there was some more whispering and soon the battered body was taken up to mark waddys room and deposited on his bed the detectives retired to consult and waddy had to break the calamity to mrs monckton he did this as well as he could but it little matters how such blows are struck her agony was great and greater when she saw him for she resisted entirely all attempts to keep her from him she installed herself at once as his nurse and mark waddy retired to a garret a surgeon came by colonel cliffords order and examined moncktons bruised body and shook his head he reported that there were no bones broken but there were probably grave internal injuries these however he could not specify at present since there was no sensibility in the body so pressure on the injured parts elicited no groans he prescribed egg and brandy in small quantities and showed mrs monckton how to administer it to a patient in that desperate condition his last word was in private to waddy if he ever speaks again or even groans aloud send for me otherwise and he shrugged his shoulders some hours afterward colonel clifford called as a magistrate to see if the sufferer had any deposition to make but he was mute and his eyes fixed as colonel clifford returned one of the detectives accosted him and asked him for a warrant to arrest him not in his present condition said colonel clifford rather superciliously and pray sir why did not you interfere sooner and prevent this lawless act well sir unfortunately we were on the other side of the house exactly you had orders to be in one place so you must be in another see the consequence the honest men have put themselves in the wrong and this fellow in the right he will die a sort of victim with his guilt suspected only not proved having thus snubbed the force the old soldier turned his back on them and went home where grace met him all anxiety and received his report she implored him not to proceed any further against the man and declared she should fly the country rather than go into a court of law as witness against him humph said the colonel but you are the only witness all the better for him said she then he will die in peace my tongue has killed the man once it shall never kill him again about six next morning monckton beckoned lucy she came eagerly to him he whispered to her can you keep a secret you know i can said she then never let any one know i have spoken no dear never why i dread the law more than death and he shuddered all over save me from the law leonard i will said she leave that to me she wired for mr middleton as soon as possible the next day there was no change in the patient he never spoke to anybody except a word or two to lucy in a whisper when they were quite alone in the afternoon down came lawyer middleton lucy told him what he knew but monckton would not speak even to him he had to get hold of waddy before he understood the whole case waddy was in moncktons secret and indeed in everybodys he knew it was folly to deceive your lawyer so he was frank mr middleton learned his clients guilt and danger but also that his enemies had flaws in their armor the first shot he fired was to get warrants out against a dozen miners jem davies included for a murderous assault but he made no arrests he only summoned so one or two took fright and fled middleton had counted on that and it made the case worse for those that remained then by means of friends in derby he worked the press an article appeared headed our savages it related with righteous indignation how mr bartleys miners had burned the dead body of a miner suspected of having fired the mine and put his own life in jeopardy as well as those of others and then not content with that monstrous act had fallen upon and beaten to death a gentleman in whom they thought they detected a resemblance to some person who had been or was suspected of being that miners accomplice but so far from that said the writer we are now informed on sure authority that the gentleman in question is a large and wealthy landed proprietor quite beyond any temptation to crime or dishonesty and had actually visited this part of the world only in the character of a peacemaker and to discharge a very delicate commission which it would not be our business to publish even if the details had been confided to us the article concluded with a hope that these monsters would be taught that even if they were below the standard of humanity they were not above the law middleton attended the summonses gave his name and address and informed the magistrate that his client was a large landed proprietor and it looked like a case of mistaken identity his client was actually dying of his injuries but his wife hoped for justice but the detectives had taken care to be present and so they put in their word they said that they were prepared to prove at a proper time that the wounded man was really the person who had been heard by mrs walter clifford to bribe ben burnley to fire the mine we have nothing to do with that now said the magistrate one thing at a time please i can not let these people murder a convicted felon far less a suspected criminal that has not been tried the wounded man proceeds according to law through a respectable attorney these men whom you are virtually defending have taken the law into their own hands are your witnesses here mr middleton not at present sir and when i was interrupted i was about to ask your worship to grant me an adjournment for that purpose it will not be a great hardship to the accused since we proceed by summons i fear i have been too lenient for two or three of them have absconded since the summons was served i am not surprised at that said the magistrate however you know your own business then the police applied for a warrant of arrest against monckton oh cried middleton with the air of a man thoroughly shocked and scandalized certainly not said the magistrate i shall not disturb the course of justice there is not even an exparte case against this gentleman at present such an application must be supported by a witness and a disinterested one so all the parties retired crestfallen except mr middleton as for him he was imitating a small but ingenious specimen of naturethe cuttlefish this little creature when pursued by its enemies discharges an inky fluid which obscures the water all around and then it starts off and escapes one dark night at two oclock in the morning there came to the door of the dun cow an invalid carriage or rather omnibus with a springbed and every convenience the wheels were covered thick with indiarubber relays had been provided and monckton and his party rolled along day and night to liverpool the detectives followed six hours later and traced them to liverpool very cleverly and with the assistance of the police raked the town for them and got all the great steamers watched especially those that were bound westward ho but their bird was at sea in a liverpool merchants own steamboat hired for a two months trip the pursuers found this out too but a fortnight too late its no go bill said one to the other theres a lawyer and a pot of money against us let it sleep awhile the steamboat coasted england in beautiful weather the sick man began to revive and to eat a little and to talk a little and to suffer a good deal at times before they had been long at sea mr middleton had a confidential conversation with mrs monckton he told her he had been very secret with her for her good i saw said he this monckton had no deep regard for you and was capable of turning you adrift in prosperity and i knew that if i told you everything you would let it out to him and tempt him to play the villain but the time is come that i must speak in justice to you both that estate he left your son half in joke is virtually his fourteen years ago when he last looked into the matter there were eleven lives between it and him but strange to say whilst he was at portland the young lives went one after the other and there were really only five left when he made that will now comes the extraordinary part a fortnight ago three of those lives perished in a single steamboat accident on the clyde that left a woman of eightytwo and a man of ninety between your husband and the estate the lady was related to the persons who were drowned and she has since died she had been long ailing and it is believed that the shock was too much for her the survivor is the actual proprietor old carruthers but i am the london agent to his solicitor and he was reported to me to be in extremis the very day before i left london to join you we shall run into a port near the place and you will not land but i shall and obtain precise information in the meantime mind your husbands name is carruthers any communication from me will be to mrs carruthers and you will tell that man as much or as little as you think proper if you make any disclosure give yourself all the credit you can say you shall take him to his own house under a new name and shield him against all pursuers as for me i tell you plainly my great hope is that he will not live long enough to turn you adrift and disinherit your boy to cut short for the present this extraordinary part of our story lewis carruthers alias leonard monckton entered a fine house and took possession of eleven thousand acres of hilly pasture and the undivided moiety of a lake brimful of fish he accounted for his change of name by the favors carruthers deceased had shown him therein he did his best to lie but his present vein of luck turned it into the truth old carruthers had become so peevish that all his relations disliked him and he disliked them so he left his personal estate to his heiratlaw simply because he had never seen him the personality was very large the house was full of pictures and china and cabinets etc there was a large balance at the bankers a heavy fall of timber not paid for rents due and as many as two thousand four hundred sheep upon that hill which the old fellow had kept in his own hands so when the new proprietor took possession as carruthers nobody was surprised though many were furious lucy installed him in a grand suite of apartments as an invalid and let nobody come near him waddy was dismissed with a munificent present and could be trusted to hold his tongue by the advice of middleton not a single servant was dismissed and so no enemies were made the family lawyer and steward were also retained and in short all conversation was avoided in a month or two the new proprietor began to improve in health and drive about his own grounds or be rowed on his lake lying on soft beds but in the fifth month of his residence local pains seized him and he began to waste for some time the precise nature of the disorder was obscure but at last a rising surgeon declared it to be an abscess in the intestines caused no doubt by external violence by degrees the patient became unable to take solid food and the drain upon his system was too great for a mere mucilaginous diet to sustain him wasted to the bone and yellow as a guinea he presented a pitiable spectacle and would gladly have exchanged his fine house and pictures his heathery hills dotted with sheep and his glassy lake full of spotted trout for a ragged irishmans bowl of potatoes and his mug of buttermilkand his stomach chapter xxvii curtain striking incidents will draw the writer but we know that our readers would rather hear about the characters they can respect it seems however to be a rule in life and in fiction that interest flags when trouble ceases now the troubles of our good people were pretty well over and we will put it to the reader whether they had not enough grace clifford made an earnest request to colonel clifford and her father never to tell walter he had been suspected of bigamy let others say that circumstances are always to be believed and character not to be trusted but i at least had no right to believe certificates and things against my walters honor and his love hide my fault from him not for my sake but for his perhaps when we are both old people i may tell him this was grace cliffords petition and need we say she prevailed walter clifford recovered under his wifes care and the house was so large that colonel clifford easily persuaded his son and daughterinlaw to make it their home hope had also two rooms in it and came there when he chose he was always welcome but he was alone again so to speak and not quite forty years of age and he was ambitious he began to rise in the world whilst our younger characters contented with their happiness and position remained stationary master of a great mine able now to carry out his invention member of several scientific associations a writer for the scientific press etc he soon became a public and eminent man he was consulted on great public works and if he lives will be one of the great lights of science in this island he is great on electricity especially on the application of natural forces to the lighting of towns he denounces all the cities that allow powerful streams to run past them and not work a single electric light but he goes further than that he ridicules the idea that it is beyond the resources of science to utilize thousands of millions of tons of water that are raised twentyone feet twice in every twentyfour hours by the tides it is the skill to apply the force that is needed not the force itself which exceeds that of all the steamengines in the nation and he says that the great scientific foible of the day is the neglect of natural forces which are cheap and inexhaustible and the mania for steamengines and gas which are expensive and for coal which is not to last forever he implores capital and science to work in this question his various schemes for using the tides in the creation of motive power will doubtless come before the world in a more appropriate channel than a work of fiction if he succeeds it will be a glorious as it must be a difficult achievement his society is valued on social grounds his wellstored mind his powers of conversation and his fine appearance make him extremely welcome at all the tables in the county he also accompanies his daughter with the violin and as they play beauties together not difficulties they ravish the soul and interrupt the torture whose instrument the pianoforte generally is bartley is a man with beautiful silvery hair and beard he cultivates nurses and tends fruittrees and flowers with a love little short of paternal this sentiment and the contemplation of nature have changed the whole expression of his face it is wonderfully benevolent and sweet but with a touch of weakness about the lips some of the rough fellows about the place call him a softy but that is much too strong a word no doubt he is confused in his ideas but he reads all the great american publications about fruit and flowers and executes their instructions with tact and skill where he breaks downand who would believe thisis in the trade department let him succeed in growing appletrees and peartrees weighed down to the ground with choice fruit let him produce enormous cherries by grafting and gigantic nectarines upon his sunny wall and acres of strawberries too large for the mouth after that they may all rot where they grow he troubles his head no more this is more than his old friend hope can stand he interferes and sends the fruit to market and fills great casks with superlative cider and perry and keeps the account square with a little help from mrs easton who has returned to her old master and is a firm but kind mother to him grace clifford for some time could not be got to visit him perhaps she is one of those ladies who can not get over personal violence he had handled her roughly to keep her from going to her fathers help after all there may have been other reasons it is not so easy to penetrate all the recesses of the female heart one thing is certain she would not go near him for months but when she did go with her fatherand he had to use all his influence to take her therethe rapture and the tears of joy with which the poor old fellow received her disarmed her in a moment she let him take her through hothouses and show her his childrenthe only children i have now said heand after that she never refused to visit this erring man his roof had sheltered her many years and he had found out too late that he loved her so far as his nature could love at that time percy fitzroy had an elder sister he appealed to her against julia clifford she crossquestioned him and told him he was very foolish to despair she would hardly have slapped him if she was quite resolved to part forever let me have a hand in reconciling you said she you shall have bbboth hands in it if you like said he for i am at my wwwits end so these two conspired miss fitzroy was invited to percys house and played the mistress she asked other young ladies especially that fair girl with auburn hair whom julia called a fat thing that meant under the circumstances a plump and rounded model with small hands and feet a perfect figure in a riding habit and at night a satin bust and sculptured arms the very first ride walter took with grace and julia they met the bright cavalcade of percy and his sister and this redhaired venus percy took off his hat with profound respect to julia and grace but did not presume to speak what a lovely girl said grace do you think so said julia yes dear and so do you what makes you fancy that because you looked daggers at her because she is setting her cap at that little fool she will not have him without your consent dear and this set julia thinking the next day walter called on percy and played the traitor give a ball said he miss fitzroy and her brother gave a ball percy duly instructed by his sister wrote to julia as meek as moses and said he was in a great difficulty if he invited her it would of course seem presumptuous considering the poor opinion she had of him if he passed her over and invited walter clifford and mrs clifford he should be unjust to his own feelings and seem disrespectful julias reply dear mr fitzroyi am not at all fond of jealousy but i am very fond of dancing i shall come yours sincerely julia clifford and she did come with a vengeance she showed them what a dark beauty can do in a blaze of light with a red rose and a few thousand pounds worth of diamonds artfully placed she danced with several partners and took percy in his turn she was gracious to him but nothing more percy asked leave to call next day she assented rather coldly his sister prepared percy for the call the first thing he did was to stammer intolerably oh said julia if you have nothing more to say than that i havewhere is my bracelet its here said percy producing it eagerly julia smiled my necklace here my charms here my specimens of your spelling love spells eh hereall here no they are not said julia snatching them they are here and she stuffed both her pockets with them and the engaged ring said percy radiant now and producing it dddont forget that julia began to hesitate if i put that on it will be for life yes it will said percy then give me a moment to think after due consideration she said what she had made up her mind to say long before percy youre a man of honor ill be yours upon one solemn conditionthat from this hour till death parts us you promise to give your faith where you give your love ill give my faith where i give my love said percy solemnly next month they were married and he gave his confidence where he gave his love and he never had reason to regret it john baker sir you had better mind what you are about or youll get fonder of her than of walter himself never colonel never and so will you then after a moments reflection john baker inquired how they were to help it look here colonel said he a mans a man but a womans a woman it isnt likely as master walter will always be putting his hand round your neck and kissing of you when youre good and pick a white hair off your coat if he do but see one when youre going out and shine upon you indoors more than the sun does on you outofdoors and taint to be supposed as mr walter will never meet me on the stairs without breaking out into a smile to cheer an old fellows heart and showing l worth of ivory all at one time and if ive a cold or a bit of a headache he wont send his ladys maid to see after me and tell me what i am to do and threaten to come and nurse me himself if i dont mend well said the colonel theres something in all this for all that said john baker candidly i shall make you my confession sir i said to mr walter myself said i heres a pretty business said i ive known and loved you from a child and mrs walter has only been here six months and now im afraid shell make me love her more than i do you why of course she will said mr walter why i love her better than i do myself and youve got to follow suit or else ill murder you so that question was settled the five hundred guineas reward rankled in the minds of those detectives and after a few months with the assistance of the ordinary police in all the northern towns they got upon a cold scent and then upon a warm scent and at last they suspected their bird under the alias of carruthers so they came to the house to get sight of him and make sure before applying for a warrant they got there just in time for his funeral middleton was there and saw them and asked them to attend it and to speak to him after the reading of the will proceedings are stayed said he but perhaps having acted against me you might like to see whether it would not pay better to act with me and no mistake said one of them so they were feasted with the rest for it was a magnificent funeral and after that middleton squared them with l apiece to hold their tonguesand more to divert all suspicion from the house and the beautiful woman who now held it as only trustee for her son remembering that he had left the estate to another mans child monckton one fine day bequeathed his personal estate on half a sheet of notepaper to lucy this and the large allowance middleton obtained from the court for her as trustee and guardian to the heir made her a rich woman she was a german sober notable and provident she kept her sheep and became a sort of squire she wrote to her husband in the states and by the advice of middleton told him the exact truth instead of a pack of fibs which she certainly would have done had she been left to herself poverty had pinched jonathan braham by this time and as he saw by the tone of her letter she did not care one straw whether he accepted the situation or not he accepted it eagerly and had to court her as a stranger and to marry her and wear the crown matrimonial for middleton drew the settlements and neither braham nor his creditors could touch a halfpenny and then came out the better part of this indifferent woman braham had been a good friend to her in time of need and she was a good and faithful friend to him now she was generally admired and respected kind to the poor bountiful but not lavish an excellent manager but not stingy in vain shall we endeavor with our small insight into the bosoms of men and women to divide them into the good and the bad there are mediocre intellects there are mediocre morals this woman was always more inclined to good than evil yet at times temptation conquered she was virtuous till she succumbed to a seducer whom she loved under his control she deceived walter clifford and attempted an act of downright villainy that control removed she returned to virtuous and industrious habits after many years solitude weariness and a gloomy future unhinged her conscience again comfort and affection offered themselves and she committed bigamy deserted by braham and once more fascinated by the only man she had ever greatly loved she joined him in an abominable fraud broke down in the middle of it by a sudden impulse of conscience and soon after settled down into a faithful nurse she is now a faithful wife a tender mother a kind mistress and nearly everything that is good in a medium way and so in all human probability will pass the remainder of her days which as she is healthy and sober in eating and drinking will perhaps be the longer period of her little life well may we all pray against great temptations only choice spirits resist them except when they are great temptations to somebody else and somehow not to the person tempted it has lately been objected to the writers of fictionespecially to those few who are dramatists as well as noveliststhat they neglect what shakespeare calls the middle of humanity and deal in eccentric characters above or below the people one really meets let those who are serious in this objection enjoy moral mediocrity in the person of lucy monckton for our part we will never place fiction which was the parent of history below its child our hearts are with those superior men and women who whether in history or fiction make life beautiful and raise the standard of humanity such characters exist even in this plain tale and it is these alone and our kindly readers we take leave of with regret the end
