out of the depths conclusion the secret in the hill part i chapter i i first see joshua pilbrow when i was a very little boy my mother died i was too young to feel her loss long though i missed her badly at first but the compensation was that it brought my father nearer to me he was a barrister a prodigal love of a man dear bless him and he felt his bereavement so cruelly that for a time he seemed incapable of rallying from the blow but presently he plucked up heart and went for my sake to his business again he was more liked than lucky i believe i had evidence enough at least of the former for after my mothers death not bearing that we should be parted he carried me with him on the last circuit he was ever to go those were the days when bench and bar dined well and sat up late telling tales sometimes my father would slip me into his pocket so to speak and from its shelter when to be candid i had been much better in bed i heard fine stories related by the gentlemen who put off gravity with the horsehair they wore all day they were a merry and irresponsible lot rather like a strolling company of actors and indeed it was no less their business to play many parts there were types among them which i came to associate with certain qualities such as the lean vivacious ones who ate and drank hungrily and presently grew incoherent and quarrelsome such as the rosy bald headed ones who always seemed to make most laughter such as the large heavy browed ones who sulked when they were bettered in argument but my friend amongst them all next to my father was mr quayle qc i fancied i had discovered after much consideration why he was called qc he was a little man quite bald and round all over his head and face except for a tuft of hair on his chin and there was the q and he wore a pouter pigeon ruff under his chin like this qc and there was the qc i may have been wrong but anyhow i had precedent to justify me for many of these jolly souls bore such characteristic nicknames there was plain john for instance who had so christened himself for ever during a dispute about the uses or abuses of multiple titles plain john had been enough for him he had said again there was blind fogle so called from his favourite cross examination phrase i dont quite see they were all boys together when off duty chaffing and horse playing and my father was the merriest and most irrepressible of the crew there was one treat however of which he was persistent in baulking me pray him as i might he would never let me see or hear him in his character of counsel the court where he would be working by day was forbidden ground to me and for that very reason i longed like bluebeards wife to peep into it this was not right even in thought for i knew his wishes but worse is to be confessed i once took an opportunity which ought never to have been given me to disobey him and dreadful were the consequences as you shall hear we were travelling on what is called the home circuit and one day we came to ipswich a town to mark itself red in the annals of my young life on the second morning after our arrival i was playing at horses with george my fathers man when mr quayle looked in at our hotel and dismissing george took and sat me upon his knee dad gone to court said he yes i answered just he grunted and rubbed his bald head with a look half comical half aggravated his eyes were rather blinky and red and he seemed confused in manner and at a loss for words dicky he said suddenly did you live very well very rich like when mamma was alive yes i answered cept when mamma said we must retrench and cried and bym by papa laughed and threw the rice pudding into the fire and took us to dine at a palace and that was very long before hey it was a very little while before mamma went away for good i murmured and hung my head inclined to whimper mr quayle twitched at me compunctious o come he said we must all bear our losses like men they teach us the best in the world to stand square on our own toeses there shall i tell you a story hey i brightened at once he knew some good ones yes please i said o lud he exclaimed rubbing his nose with his eye glasses i am committed judex damnatur dicky i sat up late last night devouring briefs and theyve given me an indigestion never sit up late dicky or youll have to pay for it he said the last words with an odd emphasis giving me a little shake is that the beginning of the story i asked with reserve o the story he said hm ha dear take my fuddled caput well here goes there were once two old twin brothers booksellers name of pilbrow who kept shop together in a town as it might be ipswich now books young gentleman should engender an atmosphere of reason and sympathy inasmuch as we talk of the republic of letters which signifies a sort of a family tie between a b and c but these fellows though twins were so far from being united that they were always quarrelling if joshua bought a book of a stranger abel would say he had given more than its worth and sell it at his own valuation and if abel attended a sale there was joshua to bid against him naturally under these conditions the business didnt flourish the brothers got poorer and poorer and the more they lost the worse they snapped and snarled till they took to threatening one another in public with dear knows what reprisals well one day at an auction after bidding each against tother thremenjus for a packet of old manuscripts and book rubbish which abel ended by getting by the by they fastened together like tom cats and had to be separated the people laughed and applauded but the end was more serious than was expected abel disappeared from the business and a few days later the shop took fire and was burned to the ground so far so plain and now mr dickycumbob dye know whats meant by insurance no sir well look here if i want to provide against my house and the goods in it being lost to me by fire i go to a gentleman with a gold watch chain like a little ships cable to recommend him and says i if i give you so much pocket money a year will you undertake to build up my house again for me in case it happens to be burned down and the gentleman smiles and says certainly then i say if i double your pocket money will you undertake to give me a thousand pounds for the value of the goods in that house supposing they are burned too and the gentleman says certainly in case their value really is a thousand pounds at the time so i go away and presently strange to say my house is actually burned to the ground then i ask the gentleman to fulfil his promise but he says not at all the house i will rebuild as before and for the goods i will pay you but not a thousand pounds because i am given to believe that they were worth nothing like that sum at the time of the fire now what am i to do well i will tell you what this joshua did he insisted upon having the whole thousand pounds and the gentleman answered by saying that he believed joshua had purposely set fire to his own house in order to secure a thousand pounds for a lot of old rubbish in it that wasnt worth twopence hapenny dyunderstand yes i think so very well then and listen to this if the gentleman spoke true joshua had fallen in scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim which means that he had jumped out of the frying pan into the fire or in other words had in trying to catch the insurance gentleman been nabbed himself by the law for arson is arson and fraud fraud and the gentleman with the watch chain isnt to be caught with a pinch of salt on his tail but that was not the worst human bones had been found among the dbris of the building and ugly rumours got about that these bones were abels bones the bones of an unhappy victim of joshuas murderous hate the man had disappeared the brothers deadly quarrel was recalled it was whispered that the fire might owe itself to a double motive that in short joshua had designed at one blow to secure the thousand pounds and destroy the evidences of a great crime joshua sir was arrested and put upon his trial for murder and arson i was listening with all my eyes and ears who defended him i whispered gulping for i knew something of the legal terms the answer took me like a smack your father sir o i exclaimed thrilling and then after a pause with a pride of loyalty he got him off didnt he mr quayle put me down and yawned dyspeptically what he said if any man can papa will i ask your pardon master dicky i really do for palming off fact instead of fiction on you but my poor brain wasnt equal the case is actually sub judice being tried at this moment yesterday began it and to day will end if you whisper to me to night ill whisper back the result the delay seemed insupportable he had read and worked me up to the last chapter of the story and now proposed to leave me agonising for the end it was the first time i had ever been brought so close to the living romance of the law and my blood was on fire with the excitement of it o i wish i began the barrister looked down at me oddly and shook his head ah you little rogue he chuckled i felt too guilty to speak he knew all that was in my mind suddenly he took my hand come along then he said and lets have a peep papa neednt know he shouldnt have tempted me nor should i have succumbed a murder romance was no book for a child though my father figured in it as a paladin championing the wronged and oppressed i hung back a moment but the creature cooed and whistled to me come and see joshua he said with his back to the wall and papa in front daring em all to come on the picture was irresistible i let myself be persuaded and run out tingling all over it was a dingy november morning the old town seemed dull and uneasy and a tallow faced clock on a church dawdled behind time as if it had stopped to let something unpleasant go by that might have been a posse of melancholy javelin men who with a ludicrous little strutting creature at their head a sort of pocket drum major in sword and cocked hat and with a long staff in his hand went splashing past at the moment the court house what with the fog and drip met us like the mouth of a sewer and i was half inclined to cry off so disenchanting an adventure when my companion tossed me up in his arms and carried me within through halls and passages smelling of cold trodden mud we were passed with deference and suddenly were swung and shut into a room where there were lights and a great foggy hush i saw before me the scarlet judge i knew him well enough but never awful like this a shrunk ferret with piercing eyes looking out of a gray nest i saw the wigs of the counsel but their bobtails seemed cocked with an unfamiliar viciousness i saw the faces of the jury set up in two rows like ghostly ninepins and then i saw another a face by itself a face like a little shrewd wicked gurgoyle that hung yellow and alone out of the mist of the court and that face i knew was the face of joshua the terrible silence ticked itself away and there suddenly was my father standing up before them all and talking in a quick impassioned voice my skin went cold and hot if i reaped little of the dear tones i understood enough to know that he spoke impetuously for the prisoner heaping scorn upon the prosecution never he said in all his experience had he known calumny visit a soul so spotless as the one it was now his privilege to defend the process would be laughably easy it was true and he would only dwell upon what must be to the jury a foregone conclusion the accuseds innocence that was to say with the object to crush with its own vicious fallacies a prosecution which indeed he could not help remarking bore more the appearance of a persecution mr quayle at this point laughed a little under his breath and whispered bravo in my ear as he eased his burden by resting my feet on the back of a bench as for me i was burning and shooting all over with pride as my eyes went from my father to the poor little ugly prisoner in the dock and back again the accused went on my father in substance i can only give the briefest abstract of his speech would not deny that there had been differences between him and his brother indeed it would be useless to in the face of some recent notorious evidence to the contrary but did not all history teach us the folly of jumping on the strength of an unguarded word to fatal conclusions had not one of our own monarchs surnamed fitz empress as he need not remind the jury suffered a lifelong regret from the false interpretation put upon a rash utterance of his will no one rid me of this turbulent priest he had cried in an unthinking moment you shall pay for this had been joshua pilbrows threat to his brother under a like aggravation in the sale room gentlemen said my father how deadly the seeming import how laughable the explanation in either case king henry cried only distractedly for some one to persuade his importunate chancellor to leave him alone joshua pilbrow meant no more than to insist that his brother should stand the whole racket of a purchase of which he himself had disapproved hence gentlemen these tears there was a little stir in court and my companion chuckled delightedly in my ear again my father then proceeded triumphantly to give the true facts of the case the packet of books had it appeared when opened revealed one item of unexpected value in the profits from which joshua as partner insisted upon sharing to this however abel quoting his own words against him demurred it was his abels purchase abel contended to do with as he chose the dispute ran so high as to threaten litigation when all of a sudden one night abel was found to have taken himself off with the cherished volume joshua at first unable to credit such perfidy bided his time expecting his brother to return but when at last his suspicion of bereavement settled into a conviction he grew like one demented he could not believe in the reality of his loss but candle in hand went hunting high and low amongst the litter with which the premises were choked hoping somewhere to alight in some forgotten corner where cupidity had concealed it on the coveted prize alas it never rains but it pours he not only failed to trace the treasure but in his distracted hunt for it must accidentally have fired the stock which smouldering for awhile burst out presently into flame and committed all to ruin such was the outline of the story and for all that i understood of it i could have clapped my father to the echo with the tears gulping in my throat for his noble vindication of a wronged man there were other points he made such as that joshua had himself escaped with the utmost difficulty from the burning building and did that look like arson such as that he had instructed his lawyers after committal to advertise strenuously though vainly for his brothers whereabouts and did that look like murder such as that the bones found amongst the ruins were the bones of anatomical specimens in which the firm was well known to have dealt i need not insist on them because the end was what i knew it must be if men were not base and abominable enough to close their ears wilfully to those ringing accents of truth the prosecution poor thing answered and the judge summed up and still mr quayle quite absorbed in the case did not offer to take me away i had my eyes on my father all the time he had sunk back as if exhausted after his speech and sat in a corner of the bench his hand over his face the jury gave their verdict without leaving their places i heard the demand and the answer the cry not guilty rang like a pan in my ears and still i kept my eyes on my father the prisoner freed from the dock had left the court when suddenly some people stirred and a whisper went round a barrister bent over the resting figure and arose hurriedly in a moment there was a springing up of heads everywhere so that the dear form was blotted from my sight mr quayle looking over my shoulder caught a word and gave a quick little gasp dicky he said catching at me come out at once we must get away before before and he left the sentence unfinished as he hurried me into the street chapter ii a great loss and a queer equivalent i looked in mr quayles face but i asked him no question the mud we trod seemed colder the houses we passed more frowning than before but i asked no question i could not form one in my mind only suddenly and somehow i felt frightened as if in dreams before a great solitude then in a moment i was sobbing fast and thickly ah what is the use to skate round the memory let it clutch me for a moment and be faced and dismissed my father my dear ardent noble father was dead struck down in an instant shaken out of life by the poignant utterances of his own spirit while the flower of his fervour was blossoming and bearing fruit the roots thereof were dead already smitten in their place in his heart that its work done had ceased beating sometimes afterwards in my desolation i recalled the church clock with its poised motionless hands and thought what a melancholy omen it had been mr quayle was kindness itself to me in my utter terror and loneliness he took upon himself provisionally the whole conduct of my affairs one morning he came in and drew me to him dicky dicky bird me jewl he said ive found the fine cuckoo thats to come and father the poor little orphaned nestling i must observe that he had his own theories about this same harbinger of spring which according to him was the bird that looked after another birds young i remembered the occasion on which he had so defined it and the laughter which had greeted him and his alternative well then tis the bird that doesnt lay its own eggs and thats all one but the first definition it appeared was the one he kept faith in dyou remember mr paxton he said uncle jenico i asked he nodded uncle jenico paxton mammas own only brother poor papa my dear always a wonder and an honour to his profession has left it seems a will in which he bequeathes everything to uncle jenico in trust for his little boy master dicky bowen and uncle jenico has been found and is coming to take charge of little dicky bowen was i glad or sorry i was too stunned i think to care one way or the other any one would do to stop the empty place which none could ever fill and neither my sympathies nor my dislikes were active in the case of uncle jenico i had seen him only once or twice when he had come to spend a night or so with us in town my memory was of a stout hoarse old man in spectacles rather lame with a little nose and twinkling eyes he had seemed always busy always in a hurry he bore an important mysterious reputation with us as a great inventive genius who carried a despatch box with him choked with invaluable patents and always left something behind a toothbrush or an umbrella when he left let it be uncle jenico as well as another while we were talking there was a flurry at the door of the room and a man overcoming some resistance outside forced his way in i gave a little cry and stood staring it was the acquitted prisoner joshua pilbrow george appeared just behind him flushed and truculent he would do it sir said the servant for all i warned him away mr quayle had put me from him and arisen there was a bad look on his face but he motioned to george to go and we were left alone the intruder stood shrugging his disordered clothes into place and looking the while with a sort of black stealth at the barrister his face held and haunted me it was bleak and sallow and grey in the hollows with fixed dark eyes the face i thought of a malignant though injured creature but it did not so affect mr quayle it was evident the verdict was not guilty sir said the man quite suddenly and vehemently mr quayle gave an unpleasant laugh or else you wouldnt be intrudin here he said shortly i came to thank my benefactor said the man i had heard nothing till this moment of the tragic sequel well said the barrister in the same cynical tone you have come too late the price of your acquittal is this little orphaned life he put his arm about my shoulders the stranger looked hard at me his son he muttered there are some verdicts said mr quayle bought too dear in a moment the man turned upon him in a sort of fierce concentrated bitterness with the inconsistency of your evil profession he cried you discount your own conclusions the law guarantees and grudges me my innocence a curse upon it i say did he there sacrifice his life for me he sacrificed it for truth sir and its that which you as a lawyer cant forgive you will observe said mr quayle icily that i have not questioned the truth not directly answered the visitor i know i know you damn by innuendo its your trade the little lawyer laughed again you malign our benevolence he said the law by its artless verdict has entitled you to sue on the insurance question think mr pilbrow it actually offers itself to witness to your right to the thousand pounds and i shall force it to cried the other and would to heaven i could make it bleed another thousand for the wrong it has done me it would if equity were justice equity is justice said mr quayle good morning the man did not move for a moment but stood looking gloomily at me now i cannot define what was working in my little soul the pinched shorn face was not lovely the eyes in it were not good yet there was something there of loss and hopelessness that touched me cruelly and was not my father lying in the next room in solemn witness to its innocence suddenly before mr quayle could stay me i had run to the visitor and plucked at his coat you did not do it i cried my father said so he gave a little gasp and fluttered his hand across his eyes sweeping in a wonderful way the evil out of them ah he said if your father young gentleman would whisper to you where abel lies hidden he knows now he stepped back with a strange wintry smile on his lips stopped seemed about to speak waved his hand to me and was gone dicky dicky cried mr quayle youre the son of your father but dear me not so good a lawyer chapter iii uncle jenico that same evening uncle jenico arrived i was just put to bed at the time but he came and stood by me a little before i went to sleep and dreamt of him he was not the least grown from his place in my memory only to my wonder a little more shabby looking than i seemed to recollect the round gold spectacles were there and the big beaver hat and the blue frock coat and the nankeen trousers and the limp all but the first and last a trifle the worse for wear his smile however was as cherubic his despatch box as glossy his walking stick as stout as ever and he nodded at me like a benevolent mandarin only we two left my boy he said poor papa dear papa hes learnt by now the secret of perpetual motion it was an odd introduction i cried a little and moved by his kindness clung to him there he said soothing me thats all right we are going to be famous friends we are well invent things well set the thames on fire we will whether from exhaustion or from the dreamy contemplation of this amazing feat to be performed by us i fell asleep in his arms lulled for the first time out of my grief and did not awake till bright morning the fog was gone the birds were singing to us to carry my father to his rest under the blue sky by and by we set out uncle jenico very grave in black with a long weeper round his hat mr quayle and one or two more who had lingered a day behind the assizes to do honour to the dead came with us and others including the judge sent flowers it was a simple pathetic service in a green corner of the churchyard i felt more than understood its beauty and when once i caught a glimpse of uncle jenico busily and stealthily writing something with a pencil on the inside lining of his hat i accepted the fact naturally as a detail of the ceremony but it was on the way home in the carriage that he disillusioned me by removing his hat and showing me a little drawing of a gravestone he had made therein just an idea that occurred to me he said to perpetuate the memory of poor papa we want to do something better than keep it green you see the weather and the lichen pay us all that compliment so i suggest having the inscription very small on a stone something the shape of a dining room clock and over it a magnifying glass boss like one of those paperweights you know that have a little view at the back the tooth of time could never touch that what do you think now i thought it a very pleasant and kind idea and told him so at which he was obviously pleased but it was never carried out no more than many another he developed and in the end but that was long afterwards a simple headstone of my own design commemorated my beloved fathers virtues the few mourners returned with us to the hotel where in a private room we had cake and sherry wine afterwards mr quayle when all but he were gone asked the favour of a final word with uncle jenico he appeared to find it a word difficult of utterance walking up and down and puffing and getting a little red in the face while uncle jenico sat beaming in a chair his legs crossed and finger tips bridged at length mr quayle stopped before him mr paxton said he when times short formalities are best eschewed eh uncle jenico nodded surely said he i ask nothing less then said mr quayle stuttering a little you are prepared to accept our friends trust for all its worth uncle jenico nodded again though i thought his countenance fell a trifle over the emphatic qualification however he recovered in an instant and rubbed his hands together gleefully capital sir he said a little capital thats all richard and i need to make our fortunes he spoke as if we had been long partners but hampered by insufficient means ah said mr quayle decisively but thats just the point just the point echoed uncle jenico still nodding but weakly and with a dew of perspiration on his forehead just the point repeated mr quayle i stood close to our friend i know something of his affairs and habits he was dye understand french mr paxton yes certainly answered my uncle proudly well listen to this then il a t un joueur invtr celui l cest possible quil a mang son bl en herbe he drew back to let his words take effect god bless me said uncle jenico weakly you have reason to know my dear sir replied mr quayle i know how some of us occupy our time on circuit when wed be better abed i know a punter when i see one i may be right i may be wrong and for your sake i hope im wrong but the point is this a good deal of our friends paper has come my way and i want to know if supposing i take it to market with bad results to the estate you are going to swear off your trust then uncle jenico did an heroic thing how heroic i could not realise at the time though even then i think a shadow of the truth was penetrating my bewilderment he got to his feet looking like an angel mr quayle he said youve spoken plainly and i dont conceal your words are a disappointment but if they are also a prophecy rest assured sir that richard and i stand or fall together we are the surviving partners of an honourable firm and there is that in there sir he pointed to his inseparable despatch box to uphold our credit with the world mr quayle seized his hand with an immense expression of relief on his face youre a good soul he said without that assurance i should have felt like robbing the orphan i hope it may turn out better than we suppose i hope so too said uncle jenico rather disconsolately chapter iv my first view of the hill it turned out not so badly yet pretty badly uncle jenico took cheap lodgings for us in the town and for two or three months was busy flitting between ipswich and london winding up my fathers estate at the end when the value of every lot stick and warrant had been realised and the creditors satisfied a sum representing perhaps a year was secured to us and with this and the despatch box we committed ourselves to the future it appeared that my uncle jenicos inventions had always been more creditable than profitable to him and this for the reason that unattainable capital was necessary to their working given a few hundreds he was confident that he could make thousands out of any one of them it was hard for the lack of a little fuel so to speak to have so much power spoiling on ones hands i would have had him when once i understood invest our own capital in some of them but though i could see he loved me for the suggestion he had the better strength of affection to keep loyal to his trust which he administered scrupulously according to the law afterwards when i came to know him better i could not but be thankful that he had shown this superior genius for honesty for his faith in his own concerns was so complete and at the same time so nave that he might otherwise have lacked nothing but the guilt to be a defaulter as to the patents themselves they represented a hundred phases of craft every one of which delighted and convinced me by its originality there was a design amongst them for an automatic dairy maid a machine which by exhausting the air in a number of flexible tubes could milk twenty cows at once there was a design for making little pearls large by inserting them like setons in the shells of living oysters there was a plan for a ship to be driven by a portable windmill which set a turbine spinning under the stern uncle jenicos contrivances were mostly on an heroic scale and covered every form of enterprise from the pill which was to eliminate dyspepsia from the land to a scheme for liquidating the national debt by pawning all england for a term of years to an international trust at the same time there was no human need too mean for his consideration he was for ever striving to economise labour for the betterment of his poorer fellow creatures his inventiveness was a great charity which did not even begin at home his patents from being designed to improve any condition but his own suffered the neglect of a world to which selfishness is the first principle of business competence his napina a liquid composition from which old clothes after having been dipped therein re emerged as new could find no market his labour of love spit which was turned by a rocking chair moving a treadle like that on a knife grinders machine so that the cook could roast her joint in great comfort while dozing over her paper could make no headway against the more impersonal clock work affair and so it was with most of his designs but a few of which had been actually tested before being condemned on insufficient evidence what more ridiculous for instance than to denounce his burglars trap on the score that one single idiot of a householder had blundered into his own snare and been kept there while the robbers were rifling his premises what more scandalous than to convict his fire derrick a noble invention like a crane dangling a little cabin for saving life at conflagrations because the first time it was tested the box would not descend but kept the insurance gentlemen swinging in the air for an hour or two or his infallible lifebelt which turned upside down in the water for the single reason that they tried it on a revenue officer who had lost his legs in an explosion no practical innovation was surely ever started without a stumble but uncle jenico had no luck he sunk all his capital in his own patents without convincing a soul or and this is the notable thing losing his temper that one only of his possessions remained to him fresh and sound as when as a little boy he had invented a flying top which broke his grandmothers windows no neglect had impaired it nor adversity ruffled for more than a moment if he had patented it and nothing else he could have made his fortune i am certain still when we came to be comrades or partners as he loved to call us his restless brain was busy as ever with ideas nothing was too large or small for him to touch he showed me on an early occasion how his hat not the black one he had worn at the funeral but the big beaver article that came over his eyes explained its own proportions in a number of little cupboards or compartments in the lining which were designed to carry ones soap toothbrush razor etc when on a short visit he had the most delightful affection for his own ingenuities and the worldliest axioms for explaining the secret of their success on the afternoon when mr quayle after the kindest of partings with me had left us and while he was yet on the stairs uncle jenico had bent to me and whispered make it a business principle my boy never to confess to insolvency you heard the way i assured the gentleman well richard we may have in our despatch box there all ophir lying fallow for the lack of a little cash to work it but we mustnt tell our commercial friends so no no we must let them believe it is their privilege to back us necessity is a bad recommendation it may be but i was not a commercial gent and uncle jenico had all my faith and should have had all my capital if it had rested with me to dispose of it as i liked during the time my uncle was engaged in london george good man remained at ipswich to look after me though we were forced reluctantly to dismiss him as soon as things were settled it was impossible however on a hundred and fifty pounds a year to keep a man servant and so presently he went and with him my last connection with the old life not more of the past than the clothes i stood in now remained to me it was as if i had been shipwrecked and adopted by a stranger but the final severance seemed a relief to uncle jenico who when it was accomplished drew a long breath and adjusted his glasses and looked at me rosily now richard he said with nobody any longer to admonish us comes the question of our home and where to make it have you any choice dear me what did i know of the worlds dwelling places i answered that i left it all to him very well he said with a happy sigh then i have an original plan suppose we make it nowhere he paused to note how the surprise struck home you mean i began hesitating i mean said he supposing we have no fixed abode but go from place to place as it suits us what boy would not have jumped at the suggestion i was in ecstasies you see said uncle jenico moving about i get ideas and in ideas lies our future prosperity lets look at the map it was a lovely proposal to enter in actual being the mysterious regions of pictures on the wall to breathe the real atmosphere so long felt in romance of tinted lithographs and coloured prints to find roads and commons and phantom distances wistful unattainable dreams hitherto made suddenly accessible to me it was thrilling it was rapturous my uncle humoured the thought so completely as to leave to me the fanciful choice of our first resting place only dont let it be too far he said just at present we must go moderate and until i can realise on the sale of a little patent which i am on the point of parting with for an inadequate though considerable sum i spent a delightful hour in poring over the county map it was patched with verdant places big farms and gentlemens estates and reminded me somehow of those french green frilled sugarplums which crunch liqueur and are shaped like little vegetables one could feel the cosy shelter of the woods marked in groves of things that looked like tiny cabbages and gaze down in imagination from the hills meandering like furry caterpillars with a miniature windmill here and there to turn them from their course the yellow roads were rich in suggestion of tootling coaches and milestones and inns revealing themselves round corners with troughs in front and sign boards and perhaps a great elm shadowed with caves of leafiness at unattainable heights but the red spit of railway which came up from the bottom of the picture as far as colchester and was thence extended in a dotted line only to ipswich gave me a thrill of memory half sad and half beautiful for it was by that wonderful crimson track that my father and i had travelled our last road together as far as the old essex town where since it ended there for the time being we had taken coach for suffolk made up your mind asked uncle jenico by and by with a chuckle i flushed and wriggled and came out with it cant we maynt we go to the sea ive never been there yet and were so close and papa promised the sea he echoed why to be sure ive long had an idea that seaweed might be used for water proofing its an inspiration richard well beat mr macintosh on his own ground but whereabouts to the sea now i could not suggest a direction however so he borrowed for me a local guide book which dealt with places of interest round the coast and left me to study it while he went out for a walk to get ideas i had no great education but i could read glibly enough for my eight years when uncle jenico returned in an hour or two our choice so far as i was concerned was made i brought the book and laying it before him pointed to a certain description dunberry he read skipping so as to take the gist of it the sitomagus of the roman occupation and later the dunmoc of east anglia population hm hm disfranchised by the reform act of hm formerly a place of importance owning a seaport fortifications seven churches and an abbey in the twelfth century the sand silting up destroyed its harbour and admitted the encroachments of the sea from which date its prosperity was gradually withdrawn hm hm since century by century made the devouring sport of the ocean until at the present date but a few crumbling ruins toppling towards their final extinction in the waves below remain the sole sad relics of an ancient glory which once proudly dominated the element under which it was doomed later to lie whelmed uncle jenico stopped reading and looked up at me a little puzzled theres better to come i murmured blushing he nodded and went on a hill called the abbots mitre as much from its associations perhaps as from its peculiar conformation overlooks the modern village and is crowned on its seaward edge by the remains of the ancient foundation from which it takes its name some business is done in the catching and curing of sprats and herrings there is an annual fair morant states that after violent storms when the shingle drifts are overturned bushels of coins roman and other and many of considerable value may be picked up for the seeking uncle jenicos face came slowly round to stare into mine his hair seemed risen his jaw was a little dropped richard he whispered our fortune is made yes i thrilled back delighted thats why i chose it i thought youd be pleased he looked out the direction eagerly on the map it was distant by road some twenty five miles north east by north from ipswich by sea perhaps ten miles further but the weather was fine and water transport more suited to our finances so two days later we had started for dunberry in one of the little coasting ketches that ply between harwich and yarmouth carrying farm produce and such chance passengers as prefer paying cheap for a risk too dear for security it was lovely april weather and a light wind blowing up the shores from the south east bowled us gaily on our way i never so much as thought of sickness and if i had uncle jenico looking in his large panama hat like a benevolent planter would have shamed me with his rubicund serenity back to confidence again our sole property for all contingencies was contained in the despatch box and a single carpet bag and with no more sense of responsibility than these engendered we were committing ourselves to a future of ravishing possibilities throughout the pleasant journey we hugged the coast never being more than a mile or two distant from it so that its features wild or civilized were always plain to us it showed ever harsher and more desolate the farther we ran north and the tearing and hollowing effect of waves upon its sandy cliffs more evident all the way it was fretted near and far with towers a land of churches they stood grey in the gaps of hills brown and gaunt on solitary headlands sometimes they were dismantled and once on a deserted shore we saw a belfry and part of a ruined chancel footing the tide itself it was backed by a great heaped billow of sand which so our skipper told us had stood between it and the sea till storms flung it all over and behind leaving the walls it had protected exposed to destruction as evening came on i must confess my early jubilation waned somewhat the thin harsh air the melancholy cry of the birds the eternal desolation of the coast chilled me with a creeping terror of our remoteness from all that friendly warmth and comfort we had rashly deserted not a light greeted us from the shore but such as shone ghastly in the lifeless wastes of foam the last coast town miles behind seemed to have passed us beyond the final bounds of civilization so that it was with something like a whimper of joy that i welcomed the sudden picture of a hill notched oddly far ahead against the darkening sky i ran hurriedly to uncle jenico uncle i cried uncle look the abbots mitre the skipper heard me and answered aye said he its the mitre sure enow and spat over the taffrail there was something queer in his tone he rolled his quid in his cheek and like enow by all they say he added looking at uncle jenico to figure agen for godliness eh said my uncle i beg your pardon granted answered the skipper shortly and that was all there was an uneasy atmosphere of enigma here but we were abroad after adventure when all was said and had no cause to complain i stood holding my uncles hand while we ran our last knot for home in the twilight as we neared the hill its peculiar shape was gradually lost and instead looking up from below we saw the cap of a broken tower showing over its swell then hill and ruin dropped behind us a shadowy bulk and of a sudden we were come opposite a sandy cleft cutting up into the cliff and below on the shingle a ghostly group of boats and shore loafers though still no light or sign of houses we brought to the sails flapping and the skipper sent a long melancholy boom sounding over the water from a horn it awoke a stir on the beach and presently we saw a boat put off and come curtseying towards us it was soon alongside revealing three men of whom the one who sat steering was a little remarkable he was immensely tall and slouching with a lank bristled jaw a swarthy skin and in spectral contrast eye places of such an odd sick pallor as to give him the appearance at least in this gloaming of wearing huge spectacles however he was the authoritative one of the three and welcomed us civilly enough for early visitors to dunberry hoping we should favour the place none so well as thee jole since thy convarsion bellowed the skipper as we pushed off there followed a chuckle of laughter from the ketch and i noticed even that the two men pulling us creased their cheeks their companion unmoving clipped out something like an oath which he gruffly and hastily coughed over the lord in his wrath visit not the scoffer he said aloud nor waft him blindfold this night upon the weary sands in a few minutes we slid up the beach on the comb of a breaker and half a dozen arms were stretched to help us out one seized the carpet bag another our tall coxswains itself the despatch box and thereby by that lank arm hangs this tale for my uncle who was jealous of nothing in the world but his box in scrambling to resecure it from its ravisher slipped on the wet thwarts and falling with his head against a corner of the article itself rolled out bleeding and half stunned upon the sand i was terribly frightened and for a moment general consternation reigned but my uncle was not long in recovering himself though to such a dazed condition that a strong arm was needed in addition to his stick to help him towards the village we started a toilful procession up the sandy gully dunberry gap its name i carrying the precious case and presently reaching the top saw the village going in a long gentle sweep below us the scoop of the land covering it seawards which was the reason we had seen no lights it had been uncle jenicos intention to look for reasonable lodgings but this being from his injury impracticable we let ourselves be conducted to the flask inn the most important in the place where we were no sooner arrived than he consented to be put to bed with me in a little closet giving off his room it was near dark by the time we were settled and feeling forlorn and bewildered i was glad enough after a hasty supper to tuck my troubles between the sheets and forget everything in sleep but how little i guessed as i did so that uncle jenico had in falling taken possession like william the conqueror of this new land of our adoption chapter v the story of the earthquake providence i cannot but believe had all this time humoured us along a seeming road of casualty which was in truth the direct path to its own wonderful ends we talk of luck and accident and coincidence they are i am certain but the veils with which it blinds us to its inexorable conclusions my chance selection of our destination my uncles mishap what were these but second and third acts in the strange drama which had begun in the law courts of ipswich where my father had given his life for a truth which was to be here thirty miles away proven and consummated the dnouement was distant yet to be sure for providence having all eternity to plot in works deliberately nevertheless it never loses sight i think of what we call the unities of art i awoke from a dreamless sleep a restored and avid little giant it was bright morning a clock on the stairs cleared its throat and sang out six times the house was still save for a shuffling of drowsy maids at their dusting below i lay quiet conscious of the most unfamiliar atmosphere all about me of whitewashed walls of a smell between wood smoke and seaweed and the faint sourness of beer of cold boarded floors gritty with sand of utter remoteness from the noise of traffic habitual to a young denizen of towns this little gap of time had lifted me clean out of my accustomed conditions and dumped me in an outpost of civilization amongst uncouth allies friendlies in name but as foreign as foes to my experience i got up soon very softly and washed and dressed and went out i had to pass on my way through my uncles room and it relieved me to see him slumbering peacefully on his pillow though the white bandage across his forehead gave me a momentary shock i emerged upon a landing on a wall of which papered with varnished marble hung a smoke stained print of a hunt with a case of stuffed water birds on a table beneath no one accosted me as i descended the little creaking flight of stairs i passed out by the unlatched private door of the tavern and found myself at the sea end of the village street it was a glowing morning not a soul appeared abroad and i turned to the path by which we had come the night before thrilling to possess the sea the ground went gently up by the way of a track that soon lost itself in the thin grass of the cliffs not till i reached the verge did i pause to reconnoitre and then at once all was displayed about me i drew one deep delighted breath and turned as my foremost duty to examine the way i had come the village yawning from its chimneys little early draughts of smoke ran straight from the sea perhaps for a quarter of a mile under the shelter of a low long hill on which a few sheep were folded beyond this hill southwards and divided from it by a deepish gorge whose end i could see like a cut trough in the cliff edge bulged another the abbots the contour which gave it its name but roughly distinguishable at these closer quarters the ruins we had passed overnight crowned this second slope near its marge and inland both hills dropped into pastures whence the ground rose again towards a rampart of thick woods which screened all dunberry from the world beyond it looked so endearing such a happy valley of peace one would scarcely have credited the picture with a single evil significance yet but i am not going to anticipate tingling with pleasure i faced round to the sea it was withdrawn a distance away creaming at the ebb all beyond was a sheet of golden lustre fading into the bright mists of dawn right under the rising sun like a bar beneath a crest stretched the line of the weary sands a perilous bank situate some five miles from shore and between bank and coast rode a solitary little two masted lugger with shrouds of gossamer and hull of purple velvet it seemed in the soft glow even while i looked this shook out sails like beetles wings and drawing away revealed a tiny boat speeding shorewards i bent and peered over ten fathoms beneath me the gully we had climbed in the dark discharged itself a river of sand upon the beach and tumbled at its mouth as it might be dbris lay a dozen pot bellied fishing boats right and left the cliffs rose and dropped in fantastic conformations until they sank either way into the horizon it was a wonderful scene to the little town bred boy presently i looked for the rowing boat again and saw it close in shore in a minute it grated on the shingle and there heaved himself out of it the tall fisherman who had escorted us last night i was sure of him and he also it appeared of me for after staring up some time shading his eyes with his hand he turned as if convinced to haul his craft into safety i watched him awhile and was then once more absorbed in the little vessel drawing seawards when i started to hear his voice suddenly address me close by he must have come up the gully as soft footed as a cat his eyes were less like a marmosets by daylight but they were still a strange feature in his gaunt forbidding face i felt friendly towards every one yet somehow this mans expression chilled me as he stood smiling down ingratiatory without another word is that your little ship out there i asked for lack of anything better lor bless ee no sir he answered heartily but in a sort of breathless way what makes ee think so werent you coming from it me he protested with a panting chuckle jole rampick own that there little tender beauty id skipped out fur my morning dip sir if you must know a wonderful bracing water this if folks would only credit it his unshorn dusky face was not i could not help thinking the best testimony to its cleansing properties but i kept my wisdom to myself and turned to go back to the inn mr rampick volunteered his company and on the way some instructive information aye he panted huskily man and boy fur nigh on fifty year have i known this here abbots dunberry but never till three months ago the healing vartues of its brine who told you of them i asked the lord he answered showing the under whites of his eyes a moment the lord sir through his minister the parson thats mr sant benighted we were and ignorant till the light was vouchsafed us and parson he revealed the bethesda lying at our very doors whats bethesda i had i am sorry to say to ask a blessed watering place he said im humbly surprised sir like as parson calclates to make of this here if the almighty will condescend to convart our former wickedness to our profit were you wicked bad bad he answered setting his lips and shaking his head a nest of smugglers and forswearers till he set his hand on us mr rampick how it tuk the form of an arthquake he said with a little cough i jumped and ejaculated o where yonder in the mitre he said waving his hand towards the hidden bluff itll be fower months ago wont it as they run their last contraband to ground in the belly of that there hill a cave it was supposed sir but few knew for sarten and none will ever know now till the day when the lord shall judge the secrets of men there was a way in as believed known only to the few and one night as believed them few entered by it each man with his brace o runlets and they never come out agen i gasped and knotted my fingers together it did not occur to my innocence to question the source of his knowledge or conjecture why i whispered why he echoed in a sort of asthmatic fury why sir because it was a full cargo and their iniquity according and so the lord he spoke and the hill it closed upon em in the dark when we was all abed there come a roaring wind from underground what turned our hearts to water and in the morning when we gathered to look there was the hill twisted like a dead face out of knowledge and the abbey two thirds of what was left scrattled abroad i could only stare up at him breathing quick in face of this wonderful romance it had i knew been a year strangely prolific in earth shocks yes sir he said soberly if all whats believed is gospel true there at this moment lays those poor sinners bedded like flints in chalk and the hill fair reeking with nantes brandy he groaned hoarsely hallerloojer it was a sign and a warning the shock of it carried off th old vicar and in a week or two arter mr sant he come to take his place he found us a soberd people hallerloojer and soil meet fur the lords planting you be the fust fruits sir and we favourably hope as when you go away youll recommend us perhaps i vaguely understood by this something of the nature of our welcome given an isolated fishing village skipped by tourists because of its remoteness given the sudden withdrawal from that village of its natural advantages for an illicit trade given a clerical enthusiast introduced at the right moment to point out to a depressed population its localitys potentialities as a watering place and to show the way for them to win an honest prosperity out of the ruins of evil given to top all a dressing of local superstition and the position was clear such deduction no doubt was for the adult rather than the child but though i could not draw it at the time it was there to be drawn i am sure as we talked we had reached the inn and my companion touching his cap passed on but he came back before i had time to enter and addressed me breathlessly as if on an after thought begging your pardon sir but you makes me laugh you reely does about that there lugger belonging to poor jole rampick and he went off chuckling and looking with his little head and slouching shoulders and stilts of legs like the hind quarters of a pantomime elephant i found my uncle sitting up in preparation to breakfast in bed he was very genial and happy but so it seemed to me extraordinarily vague i told him about my adventure and the story of the earthquake which he seemed somehow unable to dissociate from his own accident i knew it richard he said but it was taking rather a mean advantage of a lame man eh theres no security against it but balloons that ive often thought you see when the ground itself gives underneath you where are you to go if one could only pump oxygen into ones own head you know ill think about it in the course of the morning i dont fancy i shall get up just at present that despatch box now it was a drastic way of impressing its claims upon me eh well well he laughed rather wildly i thought uncle i said youve never told me how did you get lame how did i get lame he murmured pressing the bandage on his forehead why to be sure it was a parachute richard a really capital thing i invented but the wires got involved the merest accident and i came to the ground he was interrupted by two young ladies daughters of the inn who came themselves out of curiosity i think to serve us breakfast they were over dressed all but for their trodden slippers with large bows of hair on their heads and they giggled a good deal and answered questions pertly well my dears said uncle jenico how about the earthquake they stared at him and then at one another and burst out laughing o there now said one earthquake yourself old gentleman go along with you and they ran out and we heard them tittering all down the stairs uncle jenico got clearer after his meal though he was still disinclined to move i sat with him all the morning while he showed and explained to me more of the contents of his box and about midday a visitor the reverend mr sant was announced i stood up expectant and saw a thin dark young man in clerical dress enter the room at a stride he had the colourless face large boned nose and burning eyes of a zealot and not an ounce of superfluous flesh anywhere about him much athletic temperance had trimmed him down to frame and muscle but had not parched the sources of a very sweet smile which was the only emotional weakness he retained he came up to the bed took my uncles hand and introduced himself in a word permit me he said i heard of your accident i know a trifle of surgery and our apothecary visits us but twice in the month may i look he examined the hurt and saying he would send a salve for it settled down to talk now i could not follow the persuasive process but all i know is that within a quarter of an hour he had learned all my uncles and my history and the reason for our coming to dunberry and that having once mastered the details he very ingeniously set himself to appropriating them to the schemes of providence it is clear he said that you free lances of destiny were inspired to select this out of all the world for your operations we looked for visitors to report for us upon the attractions of the place you for a quiet and healthful spot in which to develop your schemes very true said uncle jenico ive long had an idea for extracting gold from sea water you see cried mr sant greatly pleased its a clear interposition of providence this coast is i am sure peculiarly adapted from the accessibility of its waters to gold seeking i could not restrain my excitement please i said did d d the smugglers hide it there mr sant glanced at me sharply who told you about smugglers he demanded mr rampick i whispered hanging my head ah he exclaimed and turned to my uncle old joel rampick was it one of the most cherished of my converts sir a deeply religious man at bottom though circumstances long obscured the light in him old rampick now and talked about smuggling did he hell have drawn the moral of it from his own experience i dont doubt dunberry theres no use concealing has been a long thorn in the side of the revenue though happily the earthquake has changed all that ah to be sure said my uncle the earthquake it was without question a divine visitation said mr sant resolutely do you think so said my uncle his face falling my purpose in coming here was really most harmless sir mr sant looked puzzled then went on with a dry smack of his lips i am afraid that my predecessor lacked a little the apostolic fervour he was old and liked his ease good man perhaps long association with the place had blunted his prejudices i must not play the pharisee to him however no doubt so circumstanced i should have failed no less to sow the seed heaven sent me at a fruitful moment to heaven be the credit and the glory this little boy now nephew dicky he knows his catechism ah said uncle jenico with a cunning look does he chit chit protested the clergyman i hope not altogether ignorant of it he was decently shocked and won an easy promise from my uncle that i should come up to him for an hours instruction every day then he rose to go youll excuse me he said bending his brows but i trust you are satisfied with your quarters well yes answered my uncle hesitating but an inn you see its a little more than we can than we ought to eh mr sant brightened immediately we came to know afterwards that he strongly disapproved of these flashy miss flemings and had once expressed in public some surprise that they had not been impounded as skittish animals not under proper control theres the widow puddephatt ripe and ready for visitors he said and perfectly reasonable i am sure may i give you her address its no the playstow my uncle thanked him warmly and smitten with a sudden idea caught at his coat as he was leaving o by the way he said these coins to be picked up on the beach now there are enough left to make it profitable i suppose mr sant stared at him the coins roman and other persisted uncle jenico anxiously scanning the clergymans face the antiques which morant tells us litter the beach like shells after storms mr sant shook his head i have heard nothing of them during my time he said but i should hardly think smuggling would have got such a hold here if it were the tom tiddlers ground your friend supposes it to be directly he was gone uncle jenico turned to me rubbing his hands with a most roguish smile puckering his mouth richard he said we are in plenty of time the obtuseness of the rustic is a thing astonishing beyond words here with all pactolus at his feet he needs a stranger to come and show him his opportunities but mum boy mum well keep this little matter to ourselves chapter vi mrs puddephatt and fancy maria the following day my uncle was near himself again and we left the flask inn and took lodging with the widow puddephatt the playstow was a little green about half way down the village where the villagers reared their may pole on may day and built their fires on midsummers eve and caroused in september on the harvest largesse won from passers by round about in a little square were cottages detached and exclusive the lite of dunberry and to one side was the church but now in process of completion in whose porch the daring would seat themselves on st marks eve to see at midnight the wraiths of the years pre doomed come and knock at the door mr sant had however limited that custom as well as some others less reputable and the fact that he was able to do so spoke volumes for his persuasiveness at the present time the villagers under his stimulus were transferring stone by stone to the long unfinished fabric and its adjoining school house the less sacred parts of the ruined foundation on the hill mrs puddephatt though dunberry born was a comparative acquisition to the village to which she had been summoned and to her natural succession in no the playstow through the death of an only sister without encumbrances she had in fact gone very young a great many years ago into service in london and had never set foot again in her native place until this inheritance now two years old had called her she brought with her an ironic atmosphere of the great world and a disdainful tolerance towards the little in which her lot was now to vegetate she had in her high experience tweenied obliged scullery maided kitchen maided house maided parlour maided and old maided and she had somehow emerged from this five fold chrysalis of virginity the widow puddephatt no one knew by what warrant other than that of a sort of waspish charity girl cap with a knuckle bone frill round her face but then her knowledge of men was so matrimonial that it was admitted nothing but a husband could have inspired it her dictums in respect to this mystic experience were merum sal to the wives of dunberry look in the pot for your new gownd and the way to a mans purse is through his mouth may be bracketed for utterances cryptic to the general but not to their delighted understandings a hopen and comes empty ome a man shuts his sweetarts mouth with a kiss but his wifes heyes be careful of a saturday morning to mend the ole in your mans pocket when your usband talks of his hage be sure he means yours such and the like shrewd axioms served the widow puddephatt at least as well as marriage lines and if more were needed her mastery of the exact science of nagging and of the conquering resource of hysterics supplied it sometimes it was whispered she was to be seen in her front garden viciously dusting a mans coat with a stick and on this moral implication alone late tavern roysterers lurching home after closing time past the little wicket where she was often to be seen watching spectral and ironic had been known to slink by meanly conscious of deserting and surrendering into her gloating hands a purely imaginary puddephatt their late boon companion this tremendous lady undertook the care of us with infinite condescension and hearing that we were londoners bred gathered us at once under the protection of her maternal and metropolitan wing lork fancy maria she would say with an air of amused tolerance towards the little suffolk rawbones who generalled for her we dont breathe on the knives and polish em in our haprons in london or that wont do fancy maria we know better in london than to dust the ot plates with our helbers with this shibboleth of sarcastic comparison she had won not only fancy maria but all feminine dunberry to a perspiring emulation of her gentility so that in the course of her two years the social code had grown quite elevated and it was no longer fashionable to dine in ones shirt sleeves fancy maria was her adoring but unable lieutenant she tried hard and breathed very hard yet her fervour led to frequent disaster it was the management of trays that tested her most severely if she rose with one from the depths she invariably struck it against the lintel of the parlour door and shot everything from it into the hall if she descended with one from the heights she tripped at the corner where the stairs turned and tobogganed down on it the rest of the way preceded by an avalanche of cups and dishes she always did her best to keep the contents steady with her thumbs but her thumbs though large were not universal and were generally occupied in holding secure the bread and butter for choice on one side and the fried fish on the other some people make a point of leaving a little piece on each dish for manners we always cut out and left fancy marias thumb marks for that mysterious retainer of our childhood it was not long before uncle jenico questioned mrs puddephatt about the earthquake she turned up her nose at the first mention of it and tittered the shrillest sarcasm lork sir she said youve never abin took hin by that stuff and you a londoner stuff is it said uncle jenico genially and why now she cocked her head and folded her arms across her chest like a tricksy saint in an old woodcut i wouldnt a believed it of you she said no not if youd gone and took me by the ears and battered my ed on the table but my good woman began my uncle mr sant bless im for a hinnercent suckling dove ocooing among the sarpints she interrupted with a tight little laugh we looked at her quite bewildered and uncle jenico was evidently at a loss for an answer what e wants that e believes said mrs puddephatt nodding her head many times but he aint a londoner and hi ham the advantage one would have thought lay with the untainted clergyman herthquake indeed exclaimed mrs puddephatt with withering contempt and grace took hout of it no sir not more than what elijah looked to find in hisn and was deceived in the almighty a fine show convert weve got in our mr rampick havent we ho yes tee hee and i opes as he makes it pay sinst the loss of his liveliood by the herthquake the amount of scorn she got each time into the word was simply blasting he lost began my uncle surprised ah what would he lose now interrupted the lady acridly humorous thats just hit sir talked of the wicked smugglers to master bowen here didnt he well supposin he were hisself the most howtdacious of the lot i dont say he was you know i wouldnt so commit myself i merely states as a curious fact that this rampick as was formerly as warm and dangerous a man as the best in the place is sinst the herthquake become a loafer without any visible means of substance ho yes a pretty convert i dont think you believe him to be at heart a smuggler still said my uncle now now mrs puddephatt sir she answered with dignity i thank you for the himplication but whatever my apperient greenness i wasnt born yesterday we may have our faults in london but to be suffolk paunches isnt among them once a smuggler sir is halways a smuggler indeed said uncle jenico much abashed yes sir said mrs puddephatt just as to be born a gipsy is to laugh at the rates a ottentot sir isnt ashamed of his own nekkedness nor a smuggler of his smugness reform hindeed well well said uncle jenico but what makes you suppose it wasnt an earthquake the landlady laughed sarcastic in london sir she said herthquakes as is praps beknownst to you sends out sulfurious perfumes and not the heffluvium of brandy good heavens exclaimed my uncle but what i reveal nothing mr paxton she interrupted him but what my nose tells me you may smell it yet sir begging your pardon about the mitre but ive eard tell sir of ile wells but never of brandy i may be wrong and halso i may be wrong in doubting that gunpowder forms of itself in the oller places of the herth and with these enigmatic words she left us but it must be said that for all her withering gentility she made us an excellent landlady as we had full opportunity of proving for i may as well out with it at once we had come to dunberry to stay chapter vii mr sant i think perhaps uncle jenico foresaw it no more than i without doubt at first he would have laughed to scorn the idea of sinking all his eager interests in this little suffolk fishing village whose communications with any town of even fifth rate importance such as yokestone were by seven miles at least of villainous roads our settlement was gradual our departure postponed in the beginning week by week probably like that of the man who went to venice for a fortnight and stayed for thirty years the initiatory step towards our continued residence was certainly my uncles acceptance of mr sants offer to instruct me that was as the french say le premier pas qui cote afterwards the offer being extended with infinite consideration for our means to one for my general tuition by the clergyman grew to confirm our attachment to the place until it came to be tacitly understood that dunberry was to see me through my education but there was another reason uncle jenico seemed never quite to recover from the stun inflicted upon him at his landing his affection his geniality his inventiveness were no whit impaired yet somehow the last one could have thought had relapsed from the practical upon the theoretic he was a trifle less restless a trifle more inert he appeared to bask in a sort of luminous placidity and more and more his concern in his patents diminished i do not mean by this to imply that his schemes for our enrichment were all forgotten on the contrary they concentrated to an intensity as pathetic as it was single in its object i know at this date that uncle jenico was a lovable failure i recognize moreover as i hardly recognized then that a wistful realization of this fact minus its qualifying adjective was beginning to dawn upon him and that he was inclining to consider his lame and impotent conclusions a right judgment upon him for his self seeking god bless him i say he thought to atone for this his egotism dear charitable soul by devoting all his remaining energies to the task of making the fortune of the little trust committed to his care he wrought in fact that he might die content leaving me rich and in the furtherance of this object his schemes were not as i say forgotten but transferred they were consolidated in short into one which in the end was to become an obsession but of that i will treat in its place as soon as we were settled i began at once to go to mr sants for my daily lesson the scope of which imperceptibly enlarged itself from catechism to the classics the rectory stood inland beyond the playstow in a rather lonely position under the drop of the hill it was a dark mossy old building shrouded in trees and a by road went past its gates up to the woods beyond in the depths of whose shadows lay the court manor house and its bed ridden old squire mr sant was a bachelor a tough militant churchman and church reformer he taught me the uses of my fists as well as of the decalogue no doubt it was this constitution of his which made such way with the villagers for englishmen respect piety the better for its being knocked into them i took my share of his excellent influence and i trust it helped to make a man of me you shall hear by and by about the first practical use to which i put it he had the motto from cicero framed and hung over the mantelpiece in his study i will quote it to you because it speaks the man more perfectly than i can do quidquid agas agere pro viribus whatever you do to do with your whole strength that was it it was a maxim very apt to one whose own strength both of will and body was of tempered steel one among his many characteristic innovations was the feast of lanterns as he called it a lecture to combine instruction with amusement would be called for delivery in the church after dark whosoever listed might on a single condition attend this he would find set up spectrally discernible in the chancel which like the rest of the building would be unlighted a screen of white linen on which had been roughly sketched in crayon by the courageous lecturer himself a number of objects to become in their turn subjects which might range say from a leg of mutton to the dome of st pauls the condition of attendance was simply that each comer should bring his or her own lantern with the natural consequence that the greater the company the brighter the illumination now with the first arrival began hymns and were so continued until sufficient lights were congregated to reveal the drawings on the screen a right identification of any one of which by any member of the audience at the close of any verse put a period to the singing and started a disquisition on the object named it must be said that the identification was not always accurate in which case the singing was continued for religious and artistic fervour are not necessarily associated and the splendid daring which mr sant put into his work sometimes obscured its intentions as when his bellows designed to introduce a dissertation on pulmonics were taken for a ham but the vigour and resourcefulness of the lecturer neither allowed an impasse nor while he was always quite ready to join in the laughter over his own artistic shortcomings permitted criticism to degenerate into fooling he did not object to laughter on the contrary i am afraid it will scandalize some people he credited the almighty with an almighty sense of humour only he insisted upon its being tempered to the sacredness of the place in which it was evoked and for the rest he had a fund of bright and ready information at his constant disposal such is an example of his methods and if any pious reactionaries object i can only say that in the result it was educational that it won tavern loafers to at least one wholesome evening in the week that in short it attained such popularity that any dissipated seceder attempting to sneak out of the church and thereby obscure the light by so much as the loss of a taper would be roughly grabbed back by his fellows and forced willy nilly to hear the lecture out mr sant to sum him up was a zealot without being a bigot and a devoted servant to his master without prejudice to human nature he was also a capable boxer i came to love as much as to respect him chapter viii treasure hunting for a fortnight succeeding our arrival the weather remained calm and bright so that uncle jenico and i were able to explore the locality with great comfort and satisfaction the coast which we followed up both north and south for miles was extremely desolate and unvisited though bearing at intervals all along it the traces of former settlements it would seem to have been quite thickly populated once during a period which dated probably from the incursions first of the roman legions and after of those salt sea wolves who preferred squatting round the fringes of their conquered island with the open door of the sea beside them and its smell in their briny nostrils to penetrating into the traps of the close shut valleys later christianity had come to fret these windy foam whipped settlements with pinnacles and monastic walls and stone fanes with jewelled windows and airy bell towers so that church might peal to church all down this long front line of the position it had won but corruption creeping in with prosperity and lawlessness with the tides god had withdrawn his countenance from the temples that abused his service and had permitted the ocean to break in their defences and one by one devour them the priest who had evaded his vows had ages ago tucked up his cassock and fled the parson who succeeded him and to the reversion of his benefices could not so hoodwink heaven by taking his tithes of smuggled tobacco and brandy as to stay for one season the hunger of the gluttonous waters year by year century by century the storms had fed on these devoted sand built coasts and were still feeding when we came to know them towns and once flourishing colonies had disappeared as utterly as if they had never existed not only they but the very soil on which they had been planted paved the floor of the ocean for miles out there were legends of foundered bells rung by unseen mermen at incredible distances from shore there were stories of treasure chests and sculptured marbles revealed to storm belated fishermen in the deep troughs of monstrous bottom scouring waves so far away as the weary sands themselves it was said traces of the ancient dunberry could be spelt out in calm seasons by those who gazed intently enough and long enough into the green deep waters it was a fable probably in a land of fables yet it served to emphasize the wreck of time and will show upon what a haunted border land of ghosts we had come to make our home the modern village itself was old how ancient then those grey ruins on the cliff which had survived to see the last of the glory of which they had once been a part claimed by the deep and their own hoary traditions engulfed into the pettier traditions of a little clan these same ruins consisted of the great tower of the abbey with a mass of tumbled and complicated masonry at its foot of the line of the nave picked out in an avenue of shattered arches which ran seawards until stopped by the upward and outward sweep of the cliff and finally of a maze of huge fragments mostly on the inland side which marked the sites of monastic buildings lazar house boundary walls and so forth elsewhere were traces of aisles cloisters and supernumerary offices uncountable the whole buttressed with ivy but the most significant ruin of all to my thinking was one which stood under the cliff and for three fourths of its depth apart from it this was no other than the abbey well which generations of storms had gnawed out of its deep bed in the ground without being able to crunch and devour the sturdy relic itself there it stood a titan of the vanished race sprouting stubborn from the littered sand below cemented as it seemed by the very drift which was yearly flung upon it to destroy exposed and isolated choked with parching rubbish as it was how thrilling was the thought of the monks who had once drunk from it of the waters it had drained from the hill of the hill itself with its one time springs lying under the salt sea it was the very gaunt dead monument to the desolation of this land and as such it seemed would endure when all else was vanished the storms which took the rest stone by stone could do no more than stone by stone reveal this the earthquake which at a blow had rent the massive tower and tumbled half the remaining walls had left this unshaken it was a wonderful and impressive relic the first time i had entered among the ruins was by myself i climbed the slope early on the morning before breakfast and stood in the midst of them thrilled and awestricken a little grassy valley divided me from the hill which concealed the village of which not so much as a roof was visible from where i stood i seemed entirely cut off and alone a pigmy in the stupendous shadows of these ruined choirs the ground swept in a steepish curve to the cliff edge and again inland in one slightly shallower these were the old and new testaments of the mitre and in the valley of knowledge that lay between was built the abbey its monastery chapter house refectory and other buildings taking and topping the western slope which on its further side went shelving down to the cemeterium fratrum and the confines of the old grounds i poked about among the shattered stones with a feeling between fear and curiosity i could tell by the fresh edges of the rents and the way in which little avalanches of mortar were constantly falling with a whispering sound that much of the devastation was recent the tower had been breached by the earthquake all down its seaward front opening a monstrous gap from which a cataract of stones had thundered and piled themselves in foam as it were at the foot in one place near the cliff slope a mighty plinth had been heaved on to its side and i saw the mould on the under surface of it yet grooved with the tracks of slugs and beetles it had sunk with the mass of masonry cemented to it two thirds of its breadth into the earth and all about the ground was strangely wryed and distorted and cracked and bubbled up into mounds as if here the underheaval had made itself peculiarly felt i was gazing on it half fascinated when happening to raise my eyes i started to see other regarding me fixedly from a face which seemed to have sprouted from the earth i gave a little cry and uttered mr rampicks name at the word the man himself rose to his height from the position in which it appeared he had been crouching and ascended the last steps of a cliff pathway of the existence of which i had not known he came up to me rubbing the back of his bony hand across his mouth come to see fur yourself sir he said in his breathless fawning way yes i answered it was here wasnt it he stamped with his great foot here or hereabouts he said they lays under as supposed each with his brace o runlets it was a fearful but thrilling thought why dont they dig for them i whispered he gazed at me a moment breathing hard his eyes seemed blacker the rims round them more livid than i had yet noticed what he cried so hoarsely that his voice cracked displace these here sacred ruins fur the likes of they the lord sir begging your pardon set his own trap for them in his own way and it beent fur us to rise his dead may i make so bold to axe if your uncle knows youre out i felt the insolence of the question but was too young to resent it no i exclaimed surprised ah he said i lay he wont be best pleased sir with humility this here hill sir if all whats said is gospel true is risky ground to walk fur them as knows it not nor its toppling stones sir nor its hidden abscesses id go home sir if i was you with favour sir i was offended but a little frightened also blushing scarlet i turned away without a word and ran down the slope homewards i told uncle jenico of my adventure and encounter to my further surprise he commended mr rampicks warning what should i do if anything happened to you richard when i was not by he pleaded there was a note of emotion in his voice which touched me and i promised i would never seek the mitre again out of his company i meant it when i said it but alas the venturesomeness of youth led me later on i am ashamed to confess to disregard my promise that was not till long after however and in the meanwhile the weather remaining fine as i have said we had plenty of opportunity for exploring the district not a day was allowed to pass moreover without our investigating at least once in the twelve hours a section of the coast uncle jenico would prod all the way with his thick stick into the moraine of shingle which ran along the shore above the high tide mark at these times he would be very absent minded answering my questions at random and i knew that he had morant and his golden bushels in his thoughts he never found anything however and each evening would look up at the sky and predict stormy weather with a sham deprecation of the inconvenience it would be to us but at last the weather really did break and dark evening settled in with a high wind and rising sea it blew a gale all night and throughout the following day and uncle jenico bemoaned our detention in the house with a gratified face it was not until the second morning that it had cleared sufficiently to enable us to go out which we did immediately after breakfast the sun was blinking waterily and the surf pounding yellow as we came down to the beach but the wind had fallen and the rain ceased which was enough for us uncle jenico with his blue coat fastened tightly across his chest was looking extraordinarily swollen i thought until the reason was explained to me we had not gone far when first glancing all about him with an air of twinkling mystery he cautiously unbuttoned and revealed neatly folded upon his chest a little bushel sack such as they use for potatoes hush he whispered though not a soul was in sight the difficulty will be to avoid observation when we bring it back full i dare say theyre honest here richard but its a wrong business principle to presume upon a sentiment we must dine and sup out ive brought some sandwiches with me and mr sant will excuse you for once and return with our booty after dark do you expect to fill that uncle i said aghast for all my infancy well he answered laughing joyously but privately i hope not quite or it would puzzle us to carry it but in common wisdom we must make the best we can of this rare opportunity he hung the sack over his arm and we started off the storm had certainly overturned the shingle and scattered much of it abroad in a tangle of seaweed and dead dog fish for hours we hunted on groping sedulously among the litter and at last late in the afternoon we found a penny at least i was convinced it was one being intimately acquainted like most boys with the coin but uncle jenico would not hear of it he was shaking with excitement as he examined it it was so rubbed by the action of the waves as to exhibit nothing but a near obliterated bust which i was sure was that of our late lamented king my uncle however pointed out to me distinct traces though i could not see them of a latin inscription and was jubilant over the find it did not make much impression on the sack it is true but he was careful to point out to me that the value of a nugget such as it would take two men to carry might all be contained in a diamond which one could slip into ones waistcoat pocket it was not so much quantity we needed he said as quality and he was quite satisfied entirely so with the result of our days exploration i was glad of this at least being dog tired long before the sun setting as it justified us in going home to supper but my faith in morant i am afraid was already sadly shaken chapter ix harry harrier it was that obnoxious penny i believe which was responsible for my uncles continued pursuit of his new lobby until the hobby itself became an obsession if we had come home that first day empty handed i have little doubt but that his baulked imagination would have found itself some other and more practical outlet as it was the discovery was held by him to justify every proverb which values itself upon small beginnings he was so little cast down by its meagreness that there was no limit to the golden dreams of which he made it the basis most crazes i fancy are so built upon a pennyworth of fact he did not take out the sack again but replaced it by a sponge bag and the bag later by a stout leathern purse finally he decided that his trouser pockets would serve all our needs with the additional advantage that our hands would be freer thereby and the risk of comment on our proceedings avoided it may have been for it had certainly little to feed upon during those early weeks beyond some scraps of old iron we found nothing at first it must be said uncle jenico was not so entirely possessed by his infatuation but he found time to experiment in other directions for days he made our lodgings almost uninhabitable by boiling and decomposing seaweed until mrs puddephatt complained that her reputation was suffering by the incessant hodour of ot putrid fish which emanated from her premises the patent upon which he had expected to realize turned out after all a disappointment and had never it appeared been regarded as other than a joke by the man who he had supposed had been going to buy it he was a little disconsolate at first but soon brightened up when he thought of the potential riches lying under the shingle well laugh at em all by and by richard he said what a joke itll be when weve got our own capital to work upon and these ninnies find out the good things theyve missed but we wont be relentless my boy and disinherit the honest labourer because of the shortsightedness of his employer work for the good of mankind remember and you work for your own fine weather at this time made him thoughtful and restless it was only when the wind blew and the waves rose that he cheered up and became excited like a seagull then he would laugh aloud and button up his coat and telling me to follow him when my lesson was over limp off to the beach and there untiringly weave his ropes of sand growing more and more absorbed in his task the faster it melted beneath his hands the coins were there he was convinced and it only needed patience and luck and he plumed himself upon his being rather a spoilt child of the latter to hit upon the deposits in the meanwhile i was going to my daily lesson and getting absorbed in my own way mr sant was a delectable tutor inspiring and invigorating and by and by unconsciously to me my hour extended itself to two and sometimes more so months passed and then a year and i was nine one morning i was on my way to the rectory when i made a notable acquaintance i had to pass on my setting out the new school which was now in full activity and battling its first successful steps in the moral and intellectual reformation of infant dunberry the children were generally trooping to the bell call as i started and i have no doubt that the sense of superiority my consciousness of private tuition gave me made itself apparent to some of them in my air and demeanour a little beyond the playstow the road to the rectory and to the court on the hill ran up obliquely through the village side passing very soon into privacy and loneliness i had almost reached the rectory palings when i saw a boy start out at sight of me from the shadow of them and come swiftly on as if to accost me while yet short of shelter he was about my own age or a little older and had a round freckled face with dark red hair curled as tight as astrakhan and a very fat little pug nose he was dressed in a brown velveteen jacket and strong corduroy breeches and leathern gaiters and he looked what in fact he was a miniature gamekeeper i knew him well enough by sight having passed him for the last two or three weeks near the school house and always i verily believe with an odd little tremor of foreboding in my inside he had proved on inquiry to be the only child of harrier the squires gamekeeper from whom and that only on his masters initiative a scowling consent to his sons attending the new school had been wrung by mr sant but the boy came though near as rebellious as his father and had even until this morning arrived punctual now he advanced swaggering and whistling with his hands in his breeches pockets and a fine air of abstraction i tried to dodge him but for all that in spite of his pretended preoccupation he brought his shoulder smack against mine with a force that knocked me sprawling and from the mere pain of it drove the angry tears to my eyes he wheeled round at once as i gathered myself up with a mock apology so impudent that i longed to hit him but was deterred by the front he showed me he stood square balancing on his heels as tight knit a young mischief as health and muscle could produce mighty he said with a pretence of being scared what i done lor blest if i aint knocked into the dirt the young genleman what treats we for sich then my uneasy consciousness understood the nature of this retaliation you did it on purpose i said sullenly trying not to whimper as i dusted myself me he cried in beautiful astonishment why howsomever can you charge it to me master walking with your nose in the air its you that has your nose in the air i retaliated malevolently he flushed through his tan and squared up to me say that agen he hissed lifting his lip like a weasel once is enough i answered he danced about me making play in the air with his fists is it he gasped spasmodic o yus o course ill larn you you dursent foonk private poople yah take your lickun then something must have stirred in the garden at the moment for he suddenly flounced round and off his mouth drawn down contemptuous and his chin stuck out but i had not done with him by any means mr sant received me that morning i thought oddly and made no allusion to my battered appearance neither did i at which perhaps he cleared a little the next morning harry harrier for such was the young sportsmans name met me as before i gave him the path though with anger in my heart and he openly jeered at me as he went by the following day it was the same and for many days after he would have risked i believe ten times the punishment he deserved and got for being late rather than baulk himself of this recurrent treat presently he altered his tactics in such a way as to eat his cake and have it so to speak he did not pass me one day at the usual hour and i confess i breathed relief for all my own inefficiency was gall to me mr sants manner as was usual now was chilling almost to repulsion i was very unhappy i had grown to brood on my grievance until it almost choked me dunberry was becoming to me a miserable siberia and i longed to be out of it and hinted as much to my uncle but to my dejection he would not understand could not perhaps as pride had always prevented me from revealing my difficulty to him or to any of my real friends moreover the picking up of some trumpery oddments on the beach had by now established him unshakably in his craze which had been further confirmed by the action of certain unscrupulous dunberryites in palming off on him some faked up coins which i could have sworn had never been minted out of my own generation the relief i enjoyed on this particular morning was however delusive the cunning little gamekeeper had got himself credited with punctuality only that he might descend upon me on his return journey as i left the rectory nor was this the worst for he came reinforced by half a dozen schoolfellows the dirty little parasites of his corduroy lordship i found them awaiting me at a quiet turn of the road and before i knew it was being hustled and insulted i pushed my way through however with a lump swelling in my throat and was trying to stifle the inclination to run when a cry from harrier brought me to the roundabout with a scarlet face cowardy cowardy custard dursent peach to old crazy what broke his leg a kicking of yer i rushed back and faced him he broke his leg falling from a parryshoot he isnt crazy im not such a coward as you i blazed out in a breath i was bristling and tingling all over the worm had turned at last harry harrier whistling softly took his hands from his pockets yus he said anythink else youre a liar i answered boiling youre a coward and liar i was down and up again in a moment and rushing blindly at him with a cut lip and bloody mouth he kept quite cool and met me over and over again with stunning blows i didnt care i hardly felt them in my rage my long pent up feelings had burst their bonds and i was quite beside myself in the midst i was caught in the leash of a sinewy hand and torn away for some moments i fought and screamed in my madness then suddenly desisted gasping and trembling all over red seemed to clear from my eyes and i saw the parasites were fled harry harrier stood opposite me hanging his head and his twitching hands and in possession of us both was mr sant a little silence followed then suddenly the clergyman released me and stepped aside youre a strong boy harrier he said quietly youve had the advantage of some training too this was hardly brave he called me a coward sir muttered the boy youve got to prove he was wrong then harrier twitched his shoulders and gave a defiant upward look what said mr sant do you call it proving it to attack him six to one i takes no count of that raff sir said the boy twas him and me fought but you used them to provoke him not content with insulting him yourself day by day as he came to his lesson yes i know i looked up amazed and then down again certain tell tale rustlings that had reached my ears occasionally from the back of the rectory palings occurred to me so that i hung my head with shame well your reverence said the boy rather insolently pay me and get it over i takes my capers with my mutton i shall pay you sir said mr sant with i could have thought the ghost of a grin as one gentleman pays another you think perhaps that master bowen here has told of your bullying him he has not breathed a word about it to anybody now that i think shows him to be the better man of the two the surprise the gratification were so great i could have cried out to him like a silly girl the young gamekeeper grinned incredulous and sarcastic you think not said mr sant well ill tell you what im going to do im going to back my man to whop you by and by the boy looked up at him breathless now youve all the advantage at present you know went on the clergyman youve got constitution muscle and a little of the science not so much as you think but still a little now master bowen isnt your equal in any of these as i suspect you knew or you wouldnt have attacked him i would said the boy furiously well said mr sant smiling ill take your word for it because i believe after all its an honest word but the point is this muscle and constitution are slow growers and while my man was training to improve his you could be improving yours science on the other hand can be taught and i mean to teach him science until i consider hes your equal and better when that comes about you shall fight again and ill umpire do you agree dont i said the boy very well only i must have an understanding you must leave him unmolested in the mean time ill do it cried the lad ill do more ill fight any one as putts a finger on un the right spirit that said mr sant with an approving face well agree to decide it then in a months time say id keep it to myself if i were you good morning the boy pulled his forelock hesitated mumbled with a blush and grin youre a genleman sir and casting a saucy triumphant glance at me retreated simultaneously mr sant took me by the shoulder and hurrying me back to the rectory study procured cold water and a sponge and shut himself in with me i felt half stupefied between the blows i had received and the prospect of others yet to come in the matter of which it appeared i was to be allowed no choice but there i was wrong mr sant as he sponged with great consideration my swollen places took up the tale at once now richard he said this is going to be i think the first great test of your life you can refuse it if you like without any loss of honour you were bullied by a stronger boy and you endured your ill treatment without telling tales that was to be a gentleman you suffered insult a little too long perhaps and only resented it when directed against some one whom you very rightly love and respect well that was again to be a gentleman i flushed crimson with pleasure and he mopped hard away talking all the time you heard the engagement i made for you well i tell you you can decline quite honourably to stand by it if you do dont think i shall blame you on the contrary i will see that an effective end is put to this tyranny you have proved yourself and that is enough now if you would like me to state the facts to your uncle i will do so at once yes please i stuttered through the sponge very well he answered but dryly i thought i could have trained you perhaps to stand up to this young bruiser but without doubt you choose the christian part i will speak to mr paxton please sir i said i dont think hed understand why ive got to fight unless you told him his hand quite bumped my poor nose with the start he gave you want it to come off then richard this is a little shocking im afraid but perhaps i cant altogether blame you hes a young samson mind you said sir that science i began but he plugged my mouth hastily and gave me no opportunity to speak more till he had cleaned my wounds to his satisfaction then he put me up between his knees and while dabbing my face spasmodically with a towel recited to me the fable of the brass and the earthenware pots the brass pot you see was the gentleman he said he illustrated the christian science of self defence he didnt invite an encounter but when it was forced upon him his art got the better of the coarser clay he stretched out my arms and pinched their muscles well enough he said but that little antaeus owes his to his mother earth he could lick you with one hand dicky easy he could arent you afraid yes i am i said honestly he nodded approvingly real courage dicky doesnt mean not being afraid we must all be afraid sometimes when we are called upon to fight men or animals who are much stronger and fiercer than we are but when we know that wrong or unjust things are being done to us by people who do these things just because they are stronger then if we fight them in spite of our being afraid that is the real courage on the other hand it isnt brave to force people to fight who we know are much weaker than we are but when god has given us good health and strong arms it is noble to use them to help people who are weaker than we are and to punish the bullies who would take advantage of their weakness thats what it is makes a true gentleman not riches nor titles nor having a tutor instead of a public teacher the little boy who is just and very truthful and who never does anything that he would be ashamed of good people knowing is on the way to be a gentleman whether he lives in a palace or a cottage but if added to these he trains all his faculties to oblige other people to repay him the truth and justice and honour which he gives them then he is a complete gentleman already he broke off to feel me all up and down theres good material here he said very good well use it to counterbalance brute strength thats the fine moral of boxing little man to see that the weak dont go to the wall now shall i confess a secret i love harry harrier pretty equal with you sir hes got the makings of a gentleman my sort in him only no amount of persuasion from me will educate him like a scientific licking from one less than his own size you dont see that perhaps but all the same i look to you to knock him into my fold for me you are the churchs champion richard and you shall gain me a new convert or ill never put faith in the gloves again now come along with me home uncle jenico received us with surprise and some consternation over my appearance nor did the recital of the affray much reassure him still more was he confounded by the rectors frank avowal of his object in approaching him he is a mere child sir said my uncle the childhood shows the man quoted the other to be sure but as he isnt going to be a prize fighter every true christian sir is a prize fighter he champions the right in order to win heaven well where was the right here i regret to have to confess sir in an insulting expression about you which he very properly resented me cried my uncle amazed then suddenly he stumped across to where i stood and patted my shoulder rather tremulously well well he said no doubt im a funny old fellow so you stood up for old uncle jenico dicky his voice shook a little i wriggled and flushed up crimson it was a lie i cried choking and im going to fight him and lick him for it mr sant struck in broughton rules sir i pledge my word eh said my uncle whos broughton and what does he rule i mean said mr sant this little affair shall be conducted strictly according to the regulations of broughton the famous boxer o exclaimed uncle jenico palpably misled by the last word and proportionately relieved o to be sure mufflers you call em i think yes yes said mr sant hastily a contest of science sir no vulgar hammering and he repeated with warm conviction his little dissertation on the true moral courage if richard sir dont assert himself at the outset he ended with i wont answer for his life here remaining endurable perhaps this prospect of our moral banishment clinched the matter with uncle jenico whose attachment to the place was becoming quite morbid he stipulated only that the umpire should stop the fight the moment it might appear i was getting the worst of it more or less satisfied on this point he rubbed his hands and rallied me on being the young gamecock i was ive given some thought myself to a new boxing glove he confessed one with a little gong inside to record the hits you know mr sant lost no time in taking me in hand he fashioned me a little pair of gloves out of some old ones of his own and gave me half an hours exercise with them every day after lessons i am not going to record the process the result was the important thing during all this interval with the single exception of the morning following that of my encounter with harry harrier i was left in peace by the village boys on that morning however i again found myself in the midst of a little mob of them who emboldened by yesterdays sport were come to waylay me after school hours i was not yet so proficient as to regard the situation with equanimity when behold my enemy resolved it for me he appeared suddenly in the midst his knees and elbows in a lively state of agitation one or two fell away protesting their hands caressing their injured parts where be a coomen ar ree expostulated one boy holding his palm to his ear mighty exclaimed the young ruffler baint the road free to none but yourself jarge here be a yoong genlman waiting to pass now they took it as aimed at me and hedged in again he clawed two by the napes of their necks and cracking their heads comfortably together flung both aside his intentions were quite unmistakable and his strength a thing to regard i was painfully conscious of it as i went through the sullen lane the others discomfited made for me but i plucked up courage as i passed to express my gratitude thank you harry i said he was after me in a moment its not agoing to make no differ he whispered fiercely you onderstand that it shant anyhow till after the fight i answered back in his ear and nodded and ran on at last the great day came mr sant in order that my uncle might be saved anxiety and me the necessity of deception had given me no warning until the very moment was on me he had manuvred to hold me a little longer than usual over my lessons and suddenly returned to me after a short absence from the room dick he said harriers waiting for you in the garden my heart gave a twist and for a moment pulled the blood out of my cheeks then i saw mr sant looking at me and was suddenly glowing all over as if after a cold douche for the right dicky he said to win your spurs in christendom remember what ive taught you and keep your head it was all very well to say so with that part of me like a bladder full of hot air but i followed him stoutly trusting to the occasion to inspire me with all the science which for the moment had clean deserted me there was a little plat of lawn at the back very snug and private behind some trees and here we found my adversary waiting in charge of jacob the gardener a grizzled comfortable old fellow in complete christian subjection to his master jacob was to second harry and mr sant me the old fellow grinned and ducked as we appeared there were no other witnesses now said mr sant when i say go go when i call time stop he fell back with the words and we stood facing one another i was utterly bemused at that instant as to the processes by which i had reached this situation i could only grasp the one fact that i was put up to batter if i could which seemed ridiculous this confident taut little figure in the shirt and corduroy smalls and gaiters who held out as if for my inspection two bare brown arms made all of bone and whipcord and that i must proceed to try to do this without any present quarrel but rather the reverse to stimulate me it was so different to the circumstances of that other mad contest i could have laughed i go said mr sant something cracked on my forehead and i fell time cried mr sant he pulled me to my feet get your wits dicky he said i had got them the bladder seemed to have burst and let out all the hot air i was quite cool now and pretty savage over this treatment all right sir i said and i think he understood he kept me simmering however for the regulation three minutes i came up to time now broughtons commendable pupil the first round had been what we call in cricket a trial ball this that followed was the game muscle and a little science against science and a little muscle the brass pot i am happy to say prevailed and sent the earthenware spinning with a crack on its stubborn little nose jacob mopped the vanquished who could hardly be kept still to endure it as for me i was cockahoop crowing inside and out my second laughed and let me go on warning me only that the battle wasnt won it was not indeed our bloods were up and the next round was a hot test of our qualities it was give and take and take and give until lunging under a loose defence harry hit me in the wind and while i was gasping and staggering levelled me to the ground with a blow on my mouth he was mad by now and was rushing to pummel me prostrate as i was when jacob with a howl clutched him and bore him struggling away law ye little warmint cried the old man no more of that harrier said mr sant from where he was kneeling nursing and reviving me or i take my man away to hit one thats down sir thats neither christian nor professional then he whispered in my ear three minutes dicky can you do it else im bound in honour to throw up the sponge there was an agitation in his voice which he tried vainly to control i made a desperate effort and rose as he began to count i felt a little sick and wild but the lesson of over confidence had gone home this time i played warily tiring out my adversary at last the moment came he struck out furiously missed and as he recovered his guard i hit him with all my strength between the eyes he staggered gave a little cry and quite blinded for the moment began to grope aimlessly with his fists noo sir howled old jacob excited i am afraid he was an unsympathetic second noo sirs your time walk in and finish en i wont i cried it isnt fair he cant see trying to mark me by my voice the boy let out a furious blow and as his fist whizzed near me i caught and clutched it in my own harry i said hurriedly lets be friends he tore his hand away stood with his face quivering a moment then all of a sudden fell upon his knees and putting his arm across his eyes began to sob as if his heart were broken a silence and embarrassment fell upon us all then mr sant walked over to the boy and addressed some words to him he turned a deaf ear repulsing him you have fought like a man said the clergyman come take your beating like one the lad started and looked up he could see again now but glimmeringly be the three minnuts past he said im afraid so said the other the boy got to his feet sniffing and without uttering a word began rolling down and buttoning his shirt sleeves theres a good hot dinner waiting for you inside said mr sant come now and do the mans part by it and by us still he would not speak but shook his head sullenly and fetching his coat and cap walked off humoursome humoursome said old jacob let en go for a warmint no said mr sant rather wistfully hes got the stuff in him well have him on our side yet richard chapter x friends at last when i had been washed and my cuts and bruises salved mr sant took me in to dinner having already sent a message to my uncle that i should be late i was horribly stiff with blubber lips and knobs and swellings everywhere yet i would not for the world have missed one pang which my jaws suffered in eating for was not each twinge an earnest to me that i was redeemed in my own eyes the penance was as gratifying as i think a catholics must be after confession and absolution given before we were well finished uncle jenico came in a little flurried and apologetic over his intrusion he had guessed pretty well the reason of my detention and his anxiety would not let him rest his hands trembled as he adjusted his spectacles to look at me and removed and wiped them and put them on again for a second scrutiny so you have conquered he said my poor boy my poor dear boy why i had no idea boxing punished so you should not have minded what they said about me richard a tough old rascal and ready to take it all in the days luck i dont think richard will agree with you sir said mr sant he has won his spurs and a convert i hope he has fought like a gentleman and a christian by george sir it was poor broughton and the norwich butcher over again and you i am sure are as proud of him as i am eh said my uncle half laughing and half crying and then falling suddenly grave if its to inculcate respect the stitch in time you know certainly but i cant help wondering if this is the victor what is the state of the vanquished a state of grace i hope said the clergyman smiling but its a very proper reflection sir and one which i am sure richard will take to heart the reminder nevertheless was not out of place it is well at the feast of triumph to remember who pays the cost i had been self glorifying a little overmuch and here of a sudden was the picture before me of my beaten enemy slinking away to hide his battered face at the very moment that i was crowing to everybody to come and look at mine uncle jenico was the true gentleman among us all and it was he who had been insulted i soon mended of my knocks and the very next day was ruffling it to my lessons with a new self confidence that made nothing of possessing the world dunberry was no longer a siberia to me but a conquered country full of breezy possibilities i should have welcomed the prospect of an attack but no one interfered with me on the contrary awed and covert glances greeted me on my way past the school i dropped a book an obsequious little courtier scurried to pick it up for me the news of the fight had got abroad it was evident and harry was no longer the cock of the walk from this moment with other than the youth of dunberry i am afraid my position was secured i hope i took no base advantage of the knowledge yet i wont say but i might have if mr sant had not been at my back to prevent it dont forget you fought for a principle he would remind me its no manner of christian use to turn out a bully that you may usurp his place to prove to me that boxing was not the whole duty of a gentleman and to school me from presuming on any idea of indulgence because of my victory he rather put the screw on in my education and for a time was something of a martinet on questions of study and discipline i was hurt and a little bit rebellious at first but soon having a fair reason of my own came to recognize his consistency during this time and for some weeks after the fight i saw next to nothing of harry harrier he kept out of my way sulking and grieving though he attended school with phenomenal punctuality too i believe regularly his father i heard from old jacob had been very savage over his beating and had dressed him well for it i was furious when i was told and wanted mr sant to complain to the squire but before he could do so something happened which made any complaint futile a new steward a draco of a man was appointed to the court and one day shortly after his arrival lo and behold there was the gamekeeper handcuffed and being carried off to ipswich gaol in a tax cart by the officers of the law it had been discovered that for years he had been in collusion with a gang of poachers and in the end he had been watched and caught in flagranti delicto his wife followed him to the county town and devoted most of her savings poor woman to his defence but without avail he was convicted and transported and i may as well say at once that that was the end of him so far as his family was concerned for he never turned up again while the trial was pending harry it is not under all the circumstances to be wondered at gave the schoolhouse a wide berth but after his father had been sentenced and their home broken up to the surprise of every one he put in an appearance there again coming dogged and punctual to a task which must have grown nothing less than a perpetual ordeal to him we did not in truth know the strength of will of the desperate humbled little spirit not any of us that is to say but mr sant he had gauged it i am sure and having set his heart on the boys reclamation was watching with an anxious interest the development of the odd little drama which he had helped to engineer he visited of course in virtue of his office the gamekeepers unhappy wife who had been forced to betake herself to a mean little tenement in the village where she eked out the small means remaining to her by washing for the rectory and though as yet the son would hardly notice or be civil to him the mother did not fail to acquaint him with many fond tears of her poor wild little fellows real love and resolution and of the courage which was determining him to train himself to take the place of the breadwinner they had lost all of which i knew made mr sant the more eager to have the lad recognize him for a friend only pride stood in the way for the truth is poor harrys prestige was gone down to zero always owing in some part to the local reputation of his father for a bully and rowdy the removal of that gentleman had finished what my victory had begun and now it was the case of the sick lion the cowardly little jackals who had formerly cringed to him egged on by their more cowardly elders taunted him with his disgrace if he retaliated they overwhelmed him with numbers or ran squealing injured righteousness to appeal against him to their parents his heart swelling in his plucky little breast must often have had a business of it not to let loose the tears but he had an indomitable soul and only time and tact could find the way into it one day mr sant and i when walking together came unnoticed upon the rear of such a scene the victim moved on in front his head hanging a little though he would not force his pace an inch to accommodate his tormentors who followed behind at a safe distance hooting and jeering at him oo stole the pawtridges when did ee last ear from the ulks why dont ee git your mawther to wash your dirty linen ar ree and such like insults they bawled i burned with indignation and was running to retaliate on my enemy by helping him as he had once helped me when mr sant seized me with a determined hand and bent to whisper in my ear he will hate you if you do leave him to fight his own battles as he spoke the little wretches let fly a shower of small missiles and a stone struck the boy smartly on the neck he leapt about at once and came rushing back with clenched fists and a blazing face the mob dispersed before his onset but he cut off one panic stricken unit of it and smote the lubberly coward with a thorny crash into the hedge his eyes looked red his breast was heaving stormily he would have done some evil i think had not mr sant run and put himself between then he backed away without a word but his cheeks were quite white now and the wings of his nostrils going like a little winded horses consternation held the scattered enemy they stood each where he had been halted by the unexpected vision of their rector and me the assaulted one sitting on spikes stuffed his face into his elbow and boo hood from stentorian lungs mr sant smiled with rather an ugly look blubber away derrick he said youve been well served for a dirty act then he scowled abroad are you english boys to kick a downed one not one of you cowards but if he passed this harrier alone would hug his fists in his pockets it is no shame of his but yours to bait him ten to one o what fine courageous fellows but ill have no more of it dye hear ill have no more of it he stamped in a little access of passion and again turned sharply on the fallen get up he said his tone was so peremptory that the boy rose snuffling and wiping his eyes with his cuff it was you threw the stone said mr sant i saw you very well then its got to be one of two things fight or put your tail between your legs and run quick now which is it to be derrick did not move but raised his wail to a pitch so artificially dismal that i had to laugh ah exclaimed mr sant still very grim for his part and snapped himself round he means fight harrier if he did the battle he contemplated was a battle of the spurs clapping his hand to the thorns in him and too frightened now to remember to cry he took to his heels and turning a corner was out of sight in a moment his answer to the resolution claimed for him was so ludicrous that even his little abettors were set off chuckling i was looking across at harry and saw his face too relax and lighten drawn by its expression i walked up to him with my hand held out why wont you harry i said he stared at me but made no response we knew you could look after yourself i went on and and i wasnt going to interfere at least i mean why wont you let us stand up for one another harry i ended with a burst and a blush his face too was very red again and i could see his lips were trembling pride and gratitude were fighting within him for mastery but the former still too hot with recent suffering to surrender remained the more stubborn of the two while my hand was yet held out he turned his back on me on us all and walked off erect i was bitterly hurt and chagrined i felt that i had done the handsome thing by a boor and had been meetly rebuffed for my condescension i came back to mr sant swelling with indignation he understood at a glance give him time dick he said quietly give him time he shall have all the time he likes sir i said before i meddle with him again he did not answer which was perhaps wise and we continued our walk but thenceforth my heart was darkened to my unchivalrous foe and when we passed in the street i ignored him my studied indifference had not however the effect of making him avoid me on the contrary he seemed rather to resume his earlier practice going out of his way to get in mine and strutting by whistling to show his unconsciousness of my neighbourhood yet all the time i knew he was never more in need of a friend mr sants protest followed by a public rebuke in the school had put an end to the active bullying but to compensate themselves for this deprivation his companions had by tacit agreement sent poor harry to perpetual coventry he was disclaimed and excluded from all games and conversation isolated in the midst of the others merriment what this meant to the bright fallen little spirit only lucifer himself perhaps could say and only lucifer himself perhaps so endure with unlowered crest while the iron ate into his soul but in justice to myself i could make no further overtures where my every advance was wilfully misunderstood so the year went its course without any reconciliation between us and early in november fell a hard frost with snow that seemed disposed to stop awaking one morning we saw the whole land locked in white under a stiff leaden canopy as if sea and sky had changed places the desolation of this remote coast winter bound it is impossible to describe we seemed as cut off from the world as esquimaux and uncle jenico who had never conceived such a situation stood aghast before the prospect of a beach ankle deep in snow so we found it the golden sand was all replaced by dazzling silver into which the surf so spotless in summer thrust tongues of a bilious yellow the sea from being sportive with weak stomachs looked sick unto death itself and the wind in ones teeth was like a file sharpening a saw and all this lifelessness cemented itself day by day until it seemed that we could never emerge again from the depths of winter into which we had fallen one afternoon i was loitering very dismal and quite alone as i thought near the foot of dunberry gap when a snowball took me full on the back of the head and knocked my cap off i was stooping to pick it up when another came splosh in my face blinding and half suffocating me i staggered to my feet gasping only to find myself the butt of a couple of snow forts between whose fires i had unconsciously strayed a row of little heads was sprung up on either side and i was being well pounded before i could collect my wits i must premise that at this time my empire was much fallen from its former greatness never having confirmed it by a second achievement it had gradually lost the best of its credit and though i was still respected by the unit there was a psychologic point in the association of units beyond which my reputation was coming to be held cheap i was learning in fact the universal truth that to rest on ones laurels is to resume them in case of emergency in a lamentably squashed condition now with half the breath knocked out of my body and my arm protecting my face i tried to struggle out of the line of fire only to find the opposing forces basely combining to pelt me into helplessness i made some show of retaliating but what was one against twenty in the midst i looked up the gap my one way of retreat and there standing halfway down watching the fray was harry harrier i was smarting all over with rills of melted snow running down my neck and still the bombardment took me without mercy harry i cried come and help me the appeal did at a stroke what months of propitiation would have missed it put him right with himself once more like a young deer he came leaping down stooping and gathering ammunition as he approached the shower ceased on the instant the craven enemy retreated pell mell to its double lines of shelter are you ready sir said harry excitedly git your wind and coom on well drive en out of one o them places and take cover there ourselves he was eagerly gathering and piling the snow as he spoke in a minute i was myself again and burning for reprisals each of us well armed we charged upon the left hand position which seemed the more accessible of the two and carried it by storm against a faint show of resistance the garrison shot out and fled encountering a volley from the opposing force while we peppered it in the rear our victory was complete as we sank back breathed but glowing i looked harry silently in the face and held out my hand for the last time he took it in his own hanging his silly head but the nip he gave it felt like a winchs thats all right then said i its pax between us aint it you old fool he nodded a long silence fell between us and i began to whistle suddenly he looked up shyly but his eyes were quick with curiosity i say he said whats a parryshoot the problem had evidently haunted him ever since i had told him that my uncle had fallen from one well what do you think says i i dunno he answered carelessly thought maybe twas one o them things that shoots the malt refuge out of brewhouses i sniggered with laughter fancy uncle jenico having been shot out of a brewery its an umbrella i said a thing that you jump into the air with off a cliff and come down without hurting yourself mighty he cried all excitement is it reelly lets make one and try it first on that derrick he added with commendable foresight my heart crowed at the idea we discussed it for many minutes in the midst we heard a sound of distant jeering and cautiously raised our heads above the snow rampart the whole body of our enemies was in full retreat and already nearing the top of the gap we were left alone sole inseparable masters of the field it was the happiest omen of what was to be chapter xi mischief of sorts i came in all glowing to mr sant who greeted my good news with a sigh of such relief that one could have thought a nightmare had rolled off his chest we have him he said gleefully you did very well dick better than i could have told you and now hm he fell into a fit of abstraction the fruits of which did not appear till the following day then as i was leaving him after lessons he detained me a moment are you going to meet him he asked yes if he will i answered then he said tell him that if he likes and can obtain his mothers consent he can come here with you for the future instead of going to school i could only breathe a great round o of rapture yes said mr sant between relish and severity i cannot have so promising a spirit warped by a sense of injustice he has grit i must put my foot down he yes tell him i will undertake his education if he is willing i ran off big with the delight of my mission and sure enough met harry loitering near the playstow by the way i should come though he would not let me suppose it was intentional his freckled face flushed as he spied me and he grinned there was already observable towards him an attitude of increased respect on the part of some of his schoolfellows who played near mighty he exclaimed as i accosted him whod ever a thought o meeting you here harry i whispered too eager to get him away to feel any embarrassment come with me ive got something to tell you he came looking both pleased and curious but still with a certain half defiant swagger tell away he said im listening and he began to whistle mr sant i said wants you to chuck up the old school and come and be his pupil with me if you and your mothers willing he was fairly hipped he stopped whistling and rubbed his round nose till it shone then suddenly halted in a quiet place and stared at me was it you axed him that he said no indeed honour bright of course why should i lie you old stoopid he tried to whistle again and broke down i didnt know the depths of the little soul nor what it had endured i dunno he said hesitating and with a curious husky sound in his voice as if it had been i could a brought myself to it now he held out his hand quickly and his eyes were shining ef youll let me be your friend master ill swear to be yours till death do me part and so help me god we shook hands firmly on it only i said im dick to you you know just as you are harry to me ill get used to it in time he answered and so the compact was made and i am sure we had none of us reason to regret it he was a pretty untamed colt at first with a little of the savage lingering about him but he was wonderfully sensitive and intelligent and soon got under mr sants vigorous and manful tuition not only to cultivate the graces of a scholar and the muscles of an athlete but to understand those right principles of a gentleman which are to temper natural combativeness with consideration for others in this respect no doubt his misfortunes had helped to shape him but i am not going to moralise over the result which i dare say not one boy in a thousand coming from such a stock would have effected harry seemed to have inherited all the hardihood with none of the brutality of his father and for the rest we became inseparable chums who so combined were a match for any puling forces the village could bring against us mischief of course we were always in it one of our first escapades was to make a parachute out of uncle jenicos big sun umbrella and having beguiled derrick to the cliff edge by the gap tie his wrists to the handle and push him over we might have killed him only we didnt he fell into a snow drift with no more hurt than to rasp his nose on the broken ice but he smashed the umbrella for which mr sant made us pay with extra lines we scoured the coast together and were for ever forgetting my embargo prowling about the mitre dislodging bits of the ruin and imperilling our precious necks on such occasions rampick was always our self elected policeman watching us and warning us away singly i think we had an awe of this great sinister hulk of a creature though together we flouted him a good deal resenting his interference but he was a pet of mr sants which made any open affront from us difficult harry by virtue of his training knew a heap about animals i am afraid we snared in our time more than one of the squires rabbits fixing loops of copper wire in the runs under the hedgerows the kill went to mrs harrier whose poverty i used for salve to my conscience and whose rather weak fondness accepted the tribute with some nervous deprecation but it was not long before our mighty reverence for mr sant both as a gentleman and a sportsman cured us of this temporary obliquity a poacher gives no law to the game he kills a gentleman does we gave no law ergo we were poachers ergo we were not gentlemen the revelation came upon us one day when our tutor was illustrating some forgotten parable the man of honour said he the gods gentleman dont bet on a certainty or run his fox with a line tied to his tail or kill a disarmed enemy or shoot his pheasant sitting he sports for the glory of the battle the test between skill and skill harry and i looked at one another and then down after lessons he addressed me rather resentfully its all very well for you as was brought up to it what do you mean i answered that you aint going to take the hint if ever i snare another he said growling may i be shot myself and nailed to a barn door well then i said for all my being brought up to it as you call it youre the better gentleman because i was still in two minds about giving it up it was such fun youll have to he said he was grown more loyal even than i to mr sant o shall i i retorted whos going to make me we were both bristling for a moment then harry chuckled guess you wont catch a many without me to help you anyhow he said which was so disgustingly true that i had to laugh in my turn before this moral reformation occurred however we made some thrilling captures one day it was a hare which harry caught in the most wonderful way with his hands alone we were crossing an open space between two copses when he suddenly threw down his hat in the snow bidding me at the same time to take no notice but walk on with him as if unconcerned there were tufts of gorse and withered bracken projecting all over the clearing we advanced briskly a short distance then quickly wheeled and came back making a crooked line for the hat as we neared it harry as swift as thought swerved aside to a patch of red dead fern and bramble and plunging down his hand brought up what looked like a mat of leaves and snow but it was a hare which in that unerring swoop he had clutched behind the poll and before the startled creature could shriek or struggle he had seized its hind legs in his other hand stretched its body and cracked its neck upon his knee i could not have imagined such quickness of eye and action it could only be done he told me in cold weather when the frost gets in the animals brains and makes them stupid they are sort of fascinated by the hat thrown down watching for it to move and when the steps return finding themselves as it were between two fires they can think of nothing but to crouch close i have seen harry bring out rats from a rick in the same way it was just a question of unwincing nerve but i never had the courage to try it myself they say that if one has the resolution to hold ones hand unmoved to a snapping dog the beasts teeth will close on it without inflicting an injury it may be true only the first time i put it to the test will be in boxing gloves a more legitimate poaching of ours but that was later in the spring was on the preserves of a beautiful unfamiliar sea bird which came nesting upon our coasts driven there by storms probably we were on the mitre one day when we saw it fly out from the top of the abbots well and swoop down upon the shore where no one being by it gorged itself on a heap of dead dog fish we immediately fell flat on the cliff edge to watch for its return the broken top of the well was perhaps thirty feet below us but the ground sloping obtusely from where we lay prevented us from seeing far into it presently the bird came back and settled on the rim so that we could mark it plainly it was gull shaped but unlike any of the species we knew white waistcoated yellow beaked and a tender ash colour on the wings a st kildas petrel in fact we came to learn which had likely been driven down from the orkneys it hopped into the well and disappeared mighty said harry its got its nest there i do believe by and by the mother bird showed herself and the fact was virtually settled then there was nothing for it but to climb the well and see harry accomplished it somehow when the village was at dinner and the beach deserted he got up claw and toe the well inclined a little outwards from the land and availing himself of every hole and projection reached the top and sprawled over the edge so that i could see nothing but his legs waving in the air the birds shot out and wheeled screaming about him i heard him utter a cry and then he emerged and descended with a very blank face coming down the last yard or two with a run his hands were barked and bloody and the right one smeared with an orange slime there was one egg he said white and a whopper but it just broke to pieces when i clawed it it was a pity we had not left it alone for as it turned out the bird was a rarity on our coasts and laying as it does only a single egg would not likely outstay so cruel a welcome which indeed proved to be the case and the only reward we got for our venture was the knowledge that the well was choked with sand to near its top a discovery which dissipated for ever some long cherished dreams of ours as to the ineffable secrets it would reveal if once surmounted and looked down into during all this time i am afraid i neglected uncle jenico a good deal he was so sweet and kind he made no complaint but only rejoiced that i had found a companion more suited than he to my years hes a fine boy richard he would say a fine promising boy and if he reconciles you to staying here do you want to leave dunberry uncle then he would look at me wistfully i my dear no no i am content if you are we are doing wonderfully well its a place of really extraordinary possibilities do you know richard i shouldnt be surprised if it turned out to be our promised land after all the extent of coast to be explored makes it a little tiring sometimes but thats a trifle we cant expect to find all tom tiddlers ground in an acre or so can we that should have been a jog to my conscience but youth i fear is selfish a dull days hunt with uncle jenico through the shingle had come to show very blank by contrast with the exciting adventures contrived by harry and me so i kept my deaf side to the calls of duty and uncle jenico pursued his hobby alone during the continuance of the frost he had however to divert his imagination into other channels as the beach was impracticable and really i think the distraction did him no harm being confined much to the house he turned his thoughts to an old invention of his for cleaning chimneys with which he had competed ages ago for a prize offered by a syndicate of anti climbing boy philanthropists i am sure if simplicity and economy counted for anything uncle jenico ought easily to have come out first but it was the usual story of showiness being preferred to plain utility the contrivance was homeliness itself just a huge compressible ball of wool attached through its centre to the middle of a cord of indefinite length and the only objection to it which was after all an extremely idle one was that it required two operators one to stand on the roof and the other on the hearth below but once they were in a position the task was a pastime rather than a labour the top sawyer so to speak lowered one end of the cord weighted down the flue his companion seized it and between them they worked the ball up and down till every particle of soot was dislodged could anything be more obvious and yet the committee rejected it well all i can say is that harry and i proved its efficacy beyond a doubt though of course mrs puddephatt while she benefited by it was sarcastic about an invention which had failed to recommend itself to the particularity of london it may be all right she would say and so may the himage of a piece of fat pork pulled up and down ones throat with a string which i am told is hemployed at sea to encourage eaving at the same time sir i may venture to remark that there are remedies known to londoners to be worse than their diseases uncle jenico in the first instance secretly inveigled fancy maria into helping him in his experiment the parlour fire was extinguished and the worthy girl despatched to the roof through a trap door where she performed her share of the task with such inflexible tenacity that when my uncle tugged at his end of the cord which she had dutifully lowered he pulled her head into the chimney and would have ended by drawing her bodily down i believe if her gasps and chokings reaching him below had not warned him in time then he slackened his hold and commended her excess of loyalty and instructed her further but in the end she descended from the roof an absolute negress and for days afterwards shed soot from her boots and sneezed it from her hair in little clouds that flavoured everything subsequently harry and i were taken into his confidence and made his operators much to our gratification climbing boys indeed it was become a luxury to be a sweep thanks to uncle jenico and the world called him a crank every one but himself might profit by his inventions certainly harry and i did we polished every flue in mrs puddephatts house as clean as a whistle and until we tired of the sport whatever other chimneys in the village the housewives would lay open to us and it was only when we took to angling with the great sooty ball over parapets for unsuspecting faces pausing below that mr sant giving ear to furious complaints stepped in with his authority and put an end to the game so on us black and joyous and inseparable i will let down the act drop of our little stage to raise it on a later development of the drama i set out to record end of part i part ii chapter i the badger it is with an odd sense of nervousness and almost of oppression that i open upon the second act of my story in the first the schoolboy with his shining morning face and serene irresponsibility had it all his own way now an interval of five years having been supposed as the play bills say to elapse the shining morning face shows a little sobered a little greyer in the dawn of manhood like a young moon in the dawn of day we have not eschewed adventure harry and i only the spirit of it in us is beginning to be tempered with a sense of moral obligations we are indulgent to the flippancies of youth but in so far as they do not venture to presume upon our patronage only when alone together do we relax our vigilance in the matter of what is due to ourselves and our extremely incipient moustaches harry in short takes up the tale at sixteen and i at a few months younger the interval had served to shape us i do believe after a manly enough model we might have been oppidans to put an extreme case at eton and had our characters stiffened like cream by whipping and have coursed hares and drunk small beer at the christopher and enjoyed all the other social and educational advantages which according to the evidence put before the late commission reported in are peculiar to this seminary of the gods and not found in its provost such a leader counsellor and noble confidant as little remote dunberry was able to furnish us with in the person of mr sant and this i say in no pharisaic spirit of self satisfaction but simply as a testimony to the qualities of this prince among tutors whom we loved and respected with the best reason in the world not much had figured to us perhaps during these five years except the shapes of romance with which strong young souls can always people a desert we had put on mind and muscle we could run swim fight eat anything that was set before us and want more our excursions were further afield our walks more extended along the road to parnassus we were very fine fellows no doubt in our own opinions and our voices were beginning to growl handsomely harry had for his part developed into a shapely fearless young figure with a good manner of speech and a great attachment to my uncle he had moreover developed a decided bent towards mechanics and went now on two days in the week to a technical school in yokestone making the journey to and from on foot and sleeping each night with a cousin of his mothers who owned a small foundry there and who since the boys proof of himself had taken a practical interest in his welfare the periodic partings were without savour to us had it not been that to them the periodic reunions supplied the salt but no doubt they were helpful in giving us opportunity for a more individually independent growth and certainly during them coke upon littleton for mr sant was training me with an eye to the law secured my less divided attention as to dunberry itself and its familiar figures there was little change to be noted on the one side there was the ripening of the young fruit towards maturity on the other a little whiter growth of lichen on the decaying branches uncle jenico must count among the latter though surely no tree past fruiting ever retained more unimpaired the sweetness of its sap he had collected during this period enough antiquities to furnish out an old rag bone and iron shop and indeed i am afraid the bulk of his stock was not suited to a much more exclusive repository there was little which provided it was gathered from the beach and had once been a part of something living or manufactured he would not give a place in it his veneration for rust was the most artless thing an object had only to be corroded with it to figure in his eyes for an assured antique in this way he amassed great quantities of bolts links sheet iron fragments and other rarities to most of which he assigned a use and period which i am convinced had never been theirs there was for instance a breastplate of the renaissance era which i do believe had never been anything but a dish cover of our own there was an iron skull cap or morion of edward the firsts time which i will swear was nothing but a saucepan without its handle the handle itself indeed being found near the same spot a few days later and catalogued for the head of a boar spear part of a whales under jaw much decayed figured for the prow of a viking ship and divers teeth mostly i think horses for the grinders of prehistoric monsters there were some bronze coins certainly none too many whose value was conjectural and whose legends were largely undecipherable uncle jenico would never submit these the cream of his collection to expert criticism he hugged them as a miser hugs his gold but with a diviner intent i alone was permitted to gloat with him over the hoard theres your jointure dicky he would say look at it accumulating for you without an effort of its own at compound interest theres no trustee like a collector who knows his business you may turn over current money to increase it but the more you leave that alone the better youll realize on it some day the antiquity market is always a rising one every year adds its interest to it we wont touch the principal yet not till you come of age then well put it up my boy then well put it up and you shall eat your dinners and follow in your dear fathers footsteps and have chambers in fountain court itself did he have a real faith in this picture he had a faith in having a faith in it anyhow yet sometimes i could not help thinking he shrunk from that same test of criticism from the conceivable discovery that he had wasted all these years of his life on a fond chimera i am glad that in the end the test was never forced that circumstances came to lay for ever the necessity of it and in a way than which none other could have delighted him better for i believe a realization of the truth would have broken his kind unselfish heart he had not during this time altogether eschewed his former habits and enthusiasms periodic inventions of purely local inspiration marked it he designed a respirator to be lined with porous shavings of driftwood so that the asthmatic merchant might inhale ozone in the thickest fogs of lombard street he planned a boat to be steered from the front by means of a rudder which was merely a jointed elongation of the prow or false beak hinging to the neck like a fishs head and gills a splendid conception seeing how the steersman would be also the look out and the crew aft suffer no more responsibility than passengers in a train other happy notions of his were the luminous angler a hook rubbed with phosphorus for night fishing a scheme for pickling sandhoppers and an uncapsizable boat the buoyant principle whereof was an armour of light iron pipings each tube of which was to be divided into a number of little water tight compartments none of these was ever to my knowledge put to the actual test so pledged is our conservatism to run in a circle the old stern steerer was good enough for our fathers and were we to be more exacting than they who stand to us for all holy prescription no inspired inventor ever yet profited by his inspiration nor did his descendants find that inspiration marketable until it was mellowed to a tradition for which reason uncle jenico had to be content like the magnanimous soul he was with planting for the generations to come he never dreamt now more than i of leaving the village in which circumstance had laid us to take root aliens at first we were become of the soil and bound to it by many ties of interest and affection as to the place itself mr sants hopes of seasonable visitors of whom we had been welcomed for the pioneers were doomed to non fulfilment whether it was its isolation its shocking primitiveness in those days of antimacassars and the social proprieties or perhaps its rather forbidding reputation for inhospitality which kept strangers away i do not know but in any case they came rarely and then only as birds of passage i think it at least quite likely that the third consideration was most operative dunberry before the days of mr sant had borne it must be confessed a sinister notoriety a name for determined and organized smuggling visitors then were neither desired nor welcomed the whole native population or at least with few exceptions forming a lawless confederacy for the disposal of contraband but after the earthquake or what was generally cited for such and by many i am persuaded who knew better though it made no difference in the moral things should have been otherwise when the new rector using its opportunity to reclaim his wayward flock to godliness sought to compensate by legitimate trade for the lost wages of sin but it is easier to cure the itch than to convince others of your patients recovered cleanness and so dunberry reformed had still to suffer the penalty of dunberry unregenerate visitors came not to it and it was in the position of having dropped the carnal substance for the moral shadow and what made it worse was that the excise unpersuaded of its reclamation chose this very penitential time to dump down a coastguard station on the cliffs a mile south and so knocked on the head for ever any possibility of its relapse into the old prosperous condition the blow fell in the second year of our stay and from it dated i think the final demoralisation of the ancient order of which rampick might be considered the prominent expression this man deteriorated thenceforth year by year recognizing i suppose the practical uselessness of his hypocrisy his gradual self revelation was a real grief to mr sant whose worldly common sense was not always proof against his missionary zeal he had the pain to see this cherished convert of his sink into an idle drunken loafer with a heart poisoned with a shapeless black resentment against all whom he chose to consider were in any way responsible for his ruin amongst whom he included for some unaccountable reason my uncle and me and in only less degree the dear clergyman himself but bankruptcy knows no reason at the date at which i reopen my story joel rampick was a shambling degraded evil looking man half crazed between drink and his sense of injury full of suppressed snarlings and mutterings still as of old the watchful spirit of the ruins on the hill still as of old policing harry and me though secretly rabid now in his impotency to control or terrify us still as of old nevertheless a hypocrite in form while he carried his heart on his tattered sleeve and so as a main factor to be in the development of the strange drama to the dark accomplishment of which in this year of our opening manhood i have been reluctantly leading i reintroduce and for the moment leave him it was a wild wet november a season full of tempest and the promise of it when guns would boom beyond the fatal sandbanks and sudden rockets tear the sky when the wives would gather a rich harvest of driftwood coming down in the morning to a prospect of frenzied waters and black spots of wreckage swooping in them like swallows blown about a storm near the end of the month the winds quieted and one afternoon fell dead calm so that harry and i were moved to stroll out after dark to stretch our long unexercised limbs it was so peaceful after the turmoil that to enlarge our sense of convalescence we took the way of the lonely valley and climbed the abbots mitre the moon was in its last quarter and stooping towards its rest in the earth like a bent and wearied old soul an idle drift or two of cloud pursued it trying the effect of a star here and there on its gauze as it loitered and not a sound broke the stillness but the whispering chuckle of the small surf on the shingle below we sat down on a block of stone in the midst of the huge and silent congress of ruin here were ghostly corridors which the sea still mocked with an echo of monkish footsteps pitch black corners where the faint rustle of mortar falling might have been the muttering whisper of the confessional drifts of broken arches colossal shouldered heaven supporting in their time now bowed under the weight of their hanging gardens of ivy shattered windows that were without a purpose like open gates set up in a desert dim and tragic in the moonlight they stood around us a spectral deputation of giants making its unearthly appeal for some human redress or sympathy they seemed to hem us in to throng closer and closer an odd nightmare mood possessed me i shivered and stamped on the ground harry i said with a nervous giggle supposing these smuggler chaps down here ever walk with my very words he started and nipped my arm like a vice look he whispered thickly and pointed out from the blackness of the overturned plinth hard by slipped a grey shadow a thing that might have been a dog but was not o i shuddered falling against my friend lets get away harry at the back here the sound of my voice little though it was appeared to startle the creature it turned paused as if regarding us seemed to be coming our way and vanished again into the glooms from which it had emerged i had had a dreadful moment and so it was with a sense of outrage that i heard harry laugh out as he sprang to his feet o he cried skipping and sniggering before me to see it come so pat and hear his tone change wasnt it beautiful and him not to know a bogey from a badger o master dicky really a badger i echoed awfully then recovered myself and added with a rather agitated laugh well dont pretend you werent startled yourself at first i he exclaimed why you old donkey i brought you up here on purpose on the chance of seeing it bosh i snapped very well he said ill show you its tracks in the mud to morrow if you dont believe me i guessed it was somewhere in the hill and now i know did you i said resentfully then id rather you played the fool with me by day played said he what have i played twas you began with your ghosts and things besides any fool knows that badgers only walk at night he sniggered again then seeing that i was hurt took my arm in his and patted me down its really rather a start though said he i mean the thing being here at all because they live in woods you know but ill tell you what i make of it that it was driven down by those burnings it had been a very hot summer with two fires destroying some acres up in the court woods to get near the water anyhow i spotted its tracks in the soft ground here some days ago and made up my mind to run it to earth well come up to morrow and have a look by daylight we did as he proposed and found amongst the bramble and other vegetable and miscellaneous litter which choked the neighbourhood of the great tumbled mass of masonry indubitable signs of a passage leading to the creatures earth dont say anything about it said harry desisting excited from his examination and well just have a try to dig it out some day wonder if it could tell us anything about the earthquake he was staring at me and i at him harry i whispered thrilling all through supposing theres a way down after all dont you believe it sir said rampicks breathless voice the man had after his customary fashion come softly upon us from some hidden coign of espial his hands were slouched in his pockets and he mumbled a little black clay pipe shaped like a deaths head between his teeth i wouldnt think if i were you he went on fur to pry into the lords secrets let the grave keep its own pervided i may be so bold i wish you wouldnt pry into our secrets mr rampick said harry loftily its got to be rather a nuisance this you know the ex smuggler snatched his pipe from his lips and seemed for an instant as if he were about to dash it to the ground in a fury but he recovered himself and pretended only to be shaking out the ashes before he returned the cutty to his mouth secrets said he why you makes me laugh to talk of having secrets here he broke off restless in a shaking way to get his pipe to draw then turned suddenly upon me youre a genleman sir he said and should know better nor to meddle in things what dont concarn you the lord has putt his seal on this here hill you let it alone if i may make free to be his mouthpiece like ezekiel what was told to warn the evil doers that they come not to grief and die i laughed o you flatter yourself mr rampick i said you arent a bit like ezekiel he stood regarding me half perplexed half malignant for a minute then settled himself down on a stone and smoked away silent his eyes staring and full of a vicious resolution come on dick said harry seeing it obvious that the man meant to outstay us and took my arm and walked me off but well have the badger nevertheless he said when we were out of hearing and in spite of that sot cant make him out can you should have thought hed have welcomed the chance of recovering some of his old brandy tubs chapter ii the great storm which its well known that ope deferred maketh a cat sick said mrs puddephatt with unintentional irreverence referring to my report to my uncle of our late meeting with mr rampick she was by this time quite in the family confidence bless you master richard said she its not the lords secret the mans so keerful of its is hown living all these years on the opes of salvidge from the ill and jealous of hothers steppin hin and anticepting of im uncle jenico laughed youre still as sceptical as ever about the earthquake mrs puddephatt said he now it occurs to me if the hill was as you suppose a rendezvous for smugglers who by some folly entombed themselves therein why wasnt the whole village plunged immediately into mourning for the loss at a blow of so many fathers and brothers mrs puddephatt standing with folded arms and a bleak patient smile awaited his good pleasure to answer hev you adone sir she now demanded dont let me hinterrupt you before youve got it hall hout thank you said uncle jenico a little abashed i think theres nothing more ho said the lady drawing in a sharp breath then let me hexpress at once sir before mores said my hobligation for your supposing as im supposing i admit it was unpardonable answered my uncle with a beaming but rather frightened smile i should have understood of course that you have warrant for your smugglers not my smugglers sir she said begging your pardon faults there may be in my pronounciation but awking and spitting in his langwidge was never yet so far as i know laid to the charge of a londoner my dear soul began uncle jenico but she interrupted him no sir nor to hend the names of his towns with a hoath which it is not permitted to a ladys lips to pollute themselves with huttering o really mrs puddephatt i dont understand said my uncle in despair i dare say not sir went on the inexorable female but you must excuse me if i draw the line at hamster and rotter o said uncle jenico gathering light through the gloom you mean to imply that these smugglers were dutchmen she condescended to smile a little and pursing her lips nodded at him with a very stiff neck bein you see a londoner yourself sir to which a nod is as good as a wink it was dutchmen what landed and stowed the stuff and dunberry what distributed of it they howned to no connection with one another and worked apart which was their safety dunberry bless you would be dreaming in their beds that hinnercent while olland would be stuffing of the ill with contraband honly that rampick was the master sperrit and go between and now you knows the truth about im we both stared at her breathless then said my uncle at last the unfortunate creatures caught up there if caught they were made no widders in dunberry sir she put in decisively god bless me said uncle jenico much agitated then rampick he turned to me dont bait the man dick he said remember whoevers to blame for it hes half crazed by his misfortunes and small wonder when some of us find it difficult to keep our heads in prosperity why dear dear it isnt the part of luck to throw stones and certainly not at a dog in a trap its like enough the poor creatures dangerous i dare say i should be if things had gone against me dont bait him dick give him a wide berth he had always been a little nervous about this fellow and our attitude towards him his appeal was however superfluous the ex smuggler was not attractive and harry and i were certainly never the first to invite collision with him for what with blight and rum and sanctimony which last from being assumed for a disguise had become a half demoniac possession in him he was little better at this day than a smouldering madman nevertheless i tried loyally henceforth to emulate uncle jenicos better christianity by making allowances for the man because of his provocation after all calumny could visit him with no more formidable charge than that of having been a successful smuggler a negative indictment even in these days and perhaps the main impeachment admitted mrs puddephatts cockney perspicacity was not so deadly a detective as she supposed i took mr sant and harry of course into my confidence with regard to our landladys story it was little more than a confirmation to them if that were needed that rampick had been the head and front of the old trade but the dutch part was news to us and nothing less i do believe to mrs puddephatt herself who however she had become acquainted with it had acquired her knowledge recently i am sure or she would not have omitted hitherto to impress us with it in her many allusions to the herthquake the rector for his part had speculated no doubt like my uncle upon the equanimity with which the village had accepted the supposed visitation of god upon a number of its bread winners but had never to this day i think in spite of the respect in which he was held succeeded in getting behind the local esprit de corps which hid the real truth from him now much was explained provided mrs puddephatt had actually been permitted to discover what had been kept from us much that is to say except the nature and cause of the catastrophe and that i supposed we should never find out but there i was mistaken as events will show for destiny having got her puppets at last into position was even now gathering the strings into her hands for the final dance of death in the meanwhile the last month of the year opened upon us with a falling barometer and fresh menace of tempest which it was not long in justifying the little calm had been but a breathing time to enable winter to brace his muscles and fill out his lungs it was on the night of the fifteenth i think that the great storm which followed notable even on those coasts rose to its height the wind came from the north east with a high tide which racing obliquely cut the cliffs like a guillotine the whole village hummed and shook with the roar of it not a chimney but was a screaming gullet into which its breath was sucked like water there were ricks scattered like chaff on the uplands and trees uprooted with mandrake groans of agony god knows too what the quicksands knew that night when the day broke the worst was already over and the sea scattered with the bones of its prey sullenly licking its jaws far on the drifts of the weary sands gaped the ribs of a mammoth it had torn the solitary monument to its rage the rest was matchwood that same night uncle jenico and harry and i were supping at the rectory the occasion is vivid in my memory because of a story which mr sant told us after the meal we had drawn our chairs to the fire and moved perhaps by the unearthly racket overhead were fallen upon talk of the supernatural the house lay so close shut within trees that the booming of the tempest came to us half muffled in its pauses we could even hear the drip from broken gutters treading the drive beneath upon which the dining room windows looked with a sound like stealthy footsteps it brought to his mind said mr sant a legend he had once heard about a werewolf the german vampire these creatures men by day but condemned for their unspeakable crimes to become wolves with the going down of the sun are like nothing mortal it is forbidden to notice to pity to sympathize with them in any way whosoever does yields himself to their thrall one winter evening a peasant woman belated in the snow bound woods was hurrying home with her basket of provisions for the morrow over her arm when she heard a pattering behind her and looking back there was a werewolf following in the hunger of the miserable creatures face she saw an expression which haunted while it terrified her it was faintly suggestive of something or somebody but of what or whom she could not tell yet the lost horror in it moved her in spite of herself her pity mastered her fear she took meat from her basket and threw it back conscious of her secret sin but who will know she thought and i could not sleep without the creature stopped to devour the morsel which enabled the woman to escape and reach her home in safety but all the following day her deed dwelt with her so that towards evening unable to bear her own sole confidence any longer she went down to the lonely church to confess her sin and be absolved of it she rang the little sacristy bell and summoned the solitary confesser he came and behind the bars heard her avowal then as listening to it he turned his face she saw that snap and change in the gloom the eyes rounded the brows puckered and met the jaw shot down and forth before her glaring through the bars was the werewolf of the preceding night it barked and snapped at the grating which divided them then dropped and she heard it issue forth and come pattering round to the side where we were never to know for at that instant weird and unearthly in a pause of the storm there rose a long melancholy bay outside the window we all fell like mutes staring at one another then moved by a single impulse jumped to our feet and made for the front door the wind battled to crush us with it driving us back as we raised the latch and so whipped our eyelashes and flared the lights in the hall that for a minute we could do nothing but when at last we emerged and stood in the drive not a living shape of any sort was to be seen only the tossed bushes and black tree trunks it must have been a wandering dog said mr sant something attracted by the light come in again all of you but we would only re enter to get our coats and caps for the homeward march some growing sense of unbounded licence in the storm awed us i think and drew us like cowed beasts to our lairs as we butted through the darkness a form detached itself from the shadows in a deep part of the lane and followed staggering and hooting in our wake it was rampick blazing drunk and his maniac laugh pursued my uncle and me long after we were housed and shuddering between the sheets chapter iii open sesame i had a vision sometimes of our tight little island lying on the sea like a round of bread and butter on a plate and the angel of the storm amusing himself by biting patterns out of its edges the coast in our part of the world was particularly inviting to him because i suppose it was crumb and not rocky with crust like other parts anyhow he never flew near without setting his teeth in it somewhere and on this occasion to such gluttonous effect that he must have blown himself out before he had fairly settled down to his meal his attack was as short as it was violent for miles north and south the cliffs had been torn and gulped only the birds mapping them from above could have said into what new fantastic outline landmarks were gone and little bays formed where had been promontories here and there a fishermans boat had been licked out of its winter perch that that same angel might play bounce ball with it on the cliffs until it was broken to bits the wreck and flotsam on the shore were indescribable and sad and ugly was the sight of more than one drowned mariner entangled in them i turn my memory gladly from such retrospects to concentrate it upon those features of the havoc which most concern this history waterside folk are a strangely incurious and fatalistic race once having satisfied themselves after a storm that their craft disposed here and there in winter quarters are untouched the changes wrought on their sea front interest them only in so far and so long as those changes mean profitable wreckage when that is all gathered they withdraw again to their winter burrows and winter occupations and leave the foreshore to its natural desolation at least that is what dunberry did after the gale and within a couple of days following it than which no longer was needed it appeared to secure any salvage worth the landing for there is this characteristic of great tempests that from their destructive rage they yield a poorer harvest of whole grain so to speak than do moderate ones the latter maybe deposit some literal pickings in the shape of crates barrels seamens chests etc yet compact the former for the most part mere disjecta membra it followed therefore that when harry and i next visited the beach which as it happened he having been away and i confined to the house with a beastly cold we did not do until the afternoon of the third day succeeding that night of uproar we found we had the whole place virtually to ourselves uncle jenico who from his anxious concern for me had also kept at home during the interval came with us full of suppressed eagerness to glean the torn fields of shingle for relics i think i only realized the self restraint which his affection must have imposed upon him in those two days when i saw the almost childish joy with which he greeted the sight of the weedy litter strewn as far as the eye could reach along the shore why richard he exclaimed rubbing his hands while his spectacles seemed to twinkle again heres a chance indeed its an ill wind that blows nobody poor souls poor souls i feel like robbing the grave to take such advantage of their misery his countenance fell a moment but his mood was not proof against the stupendous prospect the seas a pretty big grave sir said harry you might as well have scruples about digging gold out of the earth seeing were all buried there thats true said uncle jenico with serious delight thats quite true my boy i only hope ive not left it to too late this gave me a little qualm shall i come with you uncle i said no dicky he answered no no no you and harry amuse yourselves as you will i wouldnt deny myself for anything the gratification of the treat im going to bring you by and by its selfish no doubt but but id rather be alone and he hobbled away calling out to us not to let our expectations run too high or he might be defrauded of his opportunity to surprise us hes a real trump said harry i hope you think so dick of course i do i answered rather testily and began to whistle thats all right then said he and now lets explore it was a fine still afternoon with the tide at quiet ebb and a touch of frost in the air the sun low down burned like a winter fire and gleamed with a light of sadness on the ribs of the gaunt wreck lying far away on the weary sands she was visible only at low water at high being completely submerged no one so far as i knew had yet had the curiosity or venturesomeness to row out and investigate the poor castaway it was just plain to see by the aid of glasses that she had broken her back on the drift and that only her stern half remained wedged into the sand but what her name or condition dunberry had not had the energy to inquire we were standing at gaze at the foot of the gap and when uncle jenico went north we in obedience to his wish to be left alone turned our faces down the coast but we had not taken a score or so of steps when we hooted out simultaneously over the sight that was suddenly revealed to us the storm had bolted a great hunk good ten feet through at its thickest of the mitre obliterating the already half effaced step way by which rampick had been wont to ascend and laying bare high up in the cliff a mass of broken masonry from the character of this last it was evident at a glance what had happened the seaward limit to the crypts of the old abbey had been shorn through and the extreme vaulting of that ancient underworld exposed nor was this all the well now thus further isolated from the hill which had once contained it was grown from the washing away of the sand at its base an apparent five feet or so taller and was leaning outwards at a distinctly acuter and more ominous angle with the shore we stood excited a moment then without a word raced to get a closer view the wrack and downfall as we looked up at their traces must have been stupendous yet so great had been the pulverising force of the waves the mighty silt from them except for a few tumbled blocks of stone was all dispersed and distributed about the shore below so that a new cliff face clear of ruin went up in a pretty clean sweep from beach to summit sixty feet above from the lower curve of this where it ran out and down into the sand the well projected not ten feet above us like a little tower of pisa and yet thirty feet higher at a point in the hill face about on a level with the well top gaped the jagged ruin of masonry which the storm had laid bare dick whispered harry dick he was gulping and gripping my arm hard as he stared up supposing we could climb to there and look in yes i choked back i knew what was in his mind and the thought fascinated while it frightened me horribly ive never seen a dutchman he said mrs puddephatt she it would be fun to find out the truth what are they like i dont know i answered shivering they wear lots of breeches i believe but its no good the place is all choked up you can see for yourself there was no apparent entrance that way indeed the contour of the vaulting was roughly discernible it is true but so stopped with mud and dbris as to offer no visible passage besides i went on swallowing fast and trying to escape from the fluttering spell the mere suggestion had laid upon me whether it was an earthquake or gunpowder its all the same it must be just all squash and ruin inside and and the things i stuck feeling that i dare not speculate further harry released my arm and for some time looked down making thoughtful patterns with his foot in the sand well i dont know he said raising his face suddenly but id mighty like to see we were both rather silent for the rest of the afternoon and though we neither of us alluded to the subject for a day or two afterwards it was evident it stood between us we avoided the spot too until one evening a long ramble brought us back by the shore past it then by a common impulse we stopped and stood gaping silent up once more the light from the sinking sun smote level upon the face of the cliff so that it stood out as bright as a grate back its surface quite dried from the tempest reflected no glaze of water the rivulets of mud which had flowed over and sealed the scar of ruin above were hardened like plaster though shrinkage had opened black fissures in them here and there harry softly whistling left me suddenly and with his hands in his pockets toiled indifferently up the slope to the well foot here still whistling he began kicking round the base but in a moment desisted and called to me i went up and he fell upon his knees and set to scraping with his fingers see he said stopping no what i answered why look you bat said he nothing under nothing deeper heres the last bottom course of the thing the foundation stones or im a he checked himself grinning i was going to say dutchman said he and for all we know they may be listening up there o dont be a beast i exclaimed with a wriggle of discomfort he chuckled again well anyhow he said heres the old well just standing on its end like a drain pipe with a tilt to it if we brought spades and dug away underneath on the outside it would fall and on the top of us too but thats a detail wonder the storm didnt finish it dont you must have come pretty near to as he spoke staring up at me he suddenly uttered a soft exclamation and scrambling to his feet pulled at my arm look there he whispered dont move i followed the direction of his hand which was pointing to the scar in the cliff face above i could see nothing hush you old fool he said impatiently keep quiet i did not stir till at the end of a long interval something made me start involuntarily it was a wink a flutter a motion of some sort i knew not what on the hill front did you see whispered harry yes i muttered back what was it he ran down the slope to the sand and i followed at a leap thinking he meant that the cliff was falling but when i saw his face i knew that some excitement other than fear was moving him it was the badger he said turning sharp on me now do you understand what that means perhaps i had a glimmering but i shook my head feebly to repudiate it why he cried reproachfully dicky you gowk if he goes to earth at the top and comes and puts his nose out here what does it mean but that the crypts aint as blocked as we supposed there must be a passage through of course i murmured harry nodded primming his lips well said he why it dont follow that where a badger can go we can it does with me he said shortly an odd little silence fell between us then harry turned away and began to move off whistling at a bound i was after him with a furious red face and seizing his arm had whipped him round im going to try to get into the hill up there i cried if youre afraid to come too stop behind like a coward he stared at me amazed then fell a grinning i never said you were a coward he retorted but you meant it i answered fuming we were bristling actually as on that far off day when we had first come into collision our fists were clenched the backs of our necks tingled it was really a pregnant moment but the good old fellow resolved it and in the best way possible the fire suddenly left his eyes o dick he said what asses we are look here ill tell you i should funk it going up there alone and you wouldnt it seems thats the truth i only wanted to dare you for my own sake o all right i said pocketing my fists and pretty ashamed of myself i kicked the sand about not knowing how to escape the situation gracefully at last i in my turn blurted out what rot this is lets forget it all and just discuss ways and means you really intend to try said harry his face relighting if i die for it now i answered o well he said heaving a profound sigh its simple enough well just climb up there and say open sesame and walk in this little inspiration to identify our adventure with ali babas was quite a happy one not forty dutch smugglers but forty beautiful persian thieves with scimitars and waxed moustaches it tinctured with romance at once the thought of the ugly sights it was possible we might encounter our half fearful design became in a flash of coloured light a tingling conspiracy it was too late of course to attempt anything that evening but the following afternoon was a half holiday with us and quite apt to our purpose in the interval we secured some candles and a box of the friction matches then lately come into use as also privately uncle jenicos geological hammer a sturdy tool with a heavy butt and a long steel pick to balance its head and with these and nothing else whatever but our trust in ourselves we issued forth after a hasty early dinner and no word said to anybody to dare and do we had resolved after consultation to make the attempt from above rather than below because in the first place we should be less likely to attract attention and in the second because a descent of twenty feet appeared easier of accomplishment than a climb of thirty up that slippery glacis so we started unregarded of any one as we supposed by way of the valley and were not long in reaching the brow of the mitre where it overlooked the well and the recent landfall it was all strangely altered here and near the edge risky footing at the best but we stole up cautiously and going upon our stomachs the last yard or two looked down below us at a rather giddy distance projected some spars and ledges of the fractured masonry fortunately however the interval between us and them was not balked by any bulge in the cliff but showed a smooth descent and not too sheer for the essay still it did not do to dwell upon it are you ready i whispered im going down no you arent said harry me first i only answered by crooking my elbow to keep him back dont be a fool he protested we shall break away and both go faster than we want if you arent careful i made no reply but to resist him doggedly till at last with a grunt he let me go and i turned lying flat faced and swung my legs over the precipice o you old brute he said well go easy then and dig your toes in and with that i let go and slid away clawing and scratching like a cat coming down a tree it was just to fasten on and commit ones self to luck which fortunately for me directed my feet to a ledge on which i brought up gasping and spitting out dirt but once secure of my hold and in a state to look about me i was relieved to find that the position was much more possible than it had seemed either from above or below the projecting spits of stonework being more and more pronounced than had showed at a distance i took a minute to get my wind and then called up to harry to follow but he was already on his way i saw him coming at a risky pace and by a slightly divergent course which he had taken to avoid me it would have carried him clear of the ruin altogether had i not at the psychologic moment clapped my hand to the seat of his small clothes and checked his descent o he howled let go i wont i cried dont be an ass stick your foot out here with a desperate effort he managed to wriggle oblique and in a moment we were standing together on the ledge that was give and take he panted like being saved from drowning by a shark cant say your barks worse than your bite i chuckled so that i was near falling off our perch till a sudden thought sobered me supposing after all we cant get in or up or down neither i said dismayed a pretty picture we shall make stuck up here well its too late to think of that now answered harry coolly lend me a hand while i kick he let out on the wall of mud in front which we had hoped was just a mask or screen hiding a cavity behind but his foot only sunk to the ankle in it without effect so there he said we must look for a better place thats all we were standing so far as we could judge about midway up the groining of the vault and right under the apex a little above and to the right of us gaped a small round fissure see said harry excitedly thats the place it dont go perpendicular like the others which means that its sunk away from some support above it hold me now i clutched him the best i could gripping a stone with my other hand and he brought the big hammer from his jacket pocket and poised himself standing high on his toes open sesame says he and struck with all the force he could muster on the soil just under the hole the result made him stagger for he had expected some resistance and there was none the whole top of a mound of silt which stopped the neck it seemed of the decapitated crypts and into the thick base of which he had first struck his foot broke away and fell inwards revealing an aperture already under that one blow large enough for a man to crawl through harry recovering himself quietly repocketed the tool and turned to me his face was a little white but his mouth was set as grim as sin its my turn he said think you can give me a leg up it was no use my disputing as he was on the right side working with infinite caution and difficulty on that perilous eyrie i managed to stoop and getting my hands under one of his feet levered him slowly up while he drew on every projection he could reach until he was able to claw his arms into the hole and hang on now came his voice out muffled and hollow one shove and i drove with the word dig went his feet and knees he sprawled convulsively a moment got hold the mound jerked and sunk a little under him a clatter of dbris went down the cliff face and he was in almost in the same instant his face hot and staring re emerged and then his arms here he panted can you reach not by a couple of feet could i hold tight and catch me i said im going to jump fixing my eyes on him and crouching to the lowest i dared i sprang and he snatched and gripped my wrists now he gasped and instantly the both of us were battling and struggling he to hold me firm and i to get way on and leverage for a minute the issue was doubtful the mound sunk and crumbled still lower i clawed frantically with my toes my legs going like a frogs on a slippery basin but at last i got hold and a little ease to my lungs and so hauling on to the hands held out to me and wriggling up foot by foot was drawn into the opening now much enlarged and crawling through rolled tangled up with harry down a slope into darkness chapter iv the secret in the hill my first impression as i sat up to gather my wits was of awakening from a falling nightmare to the comfortable security of bed and early morning the frantic fears engendered of that fathomless descent were all resolved in laughter i giggled as i recalled them shaking my dusty noddle to get the brains into place in it opposite me i could discern a shadowy figure squatting in a like process of self recovery well old chap i said here we are the sound of my voice clanging in a vaulted space gave me a start o i exclaimed and the monosyllable rolled away into the darkness like a barrel we scrambled up while it was still echoing and catching involuntarily at one another looked fearfully about us at a height of twelve feet or so behind us shone the opening through which we had entered it made a great splotch of light with a dim tail running fanlike from it down the slope by which we had fallen the effect to us standing possessed by gloom was as of our being involved in the tail of a comet so long as we looked that way it dazzled and perplexed us we turned our backs on it then gradually the obscure details of the place gathered coherence and we saw that we were standing in a low vaulted chamber giving at its further end upon a sewer like mouth of blackness dicky said harry in a rather tremulous whisper have you got the candles and lucifers all safe this is p p prime isnt it yes i gulped to either question but i answered without heart being sick to postpone the advance by whatever means for a little dont let me go you old idiot i complained in a panic as he made as if to step forward supposing we lost one another ha harry do you know what i saw under my arm as you p pulled me up outside there no what rampick the b beast scuttling for the gap he must have been watching us again hidden below somewhere this time and like enough now hes making for the cliff overhead harry began chuckling but stopped in a fright to hear himself answered as it were by a patter of little laughing hiccoughs he wont find much he whispered and we neednt be afraid hell follow us down here light a candle dicky for goodness sake there seem to be all sorts of things creeping and rustling my hands shook so that i boggled three good matches in coaxing the wick to take but i would not let harry hold the candle for fear that he might run ahead with it and perhaps in some labyrinth of passages leave me to follow the wrong one the flame caught at last flared with a momentary brilliancy and shrunk to a mere blink it is the common way with candles yet i know nothing more maddening in a nervous emergency and if philosophy sneers over that statement let it ponder and be thankful but take no credit because it had nothing whatever to do with the making of its own temperament at length after a moment of tension indescribable the wicked little tongue stretched and glowed steady and i lifted it high while we glared right and left the cellar in which we found ourselves was or had been till shorn of its seaward end a four square room with norman vaulting crossed flat half hoops of stone going down into the corners it was very small and very low the candle flame as i lifted it blackened the roof and very massive and because of the three very ancient probably it had once been a death chapel under some older foundation than the abbey and connected only as a matter of piety with the newer crypts which to meet it had been tunnelled eastwards in a manner very unusual from beneath the nave but so far as we could see it was quite empty and undamaged by the earthquake or explosion i waved the light to and fro nothing here whispered harry lets get on the black sewer faced us there we knew was our way if for a minute or two we hesitated to follow it by so long was providence our friend for indeed we had never thought to take account of the stale confined gases which for years must have been poisoning these glooms and our delay gave the draught that we had created time to take effect for draught there was though we were unconscious of the significance of it when we saw the flame of our candle draw towards the tunnel but in truth we had forgotten in our excitement all about the badger at last we made a move holding on to one anothers hands like hansel and gretel entering the witchs forest we reached the black mouth of the passage and went in on tiptoe it was arched and high enough in its middle to enable one to walk erect yet not so wide but that harry must drop behind and follow me i sniggered a little to feel him treading nervously on my heels and the sense of laughter was like a tonic if one touch of nature makes the world kin it is surely the touch that tickles one under the fifth rib the passage seemed to run on endlessly just a high stone drain with a floor of hammered earth driving straight into the hill no other diverged from it nor did any ruin block our path and we were beginning to move quite merrily when suddenly the end came in a flight of half a dozen steps going down and at the bottom a great door torn off its hinges and shivered into splinters at the sight we drew back on the very brink and stood gaping and dumbstruck afraid for the moment to proceed dicky said harry staring over my shoulder here comes the tug dont it i did not answer suddenly he dipped under my arm and ran down and terrified at the thought of being left alone i followed him the fragments of the door stood wrenched at any angle but through the black gaps in the wreck flowed the sense of shattered spaces beyond now for it said harry hand me the light when im in and follow yourself i would have lingered yet but he broke from me and fearing to precipitate i knew not what nameless ruin i let him go with only a show of interference he was through in a moment and calling back to me pass the light and come on its all serene and then in an instant i had followed him the draught was still strong enough here to flutter the candle flame so that for a little we could make out nothing of our surroundings but stepping cautiously to one side away from the door we found the light to stand suddenly steady and immediately before our eyes there grew into grotesque and shadowy being a vision of enormous destruction it was again a vaulted chamber we were in but of apparent proportions infinitely greater than the other apparent i say for for two thirds of its extent it was just one unresolvable ruin a great part of the roof had collapsed snapping in its downfall like sticks of celery the squat massive piers which had supported it the walls on either side were bowed to an arch above or swayed drunkenly with colossal knees bent outwards to the further side gaping at us across the havoc a huge blackened rent seemed to invite to nameless horrors beyond and scattered and spattered and spurted from under the fringe of the stony avalanche were staves of casks and fragments of burst chests from which fountains of tea had showered all over the floor we stood awestruck scarce daring to breathe the sense of yet impending disaster the terror of calling it down upon us by a stumble a false step kept us as still as mice before us a path went clear round the ruin to another broken archway and yet remoter vaults but by this time my curiosity was become something less than a negative quantity harry i whispered at last almost querulously weve seen enough im going back his face looked into mine like a little ghosts im not he said but i dont want you to come light me another bit of candle from yours and stay here while i go and explore weve found out nothing yet you know i am ashamed to say i let him go only imploring him to return soon to be satisfied with a look he did not answer but stole off resolutely with his bit of a torch and it was with a feeling of agony that i saw him disappear through the opening it is a question with psychologists how much one can dream in a second i will answer for the eternity of nightmare i suffered during those few moments of harrys absence he could hardly in point of fact have set foot in the further chamber when a strange little cry from him made me start violently and immediately as if in response there sprang into voice near me a step a rustle the menace of a coming roar and i screamed out and fled towards my friend the crash answered behind me as i ran and a film of dust followed half blinded and deafened i almost fell at harrys feet as he met me we clutched one another convulsively and for a minute could not speak the concussion was succeeded by an appalling silence presently he was staring over my shoulder swaying his light to and fro dick he went muttering in my ear dick dick dick the roof has fallen down by the door and blocked our way back horror took me of a heap i could only bite into harrys arm up and down with my fingers dumbly entreating him to do something to save us from going crazy o why did we come i moaned at last why didnt you come when i asked you what good would that have been he said miserably if wed been caught and squashed if he could not see the way to save he could to make a man of me he was the first to return to his sturdy self it struck me like sacrilege to hear him suddenly emit a faint little laugh o dont i said its too awful what is he answered look here dick were just fools thats all there must be a way out somewhere wed forgotten what the badger showed us in an instant at his words i had leapt to the ultimate pole of hope o harry i said you good old fellow to think of it why of course there must be if only we could wait a bit he interrupted me youll have to make up your mind to go on ill go anywhere i said to get safe out of this o dont stop any moment may bring down some more of it i was wriggling and sweating in a perfect agony over his hesitation all right he said pull a long breath and prepare yourself for what the truth came upon me in a flash i fell back panting at him harry theyre there he nodded yes theyre there if you like to shut your eyes ill lead you past but he had shamed me once no i said with a catch in my voice if you stood it so can i go on quick are they are they very we were in the further vault before i could shape my question and i took one glance and shrieked and shrunk back under the wall and so in the very act at a leap the horror was gone why i cannot tell the problem is again for the psychologists all i know is that as i cried out the sickness left me a spring of some human sympathy gushed up in my heart and expelled it these pitiful remnants seemed to greet us as with a wistful hail of comradeship they were ugly disjointed ghastly enough in all conscience but they appealed as from the lost to the lost and seeing them their quiet sad decay i no longer feared them as i had feared them unseen who might swear indeed that our own bones would not mingle with these others presently they were dust of our dust in the great commonwealth of death if i had been a desert castaway lying down to die beside some parched human skeleton i could not better have testified to my sense of the sorrow that makes us kin than i did now in my changed emotions yet indeed the scene was a very awful one near the whole of the further side of the crypt had collapsed making of the place a huge cave like mouth stuck with blackened splinters of teeth and gorged to the throttle with a litter of human remains they lay scattered all over the vast jaw of it chewed dismembered scarce one to be identified in its entirety here it might be a red capped skull with a naked brown cutlass tilted across its teeth here a limbless body horribly suggestive in its crumbling stumps of a mangled doll dribbling sawdust here something whole but for its head crooking its fingers into the dusty scalp of a comrade from whom the legs had been torn they may have counted to near a dozen in all if one had had the stomach to tally the flannel caps and brass buttoned jackets and disjointed slops but ten or twenty the moral was the same here at the crook of a finger was the whole life of the hill blown into fragments and the legend of the earthquake laid i understood that plain enough before harrys low excited voice sounded over my shoulder come away dick look there dont you see how it happened he drew me back and we stood figures of tragedy flashing the light from our candle ends into dark corners in all the hideous mlange there were two details unmistakable in their significance to our right lying front downwards with its face smashed into the floor and its legs caught into the closing throat of the vault was a little flattened blue coated figure its hands flung out and the left yet closed upon the butt of a pistol to our left bolt upright against the wall through which the great rent had been blown into the adjoining crypt sat a thing grotesque almost beyond naming it wore with a little air of sagging weariness a seamans common jersey and good white ducks and shoes with shining buckles and its right elbow was crooked and the hand beneath rested with a sort of exhausted jauntiness on its bent right knee in all of which there was wonder but no indecency had it not been that above the thing had no head nor any left arm but a stump which stood oddly upraised from its shoulder and somehow one knew that these two were correlative in the tragedy and somehow responsible for the human scatteration between them for the bright gleams and splotches of colour which budded from the ancient soot of the holocaust for these gaudy half perished weed heaps scoring the garden of death do you see urged harry again i sighed and shook my head not meaning ignorance but simply overwhelmed under the weight of my own conclusions why he whispered in an awestruck voice that that there was reaching up for the ammunition the the armoury in the wall where they kept their powder and things and as he opened the cupboard the other fired his pistol across the bullet must have missed who it was meant for and gone into a powder barrel as he spoke one of the lights sputtered and went dim and he caught suddenly at me come away he cried why dont you come we havent candles and to spare his words reawoke me instantly to the unresolved horror of our situation im coming i answered tremulously which way harry dont go without me we stumbled a few blind paces dazzled again for the nonce look here he said we must economize these it wont do to waste our lights instantly in a panic i blew out my candle and simultaneously he blew out his thus was illustrated the weakness of generalities and correspondingly the value as you shall see of accidents we were plunged on the breath into subterranean night lapped in lead and buried beyond hope of release at least so it seemed for the moment and moments make the sum of time we stood rigid paralysed too dumb stricken for speech or movement and in that pass if you will believe me the most unearthly horror of a voice hard by came to complete our demoralization it rose between a hiss and bark a swinish indescribable thing that tailed off into a bubbling snarl and i thought it was the dead man caught by the legs struggling to rise and get at us i could not have survived and kept my reason i think had not harry at this instant scattered all shadows with a jubilant shout daylight look up there dicky weve found the way i shook with the cry and raised my despairing eyes sure enough at a good height before and above us a gleam of blessed dawn filtered down through the superincumbent soil the accident of darkness had revealed it to us so soon as our pupils had forgotten the false glare of the candles o harry i cried half hysterical o harry what was that noise and he laughed out light up again you old funk it was the best friend in the world to us amazed without understanding i tremblingly rekindled the candle and there right before us was a flight of stone steps going up the ancient entrance to the crypts and risen bristling from his bed of straw and sticks at the foot of it was our ally our preserver our most noble and honoured the badger he was a surly auxiliary resentful for his broken slumber he stood setting at us and bubbling and showing his teeth as cross a little cerberus as ever divided his duty between guarding the way down and keeping damned souls from escaping harry softly pulled the geological hammer from his pocket dont i gasped you mustnt he saved us im not going to attack said harry but i must defend if he makes a rush try a bite of him first if youre doubtful i tell you if he once fastens on youll have to take him up with you keeping close together and our eyes on the little grey gentleman we edged gingerly round towards the foot of the flight fortunately as we advanced he withdrew coming behind us in a circle go up first whispered harry while i keep the rear holding the candle to light him i went backwards up the steps until my head touched the canopy of soil and ruin which blocked their exit and then backwards harry followed me the badger snuffed and gurgled pointing his snout at us but not offering to follow now said harry turning round for the way it was a narrow one as it first offered a mere beast earth driven down between chance interstices in the ruins above to meet the stair head but all the time while we wrought at to enlarge it the sweet light was stretched to us to comfort and inspire and the smell of liberty came down more and more in draughts like wine as if harry with his strenuous hammer were tapping the very reservoir of day the only fear was that striking carelessly he might loosen some poised mass and bury us under an avalanche of stone but luckily both sunk vault and tumbled ruin had so well adjusted between them the balance of collapse that our puny grubbing was all insufficient to disturb it for which thank god and tenfold for that glorious moment when struggling and pushing up by way of the last of the littered steps we shouldered and tore ourselves through into the mid thicket of brambles by the fallen plinth and felt the light of day broken by the branches burst over us like a salvo of resplendent rockets chapter v a reappearance on the day following that of our adventure harry was due at yokestone i had arranged to walk part of the way with him for we had much and momentous matter to discuss our discovery and the responsibility moral and legal which it entailed upon us to wit but to my disturbance the morning found uncle jenico knocked up with a chill and the dear souls hope that i would stay to keep him company was so patent that i had not the heart to disoblige him i just took an opportunity to run out and tell harry i could not come and to re decide with him upon postponing all action until we could consider the matter in its every bearing and then returned very much depressed i must own to my duty i dont know if any suspicion of the past any premonition as to the future was operating in the old mans mind pure spirits one must think must be strangely sensitive to any disturbance in their moral atmosphere he was certainly oddly solicitous about me wistfully attentive loth that i should leave him and for my sake not his own but after dinner as luck would have it he fell asleep in his chair and restless beyond endurance i took the chance to go for a stroll once outside the door i hesitated i had not yet slept soundly or exhaustively enough to shake off all the horror of our late experience i dreaded to go by the hill i dreaded to go by the beach but at last the prospective quiet of the latter drew me and i turned my face seawards i had expected to find the shore deserted and so reaching the cliff edge was put out a little to see a figure that of a stranger already down there before me it went to and fro this figure on the fringe of the surf thoughtfully its head bent its hands clasped behind its back a lean small old man it seemed but i observed it with unspeculative eyes because of my pondering all the time abstractedly and rather dismally on the events of yesterday we had not canvassed our adventure much as yet harry and i the shock and the shame of it the body and brain weariness had disinclined us during our walk home to comment on a very frightening experience out of the reach of whose shadow we could not escape for all our hurrying morning indeed found it still with us like a motionless fog which however we should have endeavoured to dissipate by the breath of frank discussion had not uncle jenicos illness supervened in consequence of which i had to face the rather depressing prospect of enduring for a whole day and night the burden of unrelieved silence still about one thing we had been agreed that we must weigh all the pros and cons before deciding to suppress or confess our discovery at first i had been for telling mr sant everything the moment he returned for he was away in london as it chanced on a short visit but harry had at once vetoed the idea it wouldnt be fair to foist all the responsibility on him he had said emphatically being a parson hed be bound to call in the law and if he did that his influence here would be lost and you might burst your cheeks trying to whistle it back who knows whod be found to be mixed up in the business if once we talked most of the village likely and were not going to do anything to force him into becoming unpopular and losing what hes been years in getting but mrs puddephatt i had complained feebly said the village had nothing to do with it nonsense harry had answered she didnt neither she said that dunberry and the dutchmen worked separate with rampick for go between well i had still protested isnt that much the same much the same you gaby he had cried o yes of course much the same as if two engine wheels connected by a rod turned up their noses about knowing one another the technical inspiration of his simile had thereupon surprised him into a grin and me even into a dismally funny attempt at a retort well they would move in different circles you know but well sleep on it thats the best and thrash it out between us to morrow that however as i have explained we were debarred from doing and now there was nothing for me but to possess my troubled soul in patience until harrys return in uncle jenico we had neither of us thought for a moment of confiding some instinctive sense of his lack of grasp of his unpractical weakness prevented us we would not confound or agitate the dear old fellow and so here in the result i was solitarily and tragically cogitating our problem on the cliff edge we had indeed already come to one conclusion too obvious for dispute the secret entrance to the smugglers lair had been patently near the spot whence we had emerged and the significance of the now obliterated cliff path was thus revealed those however were points which only concerned indirectly the main sources of our confusion which sources were necessarily the nature of the tragedy and rampicks presumptive connection with it there lay the deep core of the shadow the stress of the moral obligations our reckless adventure had imposed upon us we had opened the forbidden chamber and our fingers were bloody was it murder in short and if so was rampick an accessory and if so were we also become accessories i started at the thought and went hurriedly down the gap impelled by a sudden vision it took the form of a tax cart and a handcuffed man in it being carried off to ipswich gaol i felt the cold grip of the iron on my own wrists and had to thrust my hands deep into my breeches pockets for some familiar reassurance of warmth the stranger still paced the sands a mechanic irritating figure now noticing my advent he stopped to regard me his hands behind his back the wind gently undulating his coat tails going northwards i should come under the rake of his eyes my nerves were on the jump i flounced peevishly and went down the coast till come opposite the scene of our yesterdays escapade i stopped involuntarily and stared up i had not intended to i could master the inclination no more than i could the morbid concentration of my thoughts they were drawn like smoke into that black gash high up in the cliff it was not very noticeable even now another storm any hurricane of rain might seal it once more and close the evidence of our passage thereby why let any thought of our responsibility to it vex us our enterprise had been a purely private one and like a blow came the memory of rampicks cognisance of it of my vision of him hurrying agitated for the gap as i was drawn in he had seen us enter possibly emerge he must at least suspect us of having made some sort of discovery and his knowledge of our knowledge was the terror i still stared up if it was really murder then and this man an accessory he might have been and yet none know the truth of his guilt but himself grant it a fact that the local and foreign gangs had worked apart had he not been according to the same authority their connecting link what more likely then that he alone of all alive should be informed of the real nature of the act which at a stroke had shattered his connection it would account for his eternal haunting of the neighbourhood for his terror lest some one exploring too far should unearth his secret if guilty secret it were and what proof of that why none that was direct no proof of anything not of murder certainly and yet i was as sure as if my soul had witnessed it that murder in deed or intention had been committed it was the position the settlement of the bodies flung down with all that atmosphere of deadly suggestion i felt that i could restore the scene as sculptors restore a statue from a few significant fragments that the man under the stone had been attacked and had fired in a desperate self defence accidentally sending all to perdition i had no doubt he might have been a spy a deposed chief his clothing seemed to pronounce him above the order of the rest he might have been one of or other than themselves he had precipitated a greater tragedy in trying to avert a lesser of that i was sure and rampick it all resolved upon him this doubt this haunting stress of conscience all concentrated itself upon the wretched degraded creature in the tissue of whose story our destiny had entangled us i stirred and gave a little groan ha exclaimed a voice at my elbow with a shock i jerked round and there was the stranger of the sands come softly up and intently scrutinising me i felt unreasoningly ashamed as if caught in some self soliloquy my face went like fire what do you i was beginning loud enough and on the instant bit my teeth on the cry and stood gaping i could feel my jaw slackening idiotically minute by minute it seemed to me we stood silent there regarding one another mr pilbrow i whispered at last it all came back to me across that shining gulf of years i had forded the valley in the mean time descending into deep glens and unremembering woods distancing for ever as i had supposed the landmarks of childhood and lo climbing the further side and looking back here was the past quite close for the valley had been but a little fairy cleft after all and all the time the memory of old things had been waiting there for me to resume them six years with their fulness of growth and interest stood between me and this man yet i saw and knew him as if the interval were but a span the story of him the tragedy of my own connection with it became in this moment the instant thing with me bridging the abysmal lapse between he was not much changed it is true the face was the same haunting unearthly mask which had hung up before me in the court a gurgoyle i had called it and still the stony inhumanity of it was the first thing to impress me it was older only and more scarred by wind and weather the drench of unhealing waters had streaked its forehead and darkened the pits of its eyes but with no other result than to emphasize the fire in them and intensify the loneliness of the lost soul they windowed i gave a little foolish fluttering laugh so you remember me he said yes i answered but how do you know me that was the wonder indeed medusa might not change to perseus as perseus to medusa were you looking for me i asked did you know i was living here he shook his head slightly no more young sir than i know the ultimate goal of my destiny it suddenly occurred to me that after all he had said nothing to associate me with any memory of his own i blushed like a fool and stammered out i suppose you arent mistaking he put up his hand to interrupt me your father gave his life for me sir not a shadowed feature not a transmitted gesture of his but i should feel myself cursed for failing to identify if i lived to the age of methuselah you are master richard bowen you will hardly deny it i think i giggled again more foolish than ever no i wont i said and have you yet found abel mr pilbrow now in a wonderful way my ingenuous question wrought a sudden transformation in the man as once before his hand swept the hard evil from his eyes and when those looked at me again they were as soft as a weary womans the change was infinitely pathetic illuminating and in the light of it i seemed to see for the first time how worn was this poor creature how tired and woeful and how perhaps he wore his outlawry for a mask if i doubted before could i doubt now he cried staunch and unspoiled by the years and how could it be otherwise with his son he had seized my hands in his and embarrassed as i was his words moved me to a strange understanding mr pilbrow i cried as i had cried those long years before he said you did not do it he gazed at me rapturously a moment then fell to urging me to walk with him come he cried i must move or i shall be a woman ask me ask me everything this accident this destiny this heart filling spring in the desert no i have not found abel my friend my dear friend though i have never ceased to seek him like the spectral dog i am i thought of the werewolf of mr sants story so damned so abhorrent so pitiful appeared this grey shadow moving at my side he put his arm within mine and hurried me up and down the desolate beach the grinding of the sea seemed to hush itself the drooping pall of sky to rise aloof from us i was full of excitement and agitation carried altogether without the oppression of the thoughts which had been vexing me ask he cried feverishly pressing my arm give me the chance to unburden my heart to my one true friend i do believe god help me in all the world i have not found abel richard ah may i call you richard i have not found abel though through these long years i have never ceased to hunt him his shadow some sound of his voice some track of his footsteps to right yourself with the world i asked let it fall from me the vampire he cried contemptuously you are all the world i care as your father was before you it is not abel i want richard it is the secret he carried away with him the secret or the clue to it which i have maddened after pursuing it the wicket friars lantern down the long mire of these coasts secret i said wondering what secret the book he answered snapped rather i turned and stared at him as we walked you mean the book that that you fought about he nodded why i sniggered incredulous was it worth all this he did not resent my youthful irony met it with a solemn self deprecation in fact god knows dear boy he said this and more i thought once now richard forbear to indulge a lust till it masters you i have damned myself like the wandering jew i have no rest in rest the quest has become an obsession a craze which not even the discovery of the treasure itself could i believe appease phew i whistled soft and amazed a treasure was it yes he said and somewhere on these coasts i think you said somewhere on these east coasts i stopped in sheer excitement i dont wonder they are choke full of of things and have you been tramping them ever since i saw you last on and off up and down to and fro it must have been tiring and and a bit expensive he smacked his hand to his breast there is a hundred or two left here yet equity you remember your friends words equity is justice you got your thousand pounds i got my thousand pounds a longish silence fell between us mr pilbrow i said at last what has brought you here destiny he answered at once yours and mine it was quite accidental this meeting as the world would consider it quite well i said after a pause it is very wonderful and most of all your knowing me again i i hope you will be here a day or two i must be going home he looked at me with his strange wolfs eyes i only arrived last night he said you live here but of course i live here have lived ever since that time with my guardian he started back with a gesture of repulsion not that man that crow that quayle i laughed he had no sense of humour in all my knowledge of him i never knew him even to smile o dear no i said a very different person my uncle mr paxton he could not be too different to satisfy me as your guardian he responded grimly then his face softened and he took my hands in his so long as i stay he said sorrowfully you will let me see you sometimes now at that my heart melted to him he was so fierce so vicious to the rest of the world it was a certain glory to be his chosen wont you come and see my uncle i said he is at home not very well he knows all about that trial mr pilbrow and and he loved my father dearly i believe there were tears sprung to his eyes i turned away abashed does he love you he asked low he lives for me i think then he said we shall have that sympathy in common and i will risk it all the way back i chattered to him of my life since we had last met he had been so associated with my fathers end i could not shake off the impression that we were old friends he listened intently sharing in all my sympathies grinding his teeth over my little local misfortunes and when we reached our door he took my hand again before entering and said in a full voice thy people shall be my people and thy god my god chapter vi an odd compact age that forgets its yesterdays company often puts one to shame in the memories of long ago i had pondered the problem even while proposing it of joshuas introduction to my uncle and behold the dear soul recognized his guest at the first mention his name was associated indirectly it is true with a momentous decision in his own life yet even so well one was not wont to look upon uncle jenicos memory as the active partner in his constitution it saved me some perplexity i had left joshua by his own request in the porch while i went to prepare my relative who i found much refreshed by his sleep and to whom i briefly recapitulated the tale of my rally with this old client as i might call him bring him in by all means he said adjusting his spectacles and then beaming at me through them poor soul poor fellow to have suffered all these years under the stigma of an unfounded slander he spoke with a new awakened loudness the door was close at hand the visitor heard in a moment he came striding in hat in hand his eyes glittering mr paxton he said mr paxton you are worthy to be this dear lads guardian i can say no more the two men shook hands with a full understanding it seemed and a pregnant minute ticked itself out between them you come off a long journey asked my uncle at the end off a long journey sir a journey of six years i had hardly expected to find this haven by the way i hardly know now what it means yet fate grant it has a meaning you are making a considerable stay if i have not lost the faculty to rest i dont know i am all confounded at present he is seeking for a treasure hidden on these coasts i put in and i could have put in nothing apter my uncle kindled a treasure he cried why so am i mr pilbrow only i gather i have the advantage of you in having already collected a part of mine and did you read of yours too in morant morant sir said the bookseller no his name was victor carolus victor he checked himself instantly jealously he had been carried away emotionally i think over his reception but in the same breath his reserve was gone you shall have the whole story from me he said but not now give me time to order my thoughts to realize what this encounter means to me certainly said my uncle kindly and being all openness and simplicity himself he proceeded to relate to our visitor the entire history of our sojourn in dunberry and of the events and prospects which had brought us there the result has justified my utmost hopes he ended with enthusiastically and then cast a sudden wistful look at me it is something in an otherwise empty life mr pilbrow to have this object in accumulating heaven has seen fit sir to deny me the blessing of a family lest by my improvidence i turned it into a curse but it has compensated with the left hand while it withheld the right what prouder trust to have committed to one than the welfare of the child of him who died to prove the truth the visitor stepped back shading his eyes with his hand you rebuke me sir he said in a stifled voice you teach me is this the meaning the atonement if i too might so earn quittance of this curse of emptiness the child of him who died to prove the truth my god my god to bequeath to him the fruits of this so wretched quest to turn the curse into a blessing he advanced and seized my uncles hand with a strenuous entreaty let me be joint trustee with you by that sacred life laid down for mine i have a right if i could so convert this evil to enrich his son so perhaps to earn rest my uncle was distinctly snuffling he took off his spectacles and wiped them and put them on again tremulously so be it mr pilbrow he said we have been two selfish souls perhaps we will win our redemption through richard thus was i made the inheritor of phantom fortunes i felt quite inclined to put on airs as the sole legatee to a vast atmospheric estate mr pilbrow even came to claim me with some show of kind judicial authority as if the law had appointed him my part guardian but that was by and by now he uttered a sound as if his emotions had been too much for him and stepped back i must go he said you will excuse me this wonder this kindness i am unused it overwhelms me i must rest the body even if the brain works you will let me come and see you again but why not accept a began my uncle no no he interrupted him gasping i understand your generosity sir i have stood i can stand the rack there are limits to my endurance of benignity such human consideration i have a good bed at the flask i entreat you to let me go to he left hurriedly i would have accompanied him but uncle jenico with a better delicacy detained me the moment the door slammed on him he smacked one hand decisively in the palm of the other that man a murderer he cried richard i wish your mr quayle no worser fate than to die in refuting such another calumny chapter vii facilis descensus averni i had forgotten all our late troubles in this wonderful encounter aarons snake had swallowed the others this peaked wintry little ghost out of the past starved and frost bitten and shabby as it looked had yet a strange suggestion of vicious force about it which inasmuch as it seemed sworn for good or evil to my service comforted me unconsciously in the sense of fear and helplessness which had got me in grip somehow rampick seemed less formidable my feeling of bondage to an ugly responsibility less acute in the knowledge of this new acrid ally but beyond this there was curiosity still breathing wide eyed curiosity to know what enduring mystery yet held the footsteps of that ancient tale of the king versus joshua pilbrow i had learned something had had my adventure tooth tickled with a taste of the truth it had whetted my hunger for more had tantalized me with that sharpest spur to youthful appetite the dream of hidden treasure when would joshua serve up the whole dish or would he ever it seemed incredible that a man who had pursued such a secret morose and self contained for six years could yield it at last to a sentiment yet he had promised and though i sickened of the delay i must not dare to risk making that eternal by over precipitation in the meantime as there could be no harm in the attentions natural to hospitality i walked over to the flask inn after breakfast the following morning to see how our visitor had slept it was within three or four days of christmas and sharp beautiful weather i have always since associated the deadliest scheming of fate with such tranquillity the robin like a tiny phnix burned singing on a spray there was a glaze of rime on the ground and the sweetest coldness to take into the lungs the ringers were already practising their carols the ruddiness of the holly was reflected in the genial cheeks of the wives the prospect of holiday and fat fare smiled from every door one had thought that the village like its geese had been gutted of the last foulness and that nature beamed approval alas it is not the blackest thought that rides the storm nature like the man may smile and smile and be a villain the younger miss fleming had made herself a sad misalliance running away with the ostler and coming to grief and indigence but her fate had wrought no impression on her sister who remained as pert and coquettish as ever and wore the same gaudy finery and shoes down at heel she always rather courted me because of harry of whom she was gigglingly enamoured and who detested her lork mr dicky she said when i came in is the old gentleman a friend of yours im sure id have give him every attention if id known she was glancing fitfully all the time she spoke at a little lozenge of looking glass which stood on the bar rack whatever you could have spared from that tilly i said im sure im much obliged to you o get along she protested youre always poking your fun at me and i made my way upstairs as directed to number seven i found joshua not yet out of bed when i entered to his summons he sat up to greet me like lazarus new risen a wasted corpse like little figure white and grim and unshorn but his face lighted rapturously at sight of me it was no dream then he said and lay back again with a very gentle expression i came and stood over him and he nodded to me richard i shall lie abed to day this passion of luxury after the toil most restful most wonderful yet the sickness is not out of my bones you will do very well i said when you are rested we must show you all there is of the place the local lions you know to night it is a feast of lanterns rather fun do you think you could manage it and between question and answer he learned all about mr sant and harry and what remained untold of our simple history it might have been hume to him so profound an attention he gave to it i shall like that harry he said at the end and the sensible clergyman yes i will come to the feast if you can find me a lantern after arranging to fetch him at a given hour i left him to his trance of rest he told me no more of his story i had hardly expected he would yet i retreated in an itch of half injured excitement ah if i could have foreseen under what circumstances the revelation was to come to me i would have sworn a compact of eternal silence with him and baffled fate that morning harry returned from yokestone and i walked a mile to meet him he was near as excited as i over joshuas coming he knew all about him of course we had no secrets from one another what does he look like he said ive never seen an acquitted murderer joshua had shaved the gallows he was not the rose but he had lived near it i cant say he looks like everybody else i said because he doesnt but his nose is in the middle of his face by and by we fell to our long postponed discussion of the great adventure and its moral ive been thinking said harry that perhaps after all well tell sant o you may snigger he said but supposing anything were to happen to us why whats going to happen to us i dont know one can never tell he spoke quite sombrely it wouldnt be right would it to carry that secret to the grave especially especially what why i was going to say especially if we thought we were going to be sent there by some one on purpose to keep it look here harry i exploded i wish youd speak plain and not hint and nudge and set a fellow jumping who do you mean say out rampick then i walked on staring at the road he had but given actuality to a rather haunting spectre of my own you think hell be wanting to shut our mouths i said low i think yes he saw us go in and well look here dick whys he been watching there all these years unless out of fear that some such thing might happen ah youve thought the same yourself i see it looks black against him in my opinion and hes half crazed we two ought to be a match for him suppose he took us separate hes strong as the devil still i tell you im not afraid but i dont want to be tipped over a cliff or have a stone fall on me and mother be left to think i didnt take care of my life for her sake very well well tell sant then i said graciously conceding the point with much private relief then the sooner the better said harry ive thought it all out since yesterday and concluded that not to tell him would be to make him out less of a man than we are supposing anything were to happen to us and some chance brought to his knowing after all what wed died to keep from him a pretty opinion hed think we had of him and a pretty ghost to haunt his conscience to know that he might have saved us the sooner the better i say all right only he wont be back till this evening no more he will very well what do you say then to filling up the time by going there again i actually stumbled as if he had tripped me harry i had clutched hold of him to stop him and we stood face to face you aint afraid he asked afraid im sick at the very thought o thats rot weve seen the worst and got over it have we weve seen enough anyhow to serve me for a lifetime dont you bother then ill go by myself you shant i tell you shant i well see what do you want to go for to find out whether hes been there since or not what does it matter if he has besides hed never get his great carcase through the way we came i dare say but i want to see forewarned is forearmed wait till weve spoken to mr sant id rather have the latest facts to put before him i clutched my forehead i knew the dogged side of this friend of mine then i fell into a fury and stamped youre a beast if i have a fit youll have to answer for it thats all i dont want you to come dont you who gave you leave to dictate to me i should like to know well come if you like thank you mr harrier for the permission we resumed our way and i walked by harrys side ruffling presently he said i say supposing that old pilbrows treasure had anything to do with the secret in the hill what a lovely complication i dont see why it particularly should i snapped it had to do with a book not not with a hash of smugglers i took no longer interest in joshua for the moment harry had put all that story out of my head he saw i was worked up and said no more we parted where our roads branched on my side in a very depressed condition my dinner choked me and my desperate efforts to simulate appetite only brought me observation uncle jenico was quite concerned and mrs puddephatt disgustingly critical its the hair she said soon or late it was bound to find im hout i dont blame you sir for noticing at the eleventh hour whats long been apperient to the casual the heyes of love is blind and incapable of seeing into the stomach the young gentleman sir is sickening for london and no wonder we know sir what scripture says is the dogs fancy and is a human to be judged more himpervious to what hes give up let master richard breathe the hair of his native eath once more is my advice is there any truth in this dick said uncle jenico when she had gone have you been perhaps unconsciously thinking of london lately because o dont be a dear old idiot i interrupted him impatiently i was never less in the mood to leave dunberry cant i keep up my character for health without stuffing myself when i aint hungry i laughed vexedly but still i could see he was anxious about me and i was working myself up to the last pitch of irritability when suddenly i was conscious that harry had gone past the window outside i waited for his rap at the door it did not follow i jumped up stung to fury and disregarding my uncles cry ran out of the house and came up with my friend what do you mean i said were you going without me i thought he answered youd see me and then you could come or not as you liked now look here i said i wont be treated in this way i think its just beastly because i dont jump at being made sick every ones going to pity me or be my superior why whats happened said harry with a twinkle mrs puddephatt i answered i wish shed leave my inside alone and here you are going along with your nose in the air harry was chuckling out loud but he reddened as i ended i cant help my nose he said gravely i dont see the point no more do i i answered looking at it and beginning to come round with a vexed laugh it is strange what self respect we can acquire from other peoples weaknesses harrys pug was always a rather delicate subject with him he flushed truculent a moment then shrugged his shoulders and gave a good natured laugh i must take what comfort i can out of its being a cushion he said its very resting to the eyes better than yours that they cant settle on without slipping tit for tat i said youve answered me like a witty little gentleman my darling and now you can pull my ear if you like for having been cross and rude with you he responded with the addition of an amiable kick and richard was himself again the air being thus cleared we went swiftly for the mitre chattering spasmodically all the way in a desperate pretence of swagger i really think the greater credit was due to me as i was being engaged to this anticlimax as i considered it entirely against my judgment but my heart sank once more when at last we came up on the hill among the ruins and i realized at first hand the sinister futility of our design the day had fallen wintry close and breathless the sun was not blotted out but dulled as if a ground glass window had been shut upon it a light fog was stretching shorewards from the water chilling and isolating us it brought the very spirit of ghostly echoes with it and wickedness and watchfulness and it seemed to demoralize the pith in ones bones o if its got to be done lets get it over i said with a shiver why harry look there he nipped my arm and we both stood staring at the place of our yesterdays exit there was no doubt about it we had never effected had never thought to effect in the litter of dead stuff and bramble so complete a concealment of our passage therethrough for our ecstasy had taken no account at the moment of the rending evidences of our adventure which we were leaving behind us now all trace of such was gone obliterated had been cunningly effaced and built in with other litter torn from the thicket elsewhere the deadly spot was returned to all appearance to its wonted condition wont that do i whispered gulping we neednt look any further we need returned harry short and grim whos to know if we dont that he found his way down what does it matter if he did or didnt this shows plains enough that he saw us come out but it doesnt show that he knows what we know harry he was pulling at the dead stuff as i shook out his name a great pad of it came bodily away in his hands revealing a savage gap behind a hole torn and trodden beyond anything that we had made harry i whispered again supposing supposing he should be down there now nothing would persuade or deter him he broke from me and was in while i spoke and i had in decency to follow now if more proof were needed here it was in the black rent at our feet it was flagrantly enlarged from our memory of it by the forced passage of a huger body it offered no difficulty of descent and harry let himself down into it cautiously but without hesitation wait he muttered as he disappeared while i light up he had brought matches and candles with him but he paused a moment to listen before he fetched them out not a sound reached us the hill inside and out was wrapped in deadliest silence the next instant a soft glow spread itself below me and i went down into it tingling with the horror of what it should reveal not a sound not even the snarl of the badger which i believe i should have welcomed the brute scared out of his security i think had betaken himself to other quarters we reached the floor and crept on again the dead came about us but now knowing and holding the road to flight i could recover nothing of the sad appeal to comradeship with which they had before greeted me they were terrors apart ghastly chuckling grotesques without name in the kind world i had left i hated them as they hated me suddenly harry uttered a little cry and stooping rose again with some object in his hand look he whispered and held it to the light it was the bowl broken off short of a blackened deaths head pipe such as was familiar to us in the lips of joel rampick do you know what the french call a pice de conviction here it was and we needed nothing further he had been here and he shared our secret what was he going to do chapter viii the feast of lanterns i remember i ate a very large supper that night to the happy reassurance of uncle jenico that suffocating tightness of the midriff which anxiety brings seems to expand in its reaction to a quite exaggerated emptiness have we not all had that experience what meals weve made after a visit to the dentists who would have thought that this berserker dashing his beard with wine and roaring contempt of wounds and death was the same individual who in the morning cowered sick cropped in mr forcepss waiting room the thought of having vindicated and proved and so honourably acquitted ones self of further responsibility to a much dreaded task is one of the most appetizing reflections in the world and besides i had arrears to make up for the moment i was quite congratulatory to fate on its having found so strong an instrument as myself to help it with its schemes i even i think took credit for that brilliant conception of shifting the whole burden as soon as possible upon mr sants shoulders through the glaze of repletion i saw bedimmed and even perhaps glorified the figures of two ghostseers scuttling home that afternoon with their tails between their legs before the vision of a vengeance they had evoked now i laughed and snapped my fingers at the shadow of that vengeance left standing outside the window but it came to be just a leetle a different matter when it fell evening and when shadow enwrapped the shadow and i must go out into the first perhaps after all to find the second also claiming and involving me we were still harry and i bound unrelieved to our secret and must be so till late night at least for mr sant was to return from london but in time to keep his evening engagement at the church or rather the schoolrooms adjoining to which since their completion the lectures had been relegated and no opportunity could be ours to speak with him till after the entertainment in the meanwhile we had arranged to meet at the flask when i went to fetch joshua that harry might be introduced and about half past seven i set out i confess i looked over my shoulder more than once as i sped for the inn the night was very black with a sense of creeping inquisitive mists in it i had brought a lantern for myself and one for joshua but for some reason i did not want to light them as yet perhaps it was the thought of my moving a marked object through the gloom which prevented me however i reached my destination without mishap and finding harry already waiting for me there took him up at once to our visitors bedroom we found mr pilbrow dressed and expecting me with some eagerness he was quite spruce so far as the contents of the little hand bag his sole baggage it seemed could make him but he had been shaved and brushed and his boots cleaned and if his heavy green surtout was worn and smeared with a hundred stains the character of it was redeemed by that of the little alert forcible face which looked out of the frayed collar so he said pleased but stiffly heres the lantern and heres harry i presume how dee do sir said my friend grinning rather shy but in his frank attractive way i hope youll like dunberry we havent much in the way of local sights to recommend us but what there is well show you if youll let us im obliged to ye said joshua my young friend here mentioned some ruins yes theres the ruins said harry and and what else is there dick i had hoped under the circumstances we might have let the ruins alone i did not care much to think of them for my part o i said airily theres the wreck on the sands its the only other thing i can call to mind mighty said harry what a genius you are dicky id never thought of that would you care to pull out and see a wreck mr pilbrow infinitely said the old man handsomely and what wreck is it now we told him itd be rather a lark said harry only we must time our visit to the tide itll be low about to morrow midday if thatll suit if youll believe me sir we shall be the first to show any curiosity about the thing there its sat for a week and dunberry not taken the trouble to pull five miles out to learn its name even we must go now if we wanted to hear the lecture and so we lighted our lanterns and descended those private stairs which i had used on the morning first after our coming i led and as i issued forth i lifted my lantern to show joshua who followed the way the light shone full upon his face where it hung like the gurgoyle of my memory i could have thought in the dark entry and on the instant a little strained scream broke at my elbow and something staggered back against the closed door of the tap which stood hard by the latch burst there was a snap and tinkle of glass and the door flying open let down a heavy sprawling body into the lighted bar beyond a volley of oaths from the landlord sprung out with the glow and some one was cursed for a crazy drunken lout startled beyond measure i hurried our guest on what was it he asked unruffled nothing i said but a boozy ruffian of our acquaintance but by and by i took an opportunity to pull harry back and whisper in his ear did you see yes rampick what was he doing there what is he always doing there yes but to give out that screech at the sight of us it shows anyhow that hes more frightened of us than we are of him i was agitated nevertheless and more eager than ever to unburden myself to mr sant this giving of himself away was hardly to be reconciled with the drunkards stealthy effacement of his traces up on the hill yonder i wanted the thing all over and taken out of our hands we found the road to the schools now we came to retrace it all dotted and lively with wandering sparks of lanterns there was to be a good attendance it was evident the holiday spirit was in the air and these lectures after all were the best of holiday tasks and indeed when we entered the building we perceived it so crowded as in the brilliancy of its illumination to preclude any chance of that first fun of obscured revelations for the drawings on the sheet were plain as truth or anyhow as plain as good intentions we were forced to satisfy ourselves with back places near the door however the room was not so large but that we could distinguish every one of the freehand objects depicted in charcoal on the screen which with a seraphine a late invented reed instrument blown with the feet and the joy of mr sants heart was the whole of the lecturers paraphernalia whats that first thing whispered harry giggling hush i said i dont know it looks like an oyster the lights and the company and the prospect of our tutors near restoration to us were beginning to recover me and already i was tickled with the thought of some fun ahead and then in a moment there he was the whimsical strong soul and i breathed a great sigh of relief and joined tumultuously in the welcome which greeted him his discourse this night and the illustrations to it presumably was all of an appropriate observance of the sacred and festive occasion now upon us he urged his audience to honour it with sobriety in the very teeth he said of that foreign clergyman who exhorted his english congregation to temperance in these words myself i do not say no drink myself i would drink a pot of porter with you every minute i must assure you that it is not excess which is the friend of festivity nor is it sport to choose the devil for bottle holder and let ones self be knocked out of time at the first round take your share and drink fair is our motto and put it down that you may keep it up the father of lies a drunken christening is never a pleasant sight but when christ himself is the baby it is damning as well as shameful what would you think as honest men of repaying the author of a feast by excluding him from a share in it and not even like the model constituency in order to point a moral you have never heard of the model constituency no your reverence no well i suppose not but the one that came nearest to it was the one to the independent and enlightened electors of which a candidate once appealed with a free lunch and drinks on the day of the poll and very polite and ingratiatory he came to it himself too to take a snack and a glass with his good friends and guests only his good friends and guests wouldnt let him in on the contrary a burly red faced elector barred his way as he was entering vait a minute sir says the elector ve likes this idea of yours he says only theres vun thing ve doesnt want to be disfranchised for corruption says he the bony fiddles of our borough is wery dear to us he says and to me says the candidate rather sacrifice twenty seats than imperil that and my good name he says so ve thought sir says the elector and therefore vere going to eat your wittles and drink your hale and arterwards go down in a body and plump for the other gentleman in order to prove says he that our incorruptibility was what you stood on and well be wery much obliged he says if youll give us your countenance by clearing out the illustration went home we were not so far from the reform act of and was greeted with laughter and cheers now you have not that excuse said the lecturer the author of this feast comes to save not to corrupt you and if you would honour him consider his sober innocence in your midst or his father will withdraw him christmas without christ that is to play the devils game he sat down as he spoke to his seraphine and broke into a hymn his own production and very characteristic which ran literally as follows tis christ his feast said short to long lets pass the night in drink and song the liquor must not be too mild for toasting of that holy child said long them jews was blind said he but not so blind as we will be they drank him once and twice and thrice the main brace they began to splice a childs voice wailed outside the door o let me enter i implore tis freezing cold and dark and dire o let me warm me at your fire no place for children here said long and bid him cut his lucky strong were keeping of christ jesus feast clear out said short you little beast they sang to davids royal son and not till all the drink was done abstained then staggered to the door and sobered at the sight they saw stark on the snow christ baby lay twas him those sots had cursed away now tell me what availed them then to keep christ out and christmas in he had set his words to the tune of immortal babe who this dear day and you may question if you are purists a cockney rhyme or two and you may question if you are pharisees his methods well all i can tell you is that women wiped their eyes over the homely theme and that our christmas was the sweeter for the lesson it taught at the end mr sant jumped up and taking his rod pointed to the first object on the screen now then sniggered harry kneading his hands between his knees there followed a pause and a general stir rippled through with a little undercurrent of laughter go on whispered harry nudging me oyster i sung out mr sant caught sight of us and nodded and laughed thank you mr bowen said he no its not an oyster and he sat down and began trolling out a new carol the little ex bookseller shifted blushed faintly i do believe and turned to me i fancy ive got it said he have you i answered delightedly cry up then christmas pie he piped in his thin cracked voice every head was turned momentarily our way mr sant left his stool and bowed the artist is vindicated said he the gentleman has the right penetrative vision a mince pie it is and he made his illustration forthwith the text for a lovely disquisition on plum porridge and frumenty and goose pie on beef and plum pudding and turkey and chine and generally the history and rationale of christmas fare till his audience shifted and sighed under the influence of an illusive surfeit a thing guessed for one o them tree worms and turning out to be a yule log came next and provoked an allusion to a norfolk custom on certain farms of dealing out the strong cider to the household at meals for so long as the block was in consuming for which reason the servants would select for yule the biggest and most cross grained stump of elm they could find a shrewd providence which tickled the simple fancy of this fishing community where wood for burning was economized to the last spark it would yield a leathern jack coming third and passing by way of a wading boot the ordeal of identification led to the liveliest little essay on the drinking vessels of our ancestors the cocker nuts and hornes of beasts the goords and ostrich eggs the mazers broad mouthed dishes noggins whiskins piggins crinzes ale bowls wassell bowls court dishes tankards kannes from a pottle to a pint and a pint to a gill and last of all the great jacks and bombards which indeed were not unlike the cavalry boot of william iiis time then we came to a fowl of some sort most unnamable and amazing every species of partlet known to dunberry from a barn door to a guinea hen was named without success while mr sant at the seraphine laughed so that he could hardly sing and from the hall a peal of merriment went up with every guess but at last a dear fat boy hoogan by name was inspired and to an explosion of chuckles gave up the secret ive got un muster sarnt ive got un its a tor key the lecturer brought down his hands to a little scream of laughter and sprang to his feet hoogan he cried you redeem me not know him look here his vain empty strutting intolerable self importance isnt it all there to the life the very manner of the creature that imposed so abominably upon the mayor of bantam cries and cheers greeted him as the laughter subsided your reverence your reverence tell us who was the mayor of bantam why he was the mayor of bantam to be sure and so puffed up with pride and good living that when he sat down i tell you for a fact he couldnt see his own lap he could only see resting on it what he loved best in the world and you may guess what that was anyhow there are two ways of running to waste and his wasnt the consumption of the stomach one well one christmas when he was at the height of his glory and appetite he conceived the happy idea of making that part of himself a present of the primest and most promising bird which money could procure its no less than a duty thinks he to so faithful a servant and ill go to huggins myself this day about it now this huggins bred turkeys and what he didnt know about em wasnt worth knowing he knew their pride and their self sufficiency he knew that of all the fowls that came strutting out of the ark they were the vainest about their election he knew how a little flattery properly administered would serve them for food and drink till they came near bursting and he had a grudge against this mayor of bantam for having once fined him for being incapable when he had never felt so powerful drunk in his life so ho ho says he to himself when the mayor comes upon his quest ive a bone to pick with you my friend and fine pickings you shall have you want such a turkey as never was my lord says he and you want to take and fatten him and watch him fattening and enjoy him in anticipation do you he says but turkeys is queer beasts says he and whited sepulchres to them as doesnt know their tricks how do you mean whited sepulchres asks the mayor of bantam bones when alls told says huggins shaking his head darkly if you dont know the trick of inducing of em to swell well what is the trick says the mayor flattery my lord says huggins and then he pointed to a bird do you see him says he theres the proudest healthiest cock in my yard one as if humoured would fill a whole corporation down to its hungriest kitchen gal on two and six a week and what she could pick up with the marrer of deliciousness a dream he is a nightmare by the looks of him says the mayor theres more of sepulchre than of meat about him he says ah says huggins and that shows your ignorance its just slighting that keeps him in his place till hes wanted if i was to flatter that bird sir hed puff himself out that amazing with self importance hed burst in a week and anticipate his own market you take him home and feed him judicious on admiration and little else and youll have such a feast of him in the end as you never dreamed how much for him says the mayor not a penny less than two guineas says huggins preposterous says the mayor o very well says huggins id as lief you refused he shall be three to the next customer well the mayor allowed himself to be persuaded and he had the bird sent home and put in a coop and every day and half a dozen times a day hed go down and praise the creature to its face till its very wattles turned purple with pleasure theres nothing too fulsome for a turkey to swallow the very gobble gobble of him set the mayors jaws going with a foretaste of delight gobble gobble i could eat you my beauty says he just as a rapturous mother talks to her child you should have seen the turkey ruffle and swell to be called beauty put up your tail says the mayor and the dear little popes nose theres no junos peacock can spread such a fan says he the cage would hardly contain the bird at that he expanded at the very sound of the mayors footstep afterwards and he discarded his food almost entirely as something too gross for the consideration of a better than junos peacock the mayor wondered but he couldnt discount the evidence of his own eyes that huggins is a cunning one he thought he knows what hes about which was very true well at length the festive day arrived and the mayor went to take a last look at his beauty before consigning him to his cook he was almost in tears hed been starving himself for a week in anticipation of the feast and perhaps that was the reason darling he said my whole being craves for you there never was such a beautiful turkey in the world bang went the bird it was like a paper bag exploding and there before the mayors eyes was just a little sack of bones and feathers the creatures pride had been nothing but wind and that was a turkey all over it was christmas day not a market open and huggins was avenged the lecturer ended amidst shouts of laughter and applause in the midst he sat down to the seraphine and was fingering out the first bars of a new hymn when some one coming up on to the platform whispered to him he rose hurriedly and listening a moment or two as hurriedly left the room the audience including ourselves relaxed at his going into a babble of talk and merriment prime isnt it mr pilbrow said harry grinning and rubbing his hands if you introduce me to nothing worse answered the visitor i shall love dunberry for itself that reminds me i said i never thought of it before if were going to take him to see the wreck to morrow harry where shall we get a boat hm said my friend that requires consideration to be sure theyre all laid up for the holidays i suppose well we must see said i and in the act of speaking turned my head now there was a row of wooden pillars behind us supporting a gallery which threw into comparative darkness the space underneath and projected round that pillar nearest us and leaned out of the darkness hung the face of rampick it was ghastly pale the jaw loose the livid spectacles about the eyes horribly emphasized and its expression was one of an unnerved and listening sickness that made me shudder in the very act of my looking it was snatched back and i saw the man himself going lurching heavily but on tiptoe into the gloom and away to say that i was startled would be but to express ill my feelings all the doubts and agitations of the earlier evening trooped upon me again like a cold cloud had he followed us for a purpose and if so for what purpose he had long slunk out of all attendance at these feasts for some reason it seemed we could only assume what we had become objects of mixed terror and fascination to him he must have picked himself up from that fall and stealthily shadowed us hither where it was evident he had taken up a position cautiously to observe and overhear us i bent towards harry to whisper to him but before i could secure his attention a stir and silence ran through the room and there on the platform was our parish clerk holding up his hand he came to say that mr sant had been summoned hastily to the court where an old servant of the squire was reported at deaths door and to request the audience to take his apologies and disperse as we rose i looked at harry dumbly and significantly so here were we again baulked for the moment of our confession it was under the spirit of a fall from gaiety to a very real depression that i said good night to my friends chapter ix the weary sands but the morning rising cold and bright though still misty found me on the rebound once more the day after all is what we make it and i would not think evil of so smiling a one mr sant was back even if we could not see him yet and his mere neighbourhood was a splint to a weak kneed conscience uncle jenico though still oppressed with some odd premonition some formless concern about me permitted himself to be reassured so far by my high spirits as to let me go presently with nothing more than an earnest entreaty that i would take care of myself i had told him nothing about our proposed trip to the weary sands it would have served no purpose but to trouble him all day with anxiety as to our return i was glad to think later that i had not done so that i had sat content with him for an hour or two after breakfast had kept him chatting genially and made him laugh had taken a genuine bright interest in the colossal wrench an invention which he was engaged in perfecting at the time somewhat on the principle of the spanish garrotte for applying tremendous haulage to an object the most gratifyingly practical of all his inspirations as you shall see and i was glad to think that when at last i had left him well on in the morning in a sudden access of emotion he had kissed me and then driven me away with his stick and a laugh and the tears in his eyes i had been half shamefaced it is true at the moment but presently was to sentimentalize more over the memory than he had over the fact we were engaged harry and i by arrangement for this day to the convoying of mr pilbrow about the place in order to his making acquaintance with its objects of interest it was nothing in fact but an excuse for a ramble only to give it a holiday complexion we had arranged to bring our lunch with us and our visitor back to high tea at the end of the jaunt i set forth about eleven oclock for the flask where we were to meet the shadows of the previous night were dispelled a still shining mist half hid and half revealed like a bridal veil the pretty face of nature there was a smile and a sparkle of gems through it all and i whistled as happy as a blackbird as i went it was within three mornings of christmas a time of peace and good will and i was determined to let the day be sufficient for itself in evil without troubling to force its hand on the wall of the inn i found a wonderful notice posted it was written crooked in great black letters and without any stops and ran as follows nekt thrusday t desrember there will be on plaistoo jingling matches for hats grinning thro coler catching of a pig with the tail greazed climing of a pole of wemen running for snuff old men for tobakker there will be also a place receved for dancing and seats will be also receved for the leadies there will be a band including marrow bons and clever to conclude with a grand exbitrition of fire wax and cullerd bumps by jf harry joined me while i was spluttering over this and read the exciting legend across my shoulder i say he said mr pilbrows in luck hell think were a game lot i only hope the reaction wont be too severe but what does bumps mean is sant getting up a sparring match bombs you gaby i said sniggering mighty said he old flemings going it but wont it be fun then he fell to a little gravity by the way he said sant hasnt come home yet and they dont expect him at the rectory till this afternoon it was the first little damper on my serenity o well i said with a sigh we shall be out for the day anyhow and it dont make much difference if we can only get hold of him this evening you saw rampick last night yes he answered bother rampick for this day at least we ran up in good spirits to joshua and in a little while were launched upon our explorations our odd dry old companion was quite excited too in his way it was the most novel most wonderful experience to him i think thus to chaperon a couple of lively lads and be their favoured charge and mentor in one he kept himself acrid and reserved it was the habit of his life but a certain glistening in his pale eyes a spot of colour that established itself in his lean cheek spoke of some spark reawakening in those long chilled ashes of his soul underneath there was even some glow of self marvelling enthusiasm in that haunting gaze of his of which i found myself from time to time the cynosure it was like the glare of a remorseful ghost coveting recognition in heavens nursery by its own childs happy spirit what human sympathy have i foregone and realized too late it seemed to express we betook ourselves in the first place by joshuas rather insistent wish but secretly against our own to the ruins and for an hour poked about among them wearily loitering after our guest and supplying scarcely volunteering all that of their history with which we were acquainted impersonally that is to say the truth is the place had become odious to us as full of sordid significances as is a house in which a murder has been committed when we know ourselves subpoenad to give evidence on the crime but naturally our companion felt none of this and was only absorbed and interested so far as appeared in the archaeological testimony once at the end he paused as fatality would have it close by the plinth and the encumbered thicket i glanced at harry a second time patiently and scrupulously had the hole been stopped and the traces of our visit effaced what did the man mean did he in his diseased imagination think thus to convince us in the face of our actual experience it was like enough his unnerving dreams are so real to the drunkard he cannot but think that others must see what he sees and be blind to what he has successfully hidden from himself he is like the ostrich in his amazing digestion of both facts and fables whether he puts fire in his stomach or his head in the sand he is equally the confident and incurable dupe of his own imagination suddenly joshua after a prolonged reverie half turned to us are there any legends of crypts underground vaults anything that we have not seen about here he demanded i was startled i could not order my thoughts i mumbled out involuntarily i there used to be a talk of smugglers he turned upon me like a snapping dog smugglers what about them harry glanced at me warningly o i said recovering myself with a flush it was an old tale when we came mr pilbrow and since the weather and the coastguard have been knocking it to pieces between them he stood thoughtfully rubbing his chin so he murmured knocking what to pieces why the tale said i for i did not wish to be more particular i dont know if he understood my reluctance he did not persist in his questions anyhow but lapsed into a brown study he seemed to have forgotten our presence so it ever vanishes he muttered with a stark and melancholy frown from dungeness to spurn head it is always the same the past breaks away and falls into the sea as i approach the ghosts lead the mirage beckons me and behold the precipice and the boom of waters where i had thought a treasure house he gave a sigh that was nothing less than heart rending a certain awe and discomfort kept us mute here was some tragedy beyond our guessing but to which we were guiltily conscious that our secretiveness contributed then in a moment he turned upon us with a laugh in which there was not even a tinge of mirth if there is any land too much in the world said he put me to walk upon its shore and it will vanish before me yard by yard my breath is blasting powder my feet are earthquakes i must drown if i live long enough he walked off towards the cliff and paused at its edge looking down gloomily on the leaning shaft of the well he is thinking of abel and his book i whispered to harry as we followed suddenly he turned to me and put his arm through mine with an air emotional and apologetic dear lad he said you mustnt consider my moods i talk to myself richard the bad habit of a lonely man what is that thing now i have wondered before this i told him ah he said with a bleak jocosity let well be it should have confronted me six years ago and i see it only now the moral of all my wanderings yet in a good hour is it spoken richard since chance has brought me to your company again or is it destiny which leading me to neglect this scrap of shore hitherto points its lesson at the end with the broken shaft yonder let well be i am hungry so we sat down then and there and got out our provisions they put astonishing comfort into us and we two boys at least grew hilarious sound livered and hardened we took no thought of chill and indeed the weather for the time of year was balm a light glistening fog still slept over everything there was no breath of wind and the whisper of the surf came up to us drowsily now this wreck said joshua presently where will it be harry jumped to his feet mighty he exclaimed we must be thinking of moving if we want to pull out to it tides at ebb dicky and near the turn thereabouts it lies mr pilbrow on the weary sands but we cant just make it out in this haze well for the boat i said scrambling up and we all made for the gap together it was then half an hour past midday a bad time said i what fools we were not to think of it before there wont be a soul about there was one soul however it appeared a gaunt solitary figure which as we neared the head of the sandy slope we could see silhouetted against the sky a figure too which from its restless craning attitude one might have thought was expecting us harry edged up to me and was on the point of whispering when he caught joshuas eyes fixed upon him he giggled and looked silly i was thinking sir began he that that man there and then he stopped well what about him said the other why said harry so confused as to forget himself if if you want to know about smugglers hes the chap to tell you thats all i nudged my friend well he muttered peevishly ive not said anything have i rampick can look after himself joshua did not answer and we went on and in the same moment rampick was gone but we saw him again when we came into view of the beach he was down by the water ostentatious with a boat which lay stern on to the surf the only man and the only craft handy in all the waste prospect joshua stopped in admiration a providence it seems to me said he we cant go with him i muttered our visitor looked at me in wonder why not he said how could i answer that this seeming opportuneness was nothing more as i was convinced than a deliberate self appropriation by this man of a scheme which he had overheard us discussing in the hall last night and what then save a confession on his part of a good trading instinct i must find something better than that hes a drunkard i said flushing he isnt to be trusted in my opinion why said joshua isnt it his own boat o yes i answered for it was indeed the single sound piece of goods which rampick had saved and clung to out of the wreck of his past isnt it big enough insisted the visitor quite big enough why said joshua a seaman never loses his legs but ashore and we are three to one gentlemen im small but ill back myself for a rat to grip if its me youre thinking of harry hung his head i was ashamed to say more it did seem ridiculous that three vigorous bodies should be timorous of this one crazy oaf the half truth made us out cravens and the whole was impossible nevertheless the prospect of such a boatman for the trip quite took off the edge of its pleasure we followed joshua hangdog as he strode down the gap and across the beach youve whetted my curiosity he said over his shoulder a drunken smuggler should be good company i scowled at harry dropping behind well why didnt you take upon yourself to answer him he muttered viciously were in for a nice thing it seems knowing what we know itll be pleasant to have to hob nob with the fellow and a warrant for his hanging like in our pockets hes brought it on himself i answered he heard us last night and ill swear hes been ready and waiting for us all the morning well look out for squalls thats all i can say said my friend and as he spoke we reached the boat rampick busy over it never even looked up as we came but i could see his great hands trembling on the thwarts as he leaned down we want to pull out to the wreck mr rampick i faltered can you let us have your boat i essayed to exclude him as a last resource he did not raise his head but answered in a heavy shaking voice from where he bent which its well known to you sir that my boat and me dont part company its a special occasion mr rampick he came up with a sudden heaving together of all his bulk and subsiding rigidly backwards against the gunwale stood breathing softly and staring with intense unblinking eyes not at us but at our companion so a cat stares at bay crouching before a watchful snuffing dog i dont think he ever once looked at harry or me from that moment he seemed to focus all the panic of his haunted soul on the stranger who had come in our train it was inexplicable though in its way a relief to us for the time being the sort of relief one feels when some deriding gutter urchin attracts from one to himself the unwelcome notice of the town drunkard which its well known he whispered breathless his demented gaze wandered from joshuas face to his knees where it fixed itself and he said he muttered lazarus come forth and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre its come to it a special occasion one or the other of us boat sir yes but i never done it you ought to know one or the other of us then the other by all means said joshua caustic but interested my good man we dont want to separate you from your boat if your presence is indispensable why well put up with it rampick i could have thought went a shade more livid his dry lips seemed to crackle under his hand as he passed the back of it over them yet strangely enough i did not believe him drunk he seemed rather in that arid aghast condition which with such a man bespeaks a temporary abstinence suddenly he heaved himself upright and began heavily to busy himself with preparations for launching his craft we all lent a hand and in another minute with a slide and a jump were on board and slipping easily over the shoreward swell not then when he had settled himself to his sculls we being all seated in the stern did he for a moment take his eyes off our visitor sympathetically i shrunk under that concentrated stare but joshua bore it unruffled still there was something in the atmosphere to freeze our loquacity for a long time none of us spoke at all there had not been air enough to fill a sail and the monotonous bump and creak of the oars in the rowlocks beat a dreary accompaniment to our depression at length harry essayed a little weak conciliation tidell hold for us to land and see the wreck wont it mr rampick he said his voice broke the spell and to strange effect the ex smuggler did not answer him but he suddenly ceased rowing and resting on his sculls felt out with his foot and kicked joshua softly on the shins what are you doing snapped the victim jerking his insulted limbs under him what do you mean man rampick cowered where he sat i see you walk sir he said hoarsely i see you with my own eyes its not in nature is it you was kep from it i say held by the legs from rising who let you loose who patched you up to follow me my god ill be even with em i will he was working himself up to a mad pitch of excitement i half rose in agitation and looked behind me we were already so far from the shore that its line of cliffs was a mere blurred bank in the haze but joshua in the same instant had seized the occasion to justify the character he had given of himself silence he said not loud but in a tone like a vice who speaks of being out of nature you crazy patch row on and mind your business which is to take us to the wreck the maniac creature shrunk as quickly as he had flamed up under the bitter voice lowering and trembling he applied himself to his sculls once more and the boat sped on harry i whispered pale and gulping did you understand yes him that lies with the pistol in the hill yonder he thinks its mr pilbrow and that weve set him free he ended with an hysterical giggle here in truth it appeared was this bedlamites attitude towards our guest explained the infection of harrys laugh over the absurdity seized me i struggled in vain to control myself in another moment we were both of us doubling and rolling as if the devil were tickling our ribs joshua expressed no surprise but nodded intelligently as we gasped ourselves sober again he attributed our merriment no doubt to a general sense of the ludicrous in this wretched creatures wanderings of the likelihood of any significance or coherence in which he had of course no idea as for the man himself he regarded harry and me no further than if we had been squeaking mice behind a wainscot but sat with his vision attached once more and more cringingly than ever to the little wintry venomous figure in the stern we recovered ourselves half fearful from our convulsion feeling rather i think like fugitives who had consciously betrayed their own whereabouts but the explosion in fact had relieved the air and thenceforth we began to talk together moved by a common rebellion against the moral tyranny of the depression which had held us hitherto but for all that it startled us near out of our skins when joshua of a sudden turned upon rampick and asked him roundly if he hadnt any good smuggling yarns to recount to him of hidden stores and black nights said he and the ground giving up a sudden swarm of mushroom creatures things squat and stealthy shouldering kegs rampicks chest had seemed to fall in at the first word it was painful to hear his breathing but he made no attempt to answer come said joshua its fast confidences man you know what you know these young gentlemen have given you away but no further than to me mind come what happened underground in those days before the sea took its toll of the vaults why you should know sir as well as me such a funny little voice so strained and hoarse like a cry at a great distance joshua himself was startled by it moved perhaps by its distress he persisted no further but shrugged his shoulders and turned to address us again in the meanwhile we were approaching the wreck which for some time now had been visible to us it hung oddly in the mist suspended as it seemed in the mid haze of sky and water like a wreck painted on glass still seen through that illusive medium it appeared a phantom far off thing when to our surprise grown absorbed as we were in contemplation of it our boatman gave a final stroke and finished on it with his sculls poised no further said i rising all excitement now cant you take us any further mr rampick ill swear that not once during our approach had he turned his head to canvass our distance or direction old crafty smuggler as he was he had hit his mark blindfold as it were even as i spoke i was aware of something stretching its endless length across our course a great soft iridescent fish shaped bulk as it might be a vast submarine monster floating dead and motionless on the surface it shone sleek and fawny and pitted with little blue scales of water and in the instant of my recognizing it our boat had floated on and with the way given it had grated its nose softly in its flank following the little shock and recoil we were all on our feet the sands whispered harry with glistening eyes that was clever of you mr rampick we did not he or i demur to our enemys silence it would have made no difference if we had his regard his consideration were still all for our companion across the glimmering lifts of sand the wreck now we were brought stationary seemed to draw nearer and clearer a phantom still yet claiming some foothold on this unreal reality of an amphibious little continent only a broken poop it was tilted up and its mighty entrails spilt into the drift another storm any rough weather would scatter it for ever yet no plundered town could have stood a symbol of more awful and pathetic desolation the haze blurred and magnified it to us where we stood so that huge relic as it was in reality it looked nothing less than gigantic gazing on it its ruin and isolation in that mist of waters i felt as one might feel in alighting on a fallen colossus in a desert are we to land here said joshua breaking through the spell which had overtaken me aye answered the smuggler in that one terse low monosyllable and with his eyes never leaving the others face go you said joshua turning briskly to us two i will wait here and take my turn when youve finished we hesitated questioning him with a dumb glance come he said the tide as i reckon dont stand on ceremony why should we any of us go mr pilbrow i spoke up quickly we can see all we want to see from here nonsense he said sharply wholl credit our adventure if we dont bring back her name we still hung reluctant but he drove us good humouredly forward and out over the bow looking back after we had leapt to the reeking sand and were hurrying to cross it i saw him still standing there taut and resolute to wave us on i dont like it harry i said i dont like it and no more did he or he wouldnt have stayed by rampick lets hurry all we can well come on panted my friend the quicker were there the quicker we shall be back yard by yard as we traversed the broad spit of sand the looming ribs of the wreck seemed to shrink and materialize and take on outline and then in a moment with an involuntary gasp we had pulled up and were standing staring for between us and our quarry had come suddenly into view an unguessed at channel of dim water a hundred feet it might be across harry wheeled hes done us he exclaimed hes meaning some mischief ill swear come back dick with the word we were running for a moment the bulge of the drift hid the boat from our view the next we had topped it and breathed with relief to see the figure of joshua still standing up at the bow as we had left him for an instant only and in that instant rampick catching sight of our returning forms rose hurriedly and stealthily with one of his sculls clubbed to strike we screeched out together the warning was quick to save joshua from the worst but not from secondary consequences instinctively he ducked as the blade flashed over his head but the act toppled him from his balance and he fell from the boat prone upon the sand from which he rolled down clutching into the sea in the same moment rampick using the scull he had swung for lever pushed off from the bank hurriedly seated himself and in a stroke or two was out at safe distance and in deep water where he held up breathing stertorously as he regarded us by this time we were down at the edge and flinging ourselves flat had caught at joshuas hands where they clawed and slipped in the slobber of wet sand the drift took the water at a deepish angle but it was firm above for knee hold and in a minute or two we had drawn him up far enough to enable him to get a bite with his own nails and then the rest was easy as he sat to recover himself crowing and spitting but not otherwise greatly discomposed harry jumped to his feet and hailed the madman furiously come back rampick resting on his oars chewed his dry lips for moisture but answered nothing come back screamed harry or ill fetch you he dropped and slipped knee deep into the water as he cried as if to verify his threat insane one as he knew it to be the sea was near quiet as a mill pond and rampick had only to pull a couple of indifferent strokes to increase the distance between us by some fathoms i thought he was going to abandon us altogether and at once and in an agony hailed him on my own account mr rampick why dont you come back you arent going to leave us to drown here he leaned forward always watchful of us and groping under the thwarts fetched up a black bottle which he uncorked and put to his lips a rejoicing swill it gave him nerve and voice he sagged down between maudlin and triumphant and answered with a hoarse defiant laugh i am though mr rampick i cried what have we done to you he drank again every addition of this fuel made the devil roar in him done he yelled see how you done fur yourselves my hearties youd let him out would you youd make the dead walk to testify agen me i know you youve plotted and schemed agen me from the first you parsons whelps and heres what it come to i was on the way to salvation till you crossed me once too often the sands ll keep my secret and yourn let him out to walk you will but not to swim my god i had you there old jole had you there my bucks he poured down more fire and howled and drummed his feet in a gloating frenzy had you there he shrieked you may quicken him out of fire out of rocks and fire but you furgot as water squenches fire thought old jole crazy did you poor old jole whose fortunes went out in the spark as him there lighted and all the time he lay low to get even with you has he done it did he choose his time crafty did any one see us when your drownded corpses comes in with the tide wholl know the truth jole and jole can keep a secret once all prying apes is laid from forcing his hand he shook to the roaring of his own voice the reverberating fire in his brain deafened him to any reason reassurance protest we cried to him in our distraction to listen only to calm himself and listen our appeals could not penetrate the pandemonium in that maniac soul in the midst joshua all amazed and at sea as he was rose to add his entreaties to ours the effect was disastrous at the vision of him strung as if to fly his coat tails spread the madman gripped his oars convulsively lie down he screamed whats death to you i aint going to stop i never could abide the sight of it and with the word he was pulling furiously away we still shrieked to him vainly we ran up and down the sand for the moment i felt quite blind and delirious all was of no avail yard by yard the boat drew away into the thickening mist grew dim and dimmer a phantom of itself and while still the thump of its rowlocks drummed thickly into our ears vanished and was gone and then at last we came together and halting looked into one anothers pallid faces like dead souls meeting on the banks of styx chapter x the darkest hour the memory of that awful time is soothed and assuaged to me by virtue of the strong soul who under providence was given to us to command it if destiny had used him its instrument to precipitate the tragedy long i am sure hanging over our heads it had done so consciously by higher command in order to neutralize the effects of its own inexorable decree so thought mr sant presently and gratefully we acquiesced giving thanks to providence like children we had played with fire not realizing nor i think deserving the consequences all honour then after god to his little self possessed deputy who of his confidence and resolution helped us to the nerve to escape them for a time harry and i i may surely admit it without shame were beside ourselves to be thus cast away and abandoned on a sandbank in mid ocean for to all appearances and intents and purposes our fate seemed nothing less it was horrible beyond words an hour perhaps two hours and a lingering death must overtake us already we could see by the near lines of foam could gather from the changed whisper of the tide the seaward surges were freshening to their return we hurried to and fro wringing our hands crying for impossible help never once in our distraction holding escape as conceivable save by external agency the bank on which we stood stretched north and south a sleek hateful mockery it were useless to traverse it up and down yet we went as if to hurry this way and that over it were to summon of our agonized need a causeway to the unseen shore five miles distant we went until the terror of ranging adrift beyond recovery from our one hope of resource already grown a desolate phantom behind us in the mist sent us frantically back to the side of the motionless figure which had not once stirred since we parted from it raving mr pilbrow i cried what are we to do ah he answered sharp as an echo to command yourselves it was like a tonic of steel served from a pistol we will we do said harry forcing down his terror in one great gulp dick dont be a fool some shame i think stiffened me the debility of despair conceded a hope to the mere prospect of discussion what a courage was this to succumb without an effort to have reason and yield it to the shadow falling before the fact all right i muttered im an ass only let him tell us what were to do he brought this on us you know he showed no resentment of my bitterness yes he said in a strong quiet voice i brought this on you richard for you warned me and i overruled your warning being sceptical without knowledge which is the boast of fools the man was mad and i thought to control him with reason having failed in that as in everything else now accursed shall i be in the eyes of my co trustee your dear uncle his mention of uncle jenico quite upset me again o i cried violently what do you matter if you drown youve only yourself to thank he would have stopped my going but i wouldnt tell him anything about it because i thought it was nonsense to be afraid and now hell wait and wait and we shall never come and it will break his heart he stood before me dripping wet a most wretched pathetic expression on his face it was due less i knew to despair than to sorrow over my revolt against him at the vision of it i was moved even against my will to remorse well i said miserably i dont want to put all the blame on you though you might have given me credit for a reason you dont know what we know about the man or his interest in shutting our mouths i ought to have told you perhaps but the secret was saving for another who has more right to it it doesnt matter now we only want to get out of this mr pilbrow do you hear o please think of something there must be a way to stand here and richard he cried in great emotion he half advanced holding out his hand then suddenly commanded himself let it fall and became in a moment a figure of passionless resolution you are right he said dryly defining and articulating each word this is no time for recriminations we must compose ourselves must think the way out of a trap is never the way in that is where men waste themselves now tell me nobody knows of our coming here nobody i said nor saw us take the boat there isnt a hope of our being rescued from the shore we cant see it even and if we could be made out here whos abroad to mark us besides even if any one did theres bare time even now to put off and cover the distance before hmph he pondered frowning and fondling his gritty chin then he turned to my friend how long have we he asked harry gave a desperate glance seawards say an hour here perhaps two if we climbed the wreck but theres deep water between ah you didnt know that did you but there is and you joshua made a gesture of dissent no he said i cant swim leave me out of the question but you two can i know why shouldnt you reach the shore harry shook his head the tides running in its true but five miles and in december he ended with a despairing shrug very well said joshua so prompt and decided that he made us jump then the wrecks our one asset and well just go and see the best use we can make of it with the word he was striding over the sand and sprung to some sudden thrill of hope at his confidence we followed him our hearts thumping when we came down to the little strait we found it already and undoubtedly widened the cream of incoming surf showed more boldly over the lip of the further bank where the wreck lay and between that and ourselves there was a sense of busier movement as it might be water yawning and stretching after sleep now said joshua sharp as a lash swim across to her swim at once i exclaimed and what about you ive told you to leave me out he said dry and composed you must swim as you cant jump ill wait you here maybe youll find the means to float back on boards or such then we saw what was in his mind it was a chance against all odds and so poor a one that we had hardly considered it i think in our agitation the storm we felt must have gutted the carcase as clean as a dressed oxs nothing detachable but must have been wrenched and flung away from where we stood indeed only the framework of the poop gaunt and inflexible and rigid in its suggestion of ribs and spars shattered but unyielding appeared to have survived its furious sacking by the waves moreover a certain suspicion had come to us that rampick had not now made his first acquaintance with the wreck that even perhaps so early as the serving of the last ebb when fresh from hearing of our plans he had rowed over to examine his ground by lantern light and to make sure as so cunning a madman would that no contingency of crate or cask or loosened plank should be allowed to mar his wicked purpose though we might or might not be right in this in point of fact i believe we were right our hope looking upon that lean account of ruin was a very little hope still for what it was it lost nothing in inspiration from the self confidence of our companion i turned a desperate inquiring glance on harry come he said in answer and without another word between us we had slipped down and taken the water as for that it was chill enough but to traverse the interval childs play for swimmers so young and hardy in five minutes we had emerged sleek and dripping on the further side and the wreck was close before us we shook ourselves like dogs and ran up the sand the shivered frame of the thing lay pitched on the sharp back of the drift where the poor ship must have dumped herself to be broken like a stick across a housemaids knee what remained was a melancholy witness to the impotence of mans bravest efforts to command nature in her passions she must have been a fine craft of many thousand tons burden by evidence of this fragment ex pede herculem now the forlorn remnant of her was so shattered as to look at these close quarters more like the wreck of a blown down hoarding than of a gallant vessel wryed and gaping and burst apart her ribs had been stripped inside and out of everything that could be torn away and swallowed so that what survived survived by virtue of a tenacity which inasmuch as it had defied the wrench of the storm was little likely to yield us salvage and indeed we reached her only to find our apprehensions confirmed shorn through her waist it appeared close off by the poop and her fore part lifted and rolled and ravished god knew whither she had disgorged her vitals into the gulf to the last bolt so that not one loose board of her remained to reward us unless buried beyond our recovery in the sand into which the jagged wound of her emptied trunk was plugged we climbed and pulled and tested running hither and thither we fell upon our knees and with our hands dug frantically until they bled into the wedged drift it yielded nothing from time to time we desisted and gazed in a panic of fear at the water where but a few yards beyond and below her stern it rustled and curvetted advancing and retreating and advancing yet another step to play cat like with our anguish at last and for the last time of many we mounted the slope of stubborn planks to struggle with some fractured balk of timber some broken rib end which might seem to promise yielding to our frenzied blows and kicks it was all of no avail like lost souls we paused looking down on a litter of splinters our great needs only recompense and o my god whispered harry and staggered back where he stood and flung himself quite ill and overcome upon the bulwarks he was up by the broken stern post and sick to note the rising of the tide he looked down on the instant he uttered a wild exclamation jumped to his feet went over the side and vanished i was poising myself a little below on the slope of the deck at his cry i dropped and slipped landed at the bottom recovered my feet and raced round to meet him then i too uttered a yell for here unnoticed by us before was at least a straw of hope to catch at it was a great spar which lay down the slope of the sand with some wreck of tackle yet tangled about it and its butt wedged under the stern of the ship lord shrieked my friend come and pull dicky o lord come and pull he was skipping and sobbing as if he were cracked get a purchase he screeched we must have it out if we bust ourselves i had sprung and seized on it even as he spoke to lift it was far beyond our strength but straining and hauling our mightiest we found we could shift it a little right and left like a colossal dead tooth in its socket o if we only had uncle jenicos wrench i panted as we paused a moment in exhaustion we were quite breathless and white the sweat for all the weather was running down our faces harry i groaned piteously if we cant get it out now after all this this the look in his eyes stopped me the despair was quite gone from them and the old breezy fearlessness returned but were going to get it out he cried and without uncle jenicos wrench too his gay new confidence was revivifying amazing my heart for all its terror was beginning to expand in the radiance of it how i gasped dont keep me waiting you you old beast ill show you he said and with the word was down among the tackle unknotting and pulling i watched him breathless helped him where i could between us in a few minutes we had disentangled many fathoms of unbroken rope and still there was more to come we wrought hurriedly feverishly with one eye always on the rising water let it only wait said harry through his teeth till weve got this clear and then it may come as fast as it likes i worked on hard not asking him why perhaps i had a lingering horror that his answer would disillusion me show this shadow of hope a heart breaking chimera and still stealthily the tide crept up and still we had not done but at length the last kink was unravelled and we rose with a shout one end of the rope was still fastened tight to a ring bolt in the spar at its seaward end the other harry shouldered and with it turned to run up the bank do you understand yet gaby he demanded grinning triumphant you are going to get a haul on the thing to one side and further up yes i am my spirits sank a little we shant be able to move it that way any more than we did before anyhow not to pull it out of its hold shant we wait and see o harry dont be such a fiend why dicky you stoopid look here i examined the thing which you didnt no more than rampick himself if its true hes been here already he thought it wedged tight maybe and safe from us well i tell you its only caught by the tip of its nose far enough in to baffle us lying as it does but easy enough to pull out floating i stared at him a moment then gave a wild hoot and began to dance about as he had done before and threw up my cap and ended by hugging him you beauty you beauty you dear old positive genius and darling we shall get away after all with nothing but a ducking and uncle jenico a sudden choke stopped me i turned away so that my friend shouldnt see my shame dick old man he said soberly you mustnt be too wild even now its all right i hope only well its cold and three of us to drift five miles on a spar but i wouldnt heed a word of his admonition the recoil from despair had sent my wits toppling clean head over heels if nothing but a bowl had offered i should have been as joyous as a wise man of gotham to commit our destinies to it to have some means any to escape this hideous nightmare of enchainment to a living death hi gee whoa get on i cried chuckling hysteric and drove harry holding the rope end up the sand before me it paid out behind and did not pull taut till we were well on the slope then for the first time we thought of joshua and turned to look for him he was standing with some suggestion of agitation on the edge of the further drift the water had crept up since we left him widening ominously the channel between we waved our hands to him and he responded look here said harry he mustnt be left in his ignorance its torture besides hold on dicky while i go to him why dont you bawl across hed never gather we must have him ready and i cant explain here dont drop the rope for a moment while im gone all right but why not have a pull first to see if itll come free without mighty not for the world its been rotting in the water supposing it snapped therell hardly be a strain when the tide lifts the thing and gets under the seat of the old girl you believe me did you see her name no well its the good hope hurrah and he scuttled from me and the next moment was squattering through the water of the little strait i watched his chestnut ball of a head lovingly as it drew a line across the channel and i danced with excitement again to see his streaming shoulders emerge presently and joshua as near wrought up as i run out knee deep to help him ashore and support him as if he needed support and kneel to wring out his clothes while the faint gabble of their voices came to me and then i turned to look seawards once more and behold the comb of a little wave struck the spar end and seethed up and over it and the sight made my heart flutter harry i screeched and gripped the rope as if i feared some unnamable wickedness were seeking to snatch it out of my hands i did not dare to turn again but watched the hurrying tide fascinated and almost before i knew it harry was at my side lord dicky he whispered his eyes glistening it comes dont it dont let go we mustnt give it a chance if it had only answered to our thoughts how slow it crawled without haste or flurry sometimes seeming to drop dormant as if to take us off our guard presently what with the strain and our shivering we were fain to squat gingerly upon the sand and grip and watch setting our chattering teeth what if our expectations were to be cruelly baffled after all what if the spar were anchored by some unexpected unseen grapnel to the bank i turned sick at the thought the water by now lipped along it covering some three feet of its end and still to any gentle test of pulling it responded nothing suddenly eccentric as always in its motions the tide bowled a succession of heavier wavelets shorewards the first found us sitting the rope taut between us and the spar and left us sprawling backwards in a puddle of water i thought the mere wash of it had upset us till in the midst of my spluttering and clutching to recover purchase i heard my friend sing out get up hold on dick o come come then scrambling gasping to my feet i saw what had happened the spar answering to our strain in the bobble of water had swung towards us the rope had slackened and over we had tumbled chattering with excitement we got hold once more and pulled still it did not come free nor for long minutes yet we tugged and hauled what we dared and ceased and tugged again not to cut short that tale of agony and suspense until we were ankle deep in water not until the rush of little incoming waves foamed high on the stern of the good hope kicking her up and loosening her nip on that grim held relic of her own not until the sands were whelmed near and far so that we seemed to sprout three fantastic trunks of humanity from the surface of the ocean itself did a great surge and vortex answering to our last despairing wrench show us that we had been successful and even then some dreadful moments passed moments of terror lest the rope had given before the mass rolling sluggishly to the surface revealed itself we were panting and sobbing as we hauled it in but harry kept his wits through all get astride dick he said and help me to fasten this home this was the running gear which he wanted to dispose about the spar in such way as to give us all some hold to cling by we wrought quick and hard and in a little had it looped to our satisfaction the wreckage consisted of a huge segment of a main lower and top mast with the step pretty complete and the whole of the over lapping part bolted snug on either side of which the great sticks had snapped it was in all some twenty feet long perhaps with rings and shroud fastenings and cut ends of rigging yet attached and it floated massive on an even keel so to speak so that in places we could even walk on it without fear of upsetting in that tranquil sea now said harry at last to get to mr pilbrow i swear till that moment we had realized no difficulty and then with the word we were staring aghast at one another the spar sat too deep to move not till the tide had risen another two feet at least would she ride over the bank we knew no way round could he plant himself firm in that hurrying sway of water until we reached him we stood up and waved and shouted were coming in a little hold on till we come i dont know if he heard us he stood there plunged to the knees the oddest most tragic sight he waved back and screeched something what we could not understand every few minutes we dropped overboard and heaved our utmost at the great hulk only to have her ride a few feet and ground again but at last when the water was up to his shoulders she gave a little dip and curtsey and the following wave washed her on we yelled then and slipped into the water for the last time and finding no bottom kicked out frantic holding each to a loop of the rope and propelled her slowly before us the tide took her now and do what we would we could not coax her in a direct course for our friend we saw we should miss him by a full fathom he was staggering desperate to keep his foothold we drove near fling yourself forward shrieked harry its your only chance and with the word scrambled on to the spar again i was on joshuas side and i dwelt in an agony holding on to the rope with one hand while i strained to draw her closer it was no use and seeing we must float past i echoed harrys scream joshua sprang out and forward on the instant and with a mighty flounder of water disappeared but the impetus of his leap carried him towards me and suddenly like a crooked bough borne on a flood an arm of him was stuck out within a yard of my reach i let go my hold to dash and clutch it and as i swerved harry snapping down caught at one of my kicking ankles and held on my head went under but i had the wrist like a vice and in another minute i and my quarry were drawn to the spar side and our noddles gobbling and clucking and purple with suffocation helped right way up we were saved so far we had won free vogue la galre chapter xi joshua speaks what a fantastic nightmare in my memory is that amazing voyage were souls as oddly consorted ever launched on an odder looking back at this date on all the circumstances our isolation our helplessness our exhaustion of mind and body following on the strain and that by long hours yet not to be withdrawn it appears to me little less than miraculous that we ever won to harbour had it not been for the strange distraction of a certain recital which the occasion called forth and which occupying our thoughts both during and after its telling rendered us partly oblivious to our condition a very creeping paralysis of terror would i believe have ended by destroying us to swing there unrelated to any visible hold on life but the sodden weltering stick beneath us lost atoms in a vast immensity of mist and water my mind save i gripped it frenziedly to its own consciousness would have reeled and forsaken me i think sometimes for a moment indeed it would be almost gone dropping through the seeming clouds on which we swam into immeasurable abysses of space and it was only on these occasions by grappling aghast with the figures of reality before it that it could recover and control itself if only we could have seen the shore could have steadied nothing more than our vision on that ghost of moral support it would have been something but by now the haze had shut down and we were derelicts utterly committed to the waste it was a bad time a bad forsaken time and i do not much like to recall it that is the truth we had perched joshua having with some distress got him on board between us on the twin spar where he could set his back against the broken top and hold on mechanically till he was in the way to convalescence fore and aft of him squatting or straddling on our slippery bed we made at first fitful attempts to dig a little way on our craft with our feet but the load was too heavy thus lightly to be influenced and we soon gave up the effort we might perhaps have affected our course a trifle by swimming and pushing we did not dare it had been a different matter in the first excitement of escape with the sand under our feet now in the reaction to a consciousness of our drenched and overwrought and half benumbed condition the water had become a fathomless horror lapping after us with hiss and hurry to devour what it had seduced from its shallows there was a heaviness a deadliness in it level and undisturbed as it seemed which it was sickening to contemplate and so we sat close and drifted and essayed did harry and i while joshua was recovering to reassure ourselves and one another with fitful banter the most cheerless hollow stuff god knew and soon to expire of its own pretence for a time undoubtedly the tide carried us shorewards leisurely and with no affectation of charity the wreck sunk and disappeared behind us was a wreck a bulwark a stile in mid desert a post a stump was gone we distanced it so slowly that scarce a quarter of a mile could have separated us from it when its last token was submerged and our hearts seemed to founder with it harry i cried in a sudden shock of terror what if at this rate we never reach the shore at all and are carried out again by the ebb he wriggled and snarled whats the use of meeting trouble half way weve four or five hours before us and if we cant drift close enough by then to finish swimming the deuce is in it hold tight dicky thats all youve got to do and ill answer for the rest his self confidence soothed me supremely and i was the more comforted to see joshua stir himself at that moment and sit upright whats that he said leave me out of the question if you want to swim we dont want to swim mr pilbrow not unless the tide wont serve us to the end and then i hope itll be only a little way well he answered go when you will only i want to have a word with you first richard you are all right again sir right he muttered i dont know the land drops and flees before me the cold is in my heart i must ease it richard i must ease it of its secret load before that winter gets home o dont talk like that i complained its to flout providence in the face after this mercy well he said with a melancholy smile i shall be lighter anyhow for the easing with this weight continuing in me i should sink like a plumb theres to be no thought of sinking mr pilbrow i said but if theres something youll feel the better for ridding yourself of why say it and have done he turned stiffly in his place so that the spar rocked and looked at me where i sat behind him with a most yearning affection if you were entitled to the truth before he said how much more now when you have saved my life saved your life i exclaimed didnt you he answered didnt you risk your own by letting go to reach me when i might have pulled you down o nonsense i cried with a real laugh we should have both been in a bad way i dare say if harry hadnt had the sense to catch my foot he towed us in if theres any credit its to him he did the resourceful thing and you the brave persisted joshua i owe to him through you but to you first if i live i will honour that debt if i am to die in good time mr pilbrow i cried reassuringly this little contest had flushed and rallied us all in good time we arent going to give up i can assure you having come so far as this by gods providence answered the ex bookseller with unwonted devoutness only i feel that while i delay to tell you the devil struggles to hale me into the deeps out with it then i said lightly and lets crow to see him gnash his ugly teeth at being anticipated i realized that he was about to give us the long expected story with a shadowy abstract of which he had only as yet tantalized me and through me of course harry could we have had our curiosity satisfied under circumstances more tragically wet blanketing yet there was a providence in that no less the little sparks of inquisitiveness which survived in us expanded in the revelation to flames of heat which in warming us distracted our thoughts from our miseries i will not believe this opportuneness was accidental mercy in all the committee of destiny is jealous to keep to herself the casting vote i think his face fell the evil shadow i knew darkened on it a moment but almost in the same thought was gone he wrung his lips with his hand and heaved a profound sigh succeed then he said in a sad inspired voice succeed to the truth for which your father died and god spare you to find your inheritance a rich one if he will if for your most loyal faith in me dear child i could so requite you i could pass contented under the waters to the rest the land has denied me i am weary richard i am wearied to death and to lie floating off my legs appears beatitude he sighed again and setting his teeth in the very act forced himself frowningly and inexorably to his task i have hinted to you already he said that this long fever of my quest dates from abels disappearance with a certain book which contained the clue to an important secret hear then at last what that secret was and how it came into our hands my brother abel and i were twins and enemies partners and apart why i cannot tell look at two dogs of a litter quarrelling over a bone and seek for the reason there we thwarted one another at every turn we did and ruined our common business in a mutual spite you know as much yet in fairness i must urge that his was the more rancorous and vindictive spirit i would have cried halt sometimes but abel never he had the fiercer resolution he went armed i feared while i hated him the book in question was one of a packet over which we had perversely disputed in the sale room an old scorched and dogs eared commonplace book of the seventeenth century in contemporary crimson calf and bearing inside its cover the name of carolus victor chaplain in ordinary to his majestys prison of newgate yes you remember the name i once let it out unguarded well he was our inspirer as some morell or morant was your uncles there was nothing of note about this book it contained just the jottings and excerpta of a decent unremarkable man tips for homilies memoranda of last testaments mere personal data of a conscientious and commonplace clergyman whose lines had fallen in incongruous places with all that we have nothing to do our business is with a folded letter in the handwriting of this same carolus victor which ages ago had been slipped between the leaves and had there adhered through the melting of the wax with which it was sealed how had it got there i asked because he here came to a dramatic pause which seemed to challenge questioning ah he answered how and why it had remained undelivered i can submit only a plausible theory a second hand book shop gentlemen is a mine of reference research presently revealed to me that this carolus victor chaplain of newgate had died suddenly by presumption in that very year which dates not only his letter but the last entries in his diary where it was found suppose then the letter written by this victor and never delivered to him to whom it was addressed suppose the book containing it tied up unexamined with the deceaseds other manuscript effects and put away on some remote shelf and forgotten suppose some jealous no popery bookdealer snatching it years later from the flames of newgate and consigning it to his own store where in the excitement it was again forgotten till finally brought to light in the sale room a scorched and smoke stained packet to excite the ridicule of the dealers suppose anything or nothing conjecture and account as you will the fact remains that carolus victors commonplace book came intact and holding fast to its enclosure into our hands into our hands into our hands i say were we not brothers twins partners abel before bidding for it had known or guessed nothing of what the packet contained he had bought the lot a business transaction merely to spite me and yet now he would claim the whole fruits for himself a fury and excitement took the narrators voice at this point the heat he exhaled was communicated to us in part go on i said giving a vigorous kick into the water there was a letter in the book you say what was it about he struggled with himself a moment dropped his face into his hands with a groan looked up and resumed in a more ordered voice i am coming to it it is stereotyped on my brain all of its accursed riddle that is to say but the key it was dated newgate and was superscribed to one peachumn a doctor of divinity to whom you will always bear in mind it never was delivered from which honoured friend and counsellor the writer craved certain instruction and advice in a very private and particular matter he had had confessed to him that night he said a passing strange story by one vining a prisoner and grey in iniquity who was condemned to suffer on the morrow for piracy on the high seas this vining according to his own statement had been about the second decade of the century a student in the great english college of douai in france whence one winter he had been sent in company with an ordained brother collegiate on an extraordinary secret mission across the water to a little town on our east coast this mission said vining was nothing less than to recover if possible from its secret hiding place in the crypts of a certain long abandoned church a great treasure of gold pieces which had lain there ever since the suppression of the religious houses a suppression which in this case had but hardly anticipated a natural dissolution more complete for the church in question was it appeared already doomed when the kings edict fell lingering a relic of the greater past amidst the ruin of those eastern shores the sea had since taken its outworks and now the treasure the existence and depository of which had been made known through the death bed confidence of a former sacristan must be secured without delay if recovered it were to be at all richard it was secured by those two a loaded box of iron and then the madness of possession smote the wretched clerk in the darkness of the crypts he murdered his companion and in the darkness the curse of god fell upon him his hands were scarlet with consecrated blood he loathed to handle the price of his iniquity but like judas he cast it from him and with it hid the body of his victim in a place whence he hoped neither could again be brought to light to testify against him he paused and where was that i asked faintly an extraordinary fancy had taken possession of me a thought so stunning so bewildering in its first weak conception yet so explanatory if admitted of rampicks incomprehensible behaviour that i fairly shivered under it i looked dumfounded at harry he also if i was not mistaken had been smitten with a like shock of expectancy where was that i repeated and so innocently applied the match to this tow joshua did not answer to my surprise for a moment and then suddenly i was conscious of the flame rising and blazing in him where he shrieked give me the key if you pity me it is that has kept me hunting these long years ravenous like the dogs that devoured sin their mother and yet were unappeased give me the key give me rest or here and now the waters of oblivion for an instant i really believed he was going to rise and plunge had he done so i doubt if in our weakened condition we could have saved him a second time but in the thought he had clutched at himself once more and his passion grew inarticulate and ceased when at last he resumed his tale it was with a manner of some suffering shame richard he said touch me there and i am mad rebuke me with thine eyes sweet boy and i am sane and sorry i will not offend again listen the story breaks off with the night of our quarrel abels and mine he had discovered and was reading this letter spread out before him on the table when i came up unnoticed behind him and read over his shoulder the confession was all there to the flight of the murderer and his subsequent life of crime to the agony of his haunted soul and his desire in the shadow of death to make restitution some words by the chaplain followed some prayer of the weak soul to his stronger confidant to guide him in this pass whether for action or unconcern and at the foot of the sheet he ended with the words and the confessed place and deposit of this treasure are and there passed over the page and i never learned them was never to learn them richard some sound i made roused abel from his absorption he leapt to his feet cramming the paper into his pocket and faced me well where are they i asked smiling yet in that moment i knew he would never tell me miles under the sea probably by this time he answered you will understand that if you have pryed to any purpose abel i said quietly you are lying the place still exists or you would not wish to conceal its name from me well he said with an evil grin the book is mine and the secret with it you disputed its purchase remember i may have i replied but bought it is and with our money our money abel i will not yield my right to a share in it i advanced upon him i was hell inside though calm outwardly and as i came he pulled a pistol from his breast he was left handed like the crooked beast he was and held it at me i told you he always went armed richard i confess the creature appalled me he would have made nothing of shooting me like a dog i hesitated and then fell to entreaty expostulation threats he was grey and hard as steel in the end i must desist though still resolved to get at the paper by fair means or foul when he was gone in a hunger of agitation i threw myself upon the book it told me nothing of course i flung it down again and went to bed poisoned with black thoughts in the morning when i rose late and racked with fever i found him gone him and the book and the paper gone without leaving anywhere a trace of his direction i could not believe it for a time then madness took me i went up and down mouthing like a beast by day and night richard by day and night it was then i must inadvertently have fired the stock you know the rest he ended in a deep depression and burying his face in his hands set to rocking to and fro rest he suddenly cried no rest for me all these years i have pursued him a wicked laughing shadow in the likely places of the land always on these eastern coasts or near them exploring ruins or the histories of them recognizing at last my own madness yet unable to lay it and still the shadow flies before and still i follow myself a shadow again i looked at harry he understood and answered my mute inquiry yes tell him he said tell him if hell believe how hes been mistaken by a madman for the risen ghost of his brother yonder it was the conviction in both our minds it grew inevitably out of the tale just told us time place circumstance the combative brother who went armed the pistol clutched in the dead left hand these taken together with rampicks discovery of our discovery and his imagined identification of the dead invoked by us as he thought to rise and denounce him left us in no moral doubt whatever yet still the coincidence was so amazing i hesitated to commit myself i must take breath fencing a little longer with the truth mr pilbrow i faltered were you and abel so much alike he had started at harrys words and was sitting rigid awaiting my answer we were twins he said quietly scarce separable perhaps in feature unless by the lines which hate had chiselled to distinguish us his were deeper scored than mine and his dress i said how did he go dressed he bent over the step to stare at me he wore a blue coat richard why do you ask i gave a little gasp tell him said harry again wait a moment i fluttered why who could say mr pilbrow that thieves or the sea hadnt taken this treasure long ago abel he answered in the same voice abel the direct consignee of the secret which was sealed by carolus victor and never opened or delivered till it came to light in our parlour abel who knew this coast had written guide books about it misleading guide books indeed to me in my killing search and who was aware that the place the actual cach of the treasure still survived or why should he have sought to hide the truth from me and have fled in the night himself like a thief abel the cursed shadow that i follow and cannot run to earth o dick tell him cried harry once more mr pilbrow i broke out trembling with excitement i believe you have hunted counter i believe we can show you where your shadow lies it is in the hill under the abbey ruins and you must take off your curse from it chapter xii rescue confession discussion incredulity conviction with all their concomitants of amazement awe emotion were long over long put aside in reservation was the unsolvable problem of rampicks part in the dark mystery of the hill long had our last exhausted consideration of these questions lapsed into something like a silence of despair as we drifted with gentle lap and wallow over those immeasurable heart breaking wastes at least with harry and me i think hope had attenuated almost to the vanishing point brain sodden benumbed half lifeless grown near unconscious of time or place the instinct to hold on the power to keep at bay the last fatal drowsiness alone remained to us in ever diminishing degree we did not know in the confusion of our senses whether we were drawing inshore or to sea we did not know whether we were rocking an idle log virtually unprogressive or slipped into one of the coast currents and speeding silent on an interminable journey we could not tell the sick drawl of the hours for our watches had of course stopped but we dreaded horribly the time when dusk should fall if it should find us derelicts still and so it found us drooping down and closing in and then providence seemed hidden and we despaired i cannot picture indeed the terror of that darkening desolation the running fields of water spectral with foam fenced within an ever contracting cyclone of dusk devouring their own boundaries and committing us slowly to entombment in one final sepulchre of night it is all an impossible dream in my mind a sort of horrible pantomime in which a sense of induration of fixity while i watched grotesque figures born of my imagination come and go in my brain was ineffably dissolved by the spirit of the moon and changed into consciousness of heaven joshua i knew felt nothing of what we did except in a measure physically and even there the exultation in his soul was tonic to his body since our capping of his secret with our own he had been a changed creature a bent bow released and snapped upright it is difficult to describe his transformation his translation rather inspired as bottoms where had been sombreness depression some self deprecation was self assurance some rallying blitheness boisterousness almost he had been crushed and was expanded beaten and was triumphant that he should have run when near broke with the chase his shadow to earth and through me the son of the man whose memory he worshipped it was stupendous he could not contain his glee or discipline his expectancy now it had once burst those year long bonds he was convinced with more utterly convinced than us that the body was abels he would tolerate no suggestion of error and where the body was would be the book the clue finally the treasure i doubted if in all these generations it could still lie hidden there undiscovered and unravished he laughed my scepticism to scorn that vining would never have concealed the evidences of his crime in a place easy or inviting to be come at he declared probably indeed he had restored them to the original oubliette which i might make sure would have been chosen by the monks with a cunning genius for its inaccessibility either by smugglers or other casual squatters in their abandoned vaults moreover history or at least gossip might be trusted to have left us record of such costly treasure trove thus unearthed if unearthed it had been nevertheless he questioned us closely as to our underground observations which indeed had not been exhaustive but they were enough it appeared to confirm his assurance desire is the most credulous of all enthusiasts all this was before the last abandonment to despair had overwhelmed us harry and me and it was useful in helping us to a sort of fictitious endurance we might have succumbed sooner otherwise and actually foregone our living rescue he was so strong and hopeful so certain that destiny would not have led him thus far by such tortured ways only to see him founder when within sight of his goal that some part of his faith could not fail to communicate itself to us with vital results at the same time i think we shrunk from the merciless expression of his triumph our concern in revealing the truth as we supposed it had been with the tragic end of his brother not so his he had no sentiment for abel even now no pity for the fate which had overtaken him the best he could find to say about him was that he had paid the penalty and called quits and left the better man to come into his own not for himself that was the moral reservation after all which silenced and confounded us he longed for the treasure he gloated in the thought of its resurrection but now for my sake not his own with the prospect of its recovery instant in his mind he never wavered in his intention to bestow it all on the son of the man who had died to vindicate his honesty i could have laughed again over this tragic comical chimerical bequest to me only tears were too near the source of humour it was terrible and indecent and pathetic in one we sought life for no end but sweet lifes own the rest was a mockery well he kept us alive with it that i believe even after he himself was numbed and silenced from stimulating us from encouraging us by sympathy and example to prevail through hope he would keep nodding brightly to us to rally our spirits until his neck got too stiff to nod at all it must have been half past six and near the time of ebb when the spectral dark which engulphed us knew a change the fog lying low on the water grew slowly diaphanous waxing from a weak dawn like heaven seen through dying lids to a sweet and solemn lightness for long we were too exhausted body and mind to consider what this portended the lightness increased and suddenly high over the bank shone a little red spark like a lantern we lifted our dazed heads we stirred stiffly where we sat o god o god what did it mean swiftly it broadened glowing like a rising fire it mounted or the haze shrunk beneath it who could tell in a moment it was free and we knew it in wonder and thankfulness for the moon she was in her first quarter a child moon swelling into maidenhood slowly slowly she rose while we watched her gloating absorbed gradually the blush with which she had first observed us sole spectators of her girlish disrobing faded into a white glow of pity her tresses fell from her neck upon the sea the mist parting to let them by and were extended to us climb to me by them she seemed to whisper here is the way to hope and lo full in the midst of that shining path rode a little boat there was a man in it a solitary fisherman trawling for soles the agony of the moment gave us life and voice we screamed to him we waved we made every frantic demonstration that was possible to us in our condition he heard and saw us and he sat as if stricken ghostly leisurely we drifted past and the boat faded and became a phantom behind us we could not believe it we never ceased to cry out it was too hideous too cruel for truth harry with a dying effort half rose i dont know what desperate thought was in his mind hush i suddenly implored and we all became stone there was a little knock and paddle coming to us out of the mist in a moment the boat forged into sight approached us and hung off who be ye said a fearful voice we answered all together in a babble nay let me speak alone said joshua and he hailed the man clearly we went to visit the wreck on the sands we were abandoned there by a scoundrel and we have been floating on this spar ever since still the man was not convinced we could hear him distinctly spit into the water it is so his class exorcises all demons what might be your names now he asked cunningly here was a poser for the devil first of all master richard bowen began joshua hey interrupted the boatman with all his voice of wonder and he sculled rapidly up and alongside master he peered through the mist lord have mercy on s tis himself trewthfully old jacob i cried in a faint voice between laughing and sobbing old jacob help us off this before we die and after that i remember nothing chapter xiii rampick speaks you remember old jacob twas he seconded harry so unhandsomely in the great fight he had retired upon his savings now and did no work save when a still night persuaded him forth with line and trawling net and the loan of a friends boat could be procured such had been the case when we ran across him he had taken advantage of the holiday spirit which kept all afternoon farmers of the sea scrupulously away from it to pull a few miles out in a borrowed craft and try for a basket of fish to make a welcome garnish to his christmas pot he was lying when he picked us up off the banks some four miles from land in a southerly direction and in a few minutes was to have hauled in and returned home by so narrow a margin of providence were we acquitted in all these hours it appeared we had made no nearer the coast than this had just swung hither and thither gently drifting south on the whole and making two feet shoreward perhaps for every one we retired probably in the end we should have dropped sluggishly on the banks again unless the outward race of the tide more vicious than the inward had swept us over them in either case however the result would have been the same i believe another hour or two must have seen the finish of our endurance as it was i dont know how they got me on board harry with his stronger fibre rallied immediately under the excitement the strain off i collapsed that was the difference between us i was physically and mentally frozen i could not make an effort on my own account but lay on the planks my head on my friends knees listening in a sort of staring dream to the murmur of voices above me punctuated by old jacobs exclamations they were telling him i knew enough of the facts to explain our situation and i heard harry impress upon him the necessity of keeping all to himself until we had seen mr sant and learned what course he proposed to take old jacob made no demur he was honoured in their confidence for one thing and for another his admiration for his former master was still so unspeakable that he chuckled at the mere idea of temporarily sharing a secret with that great man harry questioned him about rampicks doings since our abandonment on the sands he knew nothing of the fellow had neither seen nor heard of him probably he thought if he were convinced no one had witnessed our departure he would after deserting us have pulled oblique up or down the coast to some outlying station on it in order to establish an alibi in case of inquiry he were free to go his gait without risk o being observed in these merry times said he reckon hes turned up late with his story of jack or jim visited and the wur rds spoke and mayhap some proof of what jack give him or jim lent to the very tune of innercence i heard them all their speech drummed on my brain as if it were parchment which was just what it felt like i lay staring at the light of the moon for my back was turned to the beautiful thing herself and i was not unhappy only utterly cold blooded i thought perhaps from my long semi immersion i had become a fish what a fate to go gasping through the world with round lidless eyes and ears palpitating like gills and never to feel warm again presently we came to shore and they tilted me up as if i were a board and stood me on end so that i could not help laughing but even then in the most extraordinary way cold air seemed to come from my lungs some one with a whisper and nudge as if to fire my interest pointed out to me a boat rampicks pulled up on the beach its sides gleaming wet in the moonshine i crowed and acquiesced very knowing about nothing as they seemed to wish me to be and then having my legs pointed out to me tried seriously to remonstrate with and command them for they were in the most drunken condition i supposed indeed that they were quite detached from me until between harrys and jacobs support i set them moving and then i understood that they still acknowledged my control and i was gigglingly interested in them looking down on them idiotically as they went splayed and giving and pulling themselves respectable over the hard they found the gap a tough business but once up and over it the descent beyond appeared a matter of moments while i was still chuckling to harry and failing in words to express to him what the joke was there close before our faces was the door of number three the playstow and i gaped and grinned and delightedly pointed out my discovery to my friends while i was yet in the act it opened hurriedly to a great surge of light and i saw the figures of uncle jenico and mr sant standing blowzed and flurried in the midst of the furnace suddenly they moved and came towards us and at that i tried to hail them with a shout of laughter but instead staggered and slipped down into their midst it was very restful after all and i thought i would stop where i was but the jangle of many voices worried me and i closed my eyes then instantly as it seemed to me i was lifted up and borne aloft and smothered in down or snow which embraced me very cold and peaceful the light sunk low and the voices to a whisper i was quite content so long as they would leave me packed there frozen but presently i was conscious that this was not to be something by creeping degrees tickled and bit and stung at my feet the poison rose giving me intolerable pain i moaned and cried and at the sound of my voice they lifted me up and poured fire down my throat the rising and the falling heat met it seemed at my heart and i believed it was consuming i struggled to beat out the flames to reproach these demons with their cruelty and then in a moment in a blazing swerve to consciousness i saw them they or their shadows leapt gigantic on the ceiling furious gnashing caricatures of my uncle mrs puddephatt mr sant fancy maria a furnace glared and reverberated behind them they sprang and held me down and rasped my limbs till they crackled and smoked from prayers and anguish i passed to frenzied defiance if they would torture me so pitilessly i would of myself stultify their efforts i felt the waters of revolt rising within me an instant and they gushed to the surface of my body putting out the fires all over surcease from pain a delicious oblivion overwhelmed me and i sank back and forgot everything once out of dreams of dewy meadows i awoke and found my hand in the hand of my uncle who sat beside the bed he was himself once more the real loving normal uncle jenico and i smiled drowzily on him and dropped away again a second time i awoke and there was fancy maria beside my pillow softly rubbing a smut into her nose with her thumb and repeating to herself the multiplication table to keep from nodding three sevens aint twenty four fancy maria i said and off i went again at last and finally after unravelling a great endless jest of a rope i stuck at a prodigious knot and gasped and opened my eyes i thought that last snore would finish you said a voice i sat up i was in bed in my own room the noonday sun glowed on the blind and squatted down before the dead embers of the fire sniggering like a bonanza was harry he rose yawning and came across to me all right he said right as a trivet hungry just youll do then think i should when ive had something to eat sweet is the constitution of youth it all came back to me now and without distress he sat down on the bed why whatever was up with you last night he asked curiously i dont know i answered shame faced didnt you feel it not much not in that way it was good enough for me to be safe i say you gave us a precious fright im very sorry i couldnt help it what happened was uncle jenico very put out about our not coming home near off his head i should think hed sent for sant nobody had heard or knew anything about us but of course they never supposed it was quite so bad as it was poor old chap i was an ass to go off like that well what was decided his face fell a little sombre sure youre in a fit state to hear o im all right i tell you it would worry me not to know very well then when wed got rid of you at last and had something to eat and drink we held a council of war mr paxton was in a rare state i think hed have liked to shoot that beast at sight id never thought he could be like that and i tell you it made me crow to see him but your friend joshua was for a postponement until he could visit the crypts he went through his whole story again just as hed said it to us we told your uncle everything of course from first to last and sant naturally and then he came down he would hear of no course but the direct one hed go straight up to the court for a warrant against rampick for attempted murder and after that to wring out and air the whole dirty business he didnt mind about risking his own popularity he didnt value at a brass piece the insane flummery of the treasure as he called it he and mr pilbrow near came to words about it and then what then i asked him for he had stopped i hardly like to tell you he said sure youre all right o yes of course i said impatiently do go on well wed all gone out on the step to see mr pilbrow off and he and sant were standing wrangling there when who should come slouching past but rampick himself i tell you he gave a screech and dropped in a heap where he stood we all ran out thinking him dead i dont know now whether he is or not it would be the best way out of it all perhaps i muttered maybe it would said harry they got help and carried him home and sant went with him hes been there ever since i think at least hes not come back here anyhow it stops the warrant business for the time and there we are nobody knows the real truth but old jacob and sant bound him to silence for the present weve been looking after you ever since young gentleman and here i am having taken my turn by the fire its very good of you you old idiot i said rather tremulously harry if if hes rested do you think you could send uncle jenico to me now he nodded comprehending perfectly and went out i dont intend to recount the meeting that followed if i had loved the old man before you may understand what penitence now made of my feelings i was painfully suspicious that that secrecy as to my own movements had been dictated rather by private selfishness than consideration for my relative certainly i had feared that had he been told of our purposed trip to the sands he would in his uneasiness of mind have put forward all sorts of objections even perhaps had i proved obstinate to a personal appeal to me not to desert him in his depressed condition and now supposing that eternal seal had been put on our actions what a heritage of mental torture of unfounded self accusations to impose on that blameless soul i ended by swearing that for the future no simplest scheme of mine should take shape without his sanction and then he was pacified though still while rampicks fate was undecided in a fever of nervousness to keep me within sight and touch i came down to dinner at which harry was an invited guest and made up handsomely for my late abstinence we had a merry meal though still in some perturbation as to mr sants prolonged absence during the course of it i suddenly found a huge scrawled on a scrap of paper lying on the table beside me a smutty thumb print in one corner informed me at once of the authorship three times seven fancy maria i said thats a good girl i knew youd come round to my point of view in the end she backed giggling out of the room and a heavy sound in the hall which followed endorsed so to speak by a pasty disc on her bustle when she reappeared showed us that she had sat down in the pudding but that fortunately was when we were at the cheese mrs puddephatt was genteel and a little distant in her visitations during the meal and finally with such spectral significance that uncle jenico though she had not spoken felt constrained to offer her a sort of apology theres something behind you think said he well candidly there is but its not exactly our secret as yet my dear woman when it is you shall have all the facts she gave a sharp wince as if suddenly recalled to herself with a pin and drawing herself up with her arms folded gazed at him with stony abstraction which you was addressing me mr paxton she said would you take the liberty now to repeat yourself much confused uncle jenico did ho she exclaimed with decision well i must believe my ears for the future i suppose when they accuses me of curihosity and pryingness into things which people no doubt has their very good reasons for keeping dark and not becoming to a decent woman to pollute herself with hearing i thank you for your consideration mr paxton venturing to remark honly as it were uncalled for me being the last person to worrit herself about her neighbours concerns nor accustomed in london to know so much as the name of the next door which is a feature of the metropulis neither hunderstood nor hemulated by provincial rustication im very sorry began uncle jenico i really thought permit me to say sir she broke in rather shrilly that you should not think about a woman at all save in the way of kindness and leastways not to adopt her to your fancies suspicion begets the shadows of its own rising mr paxton and with these enigmatical words she left us quite crushed and flabby we had hardly recovered indeed when steps outside woke us alert and the next instant mr sant entered he looked pale and worn and unshaved but his eyes lightened at sight of me sitting there rested and confident ha dick he said what a brave constitution you little dog is it fit for another strain yet do you think he came and put an affectionate arm over my shoulders is it fit he repeated while harry and uncle jenico stood wondering youve nothing else for him at present said my uncle suddenly and almost fiercely im not going to have him overtired sant the rector said hush and crossing over to see that the door was tight shut turned to us with his back against it hes dying he said it was a stroke or fit and the heart is just doing time for a little the hope of your forgiveness is all i do believe that keeps it going he looked intently at us none of us spoke he knows the truth now and in his turn confesses everything said the clergyman clearly he understands the terrible mistake he made his brain clears of its delusions in the searching atmosphere of death if you can forgive him forgive the great wrong he designed you he may be saved for god yet but there is no time to lose i felt that the blood had left my face making my head swim and my heart beat suffocatingly this was a hard relapse upon horror but had we not learned to hit and be hit and nurse no resentment i pulled myself together broughton regulations sir i said with a rather shaky smile come on harry lets go and find mr pilbrow and bring him too stay said our tutor in a very sweet voice ive fetched him already hes waiting outside now he will abide by your decision richard then let him be my dear boys deputy to forgive spoke up uncle jenico sharply theres no occasion to submit richard to this fresh ordeal mr sant looked at me hes got a bad enough road to go uncle i said i dont want to lay up more remorse for myself well cheer him on his way come mr sant my uncle uttered what sounded like an oath but he objected no further in manus tuas domine commendo spiritum suum i heard him mutter viciously and i ran up and shook his hand hard and hurried out in the little garden we found joshua he understood without a word he was very sombre but quiet and glad by his glistening eyes to see me well we hastened up the village street news of our mission had got abroad vague and speculative as yet for jacob had been loyal but the people we passed looked at us covertly and curiously scenting strange revelations in the air the ex smuggler lived was dying in a little cottage up a squalid alley near the head of the village it was a poor dreary hovel the mere lair of a beast self degraded god forsaken his wretched wife the real scapegoat of his sins took us in to him hes dyin hard she said in a thin fretful voice hard as a lord wi the whole world to lose he allers was above his station was jole lived on dreams he did i mind the time he promised me a kerridge and now well be bad set to find a hearse he sat propped up under a frowzy patchwork quilt a silhouette under broken glass was clutched in one of his hands the whole man was sunk in upon his frame his breath always difficult to him to draw laboured heavily his eyes in their livid halos were quite unearthly the woman went to him and made some show of easing the coverlet on his chest i was telling the gentlemen she said shrilly that time was we was to have our kerridge and now summut less than a hearse must serve he nodded and moved his ashy lips and fingered the picture in his hand hes daft on it she said turning to address us tis our little martha gentlemen took at the fair before her going i tell him he neednt look to join her where she sings among the angels he should have thought about it earlier if he wanted to curry favour better to pass on what he can get from you if so be as youre agreeable i felt a sudden thickness in my throat we forgive you mr rampick i cried out and hung my head and turned in dumb entreaty to mr sant he hurried to the bed head and put a gentle manly arm about the dying sinner do you hear rampick he said as god witnesses they forgive you the smuggler moved his exhausted hands mr sant understanding lifted them both for him in an attitude of prayer mr pilbrow he said softly he wants you to hear the truth if possible from his own lips will you come joshua moved up and knelt by the bed we all heard the broken gasping confession tuk you fur him i did twas in the days afore the arthquake we had our store where you know in the underground vaults of th old abbey over above in the hopen was a knot of arches running together like the bow ribs of a ship and set in the pavement under in a dark corner behind ruins were a stone moving on a pivot what let down him as knew the trick by a flight of steps to the crypts the powder was kep handy just below and beyond in th old cellars running seaward till they bruk off in a choke of ruin behind the cliff face lay the tea and brandy at that time we was a good deal chafed as one might call it what with a revenue cutter and a sloop of war to back it our last run had been a run fur life and at the end it were touch and go to get the stuff housed and in the thick of the excitement who should be sprung upon us as we thought but a spy he come from nowhere it seemed he was just up there one day poking and prying among the ruins and i see him for hours he went sniffing round while i watched secret he squinted and he tapped and he went in and out cautious and sometimes hed stamp on the ground and listen fur the holler echer with his ear down like a dog then by and by off he went on tiptoe and i follered tracken en to the flask they could tell me nothing about en there save as hed walked over by his own statement from yokestone the thing looked as black as hell and what we done we done in justice to ourselves as we thought because we was druv to it i had no hand in what follered i wouldnt have i never could abide the sight of death we was stowing the last of the cargo by starlight when i see the man agen he was setting behind a stone his eyes shining like a cats upon each of us tradesmen as we disappeared down the hole we was druv to it as we thought and tuk our plans cautious and seized en he was a cat he was we bled a few on us but we got en down he screeching all the time about some treasure he was come arter and then i left en and went up to keep watch i couldnt stand what i knew was to foller im a peaceable man by disposition i am it was a providence arter all fur i hadnt abin there not a minute when all hell bruk underneath me and went out with a roar the blessed ground heaved itself like so much bed clothes the arches come thumping down and all in a noise as if the almighty was a tearing of his world to tatters i were spilt on my face lucky fur me id moved away to git out o earshot of the thing under and when i come to my senses i didnt know myself or the place i crep home dazed like to bed and kep it fur a week hearing of the arthquake but i knew in my heart what had happened some fool had fired the powder and closed up the hill it were so i was sure when i come at last to look it seemed all fallen in upon itself where the passage had been were just a shipload of ruin the half of it turned over and sunk into the herth i never believed from that moment till the day i seen it proved otherwise that so much as a babby could find its way agen into them shattered vaults but the lord has his way he ended amidst a deep silence and sank back exhausted joshua got quietly to his feet you are forgiven rampick he said by me and by us all make your peace with god mr sant motioned to us silently we filed out and left the dying and his minister alone chapter xiv what the letter said we were all sitting very sombrely in the gloaming when mr sant came in to us there was no need to question anything but his face yes he said it is over god give him mercy by common consent we would speak no more on the subject until nature had been restored there was a scent of battle not to speak of eggs and bacon in the air which inspired us somehow to brace up our loins before the ordeal tea was on the table and we sat down to it and presently were doing justice to uncle jenicos plentiful fare then refreshed and reinvigorated we pulled our chairs to the fire and the ball began now mr pilbrow opened the rector cautiously what is your next move to find and search my brother abels body answered joshua prompt and perfectly cool what is yours to go straight to the squire and put the whole matter into the hands of the law said mr sant you will give me a day or two first no one day no joshua scrambled to his feet and went to and fro this is intolerable sir it is my brother who was done to death and the cause is mine it is the cleansing of my parish sir and the cause is mine i must secure my treasure first sir your treasure be i am sorry to say mr sant went the whole length of the expression your parish said joshua viciously has postponed its cleansing six years a couple of days longer wont spoil it it would spoil my conscience in my own eyes mr pilbrow i do not compound a felony now i know of it for an hour then go at once sir to be consistent and to satisfy your conscience defraud this orphan your pupil of his just indemnification the clergyman rose to his feet indemnification for what sir he said very sternly for the loss of his fortune of his father sir said joshua as resolutely who to vindicate the truth died and left him bankrupt of his legitimate expectations uncle jenico shifting nervously in his seat put in a pacifying word the truth is the dear old fellow had been in a suppressed state of excitement ever since our visitors first dark allusion to his mission on these coasts had begun to shadow itself out into some form and substance sant he said i think you must be reasonable we dont stand first in this matter the treasure nonsense interrupted the clergyman loudly do you credit a word of the stuff to be sceptical without knowledge the boast of fools cried joshua repeating himself hush said uncle jenico sant hadnt we better first learn from mr pilbrow how he proposes to act in event of the the clew really coming to light the rector was silent you are an adept in matters of conscience sir said the bookseller bitterly and rather violently there was no question of hurry when you wanted to use us to help you smuggle a soul into salvation i wont say that if id foreseen your intention i should have postponed my forgiveness till id gone to the hill and verified the mans words but i do say that in acting on a generous impulse without a thought of possible consequences to myself i was playing a better christian part than you who had this damning sequel in your mind all the time harry very restless cried out here sensibly enough arent we rather fighting in the dark it maynt be mr pilbrows brother that was the supposed spy after all in which case theres no question of treasure i think hes the right to go and see first before any steps are taken i beg your pardon sir mr sant sighed his brow lightened and he patted the boys shoulder approvingly good fellow he said no doubt it would be best to clear the air of this fantastic stuff before we begin to set our house in order then he turned to joshua genially i beg your pardon mr pilbrow i was betrayed into some unwarrantable heat i confess we look at this matter from different points of view but that is not to say that mine is necessarily the right one indeed you have given me a lesson in christianity to which i seem to make i admit a scurvy return the little bookseller bowed grimly still but without answer if then said the clergyman biting under the irony that would make itself felt in his words you find this clew find this marvellous deposit of wealth there are laws of treasure trove you cannot think for a moment that i will that i can counsel secrecy allow richard to share in the profits of a felony felony sir cried joshua is not that what a hoodwinking of the law would amount too you agree with me mr paxton yes yes o yes of course assented uncle jenico faintly harkee mr parson cried joshua in a heat i throw the word in your teeth i am no suborner sir no nor glorifier of my own ignorance neither be sure i dont know the law better than you before you tax me in advance with cheating it well well said mr sant smiling i dont know the law on the subject i confess then take this sir for your rebuke said the other sourly and be less apt for a clergyman to damn without book the law of england i do know it and have reason to takes its definition of treasure trove from the jurist paulus who lays down that vetus depositio pecuniae cujus dominus ignoratur that is to say ancient concealed treasure of which the lord of the soil is ignorant becomes being discovered the property of the crown if presumptively deposited by some one who at the time intended to reclaim it exactly put in mr sant and yet in the face of will you permit me interrupted the bookseller with a manner of most frosty sarcasm for all your cloth sir i would not have you on a jury lest you stopped the case before hearing the other side the rector muttered an apology he really did look abashed i say repeated joshua that the crown to prove its title to treasure trove must prove the depositors intention to reclaim first where that is wanting or where an intention to abandon can be shown as when the goods were thrown away in a panic or for other reason to be rid of them the treasure remains wholly and solely in the possession of the finder very well said mr sant plucking up heart and what benefit is that alternative to you what benefit to me cried joshua have you heard my story sir did you listen to it did you hear me quote the man vinings confession that he had abandoned the price of his iniquity and cast it from him mr sant reflected he was getting interested i was sure after all tis a subtle legal point i think said he i foresee anyhow fine complications even if you had evidence which you have not of this intention to abandon which i have not repeated joshua at present and which i shall never have to the right effect if your delicate conscience can forestall me you are unnecessarily sarcastic sir said the clergyman gravely you must give me the credit of my intentions this augean stable in our midst it must be cleaned out as soon as recognized or i become an accomplice in its condition why should any prompt summoning of the sweeper of our legal hercules affect your position because sir said joshua vigorously he would a thousand to one lay bare in so drastic a process the golden deposit underneath and so rob me of any title to its discovery mr sant grunted uneasily the better title is certainly yours he conceded i believe there was enough of the imaginative boy yet left in him to thrill and respond to this exciting legend of gold uncle jenico felt the change and fell back glistening and softly rubbing his hands together mr pilbrow said the clergyman suddenly and decisively will you tell me plainly what you propose i propose said joshua as instantly to visit and identify and search the remains of my unhappy brother to morrow i propose to take advantage of the letter which i am convinced will be found on them and which by every right is legally mine to secure the treasure after that sir let in your hercules with a fire hose if you will i shall be content for my part possession is eleven points in the law and for the twelfth i will go to pitch and toss with it sant that is certainly fair cried out uncle jenico impulsively and immediately fell abashed a longish silence ensued very well said our dear rector at last i will agree to defer my action till after to morrow but on condition that once having secured his wonderful haul mr pilbrow openly challenges the law to deprive him of it it is buying a pig in a poke i believe but i must guard myself by insisting he uttered a rather enjoying laugh which he tried to make ironic thats capital said uncle jenico you dont object to the condition mr pilbrow no said joshua shortly i ask for complete secrecy in the mean time that is all that mans wife she will say nothing said mr sant the honour of her poor rogue is safe with her then we fell excitedly to discussing ways and means the embargo once off my conscience i was eager to join in the search but here uncle jenico was quite absolute and imperative in vetoing my taking any part in it he would not on any condition whatever have me descend into the hill again i was disappointed but he was unshakable and in the end i had to submit it was finally arranged that mr sant joshua and harry should meet early on the following morning and complete their expedition if possible before the village was awake and on this understanding at a latish hour we parted the next day was christmas eve i had never known one to drag so wearily uncle jenico and i were up betimes and making a show of following with serenity our customary occupations but it was all a transparent pretence i took no more interest in my books nor he in his new invention than if they had been prison tasks we just perspired for the return of one or other of the party to put an end to our intolerable suspense and that was the beginning and end of it at last a shadow danced on the window and the door opened and harry hurried in in the first sight of his face we read momentous news i could hardly control myself as i said well he had shut the door behind him and stood there breathing quickly his eyes like white pebbles harry i whispered was it abel yes and the letter was there yes in his pocket he i could hardly look he seemed to fall to pieces and and it said where yes youll never believe where in the well in the in the well what fools we were never to think of that before of course it stood at the end of the crypts once the most natural place for him to throw them into his them seemed to hit me in the throat i had forgotten about the murdered priest i stood gaping like an idiot lost in the plain marvel of the thing i had forgotten uncle jenico till his voice speaking in a queer shaky way recalled me to the thought of him my wrench he said they will have sunk to the bottom we shall have to pull it down thats just what were going to do said harry to night after every ones asleep chapter xv out of the depths the village was long asleep when at last we issued forth as blamelessly agitated a body of brigands as ever trod the corridors of night we had taken our measures with infinite precaution so that not a hint of our designs should leak out yet still we had delayed sitting like the party in the parlour all silent and all damned while dunberry sunk into deep and deeper unconsciousness of our conspiracy in its midst we were assembled in fact in the rectors study joshua mr sant himself my uncle and we two and there we stuck spelling out the blessed quarters until the chimes of the school clock coming in a flurry out of silence called up a single rebukeful stroke from time and subsided upon it so late as this an hour after midnight had we resolved to linger to make assurance double sure and at the sound with a great pouf of relief we were on our feet and tingling to depart there had been no longer any question of course since our learning where the treasure was or should be concealed of my foregoing my share in the attempt to recover it no possible peril within reason could attach to this purely open air sport though indeed uncle jenico had made even now some presumptive risk to me the excuse for his joining us in the expedition it was a question at this last if he or mr sant were the more excited our dear comical tutor and sceptic still made a show it is true of subscribing to a madness in order to humour a party of lunatics under his charge but this affectation i do believe took in none of us was it not he in solemn fact who had insisted upon the necessity of this postponement of the foray until the small hours was it not he who had manuvred to enwrap our plans in a profound mist of secrecy was it not he who had appointed the present rendezvous with a masterly eye to contingencies as to wit his house stood remote and we could reach the sea front from the back of it without ever touching the village a french window gave from his study upon the garden to the rear there was a little hand cart for luggage in a shed in this garden which cart offered itself apt to a dual purpose a to convey down to the shore a pick and a shovel together with uncle jenicos colossal wrench which under pretence of its being submitted to some test had already been brought to the rectory b to serve as vehicle for the carrying back of the treasure on the top of all which i ask you was mr sant the incredulous humourist he professed to be whatever he thought however uncle jenico was patently and irresistibly the enthusiast of the undertaking he stumped along dear soul his face one moon of hilarity the adventure was to his very heart to be called upon in such an enterprise to advertise the merits of such an invention his own it was unspeakable beyond expectation he laughed constantly holding my arm and rebuking me for being a sluggard when i tried to regulate his pace lest he upset himself harry trundled the cart making the softest track he could manage under the hill towards the gap it was a brilliant moonlit night with a singing wind we had brought lanterns but had no need of them it was near as bright as day indeed and we sped rapidly on our course never having need to pause or pick our way till we reached the sands the great shaft of the well when we stood over against it seemed to topple towards us tragically anticipating its doom the sight of it so lonely and so ancient in this moon drowned solitude thrilled me with a sort of pity it had stood so long baffling the winds and tides foregathering with such generations of dead and departed ghosts and now at last mans cupidity was scheming to compass the final ruin of what nature had been impotent to wreck ah a more fatal force than any storm the one against which no monument however venerable is proof if the others were touched by this spirit of regret they were sensible enough to subordinate it to the inevitably practical while i was literally mooning they had already lifted the wrench from the barrow and were busy under uncle jenicos directions getting it into position on the sand i can only hastily elucidate the idea of this machine pinned to a sort of frame or trestle which was anchored all round with stout grapnels and shored up in front against a bracket was a ships steering wheel which the inventor had picked up cheap at a marine auction a good rope length indefinite to be passed round the subject of the proposed haulage and its two ends then carried to the wheel and clamped one on each side to its rim completed the design so disposed nothing remained but to turn the wheel by its spokes when the rope would garrotte the object and mechanically contracting of itself induce a forward strain now i know little about scientific values but certainly in this case the result justified the means as you shall hear we had got all in place but the rope and then suddenly mr sant drew himself up scratching his head in an unclerical manner whereabouts is it to be passed round he said o answered uncle jenico as high up on the shaft as one can reach my good man cried the rector sarcastically do you really imagine we are going to haul that thing over by tugging at its base or near it it is tottering already it is laid bare to its lowest course these boys examined and proved it answered uncle jenico nevertheless i could see he was taken by surprise and dismayed that may be said mr sant but he paused shrugged his shoulders and laughed out comically o it will never do he said we must give this insanity a better chance by hook or by crook we must get the thing fixed up near the top i started forward ill carry the rope up sir i know the way harry and i climbed it once before no cried uncle jenico sharply and decisively i wont have you go on any account richard then its to be me cried harry and as i muttered discontentedly trying to block his way he evaded me and ran for the shaft mr sant trailing the rope followed him and in a moment they were under its shadow i chafed watching them but my relative was inexorable and indeed to speak truth there was considerably more risk in the venture than formerly before the storm harry however accomplished his part in safety and while he still dwelt aloft holding the loop in place mr sant captured the two ends of the rope and came running towards us with them in a moment we had pulled them taut and clamped them in place to the wheel and then we hailed harry to come down which he did rather with a run so afraid was he of missing any detail of the sport uncle jenico had already given a half turn to the wheel in order to clinch the hold of the rope and now he stood in a tense eagerness dwelling on the psychologic moment he held by right of patent the larboard spokes mr sant the port the dear old man was so wrought up out of feebleness that i was apprehensive of the part he insisted upon taking in the manipulation of his own design he would not be denied however and who could have had the heart to disappoint him was not this the very first time that his genius for invention promised him a harvest of gold he took a long breath and tightened his hold on the spokes joshua stood rigid awaiting the result harry and i shook on wires staring from the wrench to the shaft and hardly stifling the exclamations that rose to our lips it was a solemn moment go cried uncle jenico and the wheel spun a little stiffened and began to cry ominously something cracked thank heaven it was only uncle jenicos braces the old man tugged and puffed wrestling with his task suddenly he staggered the wheel seemed to give and spin away from him and he was almost on his face in the same moment i fancied the shadow of a night bird had crossed my vision and i looked and where had been the well was nothing it was fallen prone upon the sand so wearily so softly that in that humming wind no sound of the concussion had reached us hardly suppressing a cry of triumph we dropped everything and raced for the place the shaft in falling had broken into three pieces of which the middle one was in a proportion of two fourths the fracture nearest the base was only three or so inches in width but the top fragment was quite detached and tilted over a little away from the neck where the shaft had stood was surprisingly little scar in the ground nothing to see in fact but a pyramid of sand which had run from the stuffed base of the well in its parting upon this we flung ourselves scrambling and scraping like children about a burst sugar cask we clawed as badgers claw throwing the draff behind us a hole opened under our furious assault and sunk and deepened and revealed nothing we ran for the tools and picked and dug like madmen presently mr sant threw down his shovel we are feet below the well bottom are you satisfied at last mr pilbrow he said really in a quite quarrelsome way he had been cheated he felt of the fruits of his own condescension no snarled joshua im not here was mud perhaps once it was a loaded box of iron we know that it may have sunk far mr sant laughed offensively the best of us bear awakening from engaging dreams badly as for me i had desisted from working when he did and was sitting disconsolately on the lower part of the shaft fumbling with my fingers in the fracture all in a moment the blood seemed to rush to my heart making me gasp i jumped to my feet here it is i screeched ive found it i felt it my fingers burrowing through the crack into a choke of sand had touched upon the iron bound corner of a box they were all up and swarming about me directly one by one quite cavalier to each other in their eagerness to dive and feel they exclaimed and fell back some people say that colours are indiscernible by moonlight i can answer for the flush which suffused our rectors cheek as he looked at joshua but it was uncle jenico who commanded the situation we must rope this lowest piece and pull it away from the other he cried full of bustle and excitement what a providential thought was this wrench of mine hey my boys ha ha it was brilliantly the obvious course and at the word we were all scurrying to put it into execution uncle jenico directing us in a perfect and quite lovable rapture of self importance he and i when the rope had been readjusted to its new position hurried to manipulate the machine while the others remained to watch the result of our efforts on the huge pipe of masonry we seized the spokes right said my uncle with a laugh of joyous confidence now i dont know if the first test had amounted to no more than a little soft extra persuasion applied to an already tottering article i know only that that success was not to be repeated right said uncle jenico and the wheel turned under our hands tightened and began to scream as before only infinitely more distressfully we strained our mightiest putting our backs into it it gives i think said uncle jenico in a suffocating voice and with the word an explosive lash whistled by my ear the machine bounded and pitched and there were we rolling on the sand amidst a mad wreck of everything we were neither of us hurt uncle jenico sat up ruefully mr sant came running to us across the sand anybody killed he panted as he rushed up nobody by gods mercy it was the nearest shave if i had had a whisker it would have been shorn off i think the rope had snapped like a piece of string and we were right in the path of its recoil anyhow i suppose we moved the thing a little said uncle jenico not an inch was the answer eh cried my uncle i cant understand it must have severed itself on a sharp stone i suppose that was the case without doubt said the clergyman kindly well theres nothing for us now but to take pick and shovel and dig out the pith of the thing it will take a little longer thats all indeed we found the other two once assured of our safety already hard at the job it proved a tough one for the silt inside from long pressure was grown as compact as mortar and every fragment of it had to be chipped off and pulled away a difficult matter when from the depth of our boring it was no longer possible to wield the pick however we got through it taking turns at the tools and working now by lantern light for the end of the great trunk was turned from the face of the moon suddenly harry when he and i were once more hammering and shovelling together uttered a stifled sound and scrambled up so quickly as half to fracture his skull against the roof of the tube then holding his head and squatting out backwards he gingerly raked after him a little white thing a human bone i scuttled to join him and we all looked at one another were coming to it muttered mr sant and almost on the instant as we plunged in again to resume our burrowing the end was wrought a slab of concreted stuff falling detached to our renewed blows and tilting outwards let down an avalanche of loosened sand and slipping on its torrent what we did not wait to discriminate the dead it seemed to us only had come sliding and chuckling to meet us half way with his here we are again like a clown its there gasped harry as we stood up outside some one else must fetch it not me i wont joshua dived on the instant we heard him scuffling and chattering inside and then he emerged the rope he cried like a madman fetch it a bit of it anything i ran off unknotted the shorter length from the wreck of the machine and returned with it to him he disappeared again into the tunnel drawing the slack after him and in a minute reissued unkempt and agitated beyond measure and disposed us all to haul without a question we obeyed and at his word set our shoulders to a simultaneous tug slowly the capture responded to our efforts and drew out heavily into the open a great iron ribbed box with the upper half of a human skeleton chained to it by the neck joshua seized the pick and before mr sant could stop him had parted at a blow the skull from its vertebr it leapt and settled grinning up at us from the sand that was basely done said our rector take your spoil sir these poor remains are my concern joshua had thrown away the tool and was standing as if petrified looking down on the chest it might have measured a yard by two feet and some two feet and a half in depth the wood under the corroded clamps of iron was spongey half eaten by water and half eaten preserved in sand but of the immense antiquity of the whole there was no question we must secure what of these bones we can said mr sant well dick well harry his quiet appeal overcame our repugnance once more we grovelled and groped in the bowels of the well it was a gruesome task but we fulfilled it excitement no doubt an eagerness to be done with it and so earn the sweeter reward of adventure stimulated us at the end we had found and gathered into a heap outside all evidence that remained to mortality of that ancient deed of murder it made ones brain swim to look down on this wonderful tragic salvage of the centuries it was all true then all true and destiny had made us her instruments in this unspeakable resurrection all this time joshua and even my uncle had remained as if tranced now suddenly the former raised his voice in a shrill ecstatic cry poor abel poor fool come let us load up what are we waiting for it was evident he was wrought far beyond any susceptibility to moral warning or rebuke the rector perceived this i think and submitted himself to circumstance the truck was hurried up and the chest placed upon it it needed our united efforts to raise the thing and at our every stagger joshua sawed out a little jubilant laugh we gathered the tools and the ropes and the ruin of the wrench and piled all on top then we disposed the broken skeleton amidst and started on our way home it was a hard pull now though we all gave a hand to it three oclock had struck when at last exhausted and agitated we drew the little cart cautiously up to the study window and unloaded it of its weightest burden leaving the rest temporarily outside while we examined our haul the box had been stoutly fastened and secured but the wood being shrunk away from its clamps rendered our task an easy one a little wrenching with forceps and the whole lid came apart sinking upon the floor with a dusty clang and then sleeking and glinting through a dust of perished rags piled to the throat and kept burnished by the sand that had filtered in a glut of gold gold in rouleaux and ingots gold in sovereigns and ryals gold in angels and rose nobles near all of henry the sevenths and henry the eighths reigns and of incalculable antiquarian apart from their intrinsic value gold in patens gold and more in a jewelled ciborium chased gold and ivory in an exquisite chalice with handles and little queer figures of saints in rich enamel gold in such wealth as we had never dreamt the vessels had been wrapped it appeared in soft skins of suckling calf vellum which had long crumpled into a floury meal keeping all bright as blossoms preserved in sand and easy to dust and blow away we felt fairly drunk with the sight as we gazed down spell bound into that brimming reservoir of all wealth and then suddenly mr sant had fallen upon his knees o lord he prayed in a low half agonized tone teach thy servant to deal rightly with this converting it to fair uses and justifying himself of thy generosity a little dead silence followed and at the end joshua bowed his head and raising his hands clasped together cried twice in a firm voice amen and so at last was consummated that wonderful and tragic tale of mystery and fatality which had begun for me in the old court house of ipswich truly other things than hanging and wiving go by destiny conclusion there was a sequel which i must relate stories of recovered treasure if true like this do not always end with the emotional unities and the final chapter morning does not always bring a confirmation of pious resolves a little sourness of digestion sometimes impairs the glamour of last nights feast of righteousness that is the deuce of it now i will not say that joshua repudiated in the slightest reality the sense of that amen of his but once awake and restored to the full realization of his possession he certainly did try to back out of his undertaking to challenge the law to deprive him of it not unscrupulously not in the least he merely strove to convince mr sant as to the actual letter of that law and consequently of the quixotry of calling upon it to establish his claim probably at considerable expense to both sides to do what was already by its own decreeing indubitably his but he was entirely unsuccessful the rector seeing in this only a personal obstructive policy designed to shackle that main moral question of the cleansing of his augean stable utterly declined to forego his bond and wrung a promise out of my reluctant relative himself that i should not be allowed to touch a penny of this treasure until it could be proved well gotten so joshua forced at last to give way though with a very ill grace sent in his notice to the ipswich coroner in the mean time the process of cleansing was carried through with all despatch the hill was cleared at some risk of its tragic impedimenta which after a jury had sat on them and brought in a verdict of accidental death were consigned to rest in the churchyard abels with some distinction in a separate grave the whole story was wrung out at the inquest and aired and hung up on the lines for gossips to find holes in and gradually the village with the entire country side to boot subsided from its fever heat of excitement which was only to suffer a temporary recrudescence in the cause clebre which came presently to provide the epilogue one day a tax cart a coroners clerk a posse of insurance office firemen and a couple of cavalrymen from the barracks to escort the whole appeared before the rectory and removing the treasure box well encased and sealed from the clerical strong room where it had lain perdu since its discovery mounted that and joshua in the vehicle and incontinently drove away with both we saw him go sitting darkly on the top of his coffin like a dyspeptic jack sheppard being jogged off to tyburn and thereafter for a desperate week or more heard or saw nothing of him then one day a great trumpeting and cheering in the street brought us all out pell mell and there he was worshipful in the repute of fabulous riches being carried shoulder high he had won his cause and through whom do you think why mr quayle the little qc accompanied the procession and shared in its triumph joshua had alighted on him quite accidentally in ipswich and revealing to him everything not without an ironic satisfaction one may be sure in returning at this eleventh hour a rowland for his oliver had engaged him to conduct his case and he had done it and won it and the treasure was ours out of the mouths of babes and sucklings said the little man meeting me again with delight richard i am rebuked i once said you were the son of your father but not so good a lawyer i withdraw the riservation entirely you could see further than some of us into a stone wall to think now that your friend spoke the truth through ut all ill never trust the evidence of me nine senses again five is ut well i was thinking of the muses i suppose tis a weakness i have and will prove my undoing in the end never you bother about the girls richard they spoil your law i have only a word or two to add i am afraid to declare what that box of gold realized the sum anyhow was so large as to enrich us all a great part of its treasures was distributed into the cabinets of collectors the beautiful chalice finding its way i believe at an immense figure into the museum of a famous cardinal and virtuoso in rome from the total proceeds joshua handsomely presented to harry the equivalent of a comfortable income which was the means of helping my dear friend to the very satisfactory position to which he attained a few years later in london for me he held the residue nominally in trust till i was come of age when he proposed to establish himself and uncle jenico as pensioners on my bounty the question was one merely of terms we made in fact our common home together until the end even after i had so far neglected mr quayles advice as to bother my head very much indeed about one girl and to wive her into the bargain we had left dunberry soon after the events narrated above taking mrs puddephatt with us for housekeeper and not forgetting fancy maria for some time i understand after our departure the famous crypts were a gazing stock attracting so many visitors that in the end mr sants dearest wish was realized and a popular watering place established on the foundations of the old smugglers haunt but long before that the vaults had been closed as unsafe by councillors authority and at this day only a deep depression in the soil above denotes the spot under which the tragedy of abel pilbrow was enacted so the old order changes all that is to say but uncle jenico who is engaged at this moment very bent and white in demonstrating to my little boy the
