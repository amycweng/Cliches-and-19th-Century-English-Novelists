of montrouge xv the salad course notes adventures of the comte de la muette chapter i the waxworks one morning i awoke in la bourbe and looked across at deputy bertrand as he lay sprawled over his trucklebed his black hair like a girls scattered on the pillow his eyelids glued to his flushed cheeks his face all blossoming with dissipation set into the expression of one who is sure of nothing but of his own present surrender to nothingness beside him were his clothes flung upon a chair the tricolour sash emblematic stole of his confused ritual embracing all and on a nail in the wall over his head was his preposterous hat the little carte de civisme stuck in its band casimir bertrand one time casimir bertrand de pompignan i had known and been friendly with at le plessis later he had imbibed theories had become successively a lameth a feuillant a jacobina constitutionalist a moderate an extremist had spouted in the faubourgs and overflowed in sectional committee rooms had finally been elected to represent a corner of the statesgeneral i had known him for a pious prig a coxcomb a reckless bonvivant he was always sincere and never consistent and now at last in the crisis of his engaging sanscullotism he had persuaded me a proscribed royalist to take an advantage of his friendship by lodging with him then it was that the drivingforce behind his character was revealed to me it was militant hedonism like mirabeau he was a strange compound of energy and voluptuousness he turned altogether on the nerves of excitement he was like a clock lacking its pendulum and he would crowd a dozen rounds of the dial into the space of a single hour such souls racing ahead of their judgment illustrate well the fable of the hare and the tortoise and necessarily they run themselves down prematurely casimir was an epicure with a palate that could joyfully accommodate itself to black bread and garlic a sensualist with the power to fly at a word from a hotbed of pleasure to a dusty desert of debate undoubtedly in him did i make him the mirror to my conscience and in a certain crpin with whom i came subsequently to lodge and who was of the type only a step lower in the art of selfindulgence i had an opportunity to see reflected a very serious canker in the national constitution now he opened his eyes as i gazed on him and shut them again immediately it was not his habit to be a slugabed and i recognised that his sleep was feigned the days of his political influence were each pregnant of astonishing possibilities to him and he was too finished an epicure to indulge himself with more than the recuperative measure of slumberfrothed perhaps with a bead of sthetic enjoyment in the long minute of waking casimir i called softly but he pretended not to hear me what my friend the sun is shining and the eggs of the old serpent of pleasure will be hatching in every kennel he opened his eyes at that fixed and unwinking but he made no attempt to rise let them crack the shells and wriggle out he said i have a fancy they will be a poisonous brood and that la bourbe is pleasantly remote from their centres of incubation timorous i would not lose a thrill in this orgy of liberty but if you lost he checked himself pursed his lips and nodded his head on the pillow jeanlouis i saw the sieur julien carried to the scaffold last night he went foaming and raving of a plot in the prisons to release the aristocrats in their thousands upon us there is an adder to reproduce itself throughout the city truly as you say the kennels will swarm with it and many will be bitten my friend my friend there is some dark knowledge in that astute head of yours and shall i cower at home when my kind are in peril my faith we all cower in bed but i am going out be advised he struggled quickly up on his elbow his face bore a clammy look in the sunlight be advised and lie close in your formlike a hare jeanlouislike a hare that hears the distant beaters crying on the dogs twitch no whisker and prick not an ear take solace of your covert and lie close and scratch yourself and thank god you have a nail for every fleabite what ails thee of this day then morose what ails this paris why the prussians are in verdun and the aristocrats must be forestalled but how deputy i do not know i fear that is all well there lies your sashthe talisman to such puerile emotions return to bed jeanlouis it is unwise to venture abroad in a thunderstorm it is unwiser to shelter beneath a tree but not a rooftree oh thou fool didst thou not close thine eyes last night on a city fermenting like a pan of dough et cette alarme universelle est louvrage dun moucheron but go your way he cried and scrambled out of bed he walked to the little washstand with an embarrassed air and set to preparing our morning cup of chocolate from the mill that stood thereon after all he said when the fragrant froth sputtered about his nostrils the proper period to any exquisite sensation is death i dread no termination but that put to an hour of abstinence to die with the wine in ones throat and the dagger in ones backwhat could kings wish for better he handed me my cup and sipped enjoyingly at his own i am representative of a constituency he said yet a better judge of wine than of men the palate and the heart are associated in a common bond that i would decree the basis of the new religion tears of christit is a vintage i would make tallien and manuel and billaud de varennes drunk on every day he laughed in an agitated manner and glanced at me over the rim of his cup go your way jeanlouis he repeated and pardon me if i call it the right mule one but you will walk it for i know you and eat your fill of the sweet thistleflowers before the thorns shall stab your gullet and take all relish from the feast casimir i cried in some black wonderthis is all the language of a villain or an hysteric i paused stared at his twitching face took up my hat quietly and left the room a little frost on a foot or a little blood what is the significance of either once the bimbelotiers of the palais royal used to manufacture cards of nol very pretty and sparkling with rime that was before the apotheosis of the third or butterfly state and many a time during the winter of i have seen poor vagrants of the chosen brood unwitting yet of the scarlet wings developing underneath their rugged hides ponder over the fanciful emblems in the shop windows and then look down with wonder at their own cracked and bleeding toes to whom then could the frost appeal in this dainty guise not surely to those who must walk with bare feet it is all the point of view said the philosophers but they added blood is warm and it is well to wear socks of it if you can get no other put these on and look again and you will see differently not just yet perhaps and in the meantime the king empties his private purse to buy wood for the freezing people this will warm them into loyalty while it lasts and they crawl out of their icy burrows or gather up their broken limbs on the snow bedswhereinto they have been ground by the sleds and chariots of the wealthy that rush without warning down the muffled streetsto build monuments of snow to the glory of their rulers then byandby these great obelisks melt and add their quota to the thaw that is overwhelming what the frost has spared the red socks now on this wild sunday of september when the monuments that bore the names of the good king and queen are collapsed and run away some eight years the tocsin is pealing with a clamour of triumph from the steeples for at last the solution of the riddle has been vouchsafed to the third state and it knows that to acquire the right point of view it must wear socks not of its own blood but of that of the aristocrats to whom the emblems of nol were made to appeal all day i felt the pulse of the people quickening quickeningan added five beats to every hourwith wonder rage and at last terror maniacal paris was threatened hardwrung freedom was tottering to its fall this paris was a vessel of wrath on treacherous watersmanned by revolted slaves the crew under hatches encompassed by enemies on every side what remained but to clear the decks for actionevery hero to his post at the vast bulwarks every sonofaseacook to remain and poniard the prisoners lest they club their manacles and take their captors in the rear at two oclock the tocsin pealedthe signal to prepare for the fray from its first blaring stroke i ceased it seemed to be myself i waived my individuality and became as much a conscript of the rising tide of passion as a highperched stone that the wave at last reaches and drags down with the shingle becomes a condition of the general uproar i made indeed no subscription to this fanatical heat of emotion i was simply involved in itto go with it and perish of it perhaps but never to succumb to its disordered sophistries or yield my free soul to its influence possibly i had a wild idea in the midst of sinister forebodings that a few such as i scattered here and there might leaven the ugly mass but i do not know hemmed in by wrath and terror thought casts its buoys and sinks into very fathomless depths from the place de grve along pelletier quay across the ponts au change and st michel westwards by the rue st andr des arcs where a little diversion was caused by a streetsinger at whom the crowd took offence in that he being an insignificant buffoon did pelt it with its classic pretentiousness wagging his coattails in contempt thereof bas pitou they shrieked we will dock thee of thy sting and put thee to buzz in a stone bottleand they had him unfrocked in a twinkling and hoisted for punishment round with a curve to the south into the rue de bussi thence again westwards along the street of st marguerite finally weathering the sinister cape of the abbaye st germain northwards into the rue st benoit and up to the yard entrance of the very prison itselfsuch was the long course by which i was borne in the midst of clamour hate and revilings some dreadful early scenes in the panorama of the revolution unfolded before my eyesscenes crudely limned by crude street artists splashed and boltered with crimson horrible for the ghastly applause they evoked i saw and i was helplessthe block about the carriages of the nonjurantsthe desperate stroke at the sansculotte that cut the knot of indecisionthe crashing panels the flying and flung priests one damnable with a sabre split a bald head that came wavering in my direction like a melon and the brains flew like its seeds i shut my eyes and thought mercy is in right ratio with the hardness of the blow strike deep poor guttersnipes if you must strike at all then began the severe justice of the people what was i poor philosophic misrable but a germ of those germs in that great artery of blood that the revolted system was endeavouring to expel i saw numbers of my kind thrown forth and mangled in the midst of horrors unspeakable i was borne helpless to the heart and was rejected to fly shuddering to remote veins of the prisons circulation only to return by an irresistible attraction to the central terror more than once my mad expostulations brought me into perilous notice you have hard wrongs to avenge i shrieked but at least the form of pleading has been granted you and these cried the killers blood of god is not bastille maillard within there checking the tally of the accursed aristocrat art thou they bounded from me to a fresh victim thrust that moment from the door she came dazed into the flare of the torchesa white face with umber hair tumbled all about it two gloating hounds took her under the armpits a third ciel pour tant de rigueur de quoi suisje coupable i do not know whither my wanderings tended or what space of time was covered by them sooner or later i was always back at the abbaye glutting my soul with assurance of its own wreck helpless despite my loathing of it to resist the attraction what horror absorbs the moth as it circles round the flame i thought in those recurrent moments i could understand once when i returned an unwonted silence reigned about the place a few vampire figures restless phantasmal flitted hither and thither in the neighbourhood of the reeking shambles but the slaughterers and the red ladies of st michel were retired during an interval in the examination for refreshment i heard the shrill buzz of their voices all down the rue st benoit and from the wine and lemonade shops opposite the very gates by which i stood i looked into the fearful yard my god the dead it seemed were phosphorescent with the rottenness of an ancient system here there on all sides they broke the darkness with blots of light like hideous glowwormstheir hundred white faces the reflectors of as many lamps but it is a brave illumination gurgled a voice at my ear i glanced aside in loathing a little old woman whose lungs barked at every breath stood near me she laughed as if she would shake herself into touchwood a brave illumination she wheezedthe inspiration of the girl la lune she was dedicated to the holy mother and her skirt oh mon dieu but it was of the azure of heaven and now it is purple as a strangled face and it slaps on her ankles but byandby she must seek purification for she is dedicated to the holy virgin she placed these lamps she led her sisters to the committee that sits there she pointed a gnarled finger to one side of the dreadful quadrangle a dull glow came melancholy through some tall windows she complained that ladies who would fain enjoy the show were prevented by the darkness then to each dead aristocrat they put a lamp that was a fine courtesy it is not often one sees such goods brought to market a wild cloud of shapes came rushing upon us with brandished weapons and a demon skirl of voices i thought at first that i must be the object of their fury but they passed us by cursing and gesticulating and drove something amongst them up the yard and stopped and made a ring about it on the bloody stones what was it i had a glimpse of two petrified faces as the little mob swept by and a queer constriction seized my heart then all in a moment i was following crying in my soul that here was something tangible for my abased humanity to lay hold ofsome excuse to indulge a passion of selfsacrificesome claim to a lump of ice at my feet and a lamp at my head the dead were so calm the living so besotted a miserly theft i thought to take anothers blood when ones own gluts ones arteries to suffocation i looked over the shoulders of the outermost of the group what horrible cantrip of fortune had consigned this old barren weed of a man this white exotic of a girl to a merciless handling by these demons the two were in walking dress and not in the dshabille of prisoners there was a lull in the systematic progress of the butchery here it would seem was an entracte designed only to relieve the tedium of waiting a halfdozen harpies held the girl there was a stain of red on her ripe young lip for i think one of the beasts had struck her but her face was stubborn with pride in front of all the old wizened man who had been released ran to and fro in an agony of obsequious terror yes yes he quavered tis a luminous sightan admirable show they lie like the fallen sticks of rockets glimmering a dying spark is it not so carinne little cabbage is it not so he implored her with his feverish eyes they are martyrs cried the girl and you are a coward no no he wailed and wrung his hands and my god she will murder me he shrieked suddenly he saw darted through the ring of ruffians and caught the breast of my coat with both his hands monsieur you have nobility in your face tell these good souls that i am a furious patriot and a good citizen monsieur monsieur we walk abroadwe are involved unwitting in the mle the girl denounces all for pigs and murderers and naturally those who hear take umbrage and force us hither his dry lips vibrated he danced up and down like a gnat on a windowpane all the time the women were volubly chattering and the men cursing and pulling they desired it seemed a prologue to the second act of the tragedy and that was bad art but then they were as drunk as one could wish thou art nice and dainty citoyenne they shrieked see herethou shalt be vivandire to the brave army of avengers tap her an aristocrat heart and fill her a canteen that all may drink the beastly proposal was not too gross for the occasion a man lurched forward with a jeering oath and ii sprang to the front too and took the hound by his gulping throat there came a great noise about me i did not relax my hold and some one rushed into our midst what do you here he cried harshly casimirs voice death of god have you orders to insult and threaten peaceable citizens who walk abroad to see the illuminations with a fierce sweep of his arms he cleared all away in front of him the actthe gesture brought him to my side goescape he whispered frantically this here i will attend to you knew then i gasped out and he fell back from me but i released my hold and stood panting i was at the moment no whit in love with life but i dreaded by the least stubbornness to precipitate the catastrophe that threatened that halffainting girl her casimir gave his arm to in a peremptory manner she clung to him and he led her stumbling across the yard the little whimpering pinchfist scuttling in their wake the mob spat curses after them butthis intermezzo being no part of its programmeit respected the deputys insignia of office so far as to allow him his perquisite then with a howl of fury it turned upon me accursed thou dost well to dispute the peoples will see his fine monseigneur hands washed white in a bath of milk while the peasants drank rotten water he will think to cow us with a look he cannot disabuse himself of the tradition down with the dog of an aristocrat but if he is brunswicks courierbrunswick that would dine in paris on the boiling hearts of patriots i was backing slowly towards the gate as they followed reviling me what would you i could not help others i would take my own destinies in hand here in deadly personal peril i felt my feet on the good earth once more and found restoration of my reason in a violence of action there was no assistance possible paris this night was a menagerie in which all beasts of prey and of burden were released from restraint to resolve for themselves the question of survival in a moment i turned and fled and halfadozen came screaming after me i gained the gate in advance and sped down the rue st benoit one man lurching from a wineshop cut at me aimlessly with a notched and bloody sabre but i evaded him with ease and he fell into the midst of the pursuers retarding them a little i reached the southwest angle of the prison where the place split up like the blown corner of a flag into many little crooked ribbons of streets and amongst these i dived racing haphazard while the redsocks thudded in my wake and my heart in my ribs suddenly turning a corner i saw the narrow mouth of an alley gape to my left into it i went like a touched worm into its hole and swallowed by the blackness stood still the feet pounded by but sooner or later i knew the dogs must nose back to pick up the lost scent then they would have me nicely in a little cul de sac like a badger in a tub i leaned my shoulderto the wall as i thought but the wall gave to my pressure and i stumbled and went through it with a sliding run while something flapped to grievously scoring my shins in its passing i was on my feet in an instant however and then i saw that i had broken by way of a swingdoor into a little dusty lobby to one side of which was a wicket and payplace and thence a flight of wooden stairs ran aloft to some chamber from which flowed down a feeble radiance of light i pushed through the wicket not a soul was in the place it seemed and went softly and rapidly up the stairs at the top i came upon a sight that at first astounded then inspired me i was in one of those salles de spectacle that were at that time as numerous in paris as were political clubsa wide low room with an open platform at its further end for musicians and round three of its walls a ropedin enclosure for figures in waxwork it was these bowelless dolls that caused me my start and in which i immediately saw my one little chance of salvation i went down the row gingerly on tiptoe a horn lantern slung over the stairhead was the only light vouchsafed this thronged assembly of dummies its rays danced weakly in corners and lent some of the waxen faces a spurious life a ticket was before each effigygenerally as i hurriedly gathered a quite indispensable adjunct i had my desperate plan but perhaps i was too particular to select my complete double here a button or the cut of a collar were the pregnant conditions of history the clothes made the man and mirabeau had written le tartufe on the strength of a flowing wig i saw necker personating our unhappy monarch in that fatal phrygian cap that was like the glowing peak of a volcano stuttering desmoulins waving a painted twig his lips inappropriately inseparable the english pitt with a nose blown to a point voltaire rousseau beaumarchaismany of the notabilities and notorieties of our own timesand before the last i stopped suddenly i would not for the world insult the author of figaro but it was my distinction to be without any and in a waxwork the ticket makes the man pierre augustin was represented pointing a republican moralin dress a pseudo petitmatreat his feet a broken watch one recalls the incidentat versailleswhen a grand seigneur requests the exhorologist to correct his timepiece for him monsieur my hand shakes laissez donc monsieur you belittle your professional skill beaumarchais flings the watch on the floor voil monsieur it is as i said now i saw my hope in this figure and it was all a matter of moments with me whipped it up in my arms and ran with it to the end of the platform a flounce of baize hung therefrom to the floor and into the hollow revealed by the lifting of this i shot the invertebrate dummy and then scuttled back to the ropes to take its place there were sounds as i did soa noise below that petrified me in the position i assumed my heart seemed to burr like the windingwheel of a mechanical doll i pray m beaumarchais to forgive me that travesty of a dignified reproof a stepthat of a single individualcame bounding up the stair my face was turned in its direction i tried to look and yet keep my eyes fixed the dull flapping light seconded my dissemblance but the occasion braced me like a tonic and i was determined to strike if need were with all the force of the pugnacious wit i represented suddenly i saw a white fearful countenance come over the stairheadshoulders legs a complete form it was that of an ugly stunted man of fifty whose knees shook whose cheeks quivered like a blancmange he ran hither and thither sobbing and muttering to himself quick quick whomirabeau a brave thought a magnificent thought my godwill they fathom it i have his browhis scornful air of insistence my god my godthat i should sink to be one of my own puppets astounded i realised the truth this poltroonthe very proprietor of the showwas in my own actual case and had hit upon a like way out of his predicament i saw him seize and trundle the ridiculous presentment of m mirabeau to the room end and then fling it hurriedly down and kick itthe insolent jackassunder the curtain i saw him run back and pose himselfwith a fatuous vanity even in his terroras that massive autocrat of the assembly and then with a clap and a roar i heard at last the hounds of pursuit break covert below and come yelling up the stairs i do not think i shook yet it seemed impossible that they could pass me by there were one or two amongst them i thought i recognised as carinnes captors but they were all hideous frantic shapes elflocked malodorous bestial and drunk with blood they uttered discordant cries as they came scrambling into the room and by a flickering at the nape of his neck i could see that my fellowsufferer was unable to control the throaty rising of his agitation suddenly a horrible silence befell one of the intruders a powerful young ruffian of a malignant jesting humour put his comrades back and silenced them with an arm his bloodshot eyes were fascinating poor mirabeau slowly he raised a finger and pointed it at the creature the bubbles seemed to fly up the latters neck as if his heart were turned into water it was a terrible momentthen all at once the whole room echoed with demon laughter mother of christ what cunning but my god he is a fine libel on the king of patriots see the works have not run down he twitches yet from his last performance he makes himself a show to the people he shall be given a lamp in the yard of the abbaye the figure fell upon its knees with a choking shriek messieurs i acted upon my first instinct of preservation i had no thought i swear it to insult the great or to question the majesty of the people messieurs i detest aristocrats and applaud your method of dealing with them merci merci i am a poor exhibitor of waxworks an excellent patriot and a servant of the public but that is true cried a voice from the stairs this is little tictac that helped to decorate the capets chariot on the day of the htel de ville the mob grunted over this advocate but he helped a prisoner to escape was there another then in the same plight as myself messieurs he asked the way of me as any stranger might malepeste if thou tellst us so but thou hast dared to personate a god messieurs he lent his countenance to me as ever to the unfortunate the answer raised a roar of approbation comme il est fin take thy gooseskin and yet we must tax thee somehow let us destroy this show that he has profaned my heart seemed to shrink into itself i sufferedi suffered but fortunately for a few moments only with the words on his lips the fellow that had spoken slashed with his sabre over the kneeling showmans head amongst the staring effigies the whistle of his weapon made me blink what did it matterthe end must come now it was not as i foresaw the waxen head spun into the airthe figure toppled against that standing next to itthat against its neighbourits neighbour against me i saw what was my cue and went down in my turn stiffly with a dusty flop twisting to my side as i fell and hoping that he whom i was bowling over in due order was rich in padding nevertheless i was horribly bruised there was a howl of laughter mor dieu but five at a blow cried the executioner this is better than the one to fifty yonder and he came running to read the names of those he had overturned necker it is right that he should be pictured fallen pittbeaumarchais ha ha little toad where are those patriot muskets in your breechespocket but i will cut them out now i gave up all for lost he stepped back to get his distancethere came a crash by the stairway and the room was plunged in darkness one of the mob had swung up his weapon over a figure and had knocked out the lantern with a backhanded blow it is the little incidents of life that are prolific as insects the situation resolved itself into clamour and laughter and a boisterous groping of the company down the black stairway in a minute the place was silent and deserted i lay still as yet awaiting developments i could not forget that m tictac as a pronounced patriot might not honour my confidence for my escape it must have been as i supposed another victim eluding the murderers had drawn them off my scent and the showman had effected yet a second crosscurrent he was indeed fortunate to have kept a whole skin presently i heard him softly stirring and moaning to himself misrable to have dishonoured my rle would he have succumbed thus to an accident but i am like himyes i am like him for all they may say their mockery was the wormwood in his cup he dragged himself to his feet byandby and felt his way across the room to recover his abused idol then i would delay no longer i rose stepped rapidly to the stairhead and descended to the street he heard meas i knew by the terrified cessation of his breathingand thought me perhaps a laggard member of his late company anyhow he neither moved nor spoke the killers were at their work again the agonised yells of the victims followed and maddened me but i was secure from further pursuit save by the dogs of conscious helplessness and one of these kept barking at my heel carinne that you were impotent to defend what has become of the child chapter ii citoyenne carinne it was my unhappiness in the black springtime of the terror to see my old light acquaintance the abb michau jogging on his way to the place de la bastille i pitied him greatly he had pursued pleasure so fruitlessly all his days and into this fatal quagmire had the elusive flame at length conducted him he sat on the rail of the tumbrila depressed puzzled look on his facebetween innocence and depravity both were going the same road as himselfthe harmless white girl and the besotted priest who shrunk in terror from giving her the absolution she askedand poor charles divided them he was not ever of fortunes favourites he would make too fine an art of epicurism and he sinned so by rule as to be almost virtuous i remember him with a halfdozen little axioms of his own concocting that were after all only morality misapplied to know how to forget oneself is to be graduate in the school of pleasure selfconsciousness is always a wasp in the peach the art of enjoyment is the art of selection on such as these he founded his creed of conduct and that procured him nothing but a barren series of disappointments he was never successful but in extricating himself from mishaps the ravissantes he sighed after played with and insulted himthough they could never debase his spirit the dishes he designed lacked the last little secret of perfection he abhorred untidiness yet it was a condition of his existence and he could not carry off any situation without looking like a thief one further turn of the wheel and he would have been a saint in a monastery i can recall him with some tenderness and his confident maxims with amusement that art of selection of his i found never so applicable as to the choice of ones revolutionary landlord it was michaus logeur i understand who caused the poor abb to be arrested and brought before the tribunal miscalled of liberty where the advocacy of the chivalrous chauveau de la garde was sufficient only to procure him the last grace of an unproductive appeal it was the atrocity with whom latterly i lodged who brought me to my final pass in truth as the letters of apartments were largely recruited from the valetaille of migrs the need of caution in choosing amongst them was very real m le marquis could not take flight in a panic without scattering some of his fine feathersfortunately indeed for him sometimes for they were as sops thrown to the pursuing wolves while he sped on then down would grovel public accusers police and committeemen to snap at the fragments and amongst them bonjean monsieurs valet de pied would secure his share perhaps and set up house with it in one of the meaner faubourgs and trade profitably therein upon the fears of his lodgers simon mignard was the last who had the honour to entertain me and to that horrible little grotesque did i owe my subsequent lodgment in la petite force it was a bad choice and with my experience an unpardonable but i was taken with a certain humour in the creature that put me off my judgment for generally indeed this faculty of humour i found to be antipathetic to revolution it was to be looked upon as a mark of social degeneration the brute thrown back to his primordial state is an animal that takes himself with the most laughterless gravity he resumes himself corrupt so to speak as one resumes the endurance of office full of the rebellious grievance of a holiday he returns to the primary indulgence of instinct with a debased appetite and that sense of humour does not accompany him this is why his prejudices have the force of convictions citizen simon i said one day i would put it to youif revolutionists would reconstitute society by purging the world of the abnormal should they not offer themselves the first holocausts to their theories hey he cried peering over his glasses his eyeslits were like halfhealed wounds his face was all covered with a grey down as if he were some old vessel of wrath the revolution had produced from its mustiest bloodbin in the cellars where its passions were formerly wont to ferment hey he cried but explain citizen thibaut why obviously a primal simplicity cannot be taught by those who by their own showing are an essential condition of degeneration you think so my friend but is it not he who has hunted with the wolves can best advise the lamb whither not to stray set a thief to catch a thief but not innocence to lead innocence we are all so disinterested eh we must kill to purifyso long as we remain the executioners the physicians the physicians some day we shall provide the tonic at this rate the physicians will have to drink it themselves meaning the patients will fail us rest content they will last our time the ills in the constitution of france are many for the resurrectionsang dieu he cried with a wry face but that is no part of our programme indeed it was not of his he was actuated by no passion but the bloodsuckers one day he showed me a clumsy model guillotine a foot high of his own contriving the axe was a fragment of tableknife sunk in a finger of lead and with it he would operate upon a gruesome little doll he had with an adjustable neck snip the blade fell and the head and a spout of crimson gushed forth and stained the floor that is a waste of good wine said i his face puckered like a toads eyelids is it not he chuckled of the brand drunk by the patriot citoyenne sombreuil blood voyez he cried with a little shriek of laughter it is hollow often i fill it from the tap in the place de la bastille my faith what a fountain i love it like dantzic brandy then it was i found his humour a little excessive to my taste and i severed my connection with him he might lie obviously he did in fact about the blood but ones sympathies could not embrace so stupid a falsehood promptly he denounced me to his section i had given him the courteous you said he and amongst my effects was a box of the interdicted hairpowder but it is of my earlier landlord jacques crpin who for a time influenced my fortunes quite admirably that i desire here to speak upon this rascal i happened on the evening of lepelletier st fargeaus murder in fvriers coffeehouse it was the interminable week of the votings on the kings sentence during the course of it i had many times visited the hall of convention had stayed a while to watch the slow chain of deputies hitching over the tribune with their dreary chant la mort that was like the response to an endless litany of fatality intoned by the ushers had heard the future dictator spectacled marmosetfaced irrepressible in oratory drone his sour dithyrambics where a word would have sufficed had fallen half asleep over the phantom scene and had imagined myself at the comdie franaise during a performance of les victimes clotresa dreamy fancy to which the incessant sound of feet on boards high up in the mountain quarter the reverberating clap of doors the wide patter of voices and tinkle of laughter from bedizened chres amies pricking down the ayes and noes upon scented cards the shriller brabble of mre duchesse aloft with her priestesses of the salptrire and the intermittent melodramatic drawl of the actors moving across the stage gave colour and coherence by then i think i was come to be graduate in michaus school of pleasure it was impressed upon me that to think of myself was a little to foretaste my probable martyrdom it was philosophy more congenial to read in the serene patriot thibaut a disinterested sheep fattening on the grass about the abattoir my title was a plaguespot to cover little but the dust of my patrimony remained i had long disabused my mind of the dogma that manliness is necessarily a triumphant force in the world yet a month before i had been conscious of a little run of pity that was like a sloughing of the old wound of nobility it was to see the figure of him i had called sire heavily seated in that same salle de mange his attire appropriately a drab surtoutthe colour of newturned mouldhis powdered hair blotted with a tonsure where he had leaned his weary head back for rest that lost look on his ineffectual facemessieurs this strange indignity but doubtless the saints will explain to me of what i am accused bah have i not learned the rights of man and seen them illustrated too on those days of the severe justice of the people the worse the decomposition below the thicker will be the scum that rises to the top but there the wholesome air shall deodorise it byandby and the waters of life be sweet to the taste againfor a time and in the meanwhile i browse by the abattoir on that saturday evening the last of the voting i dined with distinction at fvriers in the palais royal i could still afford morally and materially this little practice of selfindulgence for they had not yet begun to make bread of dried pease and many of the ardent deputies themselves were admirable connoisseurs in meat and wine while i was sittingthe whole place being in a ferment of scurry and babblea couple who awakened my curious interest entered and took a vacant table next to mine a withered old man it was and a young girl who sauntered with ample grace in his wake the first came down the room prying hither and thither bowelless and bent like a note of interrogation he was buttoned up to the throat in a lank darkgreen surtout and his plain hat was tilted back from his forehead so as to show his eyebrows each lifted and lost in the creases of a dozen arched wrinkles and the papery lids beneath them bulging and half closed his face was all run into grey sharpness but a conciliatory smile was a habit of his lips he carried his hands behind his back as if they were manacled there the girl who followed was in features and complexion cold and beautiful her eyes were stonegrey under wellmarked brows her forehead rounded from her nose like a kittens the curls that escaped from beneath her furred hood were of a rich walnut brown she had that colourless serenity in her face that is like snow over perfumed flowers gazing on such one longs to set ones heart to the chill and melt it and see the blossoms break now i had at once recognised in this couple the sustainers of the principal rles in a certain september tragedy entracte in these times of feverish movement the manner in which casimir had secured their escape was indeed an old story with me yet seeing them again under these vastly improved circumstances and remembering in what way i had sought to assist them my heart was moved beyond its present custom to a feeling of sympathetic comradeship with one at least of the two the old man chose his table sit down wench said he my faith we must dine though crowns fall she took her seat with a little peevish sigh though the stars fell in the street like hail you would dine she said he cocked his head sideways they have fallen my carinne the ruin of them litters the temple she said doggedly vive le roi under her breath my god he whispered and called the waiter he eyed her askance and nervously as the man came some distraught admiration seemed to mingle with his apprehension of her she sat languid and indifferent and even closed her eyes with a little disdainful smile as he leaned down to her and ran his finger eagerly over the various items of the bill of fare ostend oysters carp fried in milk sweetbread pattythat is good ragout of the kidneys and combs of cocksthat is very goodcarinne see the ragout holy saints but my pocket slice of calfs head turtle fashiongirl are you listening be reckless take of all if you will i bid theethy little uncle ma mie slice ofcarinne this is better than the cabbages and fried eggs of pierrettes i will not carei will not though i have to cut down trees to meet it the palate shall have its holiday slice ofmon dieu carinne i ate of it once before in this very house it melts like the manna of the israelites it does not surfeit but it forms an easy bed for the repose of ecstasies more acute the girl broke in with a little highflung laugh not trees but a forest she said therechoose for me i am indifferent indifferent indifferentoh undeserving of the fine gifts of the gods he turned to the waiter his eyes still devouring the carte his lips silently busy with its contents presently he gave his order sat down and remained fixedly gnawing a finger his face set half in enjoying contemplation half in a baffled aggravation of selection in only one other direction did the couple appear to arouse curiosity the great nerve of the town was all charged with a leaping electricity and citizens staid enough ordinarily ate now and drank under an excitement they could barely control but over against me at a little distance were two men seated at a table and of these one seemed to take a like interest with mine in my neighbours this individual unmoved apparently by the general ferment had finished his dinner and sat sipping his mdoc luxuriously he was a pimplefaced man wellnourished and sensuallooking but with an air of tolerant geniality about him ugly as danton he had yet a single redeeming ornament in the shape of a quantity of rich auburn hair that fell from his head in natural curls though his condition was plain to me and i saw that the restaurateur treated him with obsequious deference he appeared more selfcomplacent than selfsufficient and as if he were rather accustomed to indulge than abuse his position for i recognised in him the president of some sectional committee and that by the little plaque printed small with the rights of man that hung as a pendant from his tricolour neckribbon of the other at the table i took but little notice save to remark that he devoured his meal with the air of a man to whom good digestion is no essential condition of politics now of a sudden jacques crpin of the pendant lowered his legs took up his bottle and glass and to my extreme surprise crossed the room to my table and sat down by me he did not speak at first being engaged in watching our neighbours before whom were placed at the moment the dishes of the uncles selection mademoiselle carinne gave a little ouf over hers but what is this she said it is a pigs foot la st menehould such a dish babouine the old rascal had taken advantage of her insensibility to procure her one of the cheapest entries on the list she pushed it from her with an exclamation of disgust fie then she cried the very hoof of a filthy swine wouldst thou have me make my hunger a footstool to a pig take it away i will not touch it he protested voluble and shamefaced she would not listen out of mere wilfulness she now selected the most expensive item of the menua partridge stewed in wine he seemed like to cry but she persisted and gained her point we shall be ruined he cried inconsistently enough for a month after our return we shall have to live on bread and boiled nettles in december mon oncle then i am imperious for white wine of mont rach the old fellow almost shrieked carinne eight francs the bottle consider my niece i shall die in sainte plagie the newcomer turned to me with a grin didst ever hear the like said he i nodded gravely i was not then all inured to impertinence he lacks the art of selection i said coldly thinking of michau he showed himself goodhumouredly conscious of my manner he leaned towards me and murmured carelessly there of a truth speaks monseigneur le comte de la muette i reached for my glass and sipped from it but i have no doubt my hand shook the citizen does not recognise me no by my faith i am jacques crpin and formerly i served where i now dine i glanced at him some faint remembrance of the fellow woke in me m le comte he went on in the same low voice once rewarded me with a handsome vail for some trifling service it was the lucky louisdor of my fortunes here was a little of the means the revolution was my opportunity now the masters serve the waiters i devour with my teeth what i once devoured with my eyes you see me president of a section but pardieu i have no quarrel with aristocrats of a fastidious palate it was the contemplation of such educated me to a right humour in gastronomy i am indebted to monsieur for many a delicate hint in selection again i thought of the poor michau i am honoured i said and so m crpin this is the goal of your high republicanism my faith he said with a generous chuckle i acknowledge it i have existed forty years that i may live oneperhaps no more to drink and to eat and to love en princei have the capacity for it and the will i have nursed my constitution on broken scraps this fessemathieu here offends me had i a fortune i would fling it away on a single desired dish if necessary we have waived the right to think of the morrow but how is monsieur known they call me citizen thibaut citizen thibaut i drink to our better acquaintance this mdoci have not grudged it you in former years your refined appreciation of it has many a time glorified to me my supper of stale fragments but for you maybe i had not learned the secret of its fragrance to my past master in epicurism i gulp a grateful toast he was as good as his word citizen crpin i said where do you live rue de jouy st antoine he answered i seek a convenient landlord will you accommodate me with all my heart i heard the vieillard at the next table gobble and choke i turned my head to look sprang to my feet and my glass crashed on the boards in that instant the room had leaped into uproarfor something immediate swift and terrible had happened it was this the fasteating man at the table opposite having finished his dinner was risen to pay his bill he stood with impatient hand outstretched as fvrier fumbled in his pocket for the change and at the moment a fellow thickset stubblebearded dressed in a blouse and faded cloak strode up the room and paused by him are you deputy lepelletier said he the diner turned and nodded you have voted in this affair of the king mais oui said the otherfor death sclratprends ca and with the word he whipped a long blade from under his cloak and passed it into the body of the deputy i saw the flash and heard the piteous bleat as also i swear the sound of the flesh sucking to the steel fvrier snatched at the murderer and was spun to the floor like a skittle i saw startled figures rise chairs and tables totter and the one bounding amongst them he got clear away then as the mob closed about the fallen moaning shape i turned with an instinct of horror to view of my neighbours the old gourmet had flung himself back in his chair his face twisted from the sight but mademoiselle still picked daintily at her partridge chapter iii the footpad early in june of the year i left paris in company with m crpin at that time in the flower of his somewhat mediocre fortunes he had been intrusted with a mission which was entirely after his own heart he was to represent the executive in fact in a sequestrating tour through limosin and guienneor rather through the newfound departments that had deposed those ancient territoriesand his interest had procured me a post as his clerk or assistant what duties this embraced perhaps the government would have found it as difficult to specify as their subagent but after all jacques bonhomme emancipated was excessively conservative in the matter of his retention of the system of complimentary sinecures for myself i looked upon my appointment as the simple means to postpone an inevitable denunciation crpin and i had by then ceased to fraternise i could never quite learn to adapt my sympathies to a certain mauvais ton that underlay in him all the sensitiveness of the voluptuary also perhaps i was beginning a little to resent the humourless methods of a destiny that had not the wit it seemed to rebuke my innate luxuriousness but by affecting a concern to accommodate me with housefellows of my own kidney we parted on the best of terms and he none the less attended to my interests and as far as possible to my safety to the end i think he retained an admiration for the superior quality of my epigastrium and when his opportunity came to do me a service he never failed to remind me of his indebtedness to my fastidious gourmandise we left the city travelling en roi on a fine blowing afternoon we had our roomy carriage with four wellblooded horses and a postilion to each pair an escort of four patriots moreover mounted armed and generally drunk accompanied us to enforce the letter of the law we went out by the suburb of passy starting from the pavillonlibert close by the thuillerieswhere crpin received his papers of administrationand whipping along the riverbank by way of the port aux pierres close by the gates the carriage gave a thudding jolt and drew up suddenly to an accompaniment of noise like the screaming of a swollen axle i started up in my corner what is it i exclaimed but three men risen at that moment from a bench under some chestnuttrees engaged my surprised attention they made at the postilions it seemed and the face of him that was foremost twitched with a rage of nervous resentment their hats had been laid beside them in the shade and i noticed that as this individual sprang to his feet the powder leapt from his head as if a musketball had struck it for he was very sprucely groomed every hair currycombed to run parallel with its fellows and there was a fastidious neatness about his appearance that was like the peevish delicacy of an invalid such indeed he was from more than one point of view for he was no other than m robespierre himself dressed in the fine blue coat he was studying to make historical and exhibiting the weak extremes of his nature in presence of a runover dog but this is infamous i heard him shrill in a strained wavering voice thus to shock our humanity and our nerves he ran to the carriage window in uncontrollable excitement he bustled with his shaking speech so that it was hardly audible what mischief produces itself that you tear through the streets like brigands messieursmessieurs but i say you have no rightcitizens do you hear crpin dismayed muttered something about authority the other snapped at the word and worried it authority there is none in this city to be careless of innocent lives authority who excuses himself to meto the republicby assuming a licence to murder under its gisyes murder i say you would adopt the prerogatives of aristocratsyou are an aristocrattachereau st just he was beside himself his lean hands picked at the windowframe all the time the poor cur in the road was screeching and the sound seemed to jar him out of his selfcontrol one of his companions stepped up to him put a hand upon his arm and drew him away quite a little mob had gathered about us reculez les chevaux said this person to the postilions complete what you have begun the horses backed the carriage once and drew forward again stilling the cries personally i should have preferred alighting during the operation robespierre ran to the trees and put his palms to his ears doubling himself up as if he had the toothache the other came to the window once more this was the apocalyptic of the assembly its most admirable type of fanaticism dark and immovable as a nubian archer in a wall painting he might have been represented for ever holding the taut string and the arrow that should whistle to its mark he was young a mere boymelancholy oliveskinned beautiful in his way cold incorruptible merciless nevertheless hethis st justwas yet that one of the ultrarevolutionists i could find it in me to regard admiringly of all he alone acted up to the last letter of his creed of purification of all he alone was willing to do a long lifes reaping without wage without even that posthumous consideration of a niche in the pantheon of history like the figure of time on a clock he was part and parcel of the scythe with which he wrought he must move when the hour camecutting right and leftand with the last stroke of inspiration he must stop until the wheels of being should bring him to the front once more truly he was not great but quite possibly necessary and as such one could not but exclaim over his faultless mechanism he sacrificed his life to his cause long before it was demanded of him and in the end flung himself to the axe as to a kindred spirit with which his structural and destructive genius was quite in sympathy one must acknowledge that he made a consistent practice of that which is the true art of reformto know whom to exclude from ones system only he was a little too drastic in his exclusion and that came from a lack of ton for your fanatic sees a reactionary in every one whose mouth opens for what reason soever but to applaud his methods and the sneers which his sensitiveness regards as levelled at himself he puts to the account of treason against his policy citizen crpin he said for he had already identified my companion for the future if you must ride roughshod i would recommend you to make the meanest your first consideration but citizen it was no fault of mine you have a voice to control i presumehe stepped back and waved his hand allez vous promenerand the carriage jerked forward i shot a glance at the other as we passed he was retired from the scene and he seemed endeavouring to control the agitation into which he had been betrayed but he looked evilly from under his jumping eyelids at us as we went by we travelled cautiously until we were gone a long gunshot from the city walls and then crpin put his head out of the window and cursed on the postilions furiously savant sacr he cried sinking back on the seat we are whipt and rebuked like schoolboys is a republic a seminary for street curs they should hoist reason in a balloon if she is to travel that st justhe will make it indictable to crack a flea on ones thumbnail what were they doing in that quarter of the town how should i know citizen thibaut spinning webs under the trees maybe to catch unwary flies they and others spend much of each day in the suburbs it is the custom of attorneys as it is of storywriters to hatch their plots in green nooks they brood for a week that they may speak for an hour robespierre comes to passy and auteuil for inspiration couthon goes every day to neuilly for bagatelle my faith but how these advocates make morality unattractive a dozen lawyers amongst the elect would produce a second revolt of the angels that is why the devil is loath to recall them to recall them they are his ambassadors monsieur and it is his trouble that they are for ever being handed their passports to quit such soil as he would be represented on then they return to him for fresh instructions but they will not understand that human passions are not to be controlled by rule of thumb or sounded by depth of plumb crpin and upon my word you are a fine bailiff to your masters now i have no wish to detail the processes of our monotonous journey into the southwesterly departments wheretothat is to say to the borders of dordogneit took us eight days to travel we had our excitements our vexations our adventures even but these were by the way and without bearing on what i have set myself to relate one evening as we were lazily rolling along an empty country road making for the little walled town of coutras where the fourth henry was known to his credit once upon a time a trace snapped leading to more damage and a little confusion amongst the horses i alighted in a hurrycrpin whose veins were congested with bordeaux slumbering profoundly on in his cornerand finding that the accident must cause us some small delay strolled back along the road we had come by for it looked beautiful in perspective our escort i may say affecting ignorance of our mishap had rattled on into the dusk it was a night for love or fairies or any of those little gracious interchanges of soul that france had nothing the art to conceive in those years the wind that had toyed all day with flowers was sweet with a languorous and desirable playfulness a ripening girl moon sat low on a causeway of mist embroidering a banner of cloud that blew from her hands the floating hills were hung with blots of woodland and to peer into the trance of sky was to catch a star here and there like a note of music i turned an elbow of the road and strolled to a little bridge spanning a brook that i had noticed some minutes earlier in passing leaning over the parapet i saw the water swell to a miniature pond as it approached the archa shallow ferry designed to cool the fetlocks of weary horses the whole was a mirror of placidity it flowed like a white oil reflecting in intenser accent the fading vault above so that one seemed to be looking down upon a subterranean dawnand it is there and thus i murmured the little people begin their day there were rushes fringing the brookedge as i knew only by their sharp reversed pictures in the blanched waterglass and a leaning stake in midstream repeated itself blackly that the hairy goblins below might have something to scratch themselves on and then this fancy did so possess me that when a bat dipt to the surface and rose again its reality and not its shadow seemed to flee into the depths at last a nightingale sang from a little copse hard by completing my bewitchmentand so my thraldom to dreams was nearly made everlasting for it appeared a man had come softly out of the woods behind me while i hung over the parapet and was stealing towards me on tiptoe with clubbed bludgeon it was a stagbeetle that saved my lifewhereout of might be snatched many little rags of reflections for it shot whizzing and booming past my ear and startled me to a sudden sideway jump the fellow was almost on my back at the moment and could not check his impetus he came crack against the low wall his club span out of his fist and he himself clutched failed and went over with a mighty splash into the water underneath the ludicrous dnoment gave me time to collect my faculties i was at no loss for an immediate solution of the incident the highways in these glorious days of fraternity were infested with footpads and no farther than five miles out of paris we had had trouble with them doubtless this rascal the carriage being out of sight had taken me for a solitary pedestrian i looked over the parapet feeling myself master of the situation though i had no weapon upon me my assailant was gathering his long limbs together in the shallow pool the water dragged the hair over his eyes and ran in a stream from his bristling chin suddenly he saw drew a pistol and clicked it at me it was a futile and desperate action and calculated only to confirm my estimate of his character ventrebleu and the devil he shouted make way for me sir i waved my hand right and left of the ferry should he emerge either way i could easily forestall him you have your choice of roads i said politely he recognised his difficulty and turned as if to wade up stream and escape by the fields his fourth step brought him into deep water out of which he floundered snorting try under the bridge i said it is the right passage for rats he cursed me volubly well we are one to one said he in sudden decision and came splashing out on the coutras side the moment he climbed up the bank i closed with him he was fairly handicapped by his liquid load and out of breath and of conceit with his luck besides he aimed a blow at me with his pistolbutt but i easily avoided it and let him topple his length againassisting him in factbut this time in the dust then i sat on him and threatened his head with a great stone pouf said he panting i protest i am no adept at this business is it your only one said i at this date yes soyou have been an honest man and what more can a patriot boast of i whistled and called to my companions my prisoner looked amazed you are not alone he exclaimed by no means my escort is round the curve of the road there he seemed to collapse under me merci monsieur he muttered merci what in these days he dared his chance of the stone and began to struggle violently i doubt if i could have held him long if crpin and one of the postilions had not come running up to my shout a few words were enough to explain the situation and we conducted the fellow to the carriage and strapped him upon one of the horses in a way compromising to his dignity and so he became of our party when we moved on once more coutras clacks with mills and is musical with weirs the spirit of the warlike king yet informs its old umber walls and toppling houses i found it a place so fragrant with antique and with natural beauties that my heart wept over the present human degeneracy that vulgarised it it lies amongst the last distant swells as it were of the great billows of the auvergne mountains before those swells have rolled themselves to waste in the sombre flats of the landes it is the hillslope garden on the fringe of the moor the restingplace of the sea and the highrock winds the hostelry where these meet and embrace and people the vineyards with baby breezes it has grown old listening under its great chestnuts to the sweet thunder of the isle and the dronne its peasants pagan in their instinct for beauty train their vines up the elm and walnut trees that in autumn they may dance under a dropping rain of grapes at the same time i am bound to confess that their wine suffers for the sake of this picturesqueness now as we entered it by moonlight it was a panic town restless scurrying lurid the new spirit ran vile and naked in its venerable streets the air was poisonous with the breath of a ira for since we left paris this had happened the girondists were fallen and hunted men and tallien and ysabeau were at la role preparing for a descent on bordeaux we learned it all at the gate and also that the spies and agents of these scoundrels were everywhere abroad nosing after the escaped deputies bullying torturing and denouncing it would appear we are forestalled said crpin drily m thibaut have you a mind to rake over dead ashes well i have heard of the white wine of bergerac at least i will taste that before i go to bed we drove up to the golden lion whither our scamps had preceded us patriots hooted our prisoner as we clattered through the streets or whipped at him with their ramrods the decent citizens fled before us and whitefaced girls peeped from behind the white curtains of their little bedchambers crushing the dimity against their swelling bosoms oh we were great people i can assure you at the hostelrya high mudcoloured building with windowplaces fringed with stone and its hill of a roof fretted thick as a dovecote with dormer casementsthey brought to our carriage a poor weeping maid la demoiselle des pleurs said bonnetrouge with a grin eh said crpin the aubergiste citizen crpin looked at the poor creature with disfavour certainly she was very plain though quite young and her homely face was blowzed with tears why do you cry then little fool monsieur they have taken my father to la role he will return if innocent alas no monsieur what you would discredit the impartiality of the republic he stepped from the carriage and took her by the shoulder he will return if innocent i say and would the law had enlarged him before we arrived you are in charge here citoyenne but yes monsieur a thousand devilsand disorganised ill swear no fire in the kitchen no food in the larder monsieur is in error i go at once to serve the first monsieur of our best the firstsacr is that also forestalled but who is this first the same as monsieur and dost thou know who i am alas monsieur you come and go and you are all great and imperious but i would not with a word offend monsieur listen girl a crowd stood about he spoke for the benefit of all i am a high officer of the republic en mission to rout out the disaffected and to enforce the law go and say to this citizen that with his permission i will join him our rogues were unstrapping the footpad from the horse as he spoke as they tumbled him half silly with his jolting and with the blows he had received upon his feet the aubergiste gave a faint cry crpin caught her as she retreated and twisted her about once more you know this chevalier de la coupe monsieur ihow can i say so many drink wine with us he looked at her sternly a moment then pushed her from him for supper the best in the house he called after her and turned to arrange for the disposition of his men and their prisoner byandby the aubergiste came to conduct us to table as we went thither crpin stopped took the girl by the chin and looked into her wet inflamed eyes if the prospect of good fare exhilarated him i will say also for his credit that i believe he had a kindly nature for the future he said be discreet and make a study to command your nerves in these days one must look on life through the little window of the lunette we found our forestaller who by the way had returned no answer to crpins polite message established in the eatingroom when we entered it he was a coarse blotched ruffian thick and overbearing and he stared at us insolently as he lay sprawled over a couple of chairs so thou wouldst share my supper he cried in a rumbling vibrant voice lie down under the table citizen and thou shalt have a big plate of scraps when once my belly is satisfied crpin paused near the threshold i tingled with secret laughter to watch the bludgeoning of these two parvenus but my respected chief had the advantage of an acquired courtesy you honour me beyond my expectations he said but if i were to break the dish over the citizens face the scraps would fall the sooner the other scrambled to his feet with a furious grimace canaille he shouted it was curious that i never heard an upstart but would apply this term in a quarrel to those of his own kidneyscum pigwash do you know my name my office my reputation godsblood ive a mind to have you roasted in a fat hogs skin and served for the first course crpin walked up to the bully very coolly m le reprsentant had plenty of courage in the ordinary affairs of life do i know who you are he said why i take you for one of those curs that are whipt on to do the dirty work of the peoples ministers and do you know who i am citizen spy i hold my commission direct from the committee of safety with full authority of sequestration and requisition and no tittle of responsibility to your masters at la role if you interfere with the processes of my office i shall have something additional to say in my report to the chiefs of my department whom your highness may recognise by the names of billaudvarennes and collotdherbois if you insult me personally i shall thrash you with a dogwhip the creature was but a huge windbag i never saw one collapse so suddenly crpin it is true had some fearful names to conjure by m le reprsentant said the former in a fallen flabby voice i have no desire to oppose or embarrass you we need not clash if i am circumspect for the rest accept my apologies for the heat i was betrayed into through inadvertence we have to be so careful with strangers he bowed clumsily his neck was choked with a great cravat a huge sabre clanked on the floor beside him as he moved he was a very ugly piece of goods and he bore his humiliation with secret fury i could perceivethe more so as the aubergiste brought in the first of the dishes during the height of the dispute crpin permitted himself to be something mollified by the sight of supper he complimented the girl on her promptitude the poor creature may have been no heroine but she was a seductive cook we had potage most excellent an entre of chestnutmeal ramequins roasted kid stuffed with truffes de prigord and served with sweet winesauce also a magnificent brand of bergerac was in evidence under the influence of these generous things our tablefellows insolence a little revived but now he would rally me as the safer butt the citizen is dainty with his food the fellow himself had lapped and sucked like a pig i owe it to the cook said i serenely a debt of love thou shalt pay it her presently when the lights are out you are an illconditioned hog said i he sprang toppling to his feet mother of god he stuttered hoarsely this goes too far this he caught crpins eye and subsided again muttering we were all pretty warm with liquor but my superior officer was grown benignant under its influence for shame citizens he said blandly to put a coarse accent to this heavenly bouquet he had bettered me in the philosophy of the palate i confess it at once the other his name we came to know was lacombea name of infamous notoriety in the bordeaux business leaned over to me presentlywhen crpin was gone from the room a moment to give a directionwith hell glinting out of his eyes m le reprsentants fellow said he i bow to authority but i kick authoritys dog in the ribs if the cur molests me i dont doubt it it is probably the measure of your courage he nodded pregnantly the resurrection of france shall be in discretion that is the real courage to those whose overbearing impulse is to strike we are discreet and we watch and we evolve by degrees the whole alphabet of espionage let us call a the language of the hands these the frost of poverty will stunt the rack of labour will warp and disjoint there is your sign of a citizen of the people monsieur has very pretty fingers and pink nails by the same token a corded fist should prove one to be a hangman monsieur has a knot for every knuckle he nodded again his calmness was more deadly than his wrath you spit your insults over the shoulder of your master you think yourself secure in your office but there is an order of repartee unknown to patriots for it was hatched in the hotbeds of versailles he fell back in his chairstill eyeing mewith a grunt then suddenly leaned forward again the alphabet he said of which b shall be designated the penetration of disguises coachdrivers colporteurs pedlarsoh one may happen upon the cloven hoof amongst them all i laughed with a fine affectation of contempt this mummy at the feast there was a sound in the room i turned my head the little aubergiste stood at the door weeping and wringing her hands monsieur she cried do not let it be done i rose and went to the child tell me i said what is it monsieur the poor man that you captured they are torturing him in the yard i pointed with my hand to a window without all during our meal had been a confused clatter of voices and the lurid smoke of torches rising about the glass yes she sobbed quite overcome it is not right monsieur it will bring a curse upon the place i ran from the room my blood on fire whatever his offence to me i had sooner let the rascal go than that he should fall into the hands of drunken patriots the yard was a paved space scooped from the rear of the house a well with a windlass pierced it about the middle and round the low wall of this were seated a dozen redbonnets our own four prominent shouting and quarrelling and voluble as parrots broken bottles strewed the ground and here and there a torch was stuck into the chinks of the stones informing all with a jumping glare of red i pushed past two or three frightened onlookers and rushed out into the open where is he i cried in a heat what the devil am i not to pass judgment on my own a moments silence fell the faces of all were turned up to me scowling and furious in the pause a pitiful voice came booming and wailing up from the very bowels of the well itself merci messieurs merci and i will conduct you to the treasure i wore a sword and i drew it and sprang to the wellmouth god in heaven i cried what are you doing with him down there several had risen by this and were set at me snarling like dogs the man is forfeit to the law they yelped that is for the law to decide the people are the law we sit here to condemn him while he cools his heels send monsieur to fetch his friend up cried lacombes voice over their heads he will be dainty to wash his white fingers after a meal there were cries of aristocrat possibly they would have put the brutes suggestion into effectfor a tipsy patriot has no bowelshad not crpin at that moment run into the yard i informed him of the situation in a word as he joined me by the wellside haul up the man he said coolly and peremptorily his office procured him some respect and more fear our fellows had no stomach but to obey and they came to the windlass muttering and wound their victim up to the surface he was a pitiable sight when he reached it they had trussed him to the rope with a savagery to which his swollen joints bore witness and with a refinement of cruelty had cut the bucket from under his feet that the full weight of his body should hang without support in this condition they had then lowered him up to his neck in the black water he fell when released a sodden moaning heap on the stones and what was to be the end asked crpin citizen reprsentant we could not decide yet a show of hands was in favour of singeing over a slow fire grace of god but it would seem the accused has forestalled the jury he had not however give him brandy said crpin and bring him to the shed yonder when recovered for the procs verbal he took my arm and we went off together to the place designatedan outbuilding half full of fagots on the way he beckoned the crying aubergiste who had followed him into the yard to attend us for the present the man is saved he said to her when we were alone now what is your interest in the rascal monsieur he was an honest man once of the neighbourhood she looked up at him with her little imploring red eyes come he said i owe you the debt of a grateful digestion of the chteau she said faintly what chteau des pierrettes monsieur crpin as i i could see was beating his brains for some memory connected with the name in fvriers caf i said suddenly should it prove the same for the third time destiny seemed bringing me into touch with a lady of this history ah he said but it is not on my list in what direction does it lie girl monsieur two leagues away off the libourne road by the lane of the marron cornu and who inhabits it the poor girl looked infinitely distressed it is m de lge and his niece you will not make me the instrument to harm them monsieur they are patriots i will swear monsieur monsieur silence girl what are you to question the methods of the republic it is a good recommendation at least that they commission a footpad to patrol the neighbourhood it is none of their doing oh monsieur will you not believe me he was an honest servant of theirs till this religion of reason drove him to the crooked path and he has been dismissed this twelvemonth harkee wench if i read you right you are well quit of a scoundrel she fell to sobbing and clucking over that again and in the midst of her outburst the halfrevived felon was hustled into the shed the poor broken and collapsed creature fell at crpins feet and moaned for mercy give me a day of life he snuffled abjectly and i will lead you to the treasure one of the guard pecked at his ribs with his boot pomme de chou he grunted have you no other song to sing but that but crpin was looking extremely grave and virtuous the prisoner is in no state to be examined he said place him under lock and key with food and drink and i will put him to the question later chapter iv the chteau des pierrettes nous y voici the carriage pulled back with a jerk so that the prisoner michel who sat opposite us was almost thrown into our laps one of our grimy escort appeared at the window dog of a thief he growled is this the turning the other sacrd below his breath and nodded sullenly a vast chestnut the thick of its butt must have been thirty feet in circumference stood at the entrance to a narrow lane turning with a worrying of wheels down the latter we continued our journey southwards from coutras we had broken into a plat of country very wild and sterile but now we were amongst trees againoak chestnut and walnutthat thronged the damp hollows and flung themselves over the low hills in irresistible battalions suddenly michel bent forward and touched my companions knee menacingly the rascal was near restored to himself and his lowering eyes were full of gloom the treasure monsieur he said is that the condition of my liberty i have saiddiscover it to me and thou shalt go free but i monsieur i also must make a condition crpin stared the man bent still more earnestly forward mademoiselle carinne the niece of de lge she must be consideredrespected i will not have her insulted with a look what now michel oh monsieur you may do as you will with the old hard man but herher and is it for the ladys sake thou hast forborne hitherto to appropriate this treasure the hidingplace of which thou wilt buy thy life by revealing it is so i have driven a desperate trade starving often with this knowledge in my breast but why how can i tell i have known her from a child once she struck me that i killed a cheeping wolfcub she had brought from the snow and then she was sorry and kissed the little stupid bruise and i swore my arm should rot before it lost the will to protect her i will do my best but that is not enough my god if i were to sacrifice mademoiselles dot without purpose the purpose is thy life that were nothing were she dishonoured i put in a serene word yet it seems you would condemn her to poverty to save your skin that is different i should have life and life means many thingsthe power possibly to influence her fortunes at least the wash of wine again in ones dusty throat michel i said i must applaud you for a capital rogue he stared at me sombrely muttered je suis ce que je suis and sank back in his corner we were running between dark hedges at the time suddenly we came among farmbuildings a thronging dilapidated group the byres mouldered on their props the flat stones of the roofs had flaked generations of rubbish upon the weedy ground beneath crpin rubbed his hands it is well he said this without doubt is a skinflint we turned a corner and passed the entrance to a ruined drive here the tall iron gates swinging upon massive posts of rubblestone had been recently it seemed torn from their moorings of grass and knotted bindweed for the ground was scarred and the lower bars of metal hung with rags of drooping green crpins features underwent another change at the sight but what is this he muttered something unaccustomedsome scaresome panic he looked with sudden fury at the prisoner if he has got wind of our cominghas escaped with he broke off showing his teeth and grinding his hands together at the moment we came in view of the chteau it was an old grey housebuilt of the same material as the gatepillarswith a highpitched roof and little corner tourelles once presumably a possession of importance decay and neglect had now beggared it beyond description yet within and without were evidences of that vulgar miserly spirit that seeks by inadequate tinkering to deceive with halfmeasures the tangled grass of the lawn was cut only where its untidiness would have been most in evidence and its litter left where it fell triton blew his conch from a fine fountain basin near the middle of the plot but the shell threatening to break away had been fastened to the seagods lips with a ligament of twine that was knotted round the head a crippled bench was propped with a stone a shattered ballcapital at the entrancedoor held together with a loop of wire what restoration that was visible was all in this vein of ludicrous economy but not a sign of life was aboutno footstep in the grounds no face at any window to all appearance the place was desolate we drew up at the broken stone porch the door was already flung wide and we entered with all the usual insolent clatter of fraternity an echoing hall here as elsewhere were dust and decayinconsequent patching and the same tawdry affectation of repair a shallow flight of stairs broad and oaken led straight up to a little low gallery that bisected the hall like a transom up these steps we scuttled the escort driving the prisoner amongst them and came to a corridor from which a number of closed doors shut off the living rooms of the house suddenly crpin put up his hand and motioned us to silence from one of the invisible chambers some distance down the corridor rose and fell like wind in a keyhole a little blasphemous complaining voice in the sober moonlight of my days we made it out to cryafter scaling the rough peaks of selfdenial thus to be tilted over into the depths again by a lying providence there followed some shrill storming of nouns and epithets then a pause out of which the voice snapped once more i hear you you scum of ditchesyou stinking offal of the faubourgsyou publicans ennobled of a shortsighted saviourcome back and finish your work and i will spit poison on you that you shall follow me to the hellto the hell i say the furious dragging of a chair mangled the sentence then came a jarring thump and a further shrieking of oaths with one impulse we made for the door threw it open and burst into the room in the midst of a lofty chamber lay a little man struggling on the floor a pretty heavy priedieu to which he had been bound with his arms behind his back jerking and bobbing above him with his every kick mais cest une tortue cried one of the crew with a howl of laughter the tortoise twisted up its face disfigured with passion it was the face without doubt of the little fessemathieu of fvriers restaurant the room in which he lay was of good proportions but furnished meagrely and informed with the same spirit of graceless economy as was apparent without for the dark ancient panels of its walls had been smeared with some lightgrey wash and an attempt made to decorate them with plaster wreaths and festoons in the louis quinze style the work however had been left unfinished and so far as it went was crude and amateurish to a degree obviously here was an example of that species of niggard that will try to cheat a dozen trades by wringing the gist of all out of one poor factotum but crpin stood with corrugated forehead for there were other signs in the room than those of parsimonysigns in plenty in fact that he had been forestalled in his quest chairs and tables were overturned a bureau was smashed almost to pieces great rents appeared in the panelling of the walls where search had been instituted one would judge for secret depositories a savage oath exploded from m le reprsentants lips that spythat swaggererthat lacombe he muttered looking at me he was vanished this morninghe and his ragged tailwhen we rose he got scent without doubt and has played outrider to my mission of search if it is so if he has found and removedmy god but for all his tallien and the committee of bordeaux he shall dancehe shall dance he turned furiously to his men put the rascal upright he bellowed a couple of them lifted and spun the chair to its legs so that the old mans skull jerked against the headrail with a clack like that of a millhopper he did not seem to notice the blow his eyes ever since they had alighted on this new influx of brigands had been set like a fishswondering and unwinking now they slowly travelled taking in crpin citizen thibaut the escort until they stoppedactually it appeared with a clickat michel his mouth puckered and like a ring blown by a smoker a wavering o issued from it your cidevant servant said crpin grimly the old man nodded his head michel but yesit is michel thou owest him compensation for that long tyranny of service i owe him nothing and me citizen dost thou remember the abbaye st germain and the killings of september i struck in with the question i was willing i think for the girls sake to identify myself with a past incident he looked at me bitterly but with no recognition in his eyes i deplore the cursed fortune he cried in grief that preserved me but for this how now old fool said crpin with impatience thou shalt go free when michel has revealed to me thy secret place of hoarding m de lge gave the crying snarl of a wolf let him gothe ingrate and the traitor what michel dost thou mangle the hand that gave thee soft litter for thy couch and honest bread for thy belly look michelthe white garlands on the walls there dost thou remember how thou wroughtst them to pleasure thy mistressto win her from the depression she suffered in the sombre oak and its long history of gloom there they cling unfinishedthy solemn rebuke michel thy attachment to her was the one reality thou wouldst say in a world of shadows and yet the blatant fanfare of those shadows was all that was needed to win thee from the reality and what is the price of thy kiss judas the man hung his head not your life monsieur he muttered nay but only that which makes my life endurable and the forfeitwhat is that my life monsieur de lge drew in his breath with a cruel sound hlas he cried you will have to pay the penalty the faithful servant will have to pay the penalty crpin uttered an exclamation and strode forward you have been stripped said he of all monsieur of all there have been others here before you this morningfine sansculotte preachers of equality and the gospel of distribution whose practice nevertheless is to enrich the poor at the expense of the wealthy they were brave fellows by their own showing yet they must truss me here before they dared brandish the fruits of their robbery before my eyes suddenly he was straining and screaming in his bonds his face like a map of some inhuman territory of the passions branched with veins for rivers of blood free me that i may kill some one he shrieked i am mad to groove my fingers in flesh the time for concessions is past i was as wax in their hands till they unearthed my plate my coins my riches now now he was indeed beyond himself a better manor devilin his despair than the moneyconscious craven who had palpitated over that little vive le roi once upon a time crpin regarded the struggling creature with harsh contempt this plebeian soul also was translated but not to his moral promotion it was evident he had enlarged the scope of his anticipations greatly in view of his prisoners promise and his disappointment brought the spotted side of him uppermost take the dog he cried in a hoarse voice signifying michel by a gesture and whip him to the lair at least we will look to see if the wolves have left a bone or two for our picking m le reprsentant i ventured to say be just to consider that the prisoner is by all rights my prisoner anyhow he has stuck to his side of the bargain let me hold you in fairness responsible for his safeconduct he turned upon me like a teased bullock in fairness he criedin fairness but you presume citizen on your position he looked as if he could have struck me all the beast in the man was prominent then he gave the order to march and i found myself left alone with the little grotesque in the chair i was hot and indignant but the passion of the other seemed to have exploded itself into a rain of emotion his dry cheeks quivered the tears ran down them like moisture on an old wall monsieur i said softly i know not whether to applaud or upbraid you and where is mademoiselle carinne he seemed quite broken in a momentneither to resent nor to be surprised at my mention of the girls name she is fled he whimperedthe little graceless cabbage is fled to safety i hope to the devil for all i care monsieur i hold your wretchedness an excuse even if you have been careless of he caught me up staring at me woefully careless but my god i have pampered and maintained her ever since her brown head was a crutch to my fingers and this is how she repays me what has she done she has condemned me to beggary for a prudish sentimentme in my old forlorn age from the first i saw that the test might comethat she might be called upon to employ the privileges of her sex on my behalf freethought freelove bah what are they but a selfadaptation to the everchanging conditions of life the spirit need not subscribe to such mere necessities of being and a little gratitude at least was due to me she has none and for that may god strike her dead what has she done done his voice rose to a shriek again but what has she notthat scoundrel lacombe would have exchanged me my richesmy pitiful show of tankards that he had unearthedfor her favour she would not she refused to go with him she reviled and cursed meme that had been her bulwark against poverty you would have sold her honour for your brazen pots gold and silver monsieur and it was only a question of temporary accommodation in a few months she might have returned and all would have been well again but honourbah it will survive a chinchuck better than loss of wealth but she would not she escaped from us by a lying ruse and they sought her far and near without avail at the last they robbed and maltreated me and for that may hell seize them and fester in their bones and in thine thou pestilence my fury and my contempt joined with a clap like detonating acids lie there and rot i shouted and so flung out of the room my heart blazed that white girlthat carinne i could recall her face could picture her in her loneliness arraigned before lacombe and his sansculottes and his reptile prisonerdefying them all with some vague instinct of search directing my fury i hurried through room after room of the empty house each was like its neighbour vulgarised scantily furnished disfigured by the search that had been conducted therein once i broke into the girls own bedchamber it was hers i will swear by token of little feminine fancies consistent with the character i had gifted her withal and cursed the beasts who had evidently made it the rallyingpoint of their brutal jesting but this obviously must be the last place in which to seek her and i quickly left it not a soul did i happen upon of whomsoever the household had consisted no single individual but the old villain in the chair was remained to brazen out the situation at last i made my way into the grounds once more issuing from the rear of the building into a patch of dense woodland that flowed up to within fifty yards of the walls i heard voices and plunging down a moist track amongst the trees came immediately in view of my party returning to the house then i saw there were two women conducted in its midst and my throat jumped and i ran forward at least my sudden apprehension was comforted these crying wenches were of the working classcomely domestics by their appearance crpin stayed them all when he came up to me the ugly look had not left his facewas intensified on it in fact he stared at me haughty and lowering at once and was altogether a very offensive creature has citizen thibaut any further exception to take to my methods of procedure he said ironically i looked at him but did not reply because he went on perhaps his permission should be asked that these pretty citizenesses accompany me in my carriage mais non monsieurpar piti mais non cried one of the wenches in a sobbing voice he bent down to hera sicklily selfrevealed animal hush ma petite he said we of the republic do not askwe take thou shalt have a brighter gown than ever de lge furnished for thy shapely limbs she stopped crying and seemed to listen at that he came erect again with a smile on his face and his lips licking together and regarded me defiantly the citizen representative can please himself i said coldly and pushed past them all and walked on crpin turned to look after me gave a peculiar cynical laugh and cried en avant to his party i was to read the significance of his attitude in a momentto read it in the dead form of michel hanging from a tree i rushed back along the path and caught the others as they issued from the wood crpin heard me coming bade his men on to the house and returned a pace or two to meet me his mood asserted he was something inclined i suppose to a resumption of the better terms between us at any rate his expression now was a mixture of embarrassment and a little apprehension but i spoke to him very staidly and quietly m crpin it dawns upon me that i am slow to learn the methods of the new morality and that i shall never justify your choice of a secretary you are going to leave me there will be the more room in the coach for monsieurs harem i made him a low bow and went off amongst the trees he called after methere was some real regret in his voicebut you will come to harm be wisemonsieur i paid no heed and the thickets received and buried me chapter v la grand bte my rupture with crpin was the preface to a period of my life the details of which i could never but doubtfully piece together in my mind during this period i lived but how i supported existence is a problem that it is beyond my power to solve i have an indistinct memory of wandering amongst treesalways amongst trees in light and darkness in drought and in dew of scaring and being scared by snakes that rustled from me over patches of dead leaves of swallowing in desperate phases of hunger berries and forest fruits of whose properties i was as ignorant as of their names and throughout the strange thought dwelt with me warm and insistent that i was the champion elect of that white carinne with whom i had never so much as exchanged a word to me she was the una of these fathomless green depthsthe virgin who had carried her maidenhood and her pride to the republic of the woods where security and an equal condition were the right of all this fanciful image possessed a singular fascination for me it glimmered behind trees it peered through the thick interlace of branches i heard the paddle of its feet in mossy rills or the low song of its voice rising from some shadow prostrate in beds of fern no doubt fatigue and hunger and that sense of a long responsibility repudiated came to work a melodious madness in my brain for days loitering aimlessly under its spell i was happyhappier i believe than i had ever been hitherto i had become a thing apart from mankinda fauna reversion to the near soulless type but with the germ of spirit budding in me it was a desire to avoid a certain horror dangling over a track that had at first driven me into the thickets and so lost me my way the memory of a blot of shadow on the sunny grass underneath that same horror that swayed sluggishly like the disc of a pendulum as the body swayed above got into my waking thoughts and haunted them i wished to put a worldwide interval between myself and the blotthough i had seen monstrosities enough of late god knows but in the silent woods under that enchanted fancy of my relapse to primitive conditions a loathing of the dead man such as cain might have felt sickened all my veins i was done with violenceastonished that its employment could ever have entered into the systems of such a defenceless race as man but also i knew that to me moving no longer under the gis of authority the towns and the resorts of men were become quagmires for my uncertain feet i was three hundred miles from paris all my neighbourhood was dominated by revolutionary committees my chance of escape did once that black cuttlefish of the terror touch me with a tentacle a fingersnap would express my hitherto immunity was due indeed to the offices of certain friends and a little perhaps to my constitutional tendency to allow circumstances to shape my personality as they listed resigned to the remotest possibilities my absence of affectation was in a sense my safeguard here however far from the centre of operations that which under certain conditions had proved my protection would avail me nothing a sober nonchalance an easy manner would be the very thyrsus to whip these coarse provincial hinds to madness and finding in my new emancipationor intellectual decadencean ecstasy i had not known before i was very tender of my life and had no longer that old power of indifference in me to the processes of fatality how long this state of exaltation lasted i do not know but i know it came to me all in a moment that i must eat or die it was the reflection of my own face i think in a little pool of water that wrought in me this first dull recrudescence of reason the wild countenance of a maniac stared up at me its hollow jaws bristled like the withered husks of a chestnut its lips were black with the juice of berries an animal abandon slept in the pupils of its eyes ah it was better that reason should triumph over circumstance than that the soul should subscribe tamely to its own disinheritance all in an instant i had set off running through the wood that privilege of man to dare and to fail i would not abrogate for all the green retreats of nature for hours it seemed to me i hurried onwards my heart sobbed in my chest my breath was like a knotted cord under my shirt at last quite suddenly blue sky came at me through the trunks and i broke from the dense covert into a field of maize and found myself looking down a half mile of sloping arable land upon a large town of ancient houses whereof at the gate opposite me the tricolour mounted guard on the height of a sombre tower now in view of this my purpose somewhat wavering i sat me down in the thick of the corn and set to wondering how i could act for the best i had assignats in my pocket and a little money yet there could be no dealings for me in the open market thinking of my appearance i knew that by my own act i had yielded myself to the condition of a hunted creature all the afternoon i crouched in patches of the higher stalks peeping down upon the town that spreading up a gentle slope in the nearer distance lay mapped before my eyes sometimes desperate in my hunger i would snatch a head of the standing grain but to chew and swallow more than would just blunt the edge of my suffering would be i knew to invite a worser torture the sun beat on my head my throat was caked with drought at last i could endure it no longer but retreated once more into the wood and waited for the shadows to lengthen it was early evening when i ventured into the field again and looked down the falling sunlight smote the town with fire from the west so that its walls and turrets seemed to melt in the glare and run into long pools of shadow but here and there wan ribbons of streets or patches of open places broke up the sombrenessin vivid contrast with itand seemed to swarm alone of all the dappled area with crawling shapes of these blotches of whiteness one flashed and scintillated at a certain point from some cause i could not at first fathom now white now red it stretched across the fields a rayed beam that dazzled my woodhaunted eyes with the witchery of its brightness but presently i saw the open patch whence it issued grow dark with a press of figures it was as if a cloth had been pulled over a dead face and all in a moment the strange flash fell and rose againlike a hawk that has caught a life in its talonsand a second time swooped and mounted clustered with red raysand a third time and a fourth but by then i had interpreted the writing on the wall and it was the mene mene written on the bright blade of the guillotine by the finger of the setting sun a very strange and quiet pity flowed in my veins as i looked here was i resting amidst the tranquillity of a golden harvest watching that other harvest being gathered in could it be possible that any point of my picture expressed other than the glowing serenity that was necessary to the composition i felt as if in the intervals of the flashing each next victim must be stepping forward with a happy consciousness of the part he was to play in the design then suddenly i threw myself on my face and crushed my palms against my mouth that i might not shriek curses on the inexorable beauty of the heavens above me i did not look again or rise from my covert till dark was drooping over the hillside but with the first full radiance of moonrise i got to my feet feeling dazed and lightheaded and went straight off in an easterly direction my plan was to circumambulate at a safe distance the walls that could enclose no possibility of help to me in my distress and seek relief of my hunger in some hamlet less emancipated on their farther side if the town was libourne as i believed it to be then i knew the village of st milion to lie but a single league to the southeast of it walking as in a dream i came out suddenly into the highroad and saw the moondrenched whiteness of it flow down to the very closed gates far below me its track was a desolate tide on which no life was moving for nowadays the rural population was mostly drifted or driven into the seething marketplaces of the revolution now my imagination pictured this cold and silent highway a softly tumultuous streama welded torrent of phantoms mingling and pushing and hurrying in the midst of noiseless laughter to beat on the town gates and cry out murmuringly that a suspect was fording a channel of its upper reaches this fright this fancy one would hardly credit it brought the sweat out under my clothes but it was to be succeeded by a worse for as i looked the boiling wash of moonlight was a road again and there came up it footsteps rhythmically clanking and unearthlyand others and yet others till the whole night was quick with their approach and as the footfalls neared me they ceased abruptly and there followed the sound of an axe ringing down in wooden grooves and then i knew that the victims of the evening ghastly and impalpable were come to gaze upon the man who had indulged his soul even for a moment with the enchantment of a prospect whose accent was their agony now assuredly my reason was in a parlous statewhen with a whoop that broke the spell an owl swept above me and fled eastwards down the sky and i answered to its call and crossed the road and plunged into fields again and ran and stumbled and went blindly on once more until i had to pause for breath at last i heard the rumbling wash of water and paused a stonesthrow from a riverbank and here a weight of terror seemed to fall from me to mark how wan and sad the real stream looked and how human in comparison with that other demon current of my imagining from its bosom a cluster of yards and masts stood up against the sky and by that i knew that i was come upon the dordogne where it opened out into a port for the once busy town of libourne and that if ever caution was necessary to me it was necessary now i looked to my right a furlong off the rampart of the walls swept black and menacing and over them close at hand now the silent yoke of the guillotine rose into the moonlight it must have been perched upon some high ground within and there it stood motionless its jaws locked in slumber could it be the same monster i had watched flashing scarlet and furious from the hillside now the ravening of its gluttony was satisfied jacques bourreau had wiped its slobbered lips clean with a napkin sullenly satiate propped against the sky straddling its gaunt legs over the empty trough at its feet it slept with lidless eyes that seemed to gloat upon me in a hideous trance bah now all this is not jeanlouis sebastien de cranc nor even citizen thibaut it is in truth the halfconscious delirium of a brain swimming a little with hunger and thirst and fatigue and i must cut myself adrift from the hysterical retrospection i hurried towards the river running obliquely to the southeast if i could once win to clean water i was prepared in my desperation to attempt to swim to the opposite bank stumbling and sometimes wallowing i made my way up a sludgy shore and suddenly came to a little creek or cove where a boat lay moored to a post close by a wooden shanty set in a small common garden with benches like the guinguettes of paris rattled to its very walls with boisterous disputation while the shadows of men tossing winecups danced on its one windowblind i unhitched the painter of the boat pushed the prow from the bank and as the little craft swung out into the channel scrambled softly on board and felt for the sculls in a panic when i had once grasped and tilted these into the rowlocks i breathed a great sigh of relief and pulled hurriedly round the stern of a swinging vessel into the coolrunning waters of the dordogne it was not until i had made more than half the passage to the farther side that i would venture to pause a moment to assuage my cruel thirst then resting on my oars i dipped in my hat and drank again and again until my whole system seemed to flow with moisture like a rush at last clapping my sopped hat on my head i was preparing to resume my work when i uttered a low exclamation of astonishment and sat transfixed for something moved in the sternsheets of the boat and immediately putting aside a cloak under which it appeared he had lain asleep a child sat up on the bottom boards now my heart seemed to tilt like a topheavy thing must this hateful necessity be mine thento silence for my own safety this baby of six or seven this little comical poupon with the round cropt head and ridiculous small shirt he stared at me rubbed the sleep from his eyes and suddenly began to whimper heu heu he cried in the cheeping voice of a duckling la grand bte he took me for the mythical monster of the peasants whose power of assumption of any form is in ratio with the corrective ingenuity of nurses and mothers yes i said my brain leaping to an idea i am la grand bte and if you make a noise i shall devour you his eyes were like full brown agates his chin puckered to his lower lip but he crushed his little fists against his chest to stay the coming outcry my face relaxed as i looked at him la grand bte is kind to the little ones that obey him can you use these sculls mais oui he whispered with a soft sob i am the pretty little waterman very well now little waterman i shall land at the bank over there and then you can take the sculls and pull the boat across to the cove again but you must be very silent and secret about having gone with la grand bte over the river or he will come to your bedside in the night and devour you i had been rowing gently as i talked and now the nose of the skiff grounded easily under a low bank i shipped the sculls reached forward and took the rogue in my arms oh but la grand bte loves the good children be a discreet little waterman and thou shalt find a gold louis under thy pillow this very day month i kissed him and turning caught at the knots of grass and hauled myself up the bank it was a clumsy disembarkation for a god perhaps but my late comrade did not appear to be shaken in his faith i stopped and looked back at him when i had run a few yards from the river he was paddling vigorously away with a professional air and the moonlight was shattered on his scullblades into a rain of diamonds suddenly a patrolboat was pulled up the river across his bows and i half turned to fly my heart in my mouth hullo hullo jacksprat cried a rough voice what dost thou here at this hour they were noisy in the auberge answered the childish treble and i could not sleep i went on my way with a smile to have used the boat and cast it adrift would not have prospered me so well as did this accident yet i felt a shame of meanness to hear the little thing taking its lying cue from me lie to the men and i wished i had not clinched my purchase of his silence with that promise of a louisdor pushing boldly across a wide moondappled margin of grass so thronged with trees as to afford one good cover i came out suddenly into a fieldtrack running southwards and along this i sped at a fast pace but presently seeing figures mounting towards me from the dip of a flying slope i dived into a belt of corn that ran on my left between the track and the skirt of a dense wood and lay close among the stalks waiting for the travellers to pass this however to my chagrin they did not but when they were come right over against me they stopped very disputative and voluble in a breathless manner and lashed one another with knotty thongs of patriotism but who wants virtue or moderation in a commonwealth dost not thou ii want headsa head for every cobblestone in the rue st jacques i would walk on the brains of selfseekers this roland he wore strings in his shoes to rebuke the vanity of the veto and to indulge his own head of a cabbage thou wouldst weep over the orator though he condemned thy belly to starvation what shall i satisfy my hunger with a thesis on the beauty of selfdenial because like a drum it has a full sound be sure i do not defend him but has he not practised what he taught of a certainty and is doubledamned thereby for know that these austere moralists have found their opportunity to indulge a hobbynot to avenge a people what do we want with abstinence who have practised it all our lives what do we want with interminable phrases on the sublimity of duty but thou wilt not understand that political economy bah i know it for the economy of wordsthat delicious terminer les dbats of the jury that rolls another lying mouth into the basket and makes a body the less to feed but i tell thee with every fall of the axe i feel myself shifting a place nearer the rich joints at the top of the feast liberty that i desire is the free indulgence of my appetites now would not roland and vergniaud and their crew shave me nicely for that sentiment therefore i love to hunt them down a vieux chat jeune souris how indeed could these old grimalkins grown toothless under tyranny digest this tough problem of virtue for its own sake their food must be minced for them i never saw their faces but i guessed them by a certain croaking in their speech to be worn with years and suffering presently to my disgust they had out their pipes and a flask of cognac and sat themselves down against the edge of the corn for a mild carouse i waited on and on listening to their snuffling talk till i grew sick with the monotony of it and the cramp of my position they were i gathered informers employed by tallien in his search for those escaped deputies who were believed to be in hiding in the neighbourhood at last i could stand it no longer move i must for all the risk it entailed i set to work very cautiously a foot at a time wriggling on my belly through the corn they took no notice each being voluble to assert his opinions against the other presently making towards the wood i found the field to dip downwards to its skirt so that i was enabled to raise myself to a crouching position and increase my pace the relief was immense i was running as the treetrunks came near and opened out to me now i was so weary that i thought i must sleep awhile before i proceeded i was pushing through the last few yards of the stalks when a guttural snarl arrested me immediately right in my path a head was protruded from the corn and a bristled snout slavering in the moonlight was lifted at me i stood a moment transfixeda long moment it appeared to me the ridiculous fancy occurred to me that the yellow eyes glaring into mine would go on dilating till presently i should find myself embedded in their midst like a prawn in aspic then with a feeling of indescribable politeness in my heart i turned aside to make a dtour into the wood stepping on tiptoe as if i were leaving a sickroom once amongst the trees i penetrated the darkness rapidly to the depth of a hundred yards not venturing to look behind me and indeed only before in search of some reasonable branch or fork where i might rest in safety wolves i had not taken these into my calculations in the glowing solstice of summer and it gave me something a shock to think what i had possibly escaped during my unguarded nights in the forest at length i found the place i soughta little natural chair of branches high enough to be out of the reach of wild beasts yet the ascent thereto easy i climbed to it notched myself in securely and my hunger somewhat comforted by the water i had drunk fell almost immediately into a delicious stupor i awoke quite suddenly yet with a smooth swift leap to consciousness the angle of moonlight was now shifted to an oblique one so that no rays entered direct and the space beneath me was sunk into profound darkness for some moments i lay in a happy trance dully appreciative of the indistinct shapes that encompassed me of the smell of living green bark near my face of the stars embroidered into a woof of twigs overhead but presently gazing down a queer little phenomenon of light fixed my attention indifferently at first then with an increase of wonder this spot of pink radiance waxed and waned and waxed and waned with a steady recurrence on the butt of a great tree twenty yards away at first it was of a strong rosy tint but little by little it faded till it was a mere phosphorescent blot and then while i was flogging my brains to think what it could be of a sudden it seemed to fly down to the noise of a little grunting explosion and break into a shower of scarlet sparks at that i was betrayed into a squiggle of laughter for my phenomenon had in the flash resolved itself into nothing more mysterious than the glow from the pipe of a man seated silently smoking with his head thrown back against the treefoot hullo he exclaimed in a surprised voice but with nothing of fear in it and i congratulated myself at least that the voice struck a different note to that of either of m talliens informers nevertheless i had been a fool and i judged it the wise policy to slide from my perch and join my unseen companion he made me out i am sure long before i did him yet he never moved or showed sign of apprehension good evening jacques said i good morrow rather jacques squirrel he answered is it so it is so you prefer the burrow it seems and i the branch no doubt we are not birds of a feather why truly i seek deputies i said in a sudden inspiration and i my fortune he answered serenely we travel by the same road then have you a fragment of bread on you comrade if i had a loaf thou shouldst go wanting a crumb of it and why citizen i do not love spies i fetched a grimace over my miscarried ruse then wilt thou never make thy fortune in france i said he gave a harsh laugh you will prevent me for that word citizen i curled myself up under the tree i will wait for the dawn and read thee thy fortune i said and charge thee nothing for it but a kick to help thee on thy way he laughed again at that thou provest thyself an ass said he and refilled and lit his pipe and smoked on silently i lay awake near him because churl as he appeared i felt the advantage of any human companionship in these beasthaunted thickets at last the light of dawn penetrated a little to where we rested and when it was broad enough to distinguish objects by i rolled upon my elbow and scrutinised my companion closely good morrow then burner of charcoal he turned to me a leering smile suspended on his lips comment said he but i am a palmist my friend as you observe he looked at his stunted and blackened fists ah si fait vraiment that is to tell my past condition of poverty not my fortune the rest shall come observe my fitness for my post you are from the forests of nontron he started and stared truly i have no love for spies he muttered dismayed it was my turn to laugh i had hazarded a bold guess that he was from the woods rather than from the landes his gift of seeing through the darkness convinced me then if from the woods why not from that part of the province where they stretched thickest and most meet for his trade now said i for what follows it comes to your ears that guienne is hatching a fine breed of maggots from the carcasses of dead aristocrats that there is a feast of rich fragments toward you will have your share you will eat of these aristocrats that have so long fed on you that is a very natural resolve but in a republic of maggots as in all other communities there is always a proportion of the brood that will fatten unduly at the expense of its fellows these despots by constitution appropriate the most succulent parts they wax thick and strong and finally they alone of the swarm hatch out into flies while the rest perish undeveloped it is a cursed parable he said sullenly i do not comprehend you i speak of the people my friendof whom you are not one that will fatten and why and why you have scruples you decry at the outset the methods of this select clique of the republic that has the instinct to prosper if i congratulate you on the possession of a conscience i must deplore in anticipation the sacrifice of yet another martyr to that truism which history repeats as often as men forget it what truism sayst thou that swinish fortune will love the lusty bully that drains her though the bulk of the litter starve he spat savagely on the ground i do not comprehend he muttered again well i said at least let us hope there is an especial paradise reserved for the undeveloped maggots he rose and stood brooding a moment then looked away from me and cried morosely get up to my astonishment from a sort of cradle of roots to the farther side of the tree a young girl scrambled to her feet at his call and stood yawning and eyeing me loweringly your daughter said i yes he answered she is my daughter what then i jumped up in some suppressed excitement i recall my words i said you have a chance after all down there in bordeaux and now i see that it is a thief that fears a spy i pointed at the wench she was dressed ridiculously inappropriately in a silk gown of a past fashion but rich in quality and decorated with a collar of pointlace out of this her dirty countenance thatched with a villainous mop of hair stuck grotesquely and the skirt of the dress had been roughly caught up to disencumber her bare feet the man stamped on the ground i do not fear you he cried furiously and i am no thief i laughed derisively but it is true he shouted a young lady we met in the woods of coutras would exchange it for nannettes jupon and why the devil should we deny her my heart gave a sudden swerve what was she like this lady i said the fellow glanced sulkily askance at me does not the spy know he said perhaps he does say this demoiselle was slender and of a reasonable height that she had brown hair and grey eyes under dark brows that her face was of a cold transparent whiteness that she spoke with a certain soft huskiness in her voice he cried under his breath with a note of fright the devil is in this man i laughed and took off my hat and made the two a bow to your quick advancement in bordeaux i said he stared a moment seemed to hesitate then roughly summoning the girl to follow him strode off through the wood the moment they were out of sight i sat down again to ponder was it true then that these peasants had met carinnethat they had helped her to a disguisefor what purpose she must have been in the woods whilst i was thereaccursed destiny that kept us apart at least i must return to them at once and seek her i broke into a queer embarrassed fit of laughter what selfordained mission was this what was my interest in the girl or how would she not resent perhaps the insolence of my interference she had no claim upon my protection or i upon her favour very well and very wellbut i was going to seek her nevertheless such queer little threads of irresponsible adventure pulled me in these days but at first for my hunger it was a great voice in an empty house it would not be refused or put off with a feast of sentiment eat i must if it was only of a hunk of sour peasebread suddenly i thought of that bestial apparition at the woodskirt there had been a liquid yong in its snarl as if it could not forbear the action of gluttonous jaws even while they were setting at an intruder perhaps the remains of a goat i started running towards the point at which i believed i had entered amongst the trees very shortly i emerged into the open and saw the cornfield shimmering violet before me in the dawn i beat up and down amongst the standing grain and all in a moment came upon that i sought a goat it might have been or a scapegoat bearing the sins of the people for anything human in its appearance yet it was the body of a manof a great man too in his day i believethat lay before me in the midst of a trampled crib of stalks but featureless halfdevoureda seething abomination now in the placid aftermath of my fortunes i can very easily shudder over that thought of the straits to which hunger will drive one then i only know that through all the abhorrence with which i regarded the hideous remains the sight of an untouched satchel flung upon the ground beside them thrilled me with hope i stooped had it in my hands unbuckled it with shaking fingers it was full to choking of bread and raisins and a little flask of cognac probably the poor wretch had not thought it worth his while to satisfy the needs of an existence he was about to put an end to for the horn handle of a knife the blade of which was hidden in the decaying heart of the creature stood out slackly from a hoop of ribs i withdrew into the wood and without a scruple attacked the provisions it was a dry and withered feast yet i had been fastidiously critical of many a service aux repas at versailles that gave me not a tithe of the pleasure i now enjoyed and at the last i drank to the white andromeda whose perseus i then and there proclaimed myself to be chapter vi the herd of swine i was back in the woods of pierrettes my precious satchel still but twothirds emptied slung about my shoulders my clothes wrinkled dry from their sopping in the waters of the dordogne all that day of my finding of the food had i lain concealed in the woods but with the fall of dusk i made my way by a long dtour to the riverbank and crossed the stream swimming and in safety and now was i again la grand bte seeking to trace in the scent of trodden violets the path by which my phantom carinne had vanished that night i passed warned by experience in the branches of a tree with dawn of the following day i was on foot again striking northwards by the sun and stretching over the encumbered miles with all the speed i could accomplish i had a thought in my breast and good fortune enabled me to put it to the proof for somewhere about four oclock as i judged i emerged into a woodland track that i felt convinced was the one made detestable by a dangling body and sure enough i came of a sudden to the fatal tree and was aware of a cut slack of rope hanging from a branch thereof though the corpse itself was removed now it behoved me to proceed with caution which i did yet none so successfully but that i came plump out of the mouth of the green passage upon m de lge himself and saw and was seen by him in a single moment therefore i had nothing for it but to brazen out the situation he showed no disturbance at my approach nor indeed did he take any notice of me but he crept hither and thither with lacklustre eyes gathering nettles i went up to him suppressing my repugnance of the miserable creature is mademoiselle returned i said outright he stopped in his picking and leered up at me vaguely he seemed utterly broken and forlorn she will not return he said and resumed his task i stood some moments watching him suddenly he clasped his hands plaintively together and looked me again in the face why did she go at all he said can monsieur tell me for i forget he put his fingers aimlessly like an infant to his head i had a pride in her she was beautiful and selfwilled mon dieu but she would make me laugh or tremble the rogue well she is gone could it be that his every memory of his villainy was lost with his cherished tankards what a love was mine he murmured i would have denied her nothingin reason and she has deserted me monsieur i said do you remember me you you he cried angrilywhat do i know or care about this orson that springs upon me from the green you need to be shaved and washed monsieur undoubtedly if monsieur would provide me with the means he gave me a quick inquisitive look you have a queer accent for a patriot well wellit is no concern of mine again he resumed his task again to pause in it do you seek a service i hear it is the case with many i seek food and a lodging for the night eh but can you pay for them in reasoncertainly in reason so thenshould georgette bring a generous basketfulbah he cried suddenly stamping irritably on the groundi offer you my poor hospitality monsieur and the leer came into his eyes againshould monsieur feel any scruple a vail left on the mantelpiece for the servants will doubtless satisfy it but he had no servant left to him it would seem when byandby he ushered me with apish ceremony into his house i found the place desolate and forlorn as we had left it i have reduced my following he said since my niece withdrew herself from my protection what does a single bachelor want with an army of locusts to devour him he showed me into a little bare room on the second floor with nothing worthy of remark in it but an illfurnished bedstead and a baneful picture on the wall that i learnt was a portrait of carinne by herself it is a little of a travesty said de lge she looked in a mirror and painted as she saw herself thereincrooked like a stick dipt under water but she was clever for all she insisted that this was a faithful likeness i believe there were tears on his face as he left me what a riddle was the creature there is a blind spot in every eye it is saidand the eyes are the windows of the soul he had supplied me with soap and water and a razor and these i found almost as grateful to my wants as the satchel had been when i was something restored to cleanliness i descended to the corridor below and attracted by a sound of movement entered one of the rooms that opened therefrom within a young woman was engaged in laying one end of a carvedoak table with a white napkin she looked round as i advanced stared gave a twitter of terror and retreating to the wall put an arm up with the elbow pointed at me as if i were something horrible in her sight i had a sharp intuition for this i saw was the little aubergiste of the golden lion you think me responsible for the poor rogues hanging i said she whispered yes with a pitiful attempt to summon her indignation to this ordeal of fear i went up to her and spoke gently while she shrunk from me georgette my child it is not so you must take that on my honour for i am a gentleman georgette in disguise in disguise she whispered with trembling lips but her eyes wondered truly little girl i am a wanderer now and proscribed because i would not lend myself to thy michels punishment oh she sobbed but it was cruel and the republic destroys its own children msieu thy father ah he at least is back if still under surveillance otherwise i should not be enabled to come daily to minister to the needs of this poor lonely old man now thou art a good soul thou little aubergiste and thy ministrations are meat to him i perceive hush msieu but if he were to hear he asks no questions he accepts all like a child he would die of shame were he to learn that he owes his dinner to the gratitude of msieu his fathers dependant is he so sensitive thou great little georgette and mademoiselleshe does not return she shook her head tell me where she is child for i believe you know oh she murmured obviously in great distress msieu must not ask me i took her hands and drew her towards me look in my eyes and tell me what you see there she glanced up scared and entreating but is it cruelty false faith the currish soul of the liar and informer no no msieu then is it not rather the honour of a gentleman the chivalry that would help and protect a defenceless woman cast adrift in this fearful land of blood and licence i gave her my title now i said you can cast me to the axe with a word and where is mademoiselle carinne georgette she still hesitated i could see the little womanly soul of her tossing on a lake of tears at least i said she will not return hither she will never returnoh monseigneur she will never return and it is not for me to say why i released her hands well i said i would have helped her and have cared for her georgette but you will not let me she broke forth at once at that her arms held out and her eyes swimming i will tell you monseigneurall that i know and god forgive me if i do wrong and me georgette and wither me with his vengeance i will tell you monseigneur that nightthat night after the terror she spent in the woods and all the next day she hid there moving towards coutras i would go often to the chteau to take to m de lge the money for our weekly bill of faggots andand for other reasons and now she watched for me and waylaid me and told me all oh msieu she was incensedand it was not for me to judge but m de lge is a wise man and perhaps there is a wisdom that makes too little account of the scruples of our sex she would not return to him well she would beg or starve sooner she said and she would begin by asking a little food of me oh msieu but the sad proud demoiselle my heart wept to hear her so humble to the peasant girl to whom she had been good and gracious always in the old days of peace that is well and where is she i cannot tell you msieu ah pardon she but waited for the night when i could bring her foodall that would keep and that she could carryand then she started on foot for the mountains of gatine now mon dieu they must be twenty leagues away twentyfive msieu by la roche chalais and mareuil but she would avoid the towns and journey by way of the woods and the harsh desolate country mother of god but it makes me weep to think of her white face and her tender feet in those frightful solitudes it is madness but indeed msieu and though the towns gather all to them and the country is depopulated there may be savages still left here and thereswineherds charcoalburners to whom that libertine lacombe silence girl and you would have denied her a protector she bound me to silence msieu lest her uncle should send in pursuit it is madnessit is madness and what does she go to seek in the mountains ah msieu i know notunless it is some haven of rest where the footstep of man is never heard now georgette will you meet me tonight where you met her and bring me foodfor which i will pay youand point me out the way that mademoiselle carinne took at parting i have a mind to journey to the mountains also and to go by the harsh country and to start in the dark will you georgette pray the good god she said that it is not all a jeu de loieand at that moment we heard de lge feebly mounting the stairway he entered the room and accosted me with a sort of sly courtesy that greatly confounded me associations connected with my reappearance perhaps had kindled the slow fuse of his memory but the flame would burn fitfully and in a wrong direction and indeed i think the shock of his loss of the tankards had quite unhinged his mind shall we fall to he said this is not paris yet our good country grisels can canvass the favour of a hungry man he gave a ridiculous little laugh and what have we here girl he said msieu it is a pasty of young partridges his palate was not dulled with his wits it foretasted the delicacy and his eyes moistened he lingered regretfully over the wedge he cut for me be generous monsieur he cried with an enjoying chuckle and own that you have been served none better at vrys oh but i know my paris i was there so late as september of last year and again on business connected with my estate during the month of the kings trial he blenched over some sudden halfmemory but the sight of georgette carrying my platter to me restored him to the business of the table i know my paris he cried again i have taken kidneys with champagne at la rapes sheeps feet at la buvette du palais oysters at rocher de canale hoho but does monsieur know the rocher venite ad me omnes qui stomacho laboratis et ego restaurabo vos i said quoting a wellknown inscription over an eatinghouse he gave a sharp little squeak eh but monsieur has the right etymology of the restaurateur he is a man of taste and of delicacy this poor burgundy he clawed up his glassit might have been clos vougeot de tourton if monsieur had not been so stringent in his sequestration he favoured me with a leervery arch and very anxious i could only stare evidently he took me in his wandering mind for some other than that i was i was to be enlightened in a moment it was when georgette had left the room and we were alone the falling sunlight came through a curtain of vineleaves about the window and reddened his old mad face he bent forward looking at me eagerly hush monsieur the platethe tankardsthe christeningcups you will let me have them back my god there was a cross in niello of the twelfth century it will bring you nothing in the markets of the vandals monsieur monsieur i accept your termshot terms brave terms for a bold wooer but you must not seek to carry her with a high hand she knows herself and her pride and her beauty hush i can tell you where she lies hidden she crouches under a rosebush in the garden and as the petals fall they have covered and concealed her now i understood he was again in his lost soul staking carinne against his forfeited pots he took me for lacombe i jumped to my feet and now began my second period of wandering but under conditions infinitely more trying than the first keeping to the dense woods by day and traversing the highways only by night i had hitherto escaped that which was to prove the cruellest usurer of my vigourthe merciless blazing sun here as i travelled by desolate broomy wastes by arid hills from which any knob of rock projecting was hot as the handle of an oven by choking woods and endless winding valleysi would sometimes ask myself in amazement what could be the nature of the infatuation that for its own sake would elect to endure these sufferings i had not spoken to the girl i was not authorised to champion her cause strangest of all the lack of womanly sensitiveness she had displayed under the very ordeal of st fargeaus dying groans had not prepossessed me in her favour yet slowly was i making and would continue to make my way to these mountains of limosin in the dreamy hope of happening upon a selfwilled and rather heartless young woman whoif we were to come togetherwould probably resent my intrusion as an affront truly an eccentric quest welli was unaccountable to myself and of no account to others maybe that last is the explanation my world of conventions was dead and i livedas i have already saida posthumous life through it no doubt i was drawn by shadowsattracted by the unexplainableblown by any wind of irresponsibility this anarchy at least opened out strange vistas of romance to the imaginative soul it is odd to live apart from and independent of the voice of duty that state shall seldom occur but when it does to experience it is to something feel the marvel of dematerialisation depleted of human life savage in its loneliness blistered and flaked by the sun the country through which i travelled was yet beautiful to a degree of foodby means of eking out my little supply with chestnuts and wild berriesi had a poor sufficiency but thirst tortured me often and greatly i moved slowly threshing the land as it were for traces of an ignisfatuus that still fled before me in fancy and i had my frights and perilsone adventure also but that i shall not in this connection relate once high up on the ridge of a valley i saw a poor wretch his arms bound behind him hurrying forward under escort of a guard it was evening soft and tranquil a cluster of mountainpeaks swam in the long distance the horizon was barred with a grate of glowing clouds therethrough it seemed the consumed sun had fallen into white ashes of mist but the cooling furnace of the sky to the walls of which a single star clung like an unextinguished spark was yet rosy with heat and against the rose the hillside and the figures that crowned it were silhouetted in a sharp deep purple how beautiful and how voiceless the figure fell and his scream came down to me like a bats cheep as the soldiers prodded him to rise with their bayonets then i cursed the goths that had spoiled me my picture another time lying concealed in a little hanging copse above a gorge i heard bleating below me and the rainy patter of feet and peered forth to see a flock of goats being driven down the valley they were shepherded by three or four requisition men as they were calledpatriot louts whose business it was to beat up the desolated country for those herds of sheep or swine that had run wild for lack of owners their unexpected appearance was a little lesson in caution to me for i had enjoyed so long an immunity from interference as to have grown careless of showing myself in the most exposed districts on two occasions only was i troubled by wolves the first was on a morning of lassitude and fatigue when water had failed me for many hours i was resting on a heathcovered slope within a rocky cave or lair in the hillside for long the sky wraiths had been loading cloud upon cloud till the gathered steam of the earth finding no outlet seemed to scald ones body then in a moment such a storm crashed down as i had never before experienced each slam of thunder amongst the rocks was like a port of hell flung open the lightning slashing through the hail seemed to melt and run in a marrowywhite flood that palpitated as it settled down on the heather but the hail the fury of this artillery of iceits noise and the frenzy of the carmagnole it danced i was fortunate to be under a solid roof and when at last the north wind bristling with blades charged down the valley like the duke of saxonys horse at fontenoy i thought the earth must have slipped its course and swerved into everlasting winter suddenly the mouth of the ressui was blotted by a couple of shaggy forms they came pelting uptheir tails hooked like carriagebrakes to their bellies their eyes blazing fearand seeing me within jerked to a rigid halt while the stones drummed on their hides the next moment cowed out of all considerations of caste they had slunk by me and were huddled my very sinister familiars at the extreme end of the cave oh but this was the devil of an embarrassment i had sat out sermons that stabbed me below the belt at every second lunge i had had accepted offers of gallantry that i had never made i had ridiculed the work of an anonymous author to his face here however was a situation that it seemed beyond my power of finesse to acquit myself of with aplomb in point of fact the moment the storm slackened i slipped outconscious of the strange fancy that bristles were growing on my thighsand descending hurriedly to the valley climbed a tree it was only then so base is human nature that i waived the pretence that the wolf is a noble animal but my second experience was a more finished one then i tasted the full flavour of fright and almost returned the compliment of a feast to my company i was padding towards evening over a woodland lawn when from a hollow at the foot of a great chestnuttree a rumbling snarl issuing vibrated on the strings of my sensibilities and i saw three or four very ugly snouts project themselves from the blackness i went steadily by and steadily continued my way which without doubt was the discerning policy to pursue but impulse will push behind as well as fly before reason and presently that which affects the nerves of motion did so frantically hustle me at the rear as to set me off running at the top of my speed then the folly of my behaviour was made manifest to me for glancing over my shoulder as i sped i saw that no fewer than five fierce brutes were come out of their lair at the sound and were beginning to slink in my wake i gave a yell that would have fetched charon from the other side of the styx my feet seemed to dance on air i threatened to outstrip my own breath still the patter behind me swelled into a race and i found myself ghastlily petting a thought as to the length of a wolfs eyetooth and the first feel of it clamped into ones flesh now of a sudden the wood opened out and i saw before me the butt of a decayed tree and on its farther side a little reedy pond shining livid under a rampart of green that hedged off the sunset at the water i drove in a lost hope that the pursuit would check itself at its margin and in my blind onset dashed against a branch of the dead tree and fell half stunned into the pool beyond still an inspiring consciousness of my peril enabled me to scramble farther splashing and choking until i was perhaps twenty yards from the shore and then in shallow water i sat down my head just above the surface and caught at my sliding faculties and laughed immediately i was myself again and the secure and wondering spectator of a very walpurgis dance that was enacting for my benefit on the bank the five wolves appeared indeed to be skipping in pure amazement like the mountains of juda but they howled in tribulation like the gate of palestina they leapt and ran hither and thither they bit at the air at their flanks at their feet they raked their heads with their paws and rolled on the ground in knots at last i read the riddle in a tiny moted cloud that whirled above them in dashing against the rotten branch i had it seemed upset a hornets nest built in the old tooth of the tree and the garrison had sallied forth to cover my retreat oh but the braves i raised a little pan to them on the spot but i took care not to shout it suddenly the beasts turned tail and went yelling back into the wood i did not rise at once i left the victors time to congratulate themselves and to settle down and at last i was too diffident to pester them with my gratitude and i waded sheer across the pool that was nowhere more than three feet deep and landed on its farther side one day i happened upon carinne that is the high note of this droning chant of retrospection i was walking aimlessly the hot thirst upon me once more when i came out from amongst trees into a sort of forest amphitheatre of considerable extent whose base like the kick in a bottle was a round hill pretty high and scattered sparsely with chestnuttrees i climbed the slopes toilfully and getting a view of things from near the summit saw that to the north the circumference of green was broken by the gates of a hazy valley it was as beautiful a place as i had ever chanced on but its most gladdening corner to me was that whence a little brook looped out of the forest skirt like a timid child coaxed from its mothers apron and pattering a few yards fled back again to shelter now i would take it all in before i descended postponing the cool ecstasy like an epicure i mounted to the top and peering between the chestnut trunks down the farther slopes uttered an exclamation of surprise a herd of swine was peacefully feeding against the fringe of the wood and even as i looked one of them a mottled porkling crashed through a little rug of branches spread upon the ground and vanished into tartarus immediately his dismal screeches rebuked the skies and at the sound a girl came running out of the wood and kneeling above the fatal breach clasped her hands over her eyes and turned away her facea very niobe of pigs seeing her thus i descended to her assistance but lost in her grief it seemed she did not hear me until i was close upon her then suddenly she glanced up startledand her eyes were the cold eyes of carinne chapter vii the chevalier du guet the eyes of mademoiselle de lge were a merciless grey her face was goldwhite like a dying mapleleaf she wore no cap on her tumbled hair and a coarse bistrecoloured jupon was her prominent article of attire i knew her at once nevertheless though her cheeks were a little fallen and her underlids dashed with violet she stared at me as she knelt but she made no sign that she was afraid mademoiselle is in tribulation you need not speak a swineherd so fair she said but i honour pork with all my heart she rose to her feet she seemed to hesitate but she never took her eyes off me whence do you come she said in her soft deliberate voice from the woodsfrom the wastesfrom anywhere i am proscribed and in hiding i am hungry alsoand mademoiselle will give me to eat why do you call me mademoiselle do you not see i am a swineherd the little pig still screeched fitfully underground oh she cried in sudden anguish kill it monsieur if you know the way and let us dine i was pleased with that us i have no technical knowledge i said but let us see it is injured mon dieu i hope not i had so longed to taste meat once more and i had heard of pitfalls there was a hole in the ground i covered it over with branches that one of these might step thereon and tumble in and be killed but when i heard his cries i was sorry that was a bold thought for a swineherd and how would you tell your tale with one devoured or get the little pig out of the pit or skin and dismember and cook it when hauled to the surface all that i had not considered but you desired to eat pork and what would you say now to a pigs foot la st menehould the jest bubbled out of me i could not withhold it her mind was as quick as her speech was measured ah she cried but i remember and you were in fvriers monsieur at the table next to yours that is strange is it not she gave a little scornful shift to her shoulders it is all nothing in these mad days the question is monsieur if you can put the little beast out of his pain i looked into the pit two beady eyes withdrawn into a fat neck peered up at me the hole is not six feet deep mademoiselle his pain is all upon his nerves she gave a whimper of relief then her face fell cold again it follows that we must forego our dinner will monsieur release the victim of my gluttony i jumped into the holehoisted out the small squeakerreturned to the surface bon jour monsieur said carinne you will dismiss me hungry mademoiselle what claim have you upon me the claim of fraternity citoyenne she uttered a little laugh of high disdain well rob me she said and prove yourself a true republican i would steal nothing from you but your favour it is all bestowed on these animals take him you have rescued and make yourself my debtor and go mademoiselle is this to be when i have spent daysnay i know not how manyof hunger and thirst and weariness in the desperate pursuit of one to whom i had vowed to offer those services of protection she lacked elsewhere her pale eyes wondered at me do you speak of the swineherd monsieur she said i speak of mademoiselle de lge she is very secure and in good company and whence comes your knowledge of or interest in her shall i tell you the story nay she said with a sudden swerve to indifference but how does it concern me your uncle mademoiselle i have none that i own i was silent she looked away from me tapping a foot on the ground it was all a fight between her bitterness and her pride with a woman the first conquers tell me she said in a moment turning upon me do you come from him i come from him commissioned to beg me to return no mademoiselle nor would i insult you with such a message i can dispense with your interest in me sir again she averted her face decidedly she required some knowing byandby she spoke again without looking round and more gently how does m de lge bear the loss ofthe loss of his treasures he is i fear demented by it she gave a bad little laugh one who would sell his honour should at least keep his wits well monsieur i have nothing with which to reward your service of runner so a meal and a drink of water will repay me mademoiselle you can help yourself do you think i keep a larder in the forest but you eat my table is spread under the chestnuttrees and over the bushes i leave its selection to my friends yonder sometimes they will present me with a truffle for feastdays i regarded the proud child with some quaintness of pity this repelling manner was doubtless a mask over much unhappiness i have still something left in my satchel i said will mademoiselle honour me by sharing it the light jumped in her eyes i do not know she said what is its nature only some raisins and a little hard bread but bread monsieur that i have not tasted for long we will go to the brookside and sit down and the herd they will not wander when they come to a fruitful ground they stay there till it is stripped she led the way round the hill to the little gushing stream and seated herself on a green stone i would not even slake my thirst until i had spread my store on her lap then i lay down at her feet like a dog and waited for the fragments she could spare she ate with relish and took little notice of me but presently she paused in astonishment at herself i am eating up your dinner she cried it gives me more pleasure to watch than to share with you oh fie she exclaimed but am i not a true swineherd she handed me the satchel it is all yours mademoiselle eat she said peremptorily i will not touch another mouthful she leaned an elbow on her knee and her chin upon her knuckles while i devoured what remained her eyes dreamed into the thronging treetrunks i thought the real softness of her soul was beginning to quicken like a february narcissus but how i long for meat she said suddenly i laughed if mademoiselle will retain me in her service i will make shift to provide her with a dish of pork she turned and looked at me is it true you have sought me out i have no knowledge of your face it will not like mademoiselles impress itself on the imagination i have seen you by chance twice before mademoiselle and therefore it follows in the logic of gallantry that i am here she drew herself up at that word i was foolish enough to utter i perceive monsieur that you hold the licence of your tongue a recommendation to my service is this another message with the delivery of which you would not insult me nay mademoiselle i spoke the common fashion of more trivial times than these and i ask your pardon it is to save you from the possibility of insult that i have wandered and starved these many days she looked at me very gravely i foresee no danger in these solitudes i am sorry monsieur but i cannot accept your service she rose to her feet and i to mine mademoiselle i cried be wise to reconsider the question a delicate and highborn lady solitary and defenceless amongst these barbarous hills but i myself on my journey hither have encountered more than one perilous rogue she shook her head i take it as i find it besides i have always a covert into which i can slip on menace of a storm but this is madness by monsieurs account that is the present condition of our family she said frigidly see mademoisellei ask nothing but that i may remain near you to help and protect your guard and your servant in one she made as if to go you fatigue me monsieur it is not the part of a gentleman to impose his company where it is not desired you will not remain by my consent then i shall remain nevertheless i cried a little angrily i must not allow mademoiselle to constitute herself the victim to a false sentiment she left me without another word going off to her pigs and i flung myself down again in a pet by the brookside all that afternoon and evening i wandered about in the neighbourhood of the little hill i was hot and angryafter a humorous fashionwith myself rather than with carinne if i had chosen to invest my selfimposed knighterrantry with a purely fictitious order of merit i could hardly blame the girl for declining to recognise its title to respect at the same time while i assured myself i detested her i could not refrain from constantly speculating as to the nature of her present reflections was she still haughtily indignant at my insistence or inclined to secret heartsearchings in the matter of her rather cavalier rejection of my services like a child i wished her i think to be a little sorry a little unaccountably sad over the memory of the stranger who had come and gone like a sunbeam shot through the melancholy of her days i wished her to have reason to regret her unceremonious treatment of me i did not wish her to overlook my visit altogetherand this it would appear was just what she was doing for when i once somewhere about the fall of dusk climbed softly to the top of the hillock to get view of her perchance from ambush i was positively incensed to hear her voice coming up to me in a little placid song or chant that was in itself an earnest of her indifference and serenity she sat against a tree at the foot of the slope and all about her uncouthly dumped on the fallen mast were a score of drowsy pigs she sang to them like circe while they twitched lazy ears or snapped their little springs of tails and the sunset poured from the furnacemouth of the valley and made her pale face glorious now she did her beauty more justice by voice than by brush though in each art she was supremely artless but there was a note of nature in the first that was like the winter song of a robin and presently she trilled a little childish chansonnette of the peasants that touched me because i had some memory of it the little bonne marie moi mon poupon spoke to her doll so wee moi mon poupon hush little son sweet thing but wouldst thou be a king moi mon poupon thy sceptre grows in the mere moi mon poupon thy crown in the blossoming brere moi mon poupon for orb a grape shall stand clutched in thy tiny hand moi mon poupon a rose she pinned at his side moi mon poupon and one to each foot she tied moi mon poupon his cot she lined with rue and she named him her jsus moi mon poupon i lay amongst the branches that night with the memory of the low sweet voice and the strange picture in my brain and as i tossed literally on my timber couch a weirder fancy would come to me of the elfish swineherd sleeping within her charmed circle of hogsfearless and securemingling her soft expression of rest with their truculent breathings i was up or rather down early washed in the brook breakfasted fastidiously off beechnuts then quite undecided as to my course of action i loitered awhile amongst the trees and finally came round by the hill once more and dwelt upon a thought to climb it and investigate but as i stood in uncertainty a shrill cry came to my ears it rang startlingly in that voiceless pit of green and i hurried at my topmost speed round the base of the mound and came suddenly upon a sight that met me like a blow two savages each with an arm of the girl brutally seized were shouldering the poor swineherd towards the trees she cried and struggled disputing every step the pigs streamed curiously in the wake of the group there was an obvious ugly inference to be drawn from the sight and i made no compromise with my discretion i just rushed through the herd and charged straight at one of the ruffians he was aware of methey both werebefore i reached him they twisted their heads about and the one i made for dropped his hold of carinne and jumped to meet my onset while the other hooted ohe bran de lui and tightened his grip of the girl i saw only that my assailant was a powerful coarse bonnetrouge littleeyed hairy as attila the next instant i had dived caught one of his ankles and given his furious impetus an upward direction he went over me in a parabola like a ball sprung from a trap and i heard his ribs thud on the ground but i had no time to give him my further attention for seeing his comrades discomfiture the second rascal came at me and now i was like to pay dearly for my temerity for though i was lithe and active enough i had not that of substance on my bones to withstand the pounding of a couple of enraged and sanguinary giants the poor carinne had sunk for the moment unnerved upon the ground i prayed god she had a knife to use on herself for a last resource no doubt the ruffian i had thrown would take me in the rear in a moment the other was bearing down upon me like a bullock suddenly when come almost within my reach he jerked himself to so quick a halt that his heels cut grooves in the mast i saw his eyes dilate and glare beyond me and on the instant a single vibrant scream like the shrill neigh of a horse rose from the ground at my back it was the cue for an immediate quarrelling clamour fierce and gluttonous such as one hears when a bucket of wash is emptied into a sty and if it was lifted again bodiless and inhuman it might not reach through the uproar i had turned to lookand away again in infinite horror upon the halfstunned wretch as he lay prostrate on his back an old ravening boar of the herd had flung itself in fury and with one bestial clinch of its teeth and jerk of its powerful neck had torn out the very apple of the mans throat and there atop of his victim the huge brute sprawled tossing its head and squeaking furiously while the rest of the herd smitten with the beastlust ran hither and thither approaching snuffing retreating and through all never ceasing in their guttural outcry now in a moment came a pause in the tumult and i read in my opponents eyes as distinctly as though they were mirrors that the triumphant brute behind me was showing itself alert with consciousness of the living prey that yet offered itself in reversion i saw in the mans face amazement resolve itself into sick terror he slipped back into its sheath the couteaupoignard he had half drawn adieuva i shouted at him advancingand on the word he wheeled about and pounded off amongst the trees as if the devil were at his heels when i ran to mademoiselle de lge she was regaining in a dazed manner her feet and her faculties i must lift youi must help you i cried ah do not look but come away my god what peril when the beast in man is made manifest to the beast in the beast i put my right arm about her under hers to touch the very stringy texture of the jupon with my hand was to find my heart queerly lodged in my fingertips she came quietly with me a few paces then suddenly she wrenched herself free and turning her back upon me fumbled in her bosom monsieur she said on a little faint key from the covert of her hair bon dieu that admirable low huskiness in her voice that made of her every utterance a caressmonsieur he was the old brave of my little troop i called him my chevalier du guet it was inhumanyes it was inhuman but he struck for his lady and rescued her wilt thou not be my ambassador to decorate him for a last token of gratitude heaven the magnificence of her fancy she had taken from her shoulders her scapular together with a little heart of chalcedonyx that hung therefrom this latter she detached and handed to me loop it to his ear if thou darest said she i went quite gravely to do her bidding what a farceur of circumstance was i become but my breast overflowed with deference as i approached the great pig he had rolled from his victim and stood a little apart evilly humouring with his chaps a certain recollection he eyed me with wickedness as i advanced and his obsequious following something subsided from their hysteria seemed awaiting their cue i would not allow myself a seconds indecision i walked straight up to himmonsieur i said avec lgard le plus profondand flung the string over his ear alas the ingrate as i retreated he threw down his head dislodged the trinket smelt at and swallowed it the eyes in carinnes yet shocked face looked a pale inquiry when i returned to her mademoiselle i said the honour would appear entirely to his taste she nodded seriously it is well she whispered and i hope none will rob him he shall be turned inside out first i said stoutly and at that she nodded again and bade me to a hurried retreat we may have walked a mile or even two in a solemn silence before my comrade was fain to stop in the heart of a woodland glen and throw herself exhausted on a bank then she looked up at me her fatigued eyes struggling yet with defiance why do you not upbraid me she said why do you not say i told you so because it does not occur to me ah you would make a fine virtue of forbearance you would be the patient ass to my vanity would you not monsieur i would let mademoiselle ride me roughshod till i fell dead and so leave me the living monument to your nobility but it is not generous monsieur thus to rebuke me with silence i did not intend to and after all it was the hog that struck most effectively and that is conceded mademoiselle and the hog is generously decorated she mused up at me rebelliously i do not even know your name it is citizen thibaut citizen she made a wry mouth of it then if i can find the wherewithal to reward your gallantry citizen will you leave me to myself mademoiselle if only i could believe none other would impose himself on that sweet duet she shrugged her shoulders fretfully monsieur monsieur you assume a fathers privilege has my misfortune placed me beyond the pale of courtesy or has a swineherd no title to the considerations of decency nay mademoiselle it is that your beauty and your proud innocence make so many appeals to both my obstinacy seemed a goad to her anger you exaggerate the importance of your service she cried either of those great strong men could have crushed you like an old nut she seemed to struggle a moment with herselfwithout avail for you are very little she added i felt myself turn pale i made her a most profound bow i will leave mademoiselle i said gravely to the only company she can do justice to my own she asked i did not answer and i turned from her quivering all through i had gone but a few paces when her voice came after me monsieur i am dying of hunger mon dieu what a speech to grapple at the soul i hurried hither and thither plucking her a meal from the earth from the bushes my heart bled with a double wound presently i stood before her stern and silent her face hidden in her hands was averted from me suddenly she looked up the little pod holds the fattest pea she said and burst into tears petite pluie abat grand vent she was very sweet and humble to me byandby she made me the amende honorable by calling my heart too great for my body and at last said she i take you for my knight monsieurto honour and protect to bear with and respect me and i kissed her brown hand in allegiance chapter viii quatremainsquatrepattes mademoiselle what do you weave she sat at the entrance to her sleepingplacea hole under the radiated roots of an ancient oaktree we had happened upon the shelter in our leaguelong flight it was one of those burrowsthose logettes into which past generations of the hunted and proscribed had sunk like moles many of our forests are honeycombed with them over the opening to this once concealed by a cunning mat of weeds and branches the roots had contrived a more enduring cover within to walls and floor yet clung the remnants of brushwood with which long ago the den had been lined carinne was deftly busy over a queer contrivancea sort of fencing mask that she plaited from thin tendrils of a bindingweed monsieur on his high perch at night will suffer from the mosquitoes has mademoiselle reason to think so as i think i can tell when a little ape carries a nut in his pouch alas but how cynical of romance are the tiny bloodsuckers they fly on a chromatic scale mademoiselle often i try to comfort myself with the fancy that i am listening to the very distant humming of church bells and then comes a tiny prick and something seems to rise from my heart to my face and to blossom thereon no doubt it is the flowers of fancy budding and is the weedbonnet for me i shall not want it in my burrow this gave me exquisite gratification which survived the many inconveniences to which i was put by the bonnet falling off at night and my having to descend to recover it but it soon appeared that the least whim of this fascinating child was to be my law and yet what a dear lawless existence i do not know what termination to it we foresaw sooner or later the cold must drive me from my nightly cradle sooner or later the good fruits of the earth must wither in the meantime we were grillon and cigalewe stored not neither did we labour but we chatted and we wandered and we drew the marrow of every tender berry and gnawed the rind of every tough without making faces and we quarrelledmon dieu but how we quarrelled scarce a day passed without dispute and this in the end it was that resolved the situation for us for truly my comrade was as full of moods and whimsies as the windone moment a curious sweet woman the next and on the prick of confidence a pillar of salt yet even as such she herself was ever the savour to the insults she made me swallow by then i was a little awakening i think to a consciousness that was half fright half ecstasy let me not misrepresent my meaning i held the honour of mademoiselle de lge in high reverence yet and therefore also bien entendu i could not but acknowledge to myself that in the depth of my heart was sprouting a desire for a more particular understanding between us this very selfconfession at last was like a terrifying surrender of independenceof irresponsibilityof all that sweet store of philosophy i had made it my practice to hive against the winter of old age i saw my tranquillity yielded to a disturbing sense of duty i felt my feet and my body stung by a thousand thorns as i turned into the narrow road of selfabnegation no more for me should gleam the rosy garland and the winecup exhaling joy but rather the olive from the branch should stimulate my palate to caudle and the priest sanctify my salt of life out of all flavour ae ae and what then why i was forgetting that as a lady puts the deduction before the argument and cultivates her intuitive perceptions by reading the dnoment of a romance after the first chapter so she will have decided upon the direction of that last gift of herself while pinning her favours upon the coats of a dozen successive hopefuls i might humour or tease my fancy over the presumptive flavour of that draught of matrimony while all the time mademoiselle de lge of pierrettes held my person and my citizenship in frank contempt decidedly i was eating my chicken in the egg still the very fearless susceptibility of the child her beauty and her wilfulness were so many flames to feed that fire of passion that the strange nature of our comradeship had first kindled in my breast and so always before my minds eye i kept or tried to keep the picture of the chevalier bayard and the spanish ladies of brescia one day in our wanderings we came out suddenly upon a track of highroad that sweeping from us round a foreshore of desolate hills seemed like a coastcurrent to set some gaunt pines at a little distance swaying as if they were the masts of ships by then as i gather we must have travelled as far north as chalus and were come into regions that by reason of their elevation were somewhat colder and moister than the sunny slopes we had quitted perhaps it was this change of atmosphere that chilled our odd but never too ardent relations one with the other perhaps it was that carinne as i was at length taking alarm over the ambiguity of our position in any case we fell out and apart and so followed some harsh experiences to the pair of us now we backed from the public way in fright and concealing ourselves once more amongst the trees sat down and were for a long space silent the interval was a pregnant one to me inasmuch as i was labouring with a resolve that had been forming for days in my breast and at last i spoke carinne we have been much at crosspurposes of late have we m thibaut but perhaps it is in the order of things and that is to say that the plebeian thibaut and the patrician de lge cannot meet on a common plane you must not put words in my mouth ah if i might what then it will soothe my ennui to hear not for the moment tell me mademoiselle would you renew this comradeship were we to escape and meet in the aftertime under better conditions of security oh monsieur and would you have me wander hand in hand with you through the gardens of the thuilleries or invite you to sleep upon the tester of my bed or open my mouth like a young bird at the fruitstalls that you might pop in raspberries unkind i would have you meet me by chance i would see your eyes open to a light of pleasure i would have you come gladly to me and take my fingers in yours and say this is he that was my good friend when i needed one i will remember and then all will clap their hands and cry bravo will they not and i shall feel a little excitement quy atil jacko i shall say show the company some of the pretty tricks you played in the woods i was silent and are those the words you would put in my mouth monsieur said carinne i referred to the present i answered coldly and as you take it so i will speak in your person as i would have you speak jeanlouis you say i am like all sweet women an agglomerate of truths and inconsistencies yet i am not in the midst of my wilfulness insensible to the suffering my caprice of misunderstanding puts you to and in face of the equivocal character of our intercourse i will forego the blindness that is a privilege of my sex speak boldly then what lies in your heart as i spoke in some trepidation carinnes face grew enigmatical with hardness and a little pallor and she looked steadily away from me i thank you she said softly for that word equivocal but please to remember monsieur that this intercourse is none of my seeking you choose to misapprehend me oh it is not possible she cried turning sharply upon me you take advantage of my condescension and of the wicked licence of the times have you sought by this elaborate process to entrap me into a confession of dependence upon you why she measured me scornfully with her eyes i think i look over and beyond you monsieur now i said stung beyond endurance by her words i pronounce you mademoiselle the most soulless as you are the most beautiful woman i have ever encountered i thought i loved you with that reverence that would subscribe to the very conditions that laban imposed upon jacob i see i was mistaken and that i would have bartered my gold for a baser metal and now also i see mademoiselle that the callousness you displayed in presence of the murdered lepelletier which i had fain fancied was a paralysis of nerve was due in effect to nothing less vulgar than an unfeeling heart she stared at me in amazement it seemed i was for the moment carried quite beyond myself i will leave you i cried to your better reflectionsor at least to your better judgment this thibaut will walk off the high fever of his presumption and return presently your faithful and obedient servant i turned fuming upon my heel and strode off amongst the trees i had not gone a dozen paces when her voice stayed me i twisted myself about do not lift your head so high monsieur she said or you will run it against a mushroom and hurt yourself insolentcruelfascinating for what had i indulged this mood of quixotryfor what permitted this intolerable child to gall my sides with her disdain would it have been thus had i condescended to drive her coquetry to bay with that toothless dog of my rank ah i believe so and that only made the sting of her contempt the more poisonous it was my person that could not suffice and truly there is no bribe to a womans favour like an extra inch of weediness she is the escapement of the heart but the reason she will never move till she acquire a sense of proportion she was designed but to put man out of conceit with himself and i think she was not formed of his rib but of his spleen therefore the taproot of her nature is grievance from which her every leaf and flower and knot and canker takes its sustenance of misconstruction she may bloom very fair and sweet but then so does the dulcamara and to taste either is dangerous thinking these thoughts i postponed my return to the little glade where i had left carinne she should believe me gone for good and all i vowed and so should she suffer the first pangs of desertion then though she wished to make me feel small no giant should figure so great in her eyes as the moderate thibaut at last in the early glow of evening the unquenchable yearning in my heart would brook no longer delay halfshamefaced halfstubborn i retraced my steps to the glen that held my all of aggravation and of desire she was not there she never came to it more for long i would not realise the truth i waited and hoped and often circumambulated the spot where she had rested hurrying over a greater or less circumference according to my distance from the centre i calledi entreatedperhaps in the darkness of night i wept it was all of no avail she had vanished without leaving a trace wilfully and resentfully and had thus decided to reward my long service of devotion whenafter lingering about the spot for two nights and two days drugging a dying hope with the philtre of its own brewingi at length knew myself convicted of despair a great bitterness awoke in my breast that i should have thus permitted myself to be used and fooled and rejected she is not worthy of this vast of concern i cried i will forget her and resume myself and be again the irresponsible maggot contributing to the decay of a wormeaten system to taste disenchantment after all that is not to drink the sea but it was to eat of its fruit of ashes and i was to carry a burden with me that i might not forego this in my subsequent wanderings made my steps drag heavily as if always i bore in the breast of my coat the leaden image of an angel but nevertheless i could muster a pride to my aid in moments of a very desperate lassitude of the soul with the opening of october i was still a solitary rogue ostracised from my herded kind i had wandered so far north as that i saw paris the ultimate goal i felt of my weary feet to swim distinguishable in the misty ken of my mind therefrom always seemed to emanate a deadly but dulcet atmosphere the attraction of which must sooner or later overpower me sometimes in the night i could have thought i heard the citys swarming voices jangling to me down the steeper roads of wind sometimes the keystone of the conciergerie would figure to me as the lodestone to all shattered barques tossing helplessly on a shoreless waste for i was sick to the heart of loneliness sick of the brute evasion of my race sick of my perilous immunity from all the burning processes of that frantic drama of my times and so i trudged ever with my face set to the north and the hum of the witches cauldron whose broth was compound of all heroism and all savagery singing phantomly in my ears and to this direction yet another consideration induced me with the approach of chillier weather the wild woodlife of the wilder provinces asserted itself and assumed a more menacing aspect the abolition of the game laws had brought about indeed an amazing increase in the number of wolves and foxes and what with these on one side and sansculottism on the other i had often latterly felt myself walking between the devil and the deep sea then once upon a time i was joined by an odd roguish wayfellow the obliquity of whose moral vision i overlooked for the sake of his company and through him was my burden of selfdependence a little lightened i had sunk asleep one afternoon in a copse neighbouring on the royal village of clry autumn is all a siesta in that mild and beautiful district waking i felt the sunlight on my eyes like a damp warm sponge and so with my lids gratefully closed i fell amusing to think i murmured that the twang of a beetles bowstring at my ear on the old bridge outside coutras should have been the keynote to all this devils dance of mine i thought i heard a faint rustle somewhere at handa squirrel or coney i paid no attention to it but indulged my mood of introspection byandby a step came towards me advancing boldly amongst the trees from a distance it approached reached stopped over against me i opened my eyes as i lay my arms under my head and placidly surveyed the newcomer he stood looking down upon me his fingers heaped upon the black crutch of his bton and when he saw me awake he nodded his head in a lively manner the occasion is opportune he said in a quick biting voice his lower jaw projected showing a straight row of little even teethlike palings to keep his speech within bounds the brightness of his halfseen eyes belied the indolence of their lids he wore a jacket of sheepskin wool outwards and a leathern bag stuffed with printed broadsides hung from his shoulder by a length of scarlet tape on his head was a threecornered hat fantastically caught up with ribbons and his legs and feet were encased respectively in fine black hose and the neat pumps with buckles known as pantoufles de palais comment said i without moving the citizen has slept most tranquilly the citizen has dreamt without doubt and he is awake he made a comprehensive gesture with his stick and his hands but i interpret dreams said heand at one price i will unravel you the visions of a politician or expound himself to jack hodge for the common charge of fifty centimes he bent his head towards me with an affectation of scrutiny i perceive the citizen does not credit me he said and so his eyes rebuke his scepticism interpreter of dreams said i for thou hast rightly construed their meaning ah he murmured raising himself and drawing in his breath but i find it simple to convince the most incredulous you do yes he cried clapping his chest for know that thou speakst with quatremainsquatrepattes himself he dwelt on the pause that followed collapsed from it regarded me it seemed in astonishment thou hast not heard of me again the interpreter of dreams justifies himself he looked away from me in a high manner of abstraction and this is for the sunshine of fame to throw ones shadow over half the world said he maybe thy fame is at its meridian citizen and thy shadow consequently a little fat blot at thy feet he turned to me again oh yes he cried sarcastically i am quatremainsquatrepattes and some outside the beaten track know my name perhaps but possibly the citizen has never heard even of jean cazotte on the contrary i have seen and spoken with him par exemple the man was a charlatan he could foretell everything but his own guillotining last year and yet thou art ignorantwell well he threw up his hands in deprecation then came and sat down on the grass beside me cela mest gal m quatremainsquatrepattes said i ah he said but i will convince thee at once describe to me thy dream i dreamt i wrestled with an angel and was overthrown thy mistress has quarrelled with and rejected thee an obvious deduction yet i will assure you she is no angel canst thou say so but we are all of the seed of lucifer proceed i dreamt how a great march grew out of a single accident of sound here i was watchful of him and i saw some relish twitch his lips he assumed an air of tense introspection groping with his soul like a fakir amongst the reflex images thrown upon the backs of his eyeballs i hear a note he said presently as if speaking to himselfone vibrant accent like the clipt song of a bullet is it struck from an instrument or from any resounding vessel it comes down the windit clangsit passes nayit signifies only that some winged insect has fled by the ear of a solitary traveller resting on an ancient bridge yet from that little buglesound shall the traveller learn to date the processes of a long and fruitless journey i broke into a great laugh most excellent i cried thou hast an ingenuity of adaptation that should make thy fortuneeven at the very low rate of fifty centimes the job his eyebrows lifted at me why m quatremainsquatrepattesm jacquemart said ii knew thee listening to me just now and i heard thee steal away and come again it is easy to construe with the key in ones hand he was no whit abashed cela mest gal he said serenely echoing my words but i can foretell ones future nevertheless very exactly why so can i if i am not to be called upon to verify my statements he looked suddenly in my face thou art a disguised aristocrat better and better but are we not all such to ourselves the soul is excessively exclusive you will not consider i have earned my fee said he fifty times over my friend will you take it in a promissory note ah he cried pleasantly i perceive i have sown in barren soil again you justify yourself yet should i be a very thicket were all the berries i have swallowed of late to germinate in me is that so said he but i have been a scapegoat myself and thereat this extraordinary person pressed upon me some food he had with him with an ample and courtly grace this shall yield a better crop than my prophesying he said watching me as i munched of a surety i answered the full harvest of my gratitude he pondered at me i wish i could convince thee he said wherefore is not the evil sufficient for the day in this distracted land why should one want to probe the future because forewarned is forearmed oh little quatremainsquatrepattes dost thou not perceive the paradox how can destiny be altered by foreknowledge if you interpret that i am to be guillotined and i profit by the statement to evade such a catastrophe how is not your prophecy stultified why i have no creed of predestination the lords of life and death are not inexorable sometimes like m st meard one may buy his reprieve of them with a jest above all they hate the sour fatalist whose subscription to his own faith is a gloomy affectation well i think i love thee a little he looked at me with a smile come with me then i long to give thee proof dost thou need a safeguard thou shalt run under my winga et lto paris if thou wilt i am popular with all if necessity drives thou shalt figure as my jackpudding what thou mayst even play up to the part thou hast slept in the mire but many a ragged colt makes a good horse i laughed why not i said for i have played the tragic to empty houses till i am tired quatremainsquatrepattes and his merryandrew gambolled through a score of villages on their road to paris i found the rascal hugely popular as he had boasted he was and a most excellent convoy to my humble craft so perilously sailing under false colours he was subtle shrewd seasonableof the species whose opportunity is accident and perhaps no greater tribute could be paid to his deftness than thisthat he never once exposed himself to detection by me in a question of moral fraud ton gnie a la main crochue i would say to him chuckling but he would only respond with a rebuking silence early he handed over the bag of broadsidesthe revolutionary songs and ballads some it must be confessed abominably coarseto my care that so he himself might assume a lofty indifference to the meaner processes of his business this delighted me it was like a new rattling game to me to hawk my commodities amongst the crowd to jest and laugh with my fellows once more under cover of the droll i represented shortly i think i became as popular as quatremains himself and over this though he loved me as a valuable auxiliary he began to look a little sober byandby as if he dreaded i should joke the weightier part of his commerce out of all respect his popularity was chiefly with the village wenches they would gather about him at the fountains and pay their sous openeyed to be expounded or singly they would withdraw him into nooks or private places if the case was serious citizen ser says margot i dreamed i fell and was wounded that is good little minette thou wilt pay me five sous for a fond lover citizen ser i dreamed i was eating of a great egg and thou shalt shortly beget a male child that shall bring thee honour how now old jackalent there rises a shrill cackle of laughter fi donc margot on te le rendra de bonne heure to submit the commerce of love to the test of a little dreammanual he carried about with him that was quatremains system this key it was in manuscript interpreted on a couple of hundred or more words from abel to wounds but affairs of the heart predominated through the whole alphabet of nonsense he would coach himself continually from it in secret but indeed a small wit and a trifle of invention were all that was needed now and again i would rally him on this petty taxing of credulity how now he would answer art thou not yet convinced by what thou most surprising quatremainsquatrepattes for example did i not foretell that mre grignon whose husband was guillotined would be brought to bed of a child with the mark of the lunette on its throat and were not my words verified the same night but who knows that some one may not have bribed the nurse to score the neck of the newborn with whipcord ttebleu should i hold good my reputation and pay this nurse thinkst thou out of five sous but

the planets for you like an orange or like the fruit of his imagination there is a late picture of him often before me as he sat in the marketplace of essonnes a little village that lies almost within view of the towers of paris a halfdozen blooming daughters of the revolution stood about him their hands under their aprons for warmthfor it was pretty late in november and in fact the eve of st catherines feast now said quatremains there are seven of ye and that is the sure numberfor there must not be more than seven nor fewer than three and be certain ye are quick to my directions he jingled softly in his fists the copper harvest of his gathering are all of ye virgins he cried if the charm fails she who is not will be accountable to the others he scanned their hot faces like a very torquemada of the true faith tomorrow then he said let each wear inside her bosom all day a sprig of myrtle at night assemble together privately in a room and as the clock strikes eleven take ye each your twig and fold it in tissuepaper having first kindled charcoal in a chafingdish thereonto throw nine hairs from the head and a little moonparing of every toe and fingernail as also some

and so ye have not failed to keep silence from first to last each shall assuredly be made conversant in dream with her future husband oh wonderful nature of woman thus in a starving france to throw sous into a pool for the sport of vanity quatremains smuggled me into paris and there for we had no further use of one another our connection ceased thenceforwards i must live on my witsother than those he had taxedand on the little pieces of money that remained to me for feastdays the struggle was a short one i had not been a fortnight in the city when the blow that i had so long foreseen fell upon me one day i was arrested and carried to la force that perhaps was as well for my personal estate was dwindled to a few livres and i knew no ragpicker that would be likely to extend to me his patronage and protection yet before this came about i had one other strange little experience that shall be related chapter ix the wild dogs it was on a night of middle vendmiaire in the year two to affect the whimsical jargon of the sansculottes that i issued from my burrow with an intrepidity that was nothing more nor less than a congestion of the sensibilities fear at that time having fed upon itself till all was devoured was converted in very many to a humorous stoicism that only lacked to be great because it could not boast a splendid isolation suspect of being suspectcitizen chaumettes last slash at the hamstrings of hopehad converted all men of humane character to that religion of selfcontainment that can alone spiritually exalt above the caprices of the emotions thousands in a moment through extreme of fear became fearless hence no man of them could claim a signal inspiration of courage but only that subscription to the terms of it which unnatural conditions had rendered necessary to all believers in the ultimate ethical triumph of the human race i do not mean to say that i was tired of life but simply that it came to me at once that i must not hold that test of moral independence at the mercy of any temporal tyranny whatsoever indeed i was still so far in love with existence physically as to neglect no precaution that was calculated to contribute to the present prolonging of it i wore my frieze nightcap carmagnole sabots and black shag spencer with all the assumption i could muster of being to the shoddy born i had long learned the art of slurring a sigh into a cough or expectoration i could curse the stolid spectres of the tumbrils so as to deceive all but the recording angel and possibly citizen robespierre nevertheless with me as with others precaution seemed but a condition of the recklessness whose calculations never extended beyond the immediate day or hour we lived posthumous lives so to speak and would hardly have resented it should an arbitrary period have been put to our revisiting of the glimpses of the moon on this night then of early september as i will prefer calling it i issued from my burrow calm under the intolerable tyranny of circumstance desiring to reconstruct myself on the principle of an older independence i was mentally discussing the illogic of a system of purgation that was seeking to solve the problem of existence by emptying the world when i became aware that my preoccupied ramblings had brought me into the very presence of that sombre engine that was the concrete expression of so much and such detestable false reasoning in effect and to speak without circumbendibus i found myself to have wandered into the faubourg st antoineinto the place of execution and to have checked my steps only at the very foot of the guillotine it was close upon midnight and overhead very wild and broken weather but the deeps of atmosphere with the city for their ocean bed as it were lay profoundly undisturbed by the surface turmoil above and in the tranquil place for all the upper flurry one could hear oneself breathe and think i could have done this with the more composure had not another sound the import of which i was a little late in recognising crept into my hearing with a full accompaniment of dismay this sound was like licking or lapping very bestial and unclean and when i came to interpret it it woke in me a horrible nausea for all at once i knew that hidden in that dreadful conduit that strong citizens of late had dug from the place st antoine to the river to carry away the ponded blood of the executed the wild dogs of paris were slaking their wolfish thirst i could hear their filthy gutturising and the scrape of their lazy tongues on the soil and my heart went cold for latterly and since they had taken to hunting in packs these ravenous brutes had assailed and devoured more than one belated citizen whom they had scented traversing the champs elyses or other lonely space and i was aware a plan for their extermination was even now under discussion by the committee of public safety now to fling scorn to the axe in that city of terror was to boast only that one had adjusted oneself to a necessity that did not imply an affectation of indifference to the fangs of wild beastsfor such indeed they were so a suicide who goes to cast himself headlong into the river may run in a panic from a falling beam and be consistent too for his compact is with deathnot mutilation be that as it may i know that for the moment terror so snapped at my heel that under the very teeth of it i leaped up the scaffold stepswith the wild idea of swarming to the beam above the knife and thence defying my pursuers should they nose and bay me seated there at refugeand stood with a white desperate face scarcely daring to pant out the constriction of my lungs there followed no sound of concentrated movement but only that stealthy licking went on with the occasional plash of brute feet in a bloody mire and gradually my turbulent pulses slowed and i thought myself a fool for my pains in advertising my presence on a platform of such deadly prominence still not a soul seemed to be abroad as i trod the fateful quarter ten minutes earlier the last squalid roysterers had staggered from the wineshopsthe last gleams of light been shut upon the emptied streets i was alone with the dogs and the guillotine tiptoeing very gently very softly i was preparing to descend the steps once more when i drew back with a muttered exclamation and stood staring down upon an apparition that speeding at that moment into the place paused within ten paces of the scaffold on which i stood above the scudding clouds was a moon that pulsed a weak intermittent radiance through the worn places of the drift its light was always more suggested than revealed but it was sufficient to denote that the apparition was that of a very pale young womana simple child she looked whose eyes nevertheless wore that common expression of the dramatic intensity of her times she stood an instant tense as corday her fingers bent to her lips her background a frouzy wall with the legend proprit nationale scrawled on it in white chalk significant to the inference the cap of scarlet wool was drawn down upon her young blondes curlsthe gold of the coveted perukes suddenly she made a little movement and in the same instant gave out a whistle clear and soft yes it was she from whom it proceeded and i shuddered there below me in the ditch were the dogs here before me was this fearless child for myself even in the presence of this angel i dared scarcely stir it was unnatural it was preposterouscame a scramble and a rush and there issued from the filthy sewer was a huge boarhound that fawned on the little citoyenne and yelped under her breath like a thing of human understanding she cried softly down radegonde and patted the monsters head with a pretty manner of endearment ah she murmured hast thou broken thy faith with thy hunger traitorbut i will ask no questions here are thy comfits my sweet remember thy pedigree and thy mistress she thrust a handful of sugarplums into the great jaws i could hear the hound crunching them in her teeth what was i to dowhat warning to give this childthis frail windflower of the nightthe guillotine would have devoured her at a snap and laughed over the titbit but i and the nameless gluttons of the ditch they were therepart at least of one of those packs recruited by gradual degrees from the desolated homes of the proscribedof migrs that now were swollen to such formidable proportions as to have become a menace and a nightly terror the dogs were there and should they scent this tender quarry what power was in a single faithful hound to defend her against a half hundred perhaps of her fellows sweating with apprehension i stole down the steps she was even then preparing to retreat hurriedly as she had come her lips were pressed to the beasts wrinkled head the sound of her footstep might have precipitated the catastrophe i dreaded citoyenne citoyenne i whispered in an anguished voice she looked up scared and white in a moment the dog gave a rolling growl radegonde she murmured in a faint warning tone the brute stood alert her hair bristling bid her away i entreated you are in danger she neither answered nor moved see i am in earnest i cried loud as i durst the wild dogs are below there radegonde she murmured again ah mademoiselle what are two rows of teeth against a hundred send her away i implore you and accept my escort out of this danger my faith she said at last in a queer little moving voice it may be as the citizen says but i think dogs are safer than men i urged my prayer the beauty and courage of the child filled my heart with a sort of rapturous despair god witness i am speaking for your safety alone will this prevail with you i am the comte de la muette i exchange you that confidence for a little that you may place in me i lay my life in your hands and i beg the charge of yours in return i could hear her breathing deep where she stood suddenly she bent and spoke to her companion to the secret place radegondeand tomorrow again for thy confiture thou bad glutton kiss thy nanette my baby and oh radegonde not what falls from the table of sainte guillotine she stood erect and held up a solemn finger the hound slunk away like a human thing ashamed showed her teeth at me as she passed and disappeared in the shadows of the scaffold i took a hurried step forward near at hand the pure loveliness of this citoyenne was against its surroundings like a flower floating on blood she smiled and looked me earnestly in the face we were but phantoms to one another in that moony twilight but in those fearful times men had learned to adapt their eyesight to the second plague of darkness is it true she said softly monsieur le comte it must be long since you have received a curtsey she dropped me one there bending to her own prettiness like a rose and then she gave a little low laugh truly that city of paris saw some strange meetings in the year of terror i too she said was born of the noblesse that is a secret monsieur to set against yours i could but answer with some concern mademoiselle these confessions if meet for the holy saint yonder are little for the ears of the devils advocates i entreat let us be walking or those in the ditch may anticipate upon us his benediction ma foi she said it is true come then we went off together stealing from the square like thieves presently when i could breathe with a half relief you will not go tomorrow i said to feed radegonde ah monsieur i would not for the whole world lose the little sweettooth her goodies each of us has only the other to love in all this cruel city so my child and they have taken the rest monsieur my father was the rest he went on the seventeenth fructidor and since my veins do not run blood i think but only icewater that melts from my heart and returns to freeze again i sighed nay she said for i can laugh as you see and the dog my poor child she ran under the tumbril and bit at the heels of the horses she would not leave him monsieur and stilland still she haunts the place i go to herwhen all the city is silent i go to her if i can escape and take her the sweetmeats that she loves what of that it is only a little while and my turn must come and then radegonde will be alone my hair monsieur will observe is the right colour for the perukes she stayed me with a touch i am arrived a thousand thanks for your escort monsieur le comte we were by a low casement with a ledge before itan easy climb from the street she pushed the lattice open showing me it was unbolted from within she thinks me fast and asleep she said some day soon perhaps but not yet i did not ask her who she was i seemed all mazed in a silent dream of pity it is quite simple she said when no cavalier is by to look will the citizen turn his head she was up in an instant and stepping softly into the room beyond leaned out towards me on the moment an evil thing grew out of the shadow of a buttress close by and a wicked insolent face looked into mine with a grin a sweet goodnight to monsieur le comte it said and vanished shocked and astounded i stood rooted to the spot but there came a sudden low voice in my ear quick quick have you no knife you must follow i had taken but a single uncertain step when from a little way down the street we had traversed there cut into the night a sharp attenuated howl and in a moment on the passing of it a chorus of hideous notes swept upon me standing there in indecision my god i criedthe dogs she made a sound like a plover i scrambled to the ledge and dropped into the room beyond there in the dark she clutched and clung to me for though the cry had been bestial there had seemed to answer to it something mortalan echoa human scream of very dreadful fearthere came a rush of feet like a wind and with ashy faces we looked forth they had himthat evil thing an instant we saw his sick white face thrown up like a stone in the midst of a writhing sea and the jangle was hellish then i closed the lattice and pressed her face to my breast he had run from us to his doom which meeting he had fled back in his terror to make us the ghastly sport he had designed should be his how long we stood thus i know not the noise outside was unnameable and i closed her ears with her hair with my handsnay i say it with a passionate shame with my lips she sobbed a little and moaned but she clung to me and i could feel the beating of her heart we had heard windows thrown open down the streetone or two on the floors above us i had no heed or care for any danger i was wrapt in a fearful ecstasy byandby she lifted her face then the noise had ceased for some time and a profound silence reigned about us ah she said in a faint reeling voice radegonde was there i saw her mademoisellethe noble creatureshe hath won us a respite her breath caught in the darkness yes she said there is a peruke that must wait suddenly she backed from me and put the hair from her eyes if you dare monsieur it necessitates that we make our adieux au revoir citoyenne it must be that indeed she held out her hand that was like a rose petal i put my lips to it and lingered monsieur monsieur she entreated the next moment i was in the street who was my little citoyenne ah i shall never know the terror gripped us and these things passed incidents that would make the passion of sober times the spirit of revolution dismisses with a shrug to die in those days was such a vulgar complaint but i saw her once more and then when my heart nestled to her image and my veins throbbed to her remembered touch i was strolling on the morning following my strange experience in the neighbourhood of the champs elyses when i was aware of a great press of people all making in the direction of that open ground what arrives then citizen i cried to one who paused for breath near me he gasped the little morose to ask any question that showed one ignorant of the latest caprice of the executive was almost to be suspect has not the citizen heard the committee of safety has decreed the destruction of the dogs the dogs sacred blood he cried is it not time when they take as it is said they did last night a good friend of the republic to supper he ran on and i followed all about the champs elyses was a tumultuous crowd and posted within were two battalions of the national guard their blue uniforms resplendent their flintlocks shining in their hands they the soldiers surrounded the area save towards the rue royale where a gap occurred and on this gap all eyes were fixed scarcely was i come on the scene when on every side a laughing hubbub arose the dogs were being driven in at first by twos and threes but presently in great numbers at a time for hours i was told had half the gamins of paris been beating the coverts and hallooing their quarry to the toils at length when many hundreds were accumulated in the free space the soldiers closed in and drove the skulking brutes through the gap towards the place royale and there they made a battue of it shooting them down by the score with difficulty i made my way round to the place the better to view the sport the poor trapped fripons ran hither and thither crying yelpingsome fawning on their executioners some begging to the bullets as if these were crusts thrown to them and my heart woke to pity for was i not witnessing the destruction of my good friends the noisethe volleying the howling the shrieking of the canaillewas indescribable suddenly my pulses gave a leap i knew herradegonde she was driven into the fire and stood at bay bristling nanette cried a quick acid voice nanetteimbecilemy god it all passed in an instant there starting from the crowd was the figure of a tall sourfeatured woman the tiny tricolour bow in her scarlet cap there was the thin excited musketeer his piece to his shoulder there was my citoyenne flung upon the ground her arms about the neck of the hound whether his aim was true or false who can tell he shot her through her dog and his sergeant brained him and in due course his sergeant was invited for his reward to look through the little window these were a straw or two in the torrent of the revolution it was citizen gaspardin who accepted the contract to remove the carcasses some three thousand of them that encumbered the place royale as a result of this drastic measure however his eye being bigger than his stomach as the saying is he found himself short of means adequate to his task and so applied for the royal equipages to help him out of his difficulty and these the assembly entering into the joke was moved to lend him and the dead dogs hearsed in gilt and gingerbread as full as they could pack made a rare procession of it through paris thereby pointing halfadozen morals that it is not worth while at this date to insist on i saw the show pass amidst laughter and clapping of hands and i saw radegonde as i thought her head lolling from the roof of the stateliest coach of all but her place should have been on the seat of honour and the citoyenne the dark window the ripping sound in the street and that bosom bursting to mine in agony episodes my friendmere travelling sparks in dead ashes that glowed an instant and vanished the times bristled with such love and hate and all the kaleidoscope of passionpouf a sigh shook the tube and form and colour were changed butbutbutah i was glad thenceforth not to shudder for my heart when a blonde perruque went by me chapter x the affair of the candles gardelone of the most eminent and amusing rascals of my experienceis inextricably associated with my memories of the prison of the little force he had been runner to the marquis de kercy and that his vanity would by no means deny though it should procure his conviction ten times over he was vivacious and at all expedients as ingenious as he was practical and while he was with us the commonroom of la force was a theatre of varieties by a curious irony of circumstance it fell to madame his former chtelaine to second his extravagances for he was her fellowprisoner and out of all that motley kaleidoscopic assemblage an only representative of the traditions of her past she indulged him indeed as if she would say in him mes amis you see exemplified the gaieties that i was born to patronise and applaud she was a small faded woman of thirtyfive or soone of those colourless aristocrats who lying under no particular ban were reserved to complete the tale of any fourne that lacked the necessary number of loaves it is humiliating to be guillotined because fiftynine are not sixty but that in the end was her fate i recall her the first evening of my incarceration when i was permitted to descend rather late to the salle de rcration of the proscribed she was seated with other ladies at the long table the music of their voices rippled under the vaulted ceiling they worked these dear creaturesthe decree depriving prisoners of all implements and equipments not yet being formulated madame la marquise stitched proverbs into a sampler in red silk she looked perhaps a morsel slatternly for a grande dame and her fine lace was torn but the sampler must not be neglected for all that since the days she had played at proverbs how often in the old paternal chteau her little philosophy of life had been all maxims misapplied her sampler was as eloquent to her as was their knitting to the ladies in the place du trne endowed with so noble a fund of sentiments how could they accuse her of inhumanity i think she had a design to plead sampler before fouquier tinville byandby i had an opportunity presently to examine her work a laver la tte dun maure on perd sa lessive she had just finished itin roman characters too as a concession to the directory it was a problemaxiom the executive had resolved unanswerablyas i was bound to tell her comment she asked with a little sideling perk of her head like a robin can madame doubt it requests the black thing to sneeze once into the basket and behold the difficulty is surmounted fi donc she cried and stole me a curious glance was i delirious with the revolution fever of what do they accuse you my friend she said kindly byandby a grave offence surely there is little hope for me i gave a citizen you instead of thou so but how men are thoughtless alas she treated me to a little proverb again the sleeping cat needs not to be aroused this was late in the evening a little before the lock up hour was arrived earlier as i had entered she lifted her eyebrows to gardel who stood her chevalier dhonneur behind her chair the man advanced at once with infinite courtesy and bade me welcome entirely in the grand manner to the society of la force i have the honour to represent madame this kiss i impress upon monsieurs hand is to be returned the ladies laughed i advanced gravely and saluted the marquise i restore it like a medal blessed of the holy father sanctified a hundredfold i said there was a mignonne seated near who was critical of my gallantry but monsieur is enamoured of his own lips she said in a little voice cruel i cried what should i mean but that i breathed into it all that i have of reverence for beauty if the citoyenne there was a general crya fine a fine the hateful word was interdicted under a penalty i pay it i said and stooped and kissed the fair cheek its owner flushed and looked a little vexed for all the general merriment monsieur cheapens his own commodities she said ah mademoiselle i know the best investments for my heart i am a very merchant of love if you keep my embrace i am well advertised if you return it i am well enriched the idea was enough gardel invented a new game from it on the spot in a moment half the company was rustling and chattering and romping about the room m damzagues que feronsnous demain matinthat should have been this vivacious gardels epitaph he could not be monotonous he could not be unoriginal he could not rest anywherenot even in his grave it was curious to see how he deluded la marquise into the belief that she was his superior indeed these prisons afforded strange illustration of what i may call the process of natural adjustments accidents of origin deprived of all significance one could select without any difficulty the souls to whom a free constitution would have ensured intellectual prominence i take gardel as an instance confined within arbitrary limits under the old rgime his personality here discovered itself masterful his resourcefulness his intelligence overcrowed us all irresistibly leaping to their right sphere of action he had a little learning even but that was no condition of his emancipation also he was not wanting in that sort of courage with which one had not condescended hitherto to accredit lackeys no doubt in those days one was rebuked by many discoveries yet another possession of his endeared him to all misrables in this casual ward of the guillotine he had a mellow baritone voice and a rpertoire of playful and tender little folksongs cllie it was she i had kissed i never knew her by any other name would accompany him on the harp till her head drooped and the poudre marchale from her hair would glitter red on the stringsnot to speak of other gentle dew that was less artificial then she would look up with a pitiful mouth of deprecation la paix pour dieu la paix she would murmur my very harp weeps to hear thee the pathos of his songs was not in their application perhaps he was quit of worse grievances than those the revolution presented to him perhaps he was happier proscribed than enslaved at any rate he never fitted music to modern circumstance his subjects were sweet archaicthe mythology of the woods and pastures it was in their allusions to a withered springtime that the sadness lay for believe me we were all punchinellos grimacing lest the terror of tears should overwhelm us there was a chansonnette of his the opening words of which ran somewhat as follows oh beautiful appletree heavy with flowers as my heart with love as a little wind serveth to scatter thy blossom so a young lover only is needed to ravish the heart from my bosom this might be typical of all we convinced ourselves that we caught in them echoes of a once familiar innocence and we wept over our lost eden truly the indulging of introspection is the opportunity of the imagination to many brave souls gardels peasant ballads were the requiem passez la dormette passez par chez nous and so comes the rascal cabochon our jailer with his lowering huissiers and the evening gazette in his hand soandso and soandso and soandso to the conciergerie then if the runner had been singing would succeed some little emotions of partingmoist wistful eyes and the echo of sobs going down the corridor yet more often cabochon would interrupt a romp to which the condemned would supplement a jocund exit adieu messieurs adieu adieu we cannot keep our countenances longer we kneel to sanson who shall shrive ussanson the abb the exquisite in whose presence we all lose our heads and so the wild hair and feverish eyes vanish but it is of gardel and the marquise i speak while many went and many took their places these two survived for a time to the new as to the old the rogue was unflagging in his attentions his every respite inspired him with fresh audacity from each condemned he seemed to take a certain toll of animation presently madame and her emancipated servant with cllie and i would make a nightly habit of it to join forces in a bout of quadrille we appropriated an upper corner of the long table and for the oil lamps on the walls were dismally inadequate we had our four wax candles all regularbut in burgundy bottles for sconces a fifth bottle with no candle but charged with the ruddier light that illuminates the heart was a usual accompaniment we chattered famously and on many subjects hope a little rallied maybe as each night brought cabochon with a list innocent of our names also we had our eccentricities that grew dignified by custom if in the game roi rendu was called we paid not with a fish but with a hair plucked from the head it made cllie cry but not all from loyalty so if the king of hearts triumphed its owner drank rubis sur longle emptying his glass and tapping the edge of it three times on his left thumbnail now i am to tell you of the black evening that at the last broke up our coterieof the frantic abandon of the scene and the tragedy of farce with which it closed on that afternoon gardel sparkled beyond his wont he made the air electric with animation the company was vociferous for a romp but at present we four sat idly talkative over the disused cards m gardel you remind me of a gnatmaggot how sir says gardel it is without offence once as a boy i kept a tub of goldfish in this the eggs of the little insect would be found to germinate i used to watch the tiny waterdragons come to the surface to take the air through their tailsmy faith but that was comically like the france of today now touch the water with a finger and pouf there they were all scurried to the bottom in a panic not to rise again till assured of safety that is not my way says gardel wait my friend byandby nearing their transformation these mites plump out and lose their gravity then if one frights them they try to wriggle down their buoyancy resists they may sink fivesix inches it is no good up they come again like bubbles in champagne to burst on the surface presently and fly away and shall i fly monsieur to the stars my brave gardel but is it not so one cannot drive you down for long tonight m thibaut such was my name in the prison registertonight i confess i am like a montgolfier i rise i expand i am full of thoughts too great for utterance my transformation must be near the marquise gave a little cry je ne puis pas me passer de vous franois the servantthe masterlooked kindlily into the faded eyes i will come back and be with you in spirit he said no no she cried volubly it is oldwives talesthe vapourings of poets and mystics of all these murdered thousands which haunts the murderers i gazed in astonishment this passive douillette with the torn lace i had never known her assert herself yet but through the mouth of her henchman oh yes she went on shrilly nodding her head death death death but if the dead return this paris should be a city of ghosts perhaps it is said gardel fie then she cried you forget your place you presume upon my condescension it is insolent so to put me to school ma demeure sera bientt le nant it was dantonyes dantonwho said that he was a devil but he could speak truth suddenly she checked herself and gave a little artificial titter she was not transfigured but debased a jealous scepticism was revealed in every line of her features and what is death to m gardel she said ironically it is an interruption madame she burst forth again excitedly but danton saw further than thee thou fool who like a crab lookest not whither thou art going and wilt run upon a blind wall while thine eyes devour the landscape sidelong i will not have it i do not desire any continuance my faith is the faith of eyes and ears and lips mans necessities die with him and living mine are for thy strong arm franois and for thy fruitful service my god what we pass through and then for a hereafter of horrible retrospection no no it is infamous to suggest foolish to insist on it but for all that i do said gardel steadily he took her outburst quite coollyanswered her with gaiety even i cried malepeste under my breath and indeed my amazement was justified for who would have dreamed that this little colourless draggletail had one sentiment in her that amounted to a conviction madame placide an atheist and what was there of dark and secret in her past history that drove her to this desire of extinction at gardels answer she fell back in her chair with defiant eyes and again that little artificial laugh in the noisy talk of the room we four sat and spoke apart malappris she said you shall justify yourself of that boldness come back to me if you go first and i will believe agreed he cried and for the sign madame she thought and answered with the grateful womanliness that redeemed her do me a little servicesomething anythingand i shall know it is you the candles were burned halfway down in their bottles he rose and one by one blew them out voil he cried gaily to save your pocket so the little scene ended m gardel i said to him presently you come you will pardon me of the makers of the revolution i am curious to learn your experience of the premonitory symptoms of that disease to which at last you have fallen a victim monsieur a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse it is an early remembrance with me how my father cursed me that i passed my eighth year and so was liable to the salttax my faith i do not blame him things were hard enough but it was unreasonable to beat me because i could not stop the march of time yet we had not then learned to worship reason the moloch that devours her children so it appears but there were signs and omens for long years before i am of the territory of berri monsieur and there all we learned to read was between the lines i will tell you that i heardfor i was in service at the time he bowed with infinite complaisance to his marquisehow all during the chill dark spring that preceded the september massacres les laveuses de la nuit were busy at their washing and who are they my friend strange inhuman women monsieur who wash in the moonlight by lonely tarns and while they wash they wail wash but what some say the windingsheets of those who are to die during the year la marquise broke into shrill laughter poor poor imbecile she cried thy credulity would make but one gulp of a gravestone you must know these things are not my friend i tell thee soi thy mistress miserable have you nothing in your life that not mountains of eternity could crush out the memory of again she checked herself it is the one virtue of the revolution to have decreed annihilation a deputation approached us she jumped to her feet her pale eyes flickering but yes she cried a game a game i acquit myself of these follies it is present life i desire messieurs what is it to be to the front franois the man responded at a leap the veins of all received the infection of his wild humour in a moment chattering and pushing and giggling we were to take our places for shadow buff we had no sheet the dirty drab of the wall must suffice a stool was placed for the guessernot yet appointed and la marquises four candles relighted were placed on the table over against it in a receding row like a procession of acolytes between the candles and the back of the guesser the company were to pass one by one for identification by means of the shadows cast on the wall who shall take the stool the clamour echoed up to the vaulted stonework of the roofand died cabochons evil face was visible at the grille he saw what we were at the dull brute was sopped with drink and bestially amiable his key grated in the door and he stood before us his bodyguard supporting him the fatal list in his hand ah he said but shadow buff again it is well timed yet i could name some citizen shadows without sitting on the stool his voice guttered like a candle it seemed to run into greasy drops a wild inspiration seized me voil citoyen i cried you shall join us you shall take your victims from the wall in a moment i had snatched the dirty rag of paper out of his hand and had retreated with it a few paces i had an instant to glance down the list before he slouched at me in sodden anger my heart gave a queer little somersault and came upright again sang dieu he growled thickly you do well to jest give me the paper or ill brain you with my keys i dropped laughing upon the stool and held the list between and under my knees with an oath he fell upon me the company applauded it all with a frenzy of mad mirth and frolic the struggle was brief he rose directly puffing and cursing the paper in his hand i affected a crestfallen goodhumour you might have let us have our game out i protested with his recovered authority in his hand the rascal condescended to some facetious tolerance so he said you play a good part they should have you for king george in le dernier jugement des rois but rest content you shall appear on a notable stage yet and before an audience more appreciative than that of the thtre de la rpublique and i shall know how to bow my thanks citizen ah he crowed i love thee thou shalt have thy game and sit here and i will pick from the flock as thou numberest its tale it fell in with the reckless dreadful humour of the times i would have withdrawn from the cruel jest but it was the company of les misrables that prevented me who should go first there was a little hesitation and reluctance come hurry cried cabochon or i must do my own guessing suddenly a shadow glided past upon the wall no no i muttered name it name it chuckled the jailer the grinning sansculottes at the door echoed his demand vociferously gardel i murmured faintly the leading spirit had characteristically been the first to enter the breach good croaked cabochon referring to his list citizen shadow you are marked for judgment i rose hurriedly from the stool i will no more of it i cried whatalready my faith a nerveless judge instantly a figure pressed forward and took my place pass pass good people it cried and i will call the tale she sat therethe marquiseher lips set in an acrid smile neither look nor word did she address to her forfeited servant another shadow passed darviane she cried shrilly encore bien roared cabochon amidst shrieks of laughter my god what laughter milet de mrode fontenayshe named them all they took their places by the door skippinghalfhysterical daubiers monvillei cannot recall a moiety of them it was a destructive list cllie also was in itpoor cllie the frail i fear but with the big heart i fancied i noticed a harder ring in madames voice as she identified her i stood stupidly in the background presently i heard cabochon enough enough the virtuous citizens would forestall the executive he numbered up his list rapidly counted his prisoners they tallied to be repeated tomorrow he said it is good sport but the guessers it seems remain he treated us to a grin and a clumsy bow gave the order to form and carried off his new batch to the baking as the door clanged upon them i gave a deep gasp i could not believe in the reality of my respite for the thinned company the reaction had set in immediately women were flung prostrate on the table over the benches wailing out their desperate loss and misery madame made her way to me the strange smile had not left her mouth you were on the list i saw it in your face i was at the bottomthe very last but how as cabochon struggled with me i turned my name down and tore it off but the number it tallied it was enough for him they must find it outtomorrow when the prisoners are arraigned probably and in the meantime we will drink to our poor gardels acquittal no she said shrinking back with an extraordinary look if i wish him well i wish him eternal forgetfulness it was the evening of the day succeeding shorn of our partners in quadrille madame and i had been playing piquet we were only two but the four lights flickered in their bottles la marquise de kercy had been musing suddenly she looked up her eyes were full of an inhuman mockery the candles she said with a little laugh we are no longer using them to save my pocket franois pouf a candle went outanother another another between each the fraction of time occupied by something unseen moving round systematically i started to my feet with a suppressed cry one or two sitting near us complained of this churlish economy of wax they imagined i was the culprit madame i muttered look she is indisposed her face was white and dreadful like a skull hearing my voice she sat up so he has been guillotined she said she articulated with difficulty swallowing and panting without stop m thibaut it is true then they say but it was he made me kill the child he has more need to forget than i is it not appalling if i tell them now how i have learnt to fear they will surely spare me i cannot subscribe to their doctrinesthat club of the cordeliers if i tell them sodanton being gone her voice tailed off into a hurry of pitiful sobs and cries i welcomed the entrance of cabochon with his list her name was first on it as we stood arisen dreading some hideous scene she fell silent quite suddenly got to her feet and walked to the door with a face of stone death is an interruption ma demeure sera bientt le nant which could one hope for her pondering only that delirious outcry from her lips possibly indeed she had been mad from first to last i had time to collect my thoughts forfrom whatever causecitizen tinville had it appeared overlooked me chapter xi pyramus and thisbe i was taking exercise one forenoon in the yard of the prison it was the last black prairial of the terrorthe month like the girl la lune once dedicate to maryand its blue eyes curiously scrutinised as cleopatras of old the processes amongst us slaves of that poison that is called despair as for myself i yet a little consorted with hopethe fond clinging mistress i had dreaded to find banished with the rest of the dear creatures whose company had long now been denied usfor five months had passed since my incarceration and i was still it seemed forgotten i trod the flagsfifty paces hither and thither going one way i had always before my eyes the frowzy stone rampart and barred windows of the prison going the other an execrable statue of m rousseausurmounting an altar to liberty the very cement of which was marbled with the blood of the massacresclosed my perspective to my either hand was a lofty wallthe first giving upon the jailers quarters the second dividing the mens yard from that in which the women were permitted to walk and a foul open sewer tunnelled through the latter about its middle traversed the entire area and offered the only means by which the sexes could now communicate with each other m thibaut said a voice at my ear and a gentleman detaching himself from the aimless and loitering crowd of prisoners adapted his pace to mine and went with me to and fro i knew this odditym the admiral de st prestthough he had no recognition of me that however was small wonder by this time i was worse than a sansculotte by so much as that my bareness was suggested rather than revealed my face was sunk away from my eyes like soft limestone from a couple of ammonites my ribs were loose hoops on a decayed cask laughter rattled in my stomach like a pea in a whistle besides i had come i think to be a little jealous of my title to neglect for i had made that my grievance against fate nevertheless m de st prest and i had been slightly acquainted once upon a time and it had grieved me to see this red month marked by the advent in la force of the dubious old fop he had been a macaroni of louis xvs court and the ancient rle he had never learnt to forego the poor puppies of circumstancethe fops of a more recent date to whom the particular cut of a lapel would figure as the standard of reasonbayed him in the prison as they would have bayed him in the streets to them with their high topboots langlaise poor st prests spotted breeches and kneeribbons were a source of profound amusement to them affecting the huskiness of speech of certain rude islanders my very good friends his mincing falsetto was a perpetual incitement to laughter swaggering with their cudgels that they called constitutions they would strike from under him the elaborate tasselled staff on which he leaned tossing their matted manes they would profess to find something exquisitely exhilarating in the complicated toupet that embraced and belittled his lean physiognomy i held them all poor apes yet i confess it was a ridiculous and pathetic sight this posturing of an old wrecked man in the tatters of a bygone generation and it gave me shame to see him lift his plate of a hat to me with a little stick as the fashion was in his younger days m thibaut he said falling into step with me these young bloods he signified with his cane a group that had been baiting himthey worry me monsieur mort de ma vie what manners what a presence it shall need a butchers steel to bring their wits to an edge oh monsieur said ihave you not the selfconfidence to despise personalities the fool hath but a narrow world of conventions and everything outside it is to him abnormal his head is a drumstick to produce hollow sounds within a blank little area for my part i never hear one holding the great up to ridicule without thinking there is wasted a good stonecutter of epitaphs eh bien monsieur but i have been accustomed to leave the study of philosophy to my lackeys he spoke in a lofty manner waving his hand at me and he took snuff from a battered wooden box and flipped his fingers to his thumb afterwards as if he were scattering largesse of fragrance so you have a royal contempt of personalities he said with a little amused tolerance why said ii am not to be put out of conceit with myself because an ass brays at me or out of countenance monsieur oh m de st prest that would be to lose my head on small provocation besides one must admit the point of view m malseigne there surveys the world over the edge of a great stock you monsieur regard it with your chin propped upon a fine fichu no doubt sanson thinks a wooden cravat comme il faut and ifichtre i cry in my character of patriot there is nothing like the collar of a carmagnole to keep ones neck in place truly m lamiral i for one am not touchy about my appearance his old eyes blinked out a diluted irony and that is very natural he said but then mort de ma vie you are a philosopherlike him there he pointed to the statue of rousseau the libellous block wrought in him it seemed a mood of piping retrospection i saw the rascal once he saida mean common little man in a round wig he was without air or presence it was at the theatre the piece was one of m de sauvignys and he sat in the authors box a loge grille that was a concession to his diffidence but his diffidence had been too much consulted it seemed he would have the grate opened and then the house recognised and applauded him and finally forgot him for the persiffleur he was very angry at that i believe we heard it lost the author his friendship he accused him of having made a show of him andmort de ma vie that is to be a philosopher he ogled and bowed to a stout kindlylooking woman who coming from the jailers quarters passed us at the moment it was madame beau the keeper of la forcethe only one there in authority whose sense of humanity had not gone by the board a ruffianly warder leading a great wolfhound preceded her she nodded to us brightly and stopped ah m thibaut but soon we shall call you the father of la force as you are its mother madame poor children but after all if one considers it as a club true where one may feast like belshazzar yet i find one may have a surfeit of putrid herrings even though one is to die on the morrow madame shrugged her shoulders ah bah the stuff is supplied by contract i am not to blame my little fellows yet some of you manage better she pointed to the retreating hound voil le dlinquent he was caught redhandeddiscussing the bribe of a sheeps trotter and his sentence is five hours in a cell she nodded again and jingled her keys but yes she said consider it as a club and off she went across the yard a club oh mon dieu murmured st prest well said i i am inclined to fall in with the idea what livelier places of sojourn are there in these days of gravity and decorum than the prisons he pursed his lips and wagged his old head like a mandarin at least he said leeringly she is a fine figure of a woman she dates like myself from the era of the bienaim when women knew how to walk and to hold themselves and to reveal themselves too oh je mentends bien i have been entertained in the parc aux cerfs m thibaut i could certainly believe it this effete old carpetadmiral had he ever smelt salt water i could understand perhaps that he had crossed in the packet to the land of fogs but now he was to exhibit himself to me in a more honourable aspectto confess the man under the powder and the rubbish we stood close by where the wall was pierced by the running sewer the whole yard was alive with laughter and babble and now and again one would leave a friend or party of triflers and kneeling down over the infected sink would call some name through the opening then summoned to the other side lucille poor ange dchu would exchange a few earnest pitiful words with husband or brother or lover and her tears perhaps would fall into the gushing drain and sanctify its abomination to him was not that for love to justify itself in the eyes of the most unnatural misogynist now there came up to the trap a pale little fellowthe merest child it was little foucaud the son of madame kolly this poor lad must be held a man god save him when misfortune overtook his family but the scoundrels had the grace to consign his younger brother to the company of his mother on the womans side and here through this sink opening the two babes would converse in their sad little trebles two or three times aday how now my man said st prest for the boy stood wistfully watching us his hands picking together and his throat swelling then all at once he was weeping the old fop gently patted the heaving shoulders oh monsieur said the youngster in a hoarse little voice the cold of the stones is in my throat and on my chest what then child that is not to be guillotined but i cannot cry out so that he shall hear me and if we do not talk i know nothing in a paroxysm of agitation he threw himself down by the sewer lolo lolo he tried to call but his voice would not obey his will and then m de st prest did a thing the selfsacrificing quality of which shall be known in full perhaps only to the angels he took the lad under the arms and lifting him away himself knelt down in all his nicety by the sink and put his mouth to the opening the little foucaud he piped desires to see his brother presently he looked up he is here child oh monsieur will you explain that i cannot speak and ask him how is maman the message was given i heard the poor little voice answer through the wall maman sends her love to you she has not wept so much the last night and she has been sleeping a little it is lolo who loves you well that tells you this i assisted st prest to rise i will ask the honour i said of dusting m lamirals coat for him that same afternoon as i was again during the hour of exercise standing near the sewer of a sudden i heard a most heartrending voice calling from the other side of the wall messieurs messieurs it cried will no one send to me my darling i dropped upon my knees i give all honour to m de st prest and with a shudder of nausea lowered my face to the opening who speaks i said i am at madames service the voice caught in a sob je vous rends grcewhoever you are i thank you from my heart it is my little foucaud my dearest that must come to his maman and quickly i answered that i would summon him and i rose to my feet i had no difficulty in finding the boy he came whitefaced and wondering and knelt down maman mamancanst thou hear me my throat is a little hoarse maman oh my baby my little son thou wilt be sweet and tender with lolo in the happy days that are coming and thou wilt never forget mamansay it say it lest her heart should break god of mercy who was i to stand and listen to these pitiful confidences i drew aside watchful only of the boy lest his grief and terror should drive him mad in a moment a white hand laden with a dark thick coil of hair was thrust through the opening it was all the unhappy woman could leave her darling to remember her by no glimpse of her faceno touch of her lips on his from the dark into the dark she must go and his very memory of her should be associated with the most dreadful period of his life when they came for her in another instant i heard the agony of her soul find vent in a single cry my lambs alone amongst the wolves kind madame beau was there beside me lift him up she whispered he will be motherless in an hour as i stooped to take the sobbing and hysterical child in my arms i heard a voice speak low on the other side of the wall it is only an interruption madame gardels wordsbut the speaker i stumbled with my burdenrecovered myself and consigned the boy to the good soul that awaited him then hurriedly i leaned down again and hurriedly cried carinne carinne there was no answer probably the speaker had retreated when the wretched madame kolly was withdrawn from the wall i called again i dwelt over the noxious gutter in excitement and anguish until i was convinced it was useless to remain was it this then that out of all the voices of france one voice could set my heart vibrating like a glass vessel that responds only to the striking of its single sympathetic note i had thought to depose this idol of an hour from its shrine i had cried shame upon myself for ever submitting my independence to the tyranny of a woman and here a halfdozen words from her addressed to a stranger had reinfected me with the fever of desire i got out a scrap of paper and wrote thereon jacob to rachel jeanlouis is still in the service of mademoiselle de lge i found a fragment of stick notched the paper into the end of it and gingerly passed my billet through the hole in the wall on the instant a great voice uttered a malediction behind me and i was jerked roughly down upon the flags my end of the stick dropped into the gutter and wedged itself in slime i looked up above me were cabochon and a yellowfaced rascal this last wore a sword by his side and on his head a highcrowned hat stuffed with plumes i had seen him beforemaillard labbaye maillard a hound with a keen enough scent for blood to make himself a lusty living he and his colleague hron would often come to la force to count their victims before following them to the scaffold plotsplots he muttered shaking his head tolerantly as if he were rebuking a child see to it citizen cabochon the jailer fetched back the stick the paper however was gone from the end of it it will be in the sewer said maillard quietly cabochon had no scruples he groped with his fingers it is not here he said after a time eyeing me and very malignant well said the other who is this fellow mordi citizen president he is a forgotten jackass that eats his head off in the revolutionary stable vraiment then it follows his head must fall into the revolutionary manger he nodded pleasantly twice or thrice then turned and beckoning cabochon to walk by him strode away i sat in particular cogitation against the wall for the present it seemed i enjoyed a distinction that was not attractive to my fellowprisoners and i was left religiously to myself now said i aloud i have grown such a beard that at last the national barber must take me in hand m jeanlouis said a voice the other side of the trap will you keep me kneeling here for ever i started and flung myself face downwards with a cry of joy my heart swelled in a moment so that it drove the tears up to my eyes carinne i cried choking and halfsobbing is it thou indeed creep through the little hole she said and thou shalt see i laughed and i cried in a single breath say what thou wilt ma fillette yes i will call thee as i choose didst thou hear but now i think it is a dying man that speaks to thee carinne say after all you keep a place in your heart for the little odd thibaut insidious thou wouldst seek to devour the whole like a little worm in a gall to hear your voice again we are always shadows to one another now as a shadow i swear that i love you dearly oh ma mie ma mie i love you so dearly and why were you cruel to leave me for that small gust of temper i soon repented of carinne my god she is gone away i am here little thibaut there is a sound in your voice oh this savage unyielding wall i will kiss it a foot above the trap will you do the same on the other side monsieur forgets himself i think he is lightheaded with joy but he never forgets mademoiselle de lgenot though she punished him grievously for an indifferent offence in the forests of chalus jeanlouis listen well to this i was abducted my god by whom by a vile citizen representative journeying to paris by a i had emerged from the trees after you left me and was sitting very passionate by the road when he passed with his escort and discovered me i kneeled voiceless as if i were stunned what would you said carinne there was no thibaut at hand to throw him to the pigs he forced me to go with him and i vented a groan that quite rumbled in the gutter and at that her voice came through the hole a little changed monsieur has a delicate faith in what he professes to love i beat my hands on the wall i cried upon heaven in my agony to let me reach through this inexorable veil of stone you talked once of the wicked licence of the times how could i know oh ma mie and now all my heart is melting with love and rapture but i had a knife jeanlouis well but he was courteous to me and at that i told him who i wasno jillflirt but an unhappy waif of fortune now mon dieuit turned out that this was the very man that had come en mission to pierrettes lacombe noa creature of the name of crpin i uttered a cry crpin it was he that carried thee away truly and who has for my obduracy consigned me to prison ever since little thibaut ever sincenow at les carmes now in the rue de svres at last no later than yesterday to this extraordinary question of la force now thou art a sweetsouled carinne send me something of thine through the evil passage that i may mumble it with my lips carinne listenand i told her the story of my connection with the villain i would wring his neck if they would spare mine i said but alas i fear i am doomed carinne she had from me all the details in brief of my captivity mon dieu but it was ecstasy this dessert to my long feast of neglect at the end she was silent a space then she said very low he communicates with me but i never answer now i will do so and perhaps thou shalt not die carinne hush thou small citizen the time is up we must talk no longer i breathed all my heart out in a sigh of farewell i thought she had already gone when suddenly she spoke again jeanlouis jeanlouis do you hear yes i would have thee just the height for thine eyes to look into mine carinne and what should they read there again there was a pause again i thought she had gone and then once more her voice came to me little thibaut i did kiss the wall a foot above the trap madame beau said i when you shall be nearing old agethat is to say when your present years double themselvesit is very certain that your lines will fall in pleasant places and where will they be said she where but round your fine eyes and the dimples of your mouth she cried oh quil est malin and tapped my shoulder archly with a great key she held in her hand and what is the favour you design to ask of me she said firstly your permission to me to dedicate some verses to you said i after that that you will procure me the immediate delivery of this little tube of paper to whom is it addressed to one crpin who lives in the rue de jouy st antoine croyez men she cried do you not see i have dropped my key then as i stooped to pick up the instrument which she had let fall on the pavement slip the little paper into the barrel she muttered i did so and these were the words i had written on it i am imprisoned in la force for any reason or none it concerns me only in that i am thereby debarred from vindicating upon your body the honour of mademoiselle de lge if it gives you any shame to hear that towards this victim of your base persecution i your onetime comrade entertain and have long entertained sentiments of the most profound regard prevail with yourself i beseech you to procure the enlargement of a lady whose only crimesas things are judged nowadaysare her innocence and her beauty jeanlouis thibaut of all the degradations to which we in the prison were subjected none equalled that that was a common condition of our nightly herding thenso early as eight oclock during the darker monthswould appear the foul cabochonwith his satellites and three or four brace of houndsto drive us like cattle to our sleepingpens bayed into the corridors from which our cells opened we must answer to our names bawled out by a crapulous turnkey who held in his jerking hands and consulted with his clouded eyes a list that at his soberest he could only half decipher he calls a nameprobably of one that has already paid the penalty there is no answer the ruffian bullies and curses while the survivors explain the matter to him he sulkily acquiesces shouts the tally once more regardless of the hiatusof course only to repeat the error amidst a storm of menaces we are all ordered out of our rooms and this again and yet again perhaps until the beast satisfies himself or is satisfied that none is skulking and that nothing is in error but his own drunken vision then at last the dogs are withdrawn the innumerable doors clanged to and barred and we are left sealed within a fetid atmosphere to salve our wounded dignity as we can with the balm of spiritual selfpossession but now on this particular evening conscious of something in my breast that overcrowed the passionless voice of philosophy i felt myself uplifted and translatedan essence impressionable to no influence that was meaner than divine and who knows i said to myself as we were summoned from the yard but that quatremainsquatrepattes might have pronounced carinne to be the bright star in my horoscope not so fast citizen growled cabochon who stood list in hand at the door rest content said i i am never in a hurry par exemple you grow a little rusty perhaps for a notable actor it is well then that you have an engagement at last to perform and where m cabochon in the palais de justice that is a theatre with a fine box citizen and the verdict of those that sit in it is generally favourableto the public chapter xii the mousetrap was i so very small i had the honour of a tumbril all to myself on my journey to the conciergerie and i swear that i could have thought i filled it but mademoiselle de lge was the pretty white heifer that had caused me to puff out my sides in emulation of her large nobilityme yes of whom she would have said as the bull of the frog il ntait pas gros en tout comme un uf now i was travelling probably to my grave yet the exaltation of that interview still dwelt with me and i thought often of some words that had once been uttered by a certain casimir bertrand to die with the wine in ones throat and the dagger in ones back what could kings wish for better we came down upon the sullen prison by way of the pont au change and the quay dhorloge and drew up at a door on the riverside i saw a couple of turrets with nightcap roofs stretch themselves as if yawning above me i saw in a wide angle of the gloomy block of buildings where the bridge discharged itself upon the quay a vast heap of newly thrownup soil where some excavations were being conducted and from the mound a sort of crane or scaffold sinisterly suggestive of a guillotine surmounting a trench dug for its dead stood out against a falling crimson sky the river hummed in its course above a green spot on the embankment wall a cloud of dancing midges seemed to boil upwards like steam from a caldron everything suggested to me the mise en scne of a rehearsing tragedy and then promptly i was haled like an inanimate property into the understage of that dark theatre of varieties messieurs the jailers it appeared were at their supper and would not for the moment be bothered with me a gush of light and a violent voice issued from a door to one side of a stony vestibule run the rascal into la souricire and be damned to him thereat i was hurried by the blue that was responsible for my transfer and an understrapper with the keys by way of a gloomy courseup and downthrough doorways clinched with monstrous boltsunder vaulted stone roofs where spiders blinded by the lamp glare shrank back into crevices and where all the mildew of desolation sprouted in a poisonous fungusalong passages deeply quarried it seemed into the very foundations of despair and at last they stopped thrust me forward and a door clapped to behind me with a slam of thunder i stood a moment where i was and caught at my bewildered faculties it took me indeed but a moment to possess myself of them in those days one had acquired a habit of wearing ones wits unsheathed in ones belt then i fell to admiring the quite unwonted brilliancy of the illumination that pervaded the cell it was a particularly small chamberperhaps ten feet by eight or soand consequently the single lighted candle held in a cleft stick the butt of which was thrust into a chink in the stones irradiated it to its uttermost corner the furniture was artless in its simplicitya tub a broken pitcher of water and two heaps of foul straw but so abominable a stench filled the place that no doubt there was room for little else now from one of the straw beds the figure of a manmy sole comrade to be it would appearrose up as i stirred and stood with its back and the palms of its hands pressed against the wall remaining thus motionless the shadows blue in its gaunt cheeks and little husks of wheat caught in its dusty hair it fixed me with eyes like staring pebbles dfense dentrer it snapped out suddenly and shut its mouth like a gin oh monsieur said i no going out rather for the mouse in the trap he lifted one of his arms at right angles to his body and let it drop again to his side behold he cried the peril hadst thou been closer thy head had fallen but thine said i hast thou not already lost it oh early in the struggle monsieur oh very early and then my soul passed into the inanimate instrument of death and made it animate what thou art the guillotine itself look at me then is it not obvious that i am that infernal engine nor less that i am informed with the ego that once was my victim and is now my familiarbeing myself in effect pardieu this is worse than the game of proverbs it rests with thy ego then to put a period to this orgy of blood he gave forth a loud wailing cry i am a demon prejudged and predestined and the saint of the place du trne is possessed with me a saint possessed he wrung his hands insanely oh he criedbut is it not a fate to which damnation were paradise for me the gentle aubriot who in my material form had shrunk from killing a flyfor me to thus deluge an unhappy land with the blood of martyrs but i have threshed my conscience with a knotted discipline and i knowyes monsieur i knowwhat gained me my punishment a cripple once begged of me a poor two sous i hesitated in that i had but the one coin on me and my nostrils yearned for snuff i hesitated and the devil tripped up my feet i gave the man the piece and asked him a sou in change for so petty a trifle did i barter my salvation but heaven was not to be deceived and its vengeance followed me like a snake through the grass ah he jumped erect but the blade fell within an ace of thy shoulder this was disquieting enough in all truth yet i took comfort from the thought that the madman could avail himself of no more murderous weapon than his hands now m guillotin said i observe that it is characteristic of you to lie quiescent when you are put away for the night nenni nenni nenni he answered that may have been before the hideous apotheosis of the instrument now possessed as i am i slash and cut at whoever comes in my way mon dieu but this was a wearisome lunatic and i longed very ardently to be left peacefully to my own reflections i came forward with a show of extreme fortitude this demon of yourself i saidyou wish it to be exorcised that the soil of france may grow green again a fine selfsacrificial rapture illumined his wild face let me be hurled into the bottomless pit he cried that so the millennium may rise in the east like an august sun now said i i will commune with my soul during the night that perchance it may be revealed to me how the guillotine may guillotine itself to my surprise the ridiculous bait took and the poor wretch sunk down upon his straw and uttered no further word crossing the cell to come to my own heap my foot struck against an iron ring that projected from a flag for an instant a mad hope flamed up in me only to as immediately die down was it probable that the mousetrapinto which i knew it was the custom to put newly arrived prisoners before their overhauling by the turnkeys and scenting by the dogs of the guardwould be furnished with a door of exit as of entrance nevertheless i stooped and tugged at the ring to see what should be revealed in the lifting of the stone it the latter seemed a ponderous slab i raised one end of it a foot or so with difficulty and propping it with the pitcher looked to see what was underneath a shallow trough or excavationthat was all probably a mere pit into which to sweep the scourings of the cell leaving it open i flung myself down upon the mat of straw and gave myself up to a melancholy ecstasy of reflection the maniac crouched in his corner so long as the light lasted i was conscious of his eyes fixed in a steady bright stare upon the lifted stone there seemed something in its position that fascinated him then with a dropping splutter the candle sank upon itself and was extinguished suddenly and straightway we were embedded in a block of gloom very soon i was asleep ease and sensation drink and foodhow strangely in those days ones soul had learned to withdraw itself from its instinctive attachments to hover apart as it were from that clumsy expression of its desires that is the body with its appetites and to accept at last as radically irreclaimable that same body so grievously misinformed with animism now i could surrender to forgetfulness and that with little effort all the load of emotion and anxiety with which a savage destiny sought to overwhelm me nor did this argue a brutish insensibility on my part but only a lifting of idealism to spheres that offered a more tranquil and serener field for meditation once during the night a single drawn sound like the pipe of wind in a keyhole roused me to a halfrecovery of my faculties i had been dreaming of carinne and of the little pig that fell into the pit and associating the phantom cry with the voluble ghosts of my brain i smiled and fled again to the heights the noise of heavily grating bolts woke me at length to the iron realities of a day that might be my last on earth i felt on my face the wind of the dungeon door as it was driven back follow me aubriot grunted an indifferent voice in the opening lacking a response of any sort the speaker who had not even put himself to the trouble of entering the cell cried out gutturally and ironically hol h hol h citizen aubriot guillotin thou art called to operate on thyself mordi mordi mordi dost thou hear thou art invited to commit suicide that france may regenerate itself of thee i raised my head a burly form topped by a great hairy face blocked the doorway i made it out by the little light that filtered through a highup grating above me mille dmons shouted the turnkey suddenly what is this he came pounding into the cell paused and lifted his hands like a benedictory priest mille dmons he whispered again with his jaw dropped i had jumped to my feet pardieu mr jailer said i the guillotine it appears has anticipated upon itself that law of which it is the final expression the rest of us you will of necessity acquit i looked down halfdazed but i recalled the odd sound that had awakened me in the night here then was the explanation of itin this swollen and collapsed form whose head it seemed was plunged beneath the floor as if it had dived for tartarus and had stuck at the shoulders he has guillotined himself with a vengeance i exclaimed but how said the turnkey stupidly but thus it is obvious by propping the slabend on the pitcher by lying down with his neck over the brink of the trough by upsetting the vessel with a sweep of his arm as he lay mon dieu see how he sprouts from the chink like a horrible dead polypus this is no mousetrap but a gin to catch human vermin it was not to be foreseen muttered the man a little scared who would have fancied a madman to be in earnest and that remark said i comes oddly from the lips of a patriot he questioned me with his eyes in a surly manner bah i cried are not robespierre couthon st just in earnest are not you in earnest and do you not all put your heads into traps but i beg you to take me out of la souricire he had recovered his composure while i spoke come then he said thou art wanted down below and as to that rascalmordi he chuckled he has run into a culdesac on his way to hell but at any rate he has saved the axe an extra notch to its edge on the threshold of the room he stopped me and looked into my face how much for a billet said he you have one for me that depends but doubtless you have been paid to deliver it and doubtless thou wilt pay to receive it oh mon dieu said i but these vails and patriots i see are not so far removed from the lackeys they despise pardi said the bulky man listen to the fox preaching to the hens but i will lay odds that in another twelve hours thou wilt be stripped of something besides thy purse what matter then thou wilt have thy crown of glory to carry to the lombardhouse i gave him what was left to me now said i and he put a scrap of paper into my hand i unfolded it in the dim light and read these words hurriedly scrawled thereon in a hand unknown to me play if nothing else avails the hidden treasures of pierrettes follow me thibaut said the jailer as might feel a martyr who with a toy knife in his hand is driven to face the lions so felt i on my way to the tribunal with that fragment of paper thrust into my breast at one moment i could have cried out on the travesty of kindness that could thus seek to prolong my agony by providing me with an inadequate weapon at another i was reminded how one might balance oneself in a difficult place with a prop no stronger than ones own little finger yet this thin shaft of light cutting into desperate gloom had disquieted me strangely foreseeing and prepared stoically to meet the inevitable i had evenbefore the billet was placed in my handsfelt a certain curiosity to witnessthough as an accusedthe methods of procedure of a court that was as yet only known to me through the infamy of its reputation now however caught back to earth with a rope of straw i trembled over the very thought of the ordeal to which i was invited coming at the end of melancholy vaulted passages to a flight of stone steps leading up to a door i was suddenly conscious of a droning murmur like that of hived bees the jailer in the act of running the key into the lock beckoned me to mount to him and thus possessed of me caught me under the armpit play thy card then like a gambler said he what i exclaimed in astonishment ah bah he growled didst thou think delicacy kept me from reading the message but fear not thou art too little a gudgeon for my playingand he swung open the door immediately the hiss and patter of voices swept upon me like rain that and the broad glare of daylight after so much darkness confused me for a moment the next i woke to the consciousness that at last my foot was on the precipice paththe gangway for the passage of the predamned into the salle de la libertthe arte of the montagne it might be called seeing how it served that extreme faction for a ridge most perilous to its enemies to walk on this gangway skirted a wooden barricade that cut the hall at about a third of its length to my left as i advanced i caught glimpse over the partition of the dismal black plumes on the hats of the judges as they bobbed in juxtaposition of evil under a canopy of green cloth to my right loosely filling the body of the hall was the public and here my extreme insignificance as a prisoner was negatively impressed upon me by the indifference of those whom i almost brushed in passing for scarce a poissarde of them all deigned to notice the little gudgeon as he wriggled on the national hook then in a moment my conductor twisted me through an opening cut in the barricade and i was delivered over to the tribunal a certain drumming in my ears a certain mist before my eyes resolved themselves into a very set manner of attention the stark whitewashed walls seemed spotted with a plague of yellow facesto my left a throng of mean blotches the obsequious counsel for the defence to my front the president and judges in number three like skulls decked with hearseplumes to my right the jury a very pandorabox of goblins the lid left off the evil countenances swarming over the edge all seemed to my excited imagination to be faces and nothing elsedrab dirty and malignantugly motes set against the staring white of the walls dancing fantastically in the white daybeams that poured down from the high windows yet that i sought for most i could not at first distinguishnot until the owner of it stood erect by a little tableplaced to one side and a little forward of the judicial daisover which he had been leaning then i recognised him instantlytinville the devils advocate the bloodboltered vampireand from that moment he was the court to me judge jury and counsel and his dark face swam only in my vision like a gout of bile now i tell you that so dramatic was this assembly by reason of the deadliness of purpose that characterised it that one though a prisoner almost resented the flippant coxcombry of the three sightless busts standing on brackets above the bench for thesebrutus marat st fargeau his gods quit the indignant roman of responsibility for entertaining such companybeing jauntily decorated with a red bonnet apiece and a grimy cockade of the tricolour jarred hopelessly in the context and made of the bloodiest tragedy a mere clownish extravaganza and behold of this extravaganza fouquiertinville when he gave reins to his humour discovered himself to be the very sanniothe rude powerful buffoon with a wit only for indecency yet he did not at a first glance figure altogether unprepossessing lividskinned though he was with a low forehead which his hair brushed back and stiffly hooked at its ends seemed to claw about the middle like a black talon there was yet little in his countenance that bespoke an active malignancy his large eyes had that look of goodhumoured weariness in them that superficially one is apt to associate with unvindictive longsufferingness his brows black also and thick were set in the habitual lift of suspense and inquiry his whole expression was that of an anxious dwelling upon the prisoners words lest the prisoner should incriminate himself and it was only when one marked the tigerish steadiness of his gaze and the sooty projection of his underlip over a strongly cleft chin that one realised how the humour of the man lay all upon the evil side for the restas each detail of his personality was hammered into me by my pulseshis black clothes had accommodated themselves to his every ungainly habit of movement his limp shirt was caught up about his neck with a cravat like a rag of dowlas and over his shoulders hung a broad national ribbon ending in a silver medallion with the one word loi imprinted on it like a judas kiss thus the man as he stood scrutinising me after an abstracted fashion his left arm bent the hand of it knuckled upon the table the lachesis thumb of itflattened from long kneading of the yarn of lifestriding over a form of indictment the atmosphere of the court was frowzy as that of a wineshop in the early hours of morning it repelled the freshness of the latter and communicated its influence to public and tribunal alike over all hung a slackness and a peevish unconcern as to business bench and bar yawned and exchanged spiritless commonplaces of speech true enough a gudgeon was an indifferent fish with which to start the traffic of the day at length the public accuser slightly turned and nodded his head matre greffier said he in quite a noiseless little voice acquaint us of the charge i desire thee against this pattepelu nom de dieu here was a fine coup darchet to the overture my heart drummed very effectively in response a little blackmartin of a fellow with long coattails and glasses to his eyes stood up by the notaries table and handled a slip of paper everywhere the murmur of tinvilles voice had brought the court to attention i listened to the greffier with all my ears act of accusation he read out brassily against jeanlouis sebastien de cranc cidevant comte de la muette and since calling himself the citizen jeanlouis thibaut very well and very welli was discovered then through whose agency if not through jacques crpins i had no care to learn the wonder to me was that known and served as i had been i should have enjoyed so long an immunity from proscription as an aristocrat but i accused crpinand wrongfully i believein my heart hath rendered himself answerable to the law of the th brumaire went on the greffier mechanically in that he an migr hath ventured himself in the streets of paris in disguise and the public accuser waved him impatiently to a stop there fell a dumb silence one pellet out of a charge is enough to kill a rat said he quietly then in an instant his voice changed to harsh and terrible and he bellowed at me what answer to that monsieur rrrrat monsieur ratatouille the change of manner was so astounding that i jumped as at the shock of a battery then a hot flush came to my face and with it a dreadful impulse to strike this insolent on the mouth i folded my arms and gave him back glare for glare simply monsieur i said that it is not within reason to accuse me of returning to what i have never quitted paris the soil of france that shall not avail thee he thundered what right hast thou to the soil that thou and thine have manured with the sacred blood of the people oh monsieur i beganbut if you will convert my very refutation he overroared me as i spoke he was breathing himself at my expense for the more serious business of the day positively i was being used as a mere punchingbag on which this bruiser comme on dit langlaise might exercise his muscles silence he shouted i know of what i speak thou walkst on a bog where to extricate the right foot is to engulf the left emigrant art thoutitular at least by force of thy accursed rank and if that is not enough thou hast plotted in prison with others that are known i smiled awaiting details of the absurd accusation i had formed it was evident no proper conception of this court of summary jurisdiction the president leaned over his desk at the moment and spoke with tinville proffering the latter his snuffbox they exchanged some words a pantomime of gesticulation to me as they nodded apart however i caught a single wafted sentence we will whip her like the mricourt if she is obstinate to what vile and secret little history was this the key to me it only signified that while i had fancied them discussing a point of my case the two were passing confidences on a totally alien matter at last i felt very small and that would have pleased carinne but at any rate i thought the charge against me must now assume some definite form he that dark bouche de fer of the terror stared at me gloomily as if he had expected to find me already removed then suddenly he flung down upon the table the paper he had in his hand and cried automatically as if in a certain absence of mind i demand this man of the law to which he is forfeit god in heaven and so my trial was ended they had not even allotted me one from the litter of mongrel counsel that sitting there like begging curs dared never when retained score a point in favour of a client lest the hags and the brats should hale them off to the lampirons this certainly was justice paralysed down one whole side i heard a single little cry lift itself from the hall behind me and the clucking of the tricoteuses i felt it was all hopeless but i clutched at the last desperate chance as the president turned to address in three words the jury m laccusateur public i said hurriedly i am constrained to tell you that i have in my possession that which may induce you to consider the advisability of a remand the fellow stared dumfoundered at me as if i had thrown my cap in his face the president hung on his charge oh said the former with an ironical nicety of toneand what is the nature of this magnificent evidence i had out my scrap of paper folded like a billetdoux if the citizen will condescend to cast his eye on this i said he considered a minute curiosity ever fights in the bully with arrogance at length he made a sign to a gendarme to bring him that on which it seemed my life depended every moment while he dwelt on the words was like the oozing of a drop of blood to me i had in a flash judged it best to make him sole confidant with me in the contents of the paper that so his private cupidity might be excited and he not be driven by necessity to play the rle of the incorruptible the instant he looked up my whole heart expanded the prisoner he said acquits his conscience of a matter affecting the state i must call upon you m le prsident to grant for the present a remand oh mon dieu but the shamelessness of this avarice i believe the scoundrel would have blushed to be discovered in nothing but an act of mercy the prisoner is remanded to close confinement in the convent of st plagie were the words that dismissed me from the court and i swear fouquiertinvilles large eyes followed me quite lovingly as i was marched away chapter xiii the red cart at so early an hour was my trial in the personal and suffering sense brought to a conclusion that midday was not yet struck when my guards delivered me over to the authorities at st plagiea onetime communaut de filles in the faubourg of st victor and since appropriated ostensibly to the incarceration of debtors my arrival by grace of fortune was most happily timed and indeed the persistency with which throughout the long period of my difficulties this capricious coureuse amongst goddesses converted for my benefit accident into opportuneness offered some excuse to me for remaining in conceit with myself now i was taken in charge by a single turnkeythe others being occupied with their dinnerand conducted by him to the jailers room to undergo that rapiotage or stripping for concealed properties the general abuse of whichespecially where women were in questionwas a scandal even in those days of shameless brutality as he pushed me into the little illlighted chamber and closed the door hurriedly upon us i noticed that the mans hands shook and that his face was clammy with a leaden perspiration he made no offer to overhaul me but instead he clutched me by the elbow and looked in a halfscared halftriumphant manner into my face pay attention he said in a quick forced whisper thy arrival accommodates itself to circumstancemost admirably citizen it accommodates itself i that was to expect am here alone to receive thee it is far better so than that i should be driven to visit thee in thy cell i foresee a call upon my gratitude i said steadily regarding him that is at your service citizen jailer when you shall condescend to enlighten me as to its direction i want none of it he replied it is my own to another that procures thee this favour what other and what favour as to the firsten bon franais i will not tell thee for the secondbehold it with the words he whipt out from under his blouse a thin strong file a little vessel of oil and a dab of some bluecoloured mastic in paperand these he pressed upon me hide them about thy personhide them he muttered in a fearful voice and take all that i shall say in a breath he glanced over his shoulder at the closed door he was a blotched and flaccid creature with the staring dry hair of the tippler but with very human eyes his fingers closed upon my arm as if for support to their trembling cell thirteenon the first floor he said that is whither i shall convey thee ask no questions hast thou them all tightallezvous en mon ami a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse but ah thou must needs be talking cement with the putty then and rub the filings over the marks i was not born yesterday it is not that i would know sst at nine by the convent clock be ready to drop silently into the cart that shall pass beneath thy window never mind what thou hitst on a falling man does not despise a dunghill i hesitated seeking to read this patriots soul was this all a snare to clinch my damnation pooh if i had ever fancied tinville hunted for the shadow of a pretext this mornings experience should have disabused me of the fallacy who commissions thee i said one to whom i owe a measure of gratitude but not i from this timeyes he pushed at me to go before him at least i said acquaint me if it is the same that sent the letter i know nothing of any letter san dieu i begin to regret my complaisance this fellow will strangle us all with his long tongue but for thyself my friend oh nom de dieu i have no fear if thou wilt be discreetand grateful and this tooland the rapiotage listen then the thief that follows a thief finds little by the road we are under no obligation to search a prisoner remanded from another prison impulsively i wrung the hand of the dear sententious i looked into his eyes the goddess of reason disown thee i said thou shalt never be acolyte to a harlotand iif all goes well i will remember and what is thy name good fellow m un tel said he and added bah shall not thy ignorance of it be in a measure our safeguard true said i and take me away then i cannot get to work too soon he opened the door peeped out and beckoned me all is well he whispered the coast is clear as he drove me with harsh gestures across a yard a turnkey standing at a door and twirling a toothpick in his mouth hailed him strenuously what perquisites then comrade bah cried my fellow i have not looked he is a bone of cabochons picking with what a conflict of emotions i set to worktentatively at first then seeing how noiselessly the file ran in its oiled groove with a concentration of vigourupon the bars of my window it is not difficult to imagine so hard i wrought that for hours i scarce gave heed to my growling hunger or attention to my surroundings as to the latter indeed i was by this time sensibly inured to the conditions of confinement and found little in my cell when i came to examine it to distinguish it from others i had inhabited a bench a pitcher a flattened mess of straw here and there about the stone flags marks as if some frantic beast had sought to undermine himself a passage to freedom here and there engraved with a nail or the tooth of a comb on the plaster coating of the walls ciphers initials passionate appeals to heaven or blasphemous indecencies unnameable in one spot a forlorn cry libert quand cesserastu dtre un vain mot in another in feminine characters the poor little utterance on nous dit que nous sortirons demain made so pathetic by the later supplement underscored vain espoirwith all these or their like was i grievously familiarresigned not hardened to them i am sure the window at which i stood looked across a littlefrequented passagethe puit dermiteupon a blank wall and was terminated with a pretty broad sill of stone that screened my operations from casual wayfarers in the street below once peering forth as i could with my face pressed to the bars i found myself to be situated so indifferent high as that free of the grate i might drop to the pavement without incurring risk of severer damage than a fractured leg or ankle perhaps obviously every point had been considered in this trifling matter of my escape by whom by him that had put me that pawn up my sleeve in the palais de justice well the pawn had checked the king it appeared and now it must content me to continue the game with a handkerchief over my eyes like the great m philidor by two oclock having cut through a couple of the bars close by their junction with the sill so that a vigorous pull at both would open a passage for me large enough to squeeze through i was absorbed in the careful process of cementing and concealing the evidences of my work when i heard a sound behind me and twisted myself about with a choke of terror but it was my friendly jailer come with a trencher of broken scraps for the famished animal in the cage corps de christ he muttered his face white and scaredbut here is an admirable precaution what if i had been fouquiertinville himself then you made no noise par exemple i can shoot a hundredweight of bolts it seems so as not to wake a weasel i made no noise to deaf ears but for thyself monsieurhe that would steal corn must be careful his sack has no holes in it and now ill wager thoust dusted thy glittering filings out into the sunbeams and a sentry with pistols and a long musket pacing the cobbles down there soyez tranquille i have all here in my pocket he put down the platter shrugged his shoulders and came on tiptoe to the window well it is excellent he whispered grudginglyif only thy caution matched thy skill then he came close up to me i have news he muttered all is in preparation it needs only that thou playst thy part silently and surely a moments decision and the game is thine but the sentry sayst thou he will be withdrawn what is it not the eve of the dcadi tonight the wineshops tomorrow full suburbs and an empty paris but for thee the public accuser with his questions and why should he not visit me today rest assured he hath a double baking to occupy him a noise sounded in the corridor the man put his finger to his lips pointed significantly at the remainder litter about the sill stole to the door jangled his keys viciously and bellowed at me thou shalt have that or nothing saint sacrement but the dainty bellies of these upstartsand off he went slamming the door after him and grumbling till he was out of hearing excellent nameless one i cried to myself and so having most scrupulously removed every trace of my work i fell while attacking with appetite the meal left for me into a sort of luminous meditation upon the alluring prospect half opened out to my vision and whence in the name of god i marvelled issues this unknown influence that thus exerts itself on my behalf and by what process of gratitude can my jailer in these days of a general repudiation of obligations have attached himself to a cause that on the face of it seems a purely quixotic one then oh merciful heaven i thought can it be possible that set in the far haze of a narrow vista of hope an imageto whose wistful absorption into the paradise of dreams i have sought to discipline myselfyet yearns to and beckons me from the standpoint of its own material sweetness i see the smile on its mouth the lift of its arms i hear the little cry of welcome wafted to me my god the cry all in an instant some shock of association seemed to stun my brain the crythe single cry that had issued upon my condemnation in the hall of justice had it not been the very echo of that i had once heard uttered by a poor swineherd fallen into the hands of savages i got to my feet in agitation now suddenly it was borne to me that from the moment of issue of that little incisive wail a formless wonder had been germinating in my soul carinne present at my trialno no it was impossibleunless citizen the patriots in this corridor send thee greeting i started as if a bullet had flown past my ear the voice seemed to come from the next cell i swept the cobwebs from my forehead a thousand thanks i cried they have dreamt that the ass cursed the thoroughbred for the niceness of his palate went on the voice and most heartily they commiserate thee there followed a faint receding sound like laughter and the clapping of hands i had no idea what to say but the voice relieved me of the embarrassment may i ask the citizens name i am the comte de la muette allons doncand the information it seemed was passed from cell to cell monsieur then came the voice we of the community of the eremites of st plagie offer thee our most sympathetic welcome and invite thee to enrol thyself a member of our society permit me the president by name marino to have the honour of proposing thee for election by all means and what excludes monsieur le prsident dune haleine i mention it to monsieur as a matter of form to have been a false witness or a forger of assignats then am i eligible surely monsieur how could one conceive it otherwise and it remains only to askagain as a matter of formthy profession thy abode and the cause of thy arrest very well my profession is one of attachment to a beautiful lady i live i dare to believe in her heart and for my arrest it was because in these days of equality i sought to remain master of myself my answer was passed down the line it elicited i have the gratification to confess a full measure of applause i have the honour to inform m le comte said the president that he is duly elected to the privileges of the society i send him a fraternal embrace my inclination jumped with the humour of the thing it was thus that these unfortunates condemned to solitary confinement had conceived a method of relieving the deadly tedium of their lot thus they passed to one another straws of information gleaned from turnkeys or from prisoners newly arrived and in order to the confusion of any guard that might overhear them they studied in their intercommunications to speak figuratively to convey a fact through a fable or at the least to refer their statements to dreams that they had dreamt at the same time they formed a society rigidly exclusive admitted rascals imprisoned in the corridor they would by no means condescend to notice i had an example of this once during the afternoon when the whole place echoed with phantom merriment over a jest uttered by a member m le comte cried a voice from the opposite row i could tell thee a better tale than that before the speaker could follow up his words the president hammered at my wall i beseech thee do not answer the fellow he said it is a rogue that was suborned in the most pitiful case of the st amaranthe monsieur monsieur exclaimed the accused it is a slander and a lie and how wouldst thou pick thy words with thy shoulder bubbling and hissing under the brandingiron as i would pick nettles i said i beseech thee cried again my neighbour the president in a warning voice this man can boast no claim to thy attention the poor rascal cried out it is inhuman i perish for a word of sympathy i would have given it him but his protests were laughed into silence he yelled in furious retort his rage was overcrowed and drifted into sullenness i dreamt i belaboured a drum said the president and it burst under my hands truly i did not regret the distraction this whimsical society afforded me left to myself the fever of my mind would have corroded my very reason i think to have been condemned to face those hours of tension indescribable with no company but that of my own thoughts would have proved such an ordeal as i felt would have gone far to render me nerveless at the critical moment so responding to the dig of circumstance in my ribs i abandoned myself to frolic and almost in the end lapsed into the other extreme of hysteria but about five oclock closing in from the far end of the corridor a swift ominous silence succeeded the jangle and i was immediately aware of heavy footsteps treading the cemented floor of the passage and following upon these the harsh snap of locks and the rumbling of a deep voice follow me de la chatire the words were the signal for a shrilling chorus of soundswhoops catcalls verberant renderings of a whole farmyard of demoniac animals miau miau mile thou art caught in thine own springe they will ask thee one of thy nine lives mile ahbah if he pleads as he reasons upsidedown they will only cut off his feet plead thy poor sick virtue mile no no that were one coup de tte that shall procure him another what need to lie when the truth will serve plead thy lost virtue mile and the jury will love thee taisezvous donc roared a jailer he was answered by a shriek of laughter in the midst of the noise i heard the door of my neighbouring cell flung open and marino summoned forth as the party retreated m le prsident m le prsident shouted a voiceart thou going without a word but do not i beseech thee in the pride of thy promotion neglect to nominate thy successor lamarelle then answered the poor fellow in a voice that he tried vainly to control he was led away the babble boiled over and simmered down in a very few moments a tense quiet had succeeded the uproar thisdue partly to the reaction from excitement partly to the fact that jailers were loitering at handwrought in me presently a mood of overbearing depression i durst give no rein to my hopes or to my apprehensions lest getting the bit between their teeth they should fairly run away with my reason the prospect of another four hours of this mindless inactionhours of which every second seemed to be marked off by the tick of a nervewas a deplorable one indeed i tramped ceaselessly to and fro in my cage humming to myself and assuming the habit of a philosophy that fitted me about as well as dantons breeches would have done i grimaced to my own reflections like a coquette to her mirror i suffered from my affectation of selfcontainment as severely as though i were a tightlaced femme la mode weeping to hear a tale of pity the convent clock moving somewhere with a thunderous click as if it were the very doyen of deathwatches chimed the dusk upon me in reluctant quarters ghostly emanations seemed to rise from the stones of my cell sorrowful shapes of the lost and the hopeless to lean sobbing in its corners sometimes i could have fancied i heard a thin scratching on the walls about me as if the returned spectres of despair were blindly tracing with a finger the characters they had themselves engraved thereon sometimes as i wheeled to view of the dull square of the window a formless shadow set against it would appear to drop hurriedly and fold upon itself like a bat by the time at last that despite my resolves i was worked up to a state of agitation quite pitiful some little relief of distraction was afforded me by the entrance into my cell of a stranger turnkey with some coarse food on a plate in his one hand and in the other a great can of water from which he replenished my pitcher during the half minute he was with me a shag beast of a dog kept guard at the door fall to then growled the man if thou hast the stomach for anything less dainty than fat pullets and butter in effect i had none for anything yet i thought it the sensible policy to take up the plate when the fellow was withdrawn and munch away the drawling minutes lest i should spend them in eating out my heart other than this rascal no soul came near me i had had it seemed my full warningmy complete instructions yet lacking reassurance during this long trial of suspense i came to feel as if all affecting my escape must be a chimeraa fancy bred of the delirium that precedes death well as my friendly huissier might have said time flies however strong the headwind and at length the quarters clanged themselves into that one of them that was the prelude to my most momentous adventure and immediately thereon god absolve me for the inconsistency a frantic revulsion of feeling set in so that i would have given all but my chance of escape to postpone the act of it indefinite hours now i heard the throb of the seconds with a terror that was like an acute accent to my agony of suspense it grewit waxed monstrous and intolerable i must lose myself in some physical exertion if i would preserve my reason suddenly a nightmare thought faced me what if when the time came the cut bars should remain stubborn to my efforts to bend them what if i had neglected to completely sever either or both and that while i madly wrought to remedy my error the moment should pass and with it the means to my deliverance sweating panting in a new reaction to the frenzy for liberty i sprang to the window gripped the bars and with all my force dragged them towards me they parted at the cuts and yielded readily a sideway push to each and there would freedom gape at me in the very instant of settling my shoulder to the charge i was aware of a sound at my cell doorthe cautious groping of wards in a lock with a suppressed gasp i came round with my back to the telltale grating and stood like a discovered murderer a lance of dull light split the blackness perpendicularly open again when i tap said a little voicethat cracked like thunder in my brain neverthelessand the light closed upon itself god of all ironythe little voicethe little dulcet undertone that had cried pattepelu upon me in the hall of justice so the turnkey had miscalculated or had been misinformed and m laccusateur public would not postpone the verbal satisfaction of his cupidity to the dcadi le limier rencontrait i was bayed into a corner and my wit must measure itself against a double row of teeth for an instant a mad resentment against fate for the infernal wantonness of its cruelty blazed up in my breast so that i could scarce restrain myself from bounding upon my enemy with yells of fury then reasonset contained and determinedwas restored to me and i stood taut as a bowstring and as vicious a moment or two passed in silence i could make out a dusky undefined heap by the door in the dark all cats are grey at length who is there i said quietly the figure advanced a pace or two speak small my friend it said as if thou wert the very voice of conscience this time there was no doubt i ground my teeth as i answered of thy conscience monsieur then should i thunder in thy ears like a bursting shell what is this said he taking a backward step on my honour i could not have told him i felt only to myself that if this man baulked me of my liberty i should kill him with my hands but doubtless indignation was my bad counsellor how he muttered with a menacing devil in his voice does the fool know me i broke into wicked laughter hear the unconscious humorist i criedand the cry seemed to reel in my throat for on the instant dull and fateful clanged the first note of the hour now god knows what had urged me to this insanity of defiance when it was obvious that my best hope lay in throwing a sop of lies to my cerberus god knows i say and to him i leave the explanation yet having fallen upon this course i can assert that not once during the day had i felt in such good savour with myself he came forward again with a raging malediction thy pledge he hissed the paperthe treasure gods name dost thou know who it is thou triflest with i heard the rumble of wheels over the stones down below my very soul seemed to rock as if it were launched on waves of air the wheels stopped listen i said in a last desperation it was a ruse a lie to gain time i know of no treasure nor if i did would i acquaint thee of its hidingplace a terrible silence succeeded i stood with clinched hands had i heard the cart move away again i should have thrown myself upon this demon and sought to strangle him then oh my god oh my god he said twice in a dreadful strained voice and that was all suddenly he made a swift movement towards me i stood rigid still with my back to the damning grate but come within a foot of me he as suddenly wheeled and went to the door open gamache he whispered like a man winded and tapped on the oak openi have something to say to thee in another moment i was alone i turned and in a frenzy of haste drove the bars right and left with all my force like a veritable ape of destiny i leapt to the sill and looked down a white face stared up at me the owner of it was already in the act of gathering his reins together i heard a soft tremulous ouf issue from his lips and on the breath of it i dropped and alighted with a thud upon something that squelched beneath my weight as i got to my knees he on the drivingboard was already whipping his horses to a canter quick quick he said come up and sit here beside me i managed to do so though the cargo we carried gave perilous foothold then at once i turned and regarded my preserver saints in heaven i whispered crpin he was a very sansculotte and his face and eyebrows were darkened but i knew him well he said i am no rogue of a talma to act a part but what in gods name delayed thee fouquiertinville his jaw dropped at me si fait vraiment i said and gave him the facts he shivered as i spoke the instant i was done get under the canvas said he in a terrible voice there will be hueandcry and if i am followed we are both lost get under the canvas and endure what thou canst not cure my god the frightfulness of that journey of the company i lay with we drove as i gathered by the lessfrequented streets and reached the barrier of st jacques by way of the rue de biron here for the first time we were stopped halte l bawled a tipsy voice what goods to declare friend content thyself i heard crpin answer they bear the government mark how then carrier peep under the carttail and thou shalt see the gendarme lifted a corner of the canvas with his swordpoint a wedge of light entered and amazed my panicstricken eyes il est bon l chuckled the fellow and withdrew his sword he had noticed nothing of me but as we whipped to a start he made a playful cut at the canvas with his weapon the blade touched my thigh inflicting a slight fleshwound and i could not forbear a spasmodic jerk of pain at this he cried out hol h here is a dead frog that kicks and came scuttling after us now i gave myself up for lost but at the moment a frolicsome comrade hooked the runners ankle with a stick and brought the man heavily to the ground there followed a shout a curse of fury andfortune it appeared had again intervened on my behalf silence succeeded for all but the long monotonous jolting and pitching over savage ground at length crpin pulled up his horses and leaning back from his seat tossed open a flap of the canvas come then he said in a queer voice we have won clear by the grace of heaven i wallowed faint and nauseated from my horrible refuge sick and in pain of mind and body i crept to a seat beside my companion we were on a dark and desolate waste a little moon lay low in the sky behind us the enceinte of the city twinkled with goblin lights and these i said weakly signifying our dreadful load whither dost thou carry them crpin whither i carry thee monsieur le comteto the quarries under the plain of montrouge to unconsecrated ground what would you the yards are glutted the madeleine bulges like a piecrust at last by force of necessity we consecrate this the natural cemetery of the city dug by itself to the citys patron saint la guillotine tell me my preserver and as god shall quit thee also my friendyou received my letter else why art thou here but thou hast done me an incalculable wrong and an incalculable benefit oh monsieur do i not atone to me yes let that pass then but even there i would not have thee underrate my service have i not to save thee annihilated time called in a debt of gratitude that i kept in reversion for my own needs suborned the very hangmans carter that i might help thee in thy extremity and all this is due to thee assuredlyand for what reason because in total ignorance of thy claim to it i took a fancy to a sweet face now i think you will acknowledge m le comte that the revolution for all its excesses is capable of producing a gentleman of honour who knows how to make reparation truly this is no small thing that you have done truly i think thou mightst apply superlatives to it without extravagance to outwit and baulk the public accuserthe catfish of the committee of safetydame is there a hole in all paris too small to admit his tentacles but i tell thee monsieur i am already in the prison of my own holy namesake i would kiss thy hands but what now my letter referred to other than myself he turned and i thought looked at me oddly in these days what safer refuge for a woman than prison he said provided she hath a friend at court understand monsieur i have found mademoiselle de lge respectable lodgings that is all where you hold her as lovelace held the estimable clarisse crpin i cannot accept my life on these terms the words jerked on my lips as the waggon was brought to a stand with a suddenness that made the harness rattle a tall figure that seemed to have sprung out of the earth stood at the horses heads gusman said my companion quietly this is citizen thibaut whom you are to conduct to the secret lodging hurry then thibaut i got with some difficulty to the ground and you said i i go yet a mile to deliver my goods we will discuss this matter further bien entendu on my return he flogged his cattle to an immediate canter leaving me in all bewilderment alone with the stranger on every side about us it seemed stretched a melancholy wastea natural graveyard sown with uncouth slabs of stone the wind swayed the grasses as if they were foam on black water the tide of night murmured in innumerable gulfs of darkness come then muttered the figure and seized my hand we walked twenty cautious paces i felt the clutch of brambles at my clothes suddenly he put his arm about me and as we moved forcibly bent down my head and shoulders at once i was conscious of a confined atmospheredamp earthy indescribable it thickenedgrew closer and infinitely closer as we advanced now i could walk upright but my left shoulder rasped ever against solid rock the blackness of utter negation was terrible the cabined air an oppression that one almost felt it possible to lift from ones head like an iron morion for miles i could have fancied we thridded this infernal tunnel before the least little blur of light spread itself like salve on my aching vision then suddenly like a midnight glowworm the blur revealed itself a fair luminous anther of fire in a nest of raysand was a taper burning on the wall of a narrow chamber or excavation set in the heart of the bedstone voil ton ressui exclaimed my sardonic guide and without another word he turned and left me i stood a moment confounded then with a shrug of my shoulders walked into the little cellar and paused again in astonishment from a stone ledge on which it had been lying it seemed prostrate a figure lifted itself and standing with its back to me swept the long hair from its eyes i stared i choked i held out my arms as if in supplication mon dieu mon dieu i criedif it is not carinne let me die chapter xiv the quarries of montrouge she turned the dear figure i heard her breath catch as she leaned forward and gazed at me her hair was all tumbled abroad her sweet scared eyes looked out of a thicket of it like little frightened birds from a copse she took a hurried step or two in my direction then cried cest un coup du ciel and threw up her hands and pressed them to her face i dropped my yearning arms a needle of ice pierced my heart a judgment of heaven i cried sorrowfully the sound of my voice seemed like the very stroke of a thyrsus on her shoulders she broke into an agitated walkpacing to and fro in front of mewringing her hands and clasping them thus to her temples her shadow fled before or after her like a coaxing child suddenly to my amazement she darted upon me and seized and shook me in a little fury of passion prends cela prends cela prends cela she cried and then as suddenly she released me and ran back to her ledge and flung herself facedownwards thereon sobbing as if her heart would break shocked and astounded beyond measure i followed and stood over her mademoiselle de lge i said miserablyof what am i guilty of everythingof nothing perhaps it is i that am to blame she cried in a muffled voice what have i done she sat up weeping and pressed the pain from her forehead oh monsieur it is not a little thing to pass twelve hours in the most terrible lonelinessin the most terrible anxiety i do not understand you do not indeedthe feelings of othersthe wisdom of discretion mademoiselle i exclaimed in all patience she sat with her palms resting upon the ledge she looked up at me defiantly though she yet fought with her sobs it was doubtless a fine thing in your eyes this morning she said to throw scorn to that wretch who could have destroyed you with a word i felt my breath come quickly that wretch i whisperedthis morning it was what i said monsieurthe loupgarou of the salle de la libert but where one attaches any responsibility to life one should learn to distinguish between bravado and courage i think i must have turned very pale for a sudden concern came into her face mademoiselle i said will persist in giving me the best reason for holding life cheaplythat i cannot it seems find favour with her was it then monsieur that you yourself were your only consideration oh give me at least the indulgence i cried to retort upon an insolent that insults me grand dieu she said mockingly but what a perverted heroism and must a mans duty be always first towards his dignity and afterwards a long way she broke off panting and tapping her foot on the ground i looked at her all mazed and dumfoundered and afterwards i repeated she would not continue a little silence succeeded mademoiselle i said at length sadlylet me speak out what is in my heart and have done with it that little cry of pity and of protest that i heard uttered this morning when sentence was demanded upon me in the palais de justice and that i must needs now associate with this new dear knowledge of your freedomif i have put upon it an unwarrantable construction something beyond the mere expression of a womans sympathy with the unfortunateyou will i am sure extend that sympathy to my blindness the realisation of which must in itself prove my heavy punishment if also i have dared to translate the anxiety you have by your own showing suffered here in this savage burrow into a sentiment more profound than that of simple concern for an oldtime comrade you will spare my presumption will you not the bitterness of a rebuke it shall not be needed believe me my very love she interrupted me rising to her feet white and peremptory not for me monsieurnot for me and for my associationsthey shall never be of that word with deceit deceit but is it not so have you not approached my confidence in a false guise under a false name oh she stamped her foot again cannot you see how my condescension to the citizen thibaut is stultified by this new knowledge of his rank how to favour now what i had hitherto held at armslength would be to place myself in the worst regard of snobbishness no mademoisellei confess that i cannotbut then i journeyed hither in the national hearse i do not understand why only that there one finds a ragpickers head clapt upon a monseigneurs neck in the fraternity that is decreed to level all distinctions what is the advantage of a name then when one is denied a tombstone ah she cried you seek to disarm me with levity i recognise your habit of tolerant contempt for the mental equipment of my sex it does not become you monsieurbut what does it matter i know already your opinion of me and how compound it is of disdain and disgust i am soulless and cruel and capriciousperhaps illfavoured also but there i think you pronounce me inoffensive or something less but i would have you say monsieurwhat was lepelletier to me i should have sickened rather to break bread with my unclewhom heaven induce to the shame of repentance and i was ill that night so that even you might have softened in your judgment of me i stood amazed at the vehemence of her speech at the rapidity of inconsequence with which she pelted me with any chance missile that came to her hand it was evident the poor child was overwrought to a degree and i was fixed helpless between my passionate desire to reassure and comfort her and my sense of her repudiation of my right to do so now it happened that where words would have availed little a mute appealthe manner of which it was beyond my power to controlwas to serve the best purposes of reconciliation for suddenly as i dwelt bewildered upon the wet flashing of carinnes eyes emotion and fatigue coupled with the sick pain of my wound so wrought upon me that the vault went reeling and i with it i heard her cry out felt her clutch meand then there was sense for little but exhaustion in my drugged brain i am on the floor carinne on the floor mon ami i am not so little a weight you see you tried to support me to the bench and failedfor i know but you were a deadweight not dead yet chattemite only i think i am dying no no little thibaut dieu ne plaise you will not be so wicked and what makes you think so i am so near heaven do you mean me but i burn kiss me then and give me of your fire but if you were to recover i would return it it is infamous you presume upon my tenderness that is all for your cruel wound yet i do not think you are much hurt not now with your hand upon my heart tell me carinneit was jacques crpin that brought you here that had me conveyed hither by his deputy gusman it was this morning after your trial he had had me released from prisonle pcheur pnitent god had moved him to remorse it seemed and some unknownperhaps one that had overheard us in la forceto knowledge of our friendshipyours and mine he procured me my passport accompanied me beyond the barrier denfer committed me to the keeping of this deadman of the quarries he swore he would play his life against yourswould win you to me here or perish in the attempt judge then you of my waiting torturemy anguish of expectation in this solitude would win me to you and you desired this thing oh ma mie ma mie how then could you welcome me as you did i do not know and deny and abuse me and give me such pain i do not know for you love me very dearly carinne i am dying i do not believe you that trick shall not serve a second time and what are we to do now carinne thou must be asking thyself that question said a voicecrpinsthat clanged suddenly in the vaulted labyrinth the man himself stood looking down upon us beside him the gaunt figure of my guide held aloft a flambeau that talked with a resinous sputter its flare reddened the auburn curls of the sectional president and informed his dissolute face with a radiance that was like an inner consciousness of nobility my task ends here he said quietly and shall we cry quits m le comte i lay on the floor my head in carinnes lap citizen crpin i said thou hast acquitted thyself like a gentleman and a man of courage i would not wish for thy sake that the risk had been less i would not for ours know that it hath involved thee in the toils we are all in the toils nowadays said he and happy the lion that can find a mouse for his friend to the extent of my power i have done yet i warn thee thou art not out of the wood if the weasel wakes to the manner of his outwitting not a river of blood shall divert him from the scent till he has run thee downthee and me also oh i desire thee do not misapprehend the importance of my service carinne looked up she made an involuntary gesture with her hands this dear child in her sweet surrender became the archetype of womanhood monsieur she said softly you have stood aside so honourably you have made us so greatly your debtors that you will not now stultify your own selfsacrifice by imposing upon us a heritage of remorse if you are in such danger why not remain here with us he did not answer for some moments but he shook his head very slightly as he gazed down on us as to life he said presently my compact is with the senses there is a higher ideal to reach to no doubt but mordi i confess for myself i cannot feel the epicure and play the ascetic to continue in love with virtue one must take it only like opium in occasional doses an habitual indulgence in it degrades the picturesqueness of its own early evoking perhaps it should be ethically grateful to me to remain here to contemplate the fruit of my generosity ripening for anothers picking perhaps the guillotine is awaiting me in paris well mademoiselle of the two evils i prefer the latter here to feed on my own selfrighteousness would be to starve at the end of a day there the glory of doing of directing of enjoying will soon woo me from memory of a sentiment that was no more part of my real self than the mistletoe is part of the harsh trunk it beautifies for death i do not fear it if it will come to me passionately like a mistress monsieur ah mademoiselle believe me that i can offer no higher testimony to your worth than the assurance that i have for six months lost myself in you i looked at this exwaiter in marvel his dishes could never have shown a finer polish than his manners moreover in what intervals of supplying food to others had he sat himself down to his own feast of reason one was accustomed in those days to hear coalheavers discussing diderot but not in the language of diderot i gazed on his face and thought i saw in it a neutral ground whereon a beast and an angel hobnobbed in the intervals of combat beside him the torchbearersilent melancholy astringentheld his brand aloft motionless as if his arm were a sconce of iron you are hurt monsieur said crpin suddenly referring to me it is nothinga bite a scratch an excuse for a pillow ah he fetched a flask from his pocket and uncorked itthis is ethereal cream of minta liqueur i affect in that it reminds me of lambs and innocenceand shepherdesses let us pledge one another like good friends at parting and it will confirm thy cure monsieur so happily begun mademoiselle he said pleadingly and offered it to carinne she touched it with her lipsi more effectively with mine crpin cried trinquons and taking a lusty pull handed the flask to gusman who drained it now said he we are united by a bond the sweetest in the worldthe sympathy of the palate we have made of ourselves a little rosary of wine beads he put his hand lightly on gusmans shoulder this austerity he saidthis bailly of the municipality of the deadi have purchased ye his favour with the one bribe to which he is susceptible kings might offer him their crowns easy maids their honour they should no more draw him from his reserve than alexander drew diogenes from his tub but there is a sductrice to his integrity and the name of it is right hollands my faith i would not swear my fidelity to such a frowzy mistress but taste is a matter of temperament is it not so jacques while the keg lasts i will hold the safety of thy friends in pawn to thee so replied the spectral figurea voice a phantomthe very enigma of this charnel city of echoes the liqueur had revived and comforted me amazingly i raised myself on my elbow ah i cried if good intentions could find favour with thee i would make thy keg a kilderkin citizen gusman the figure stood mute like a man of bronze crpin laughed recklessly he is the fast warden of these old catacombs he saidthe undying worm and sole master of their intricacies himself hath tunnelled them under the ground i believe like the tanyard grub that bores into poplartrees silence and secrecy are his familiars but i tell thee monsieur he will absorb hollands till he drips with it as the roofs of his own quarries drip with water the keg once drained andif thou renewst it nothe will sell thee for a single measure of schnapps is it not so jacques it is so said the figure in a deep indifferent voice crpin laughed again then suddenly turned grave and leaned down towards me harkee m le comte he said is thy pocket well lined with good intentions m le prsident he nodded and fetching a little bag of skin out of his breast forced it into my hand it is all i can spare he said and with that i must acquit my conscience of the matter if ever i live to repay thee good fellow ah bah monsieur i owe thee for the mdoc and nowescape if thou seest the way open this strange creature will be thy bondslave while the keg runs afterwardseh bien cest toi la balle for food thou must do as others heretake toll of the country carts as they journey to the barriers they will not provide thee with sweetbreads in wine butwell monsieur there are fifty ways after all of cooking a cabbage i rose with difficulty to my feet carinne still seated on the floor held her hand in mine something like a gentle quinsy in my throat embarrassed my speech good citizen i muttered crpin made a gesture with his hand and backed in a hurry i desire no expression of gratitude he said loudly good citizen i repeated thou wouldst not rebuke our selfishness by denying us thy most faithful debtors the privilege claimed by even a minor actor in this escapade of whom dost thou speak of a turnkey at st plagies mordi i drenched him once for the colicthat is all the fool fancied he had swallowed an eft that was devouring his entrails he cried portez vous bien and a quick emotion as of physical pain flickered over his face like a breath of air over hot coals carinne was on her feet in a moment had gone swiftly to him and had taken his hand monsieur she said in a wet voice it is true that honour like sweet vines may shoot from beds of corruption god forbid that i pass judgment on that which influences the ways of men but onlybut only monsieur i hope you may live very long and may take comfort from the thought of the insignificance of the subject of your so great sacrifice she drooped her dear head the other looked at her with an intense gaze but nevertheless he said quietly it was the letter of m le comte of my honoured father epicurus that moved me to the sacrifice that is great as you say i never realised how great till this moment yetah mademoiselle i would not sanctify it out of the category of human passions by pretending that i was induced to it by any sentiment of selfrenunciation thyself should not have persuaded me to spare theenor anything less may be than an appeal from my preceptor in the metaphysics of the senses i take no shame to say so i am not a traitor to my creed and it would offend me to be called a puritan he put the girls hand gently away from him still he said i may not deem myself worthy to touch this flower with my lips and at that he turned and went from us summoning gusman to accompany him and crying as he vanished good luck and forgetfulness to all so disappeared from our lives this singular man who persisted to the very last in lashing me with the thong of my own twisting we never saw him again once only we heard of him as the flash of the retreating torch glimmered into attenuation carinne returned to me and sat down at my side little thibaut she said softly he designed me so great a wrong that i know not where to place him in my memory with the abortive children of thy fancy carinne amongst the thoughts that are ignorant of the good in themselves she sighed and so it was thou wast his informer as to our friendship and why didst thou write jeanlouis to urge him by our one time intimacy to cease his persecution of a beautiful and most innocent lady i did not know i did not know she cried and suddenly her arms were round my neck and i lay in a nest of love oh i am glad to be pretty for the sake of the little thibaut that saved me from barbarous men and from myself and alas from my uncle little thibaut did i hurt when i beat thee beat me then till i cry with the pain she sobbed and laughed and held my face against her bosom in the midst the candle on the wall dropped like a meteor and instantly we were immured in a very crypt of darkness she cried in a terrified voice oh mon dieu hold me or i sink and committed herself shuddering to my embrace the blackness was blind horrible beyond reason we could only shut our eyes and whisper to one another expecting and hoping for gusmans return but he came no more that night and byandby carinne slept in my arms the glare of torchlight on my face brought me to my senses that sombre deadman as carinne called him stood above usvisionless without movement it seemeda lurid genii presented in a swirling drift of smoke he might never have moved from the spot since we had last seen him there why dost thou wake us good friend said i hast thou a midnight service for the dead here it is high morning said he in a voice like a funeral bell morning i sat up in amazement truly i had not thought of it we had slept the clock round but there was no day in this hideous and melancholy underworld i looked down at my companion she had slipped from my hold of her and lay across my knees her hair curled low on her forehead her eyelids were misted with a faint blue shadow like the sheaths of hyacinth buds before they open her lips were a little parted as love had left them mon dieu there is no sight so tender and so pathetic as that of a fair child asleep and what was carinne but a child in an access of emotion i bent and softly touched the lips with mine this infant so brave and so forlorn whose head should have been pillowed on flowers whose attendants should have been the lady fairies she is very pretty said the deadman ha ha i cried hast thou found it out there shall spring a blossom for thee yet old gusman in this lifeless city of thine he twirled his torch for the first time so that it spouted fire like a handgrenade blossoms he barked but thou shalt know i have my garden walks down herebowers of mildew parterres of fine rank funguses royal worms even that have battened for centuries on the seed of men he crooked his knees so that he might stare into my face not altogether a city of the dead said he is it peopled with ghosts then very thickly without doubt thou shalt see them swarm like maggots in its streets i shrugged my shoulders the creature stood erect once more and made a comprehensive gesture this he saidyou must not judge by this it is the holy of holies to which none has access but the high priest of the catacombsand such as he favours and what in a rude age keeps it sacred he swept his torch right and left look then said he we lay in a vaulted chamber hewn out of the rock on all sides i fancied i caught dim vision of the mouths of innumerable low tunnels that exhaled a mist of profound night knowledge exclaimed the fearful man the agelong lore of one that hath learnt his every footstep in this maze of oubliettes there are beaten tracks here and there here and there a fool has been known to leave them it may be days or weeks before i happen across his bodythe eyes slipping forward of their lids his mouth puckered out of shape from sucking and gnawing at the knuckles of his hands it is terrible and none comes hither but thou i and the beasts of blood that must not be denied when they hunt i lead therefore it is well to win my favour carinne hurriedly raised herself she threw her arms about me oh my husband she cried take me where i may see the sweet daylight if only for a moment i had thought the poor child slept hush i murmured citizen gusman is going to show us his township by interminable corridors so intricate that one would have thought their excavators must have lain down to die each at the limit of his boring from sheer despair of ever finding their way to the open again we followed the flare of the torch our eyes smarting in its smoke our arms most fervently linked carinnes to mine in inseparable devotion now and again i would hear my poor little friend whisper light light as if her very heart were starving and then i would draw her face to mine and cry confidently it is coming ma mie still on we went over the uneven ground thridding an endless labyrinth of death oppressed weighed upon hustled by inhuman walls breathing and exhaling the thin black fluid that is the atmosphere of the disembodied sometimes as if it crouched beneath a stroke the flame of the torch would dip and shrink under a current of gas then leap jocund again when the peril was swept by sometimes the tinkle of falling water would gladden our ears as with a memory of ancient happiness and passing on in a moment we should be bedewed with spray and catch a glimpse in the glare of a very dropping well of fire at length at the turning of a corridor gusman called us to a halt he hollowed his left hand to his mouth holleeehhh he yelled like a very lutin llllleeehleeehleeeh was hooted and jangled back in a tumbling torrent of sound that seemed to issue from the throat of a passage facing us and to shake the very roofs with merriment involuntarily we shrunk against the wall as if to allow space to the impetuous rush we foresaw mon dieu the strange illusion only the swarming imps of echoes summoned to the master call came hurrying forth leaping and falling over one another fighting and struggling clanging with reverberant laughter distributing themselves disappearing down this or that corridor shouting over their shoulders as they fledfaint faintertill silence settled down once more like water in the wake of a vessel gusman slewed his head aboutcockt as it had been to the outcryto view of us they are lively today he said with an unearthly distortion of his features the echoes cest cela citoyen so men entitle them no doubt it is human to think to put terror out of countenance by miscalling it how then he beckoned us to follow plunged into the very funnel mouth that had vomited the eerie babble led us swiftly by a winding passage and stopped behold said he flashing his torch to and fro over the surface of a roughly piled and cemented wall that seemed to close the entrance to a vast recess behold said he sweeping the flame to the ground at the wallfoot we saw a skull or two a few scattered bones an indescribable brassy odour assailed our nostrils the stones shone with an oily exudation what company lies here citizen a brave one by my faitha whole cemetery en bloc comment diable shall they have fitted themselves each with his own by the day of judgment they pretend to sleep piecemeal as they were bundled in but utter so little as a whisper down there and they will begin to stir and to talk then if thou shoutst as i didmy god what a clamour in reply but one would have thought they had protested enough already in what manner ask the killers of september thou they are held honest men i believe it is enough said i lead on citizen gusman and find us a glint of light in the name of god i glanced with a shudder at carinne thank heaven she had not it appeared understood so here in one dreadful limecemented heap were massed the victims of those unspeakable days i remembered the abbaye and the bloodmark on the lip of mademoiselle de lge and i held the girl to my side as we walked with a pressure that was convulsive again the torch danced before us and again we followed and yet again the deadman called us to a stop and whirled his halfdevoured brand observe well said he for it is in this quarter ye must sojourn and here seek refuge when warning comes this time a very hill of skulls and ribs and shanksa lifeless cratera monte testaccio of broken vessels that had once contained the wine of life the heap filled a wide recess and rose twenty feet to the roof the contribution of les innocens said gusman as if he were some spectral minister of affairs announcing in the convention of the dead a sectional subscription he pointed to a little closet of stone like a friars cell that pierced the wall to one side of the heap behold your hermitage said he carinne clinging to me cried no no in a weeping voice eh bien said the creature indifferently you can take or leave as you will we will take citizen look then he gripped my arm and haled me to the mound and note what i do there was a pointroughly undistinguishable from the restwhere a welded mass of calcareous bone and rubbish lay upon the litter this was in effect a door in one piece with an infants skull for handle and concealed hinges of gut to one side to prevent its slipping out of place removed it revealed a black mouth opening into an inner vacancy underneath lies a great box or kennel of wood said gusman with a manhole cut in its side and round and over the box the stuff is piled at the very word of warning creep in and close the entrance it is like enough ye will need it and here we are to stay that is according to your inclination but mor dieu my friend if thou wert to forget or overlook us entombed in this oubliette soyez content i might forget thou wert lacking food but never that the citizen president gave thee a purse but tst tst wouldst thou explore farther my city of shadows here the wild quarries merge into the catacombs hence a little space thou wilt find company and to sparelight also if mademoiselle wills the poor child uttered a heartmoving sigh come then said gusman with a shrug of his shoulders he preceded us the length of a single corridor low and narrowa mere human molerun all throughout it the rock seemed to grip us the air to draw like wire into our lungs and then suddenly we were come to a parapet of stone that cut our path like a whitewashed hoarding for through a fissure in the plain above it a wedge of light entereda very wise virgin with her lamp shining like snowand under the beam we stopped and gazed upwards and could not gaze enough but for carinneshe was translated she laughed she murmured she made as if she caught the sweet wash like water in her hands and bathed her face with it and now i am ready said she then we scaled the wall jumping to a lower terrace of rock and thereafter ran the corridor again descending but now of ample enough width and showing a design of masonry at intervals and sometimes great stone supports to the roof where houses lay above and in a moment our path swept into a monstrous field of bonesconfused myriad piled up like slag about a pitmouth and we thridded our way therethrough along a dusty gully and emerged at once into a high vaulted cavern and the view of living things living thingsgrand dieu the bats of the living terror they peered from holes and alcoves they mowed and chattered they shook their sooty locks at us and hailed gusman in the jargon of the underworld thieves and rogues and cowardshere they swarmed in the warrens of despair the very sacristans of devilworship the unclean acolytes of the desecrated rockchapels whose books of the gospel were long since torn for fuel out of one pestilent cavern wherein i caught glimpse of an altar faced with an arabesque of cemented bones something like a dusky ape that clung with both hands to a staff for support came mouthing and gesticulating at us bread bread it mumbled working its black jaws and it made an aimless pick at carinnes skirt there is for thee then thundered gusman and he flapped his torch into the things face the animal vented a hideous cry and shuffled back into its hole shedding sparks on its way as if it smouldered like an old rag oh mon ami whispered carinne in a febrile voicebetter the den by the skulls than this the deadman gave an acrid grin la bonne heure said he doubtless hunger pinches come back then and i will open my wallet and thou shalt thy purse early in the afternoonso far as in that rayless desolation one could judge it to bethere broke upon our eyes the flutter of an advancing light upon our ears the quick secret patter of hurrying steps these ran up to the very opening of our lair and stopped hide said the deadmans voice i hear them call me to the search hide and without another word he retreated as he had come carinne uttered a little shuddering oh she took my head between her hands and kissed my lips the admirable child then we emerged from our den the ghostliest glimmer reached us from some distant corner where no doubt gusman had left a light burning and stole swiftly to the moundfoot i felt about for the infants skull the position of which i had intensely remarked and in a moment found it and laid bare the aperture dive little rabbit said i i am within jeanlouis i followed feet first and with my toes just touching bottom reached out and pulled the trap upon us then with a feeling as if i were wrenching off a blouse over my shoulders i let myself back into the holeupon a carpet of muffling dustand ma bonne amie caught at me and we stood to hear our own hearts beating like the thick throb of a clock in an underroomthus i swear our pulses sounded to us in that black and horrible stillness the box had it appeared been very compactly built in at the firstand before the superincumbent litter of rubbish had been discharged over and around itwith the strongest bones for that these were calculated to endure without shifting the onset of one hurriedly concealing himself yet this necessary precaution went near to stultifying itself by so helping to exclude the air as to make breathing a labour to one confined within fortunately however no long strain upon our endurance was demanded of us now the hunters came upon us so silently that there in our ghastly prison a spray of light scattered through the chinks of the trap was our first intimation of their presence then as we maddened to see the glint withdrawn a low voice came to our ears stop then what is this the dust of the innocents citizen gusmans voice it is with the dust of the depraved in breeding fat maggots is it not ay so long as they can find flesh food but what if such food were concealed herein that little babouin of st plagiepeste a big thighbone would afford him cover i felt my hand carried to carinnes lips in the darkness gusman kicked at the mound with his sabot close litter said he a man would suffocate that burrowed into it is that so rake me over that big lump yondervoilwith the little skull sticking from it i felt my heart turn like a mountebankfelt carinne stoop suddenly and rise with something huddled in her hands the astonishing child had unknown to me preconceived a plan and was prepared with it on the very flash of emergency she leant past me swift and perfectly silent and immediately the little spars of light about the trap went out it seemed if in moving she made the smallest sound it was opportunely covered by the ragged cough that issued at the moment from gusmans throat dpchetoi said the authoritative voice that projecting patch citizenturn it for me there is nothing here but there i say no no mille tonnerresi will come myself then i heard gusmans breath vibrant outside the trap heard him hastily raise the covering an inch or two with an affectation of labouring perplexity i set my teeth i saw red like flecks of blood i waited for the grunt of triumph that should announce the discovery of the hole it is as i told thee said the deadman there is nothing i caught a note of strangeness in his voice a suppressed marvel that communicated itself to me the sweat broke out on my forehead hmph muttered the inquisitor and i heard him step back suddenly he cried en avant plus avant to thy remotest boundaries citizen warden we will run the little rascal to earth yet the light faded from our ken the footsteps retreated i passed a shaking hand over my eyesi could not believe in the reality of our escape at length unable any longer to endure the silence i caught at carinne in the blackness little angel i said in gods name what didst thou do she bowed her sweet face to my neck only this jeanlouis i had noticed that my poor ragged skirt was much of the colour of this heap and so i slipped it off and stuffed it into the hole we dwelt an hour in our horrible retreat from time to time cautiously lifting the trap a fingersbreadth for air at the end gusman reappeared with his torch and summoned us to our release he looked at carinne as st hildephonsus might have gazed on the blessed virgin it was magnificent he said i saw at once thou hast saved me no less than thyself that i will remember citoyenne when the opportunity serves on the third day our deadman came to us with a copy of the moniteur in his hand he pointed silently to a name in the list of the latest executed carinne turned to me with pitiful eyes ah le pauvre crpin i cried in great emotion what can one hope but that death came to him passionately as he desired citizen gusman we are resolved we must go forth if it is only to perish we can endure this damning gloom no longer he looked down on us as we sat this genii of the torch his face was always framed to our vision in a lurid wreath was the sport of any draught that swayed the leaping fire submitted to daylight his features might have resolved themselves into expressionlessness and immobility to us they were ever shifting fantastic possessed with the very devils of the underworld well he said at lengthi owe the citizeness a debt of gratitude butsang dieu after all i might repudiate it when the keg threatened to suck dry i am myself only when i am not myself that would be a paradox in the world above there eh at least the moment is opportune they hunt counter for thee thibaut for the wenchshe is not in their minds nor associated in any manner with thee that lends itself to an artifice the idea tickles me sang dieu yes i will supply thee with a passport to calais wait he went from us we knew better than to interrupt or question him but we held together during his absence and whispered our hopes in less than half an hour he returned to us some papers grasped in his hand observe said he it is not often after a harvest of death that the glaneurs of the municipality overlook a stalk yet now and again one will come to me citizen tithon riouffe it appears meditated a descent upon la maudite angleterre he had his papers signed and countersigned for himself and for his wife sabine moreover it is lucky for you that he proved a rascal for they shaved him nevertheless what barrre had granted st just rendered nugatory but if they took his head they left him his passports and those i found in his secret pocket he broke off with a quick exclamation and peered down at me holding the torch to my face mother of god he criedi will swear there is something a likeness here i have a mind to fetch the head and set it to thine cheek by jowl h bien comment la petite babiolethat disturbs her well welltake and use the papers then and with discretion ye shall win free carinne caught at the rough hand of our preserver and kissed it monsieur thou art a deadman angel she cried and broke into a little fit of weeping his lids fell i saw his throat working he examined his hand as if he thought something had stung it yes she is very pretty he muttered i think i would give my life for her then he added vaguely chou pour choui will take it out in hollands chapter xv the salad course citoyen tithon riouffe et femme had yet to experience the most extraordinary instance of that favouritism by an afterdisplay of which towards those whom she has smitten without subduing fortune proclaims herself the least supernatural of goddesses truly they had never thrown into the lottery of events with a faint heart and now a first prize was to be the reward of their untiring persistency possibly indeed the papers of recommendation might have sufficed of themselves yet that they would have carried us having regard to our moulting condition poor cageworn sparrows and the necessary slowness of our advance in safety to the coast i most strenuously doubt dear god the soughing of the may wind the whisper of the grasses the liquid flutter of the stars that were like lights reflected in a lake the hour of ten saw us lifted to the plain in bodyto the heavens in spirit for freedom we were flying from the land of liberty for life from the advocates of the rights of man we sobbed and we embraced some day we cried to gusman we will come back and roll thee under a hogshead of schnappsand then we set our faces to the north and our teeth to a long task of enduranceone no less indeed than a sixtyleague tramp up the half of the isle de france and the whole of picardie well at least as in the old days we should walk together with only the little rogue that laughs at locksmiths riding sedan between us it was our design to skirt at a reasonable distance the east walls of the city and to strike at pantin going by way of gentilly and bercythe road to meaux thence we would make by a northwesterly course the amiens highway and so with full hearts and purses tightbelted for their hunger for the pathetically distant sea and all this we did though not as we had foreseen we toiled onwards in the dark throughout that first sweet night of liberty for seven hours we tramped without resting and then ten miles north of the walls we lay down under the lee of a skilling and rolled in one anothers arms slept for four hours like moles i woke to the prick of rain upon my face before my halfconscious eyes a hectic spot faded and went wan in a grey miasma like death it was the sunthe cheek of the virgin day grown chill in a premature decline i sat up from the southwest like the breath of the fatal city pursuing us a melancholy draft of cloud flowed and spread itself making for the northern horizon it wreathed in driving swirls and ripples as if it were the very surface of a stream that ran above us and indeed almost before we were moved to a full wakefulness we were as sopt as though we lay under water a swampy day it was to be the drops soon fell so thickly that heaven seemed shut from us by a skylight of blurred glass the interval from cloud to earth was like a glaze upon the superficies of a firebaked sphere the starved clammy fields shone livid the highway ran literally the poplars that skirted it were mere leafy piles in a lagoon then the wind rose shouldering us forward and bombarding us from the rear in recurrent volleys till i at least felt like a fugitive saurian escaping from the deluge with my wet tail between my legs i looked at my comrade the delicate gallant lady her hair was whipped about her face her skirt about her ankles the red cap on her head with which gusman had provided her hung over like the comb of a vanquished cockerel she was not vanquished however her white teeth clicked a little with the cold but when she became conscious of my gaze she returned it with an ardour of the sweetest drollery enfin mon ptit thibaut she said i prefer liberty in her chilly moods though she make a noyade of us it is almost come to that with a brave effort it seems we might rise to the clouds by our own buoyancy take a long breath carinne canst thou swim she laughed and stopped a moment and took me by the hands i should be able to she said i feel so like a fish or a lizard whose skin is a little loose on his body am i not a dreadful sight jeanlouis thou art never anything but beautiful in my eyes fie then fie then cannot i see myself in them very small and very ugly jeanlouisan imp of black waters and i see babies in thine carinne that is what the peasants call them and i never loved my own image so well as now it has a little blue sky to itself to spite the reality it is a fairy peeping from a flower ma mie and art thou so very cold and hungry truly my teeth go on munching the air for lack of anything better it is pitiful we must brave the next town or village to procure food there are no berries here carinne no little conies to catch in a springe of withe and spit for roasting on an old sabre and if there were we must not stop to catch them it is true we must eat then the plunge has to be madefor liberty or death formez vos bataillons advance m le comte with thy heart jumping to the hilt of thy sword she cried out merrily she was my own my property the soul of my confidence yet i could have cheered her in the face of a multitude as god forgive the comparison the mob cheered the guenipe throigne when she entered the bastille so once more we drove and were driven forward and presently six miles north of st denis down we came with stout courage i hope upon the village of couen and into immediate touch with that fortune that counselled us so amiably in the crisis of our affairs yet at the outset this capricieuse essayed to terrify us out of all assurance of selfconfidence and was the coquette to give us a bad quarter of an hour before she smiled on our suit for at the very barrier occurred a contretemps that but for its happy adaptation by us to circumstance threatened to put a short end to our fugitive romance we assumed a breezy deportment under the raking scrutiny of five or six patriot savagesmere arrogant pagers down whose dirty faces the rain trickled sluggishly like oil foul straw was stuft into their clogs over their shoulders nipped with a skewer at the neck were flung frowzy squares of sacking in the hanging corners of which they held the flintlocks of their pieces for dryness sake by the door of the village taxinghouse that stood hard by the barrier a ferretfaced postilionthe only man of them all in bootslounged replaiting the lash of his whip and drawing the string through his mouth graceless weather citizens said i a squinting bonnetrouge damned me for un ne ennuyant keep thy breath said he for what is less obvious and he surlily demanded the production of our papers a good patriot growled another walks with his face to paris so many of them have their heads turned it is true whispered carinne the squinting man wedged his eyes upon her what is that he said sharplysome mot de ralliement be careful my friends i have the gift to look straight into the hearts of traitors it was patent however that he deceived himself he snatched the papers rudely from me and conned them all at crosspurposes sacr corps he snappedwhat is thy accursed name it is plain to read citizen for a mincing aristocrat yes but for uswe read only between the lines read on them then the names of citizen tithon riouffe and wife the indolent postilion spat the string from his lips looked up suddenly and came swiftly to the barrier how said he what name i repeated the words with a little quaver in my voice the man cockt his head evilly his eyes gone into slits oh le bon dieu he cried in acrid tones but the assurance of this ragged juggler carinne caught nervously at my hand i do not understand the citizen said i in my truculent voice but i think yes that that is not the name on the passport i know nothing of the passport i know that thou art not riouffe and it is enough squinteyes croaked joyously come he said here is a sop to the weather as for me i could have whipped gusman for his talk of a fortuitous resemblance i am riouffe said i stubbornly whatever thou mayst think well it is said cried the postilion he chirped shrilly like a ferret and if thou art riouffe thou art a damned aristocrat and how art thou the better for that bah i exclaimed what dost thou know of me pig of a stableboy of thee nothing of riouffe enough to say that thou art not he explain citizen growled a curtspoken patriot spitting on the ground for fullstop mes amis cried the deplorable rogue myself i conveyed the citizen tithon riouffe to paris in company with the englishman the englishman within the fifteen days returns alone he breaks his journey here as you know to breakfast at the anchor but for riouffei heard he was arrested grace of god here was a concatenation of mishapsas luckless a rencontre as fate ever conceived of cruelty my heart turned grey the beastly triumphant faces of the guard swam in my vision like spectres of delirium nevertheless i think i preserved my reason sufficiently to assume a sang froid that was rather of the nature of a fever the question is said i coolly not as to whether this lout is a fool or a liar but as to whether or no my papers are in order you will please to observe by whom they are franked i remembered in a flash the deadmans statement the name of the citizen deputy who assured me a safe conduct to paris being on this return passport should be a sufficient guarantee that his good offices did not end with my arrival i may have been arrested and i may have been released it is not well my friends to pit the word of a horseboy against that of a member of the committee of public safety my high manner of assurance had its effect the faces lowered into some expression of chagrin and perplexity and then what must i do but spoil the effect of all by a childishly exuberant anticlimax i will grant said i that a change in the habit of ones dress may confuse a keener headpiece than a jockeys what then i arrive from england i return from paristhere is the explanation moreover in these days of equality one must economise for the common good and rather than miss my return seat in the englishmans carriage and have to charter another i follow in his track when i find he is already started in the hope to overtake him and now you would delay us here while he stretches longer leagues between us carinne gave a little soft whimper the postilion capered where he stood mes amis he cried he speaks well it needs only to confront him with the englishman to prove him an impostor misrable what folly had i expressed it had not been sufficiently flogged into my dull brain that the islander was here now in the village i had obtusely fancied myself safe in claiming knowledge of him while my secure policy was to have blustered out the situation as another and independent riouffe that course i had now made impossible i could have driven my teeth through my tongue with vexation carinne touched my hand pitifully it almost made my heart overflow thus i said byandby to her the condemned forgives his executioner andah little thibaut she whispered but you do not know how big you looked for the moment they could not find the englishman he had finished his breakfast and wandered afield that was a brief respite but nothing it seemed to avail in the end in the meantime they marched us into the taxinghouse where at a table sat a commissary of a strange figure i had blundered desperately yet here i flatter myself i turned my faculty for construing character to the account of retrieving my own in citizen tristan i readand quite rightly as events showeda decent burgher aggrandised not against his will but against the entire lack of one his face was shaped and something coloured like a great autumn pear it was narrow at the forehead with restless ineffective eyes and it dropped to a monstrous china selfprotective evolution in the era sainte guillotine obviously he had studied to save his neck by surrounding it with a rampart of fat for the rest he was very squat and ungainly and he kept shifting the papers on his desk rather than look at us here is a man thought i who has been promoted because in all his life he has never learned to call anything his own our guard presented us arrogantly the wizened postboy laid his charge volubly call your witness said i in a pet the case lies in a nutshell my words made an impression no doubt though they were uttered in mere hopeless bravado but it seems he cannot be found protested the commissary plaintively then i urged it is bad law to detain us you are detained on suspicion of not being ourselves oh monsieur he took me up peevishly eh eh voil ce que cest monsieur to me art thou not an aristocrat then i answered pregnantly the question in itself is a reflection upon him that signed this passport he looked about him like a trapped creature dumbly entreating the fates for succour it was my plain policy to harp upon the strings of his nerves well said i a citizen commissary i perceive must have the courage of his opinions and i can only hope thine will acquit thee when the reckoning is called he shifted in his chair he spluttered little deprecatory interjections under his breath he shot small furtive glances at his truculent following finally he bade all but us two out of the room and the guard to their post at the barrier the moment they were withdrawn grumbling he opened upon me with a poor assumption of bluster thou art very big with words but here i am clearly within my rights are not my papers in order then it would at least appear so his lids rose and fell patently his selfpossession was an insecure tenure citizen i said shaking my finger at him since when hast thou learned to set thy will in opposition to that of barrre oh nom de dieu he whimpered in great distress and rose and trundled up and down the room i oppose nobody i am a most unhappy being condemned by vile circumstance to give the perpetual lie to my conscience it is an ignoble rle said i and quite futile of itself he paused suddenly opposite me his fat lips were shaking his eyes blinked a nerveless anxiety i contradict nobody he cried and added afflictedly i suppose if you are riouffe you are riouffe i suppose it all lies in that said i then he cried feeblywhat the devil do you want of me i could have laughed in his poor gross face what indeed said i my account with you will come later you will be prepared then no doubt to justify this detention for me there remains barrre no no he cried i desire only to steer wide of quicksands you may guess monsieur how i am governed this fripon takes my fellows by the ears he gives you the lie and you return it in his teeth what am i to say or think or do is it for me to advise a commissary he rumpled his limp hair desperately as he walked you will not help me you drive me to distraction he stopped again are you riouffe he cried you have my passport monsieur yes yes i know he exclaimed in a frenzy butmother of god monsieur do you not comprehend the postboy to swear you are not the englishmans riouffe confront me then with the englishman he cannot be found i shrugged my shoulders i can only recall monsieurs attention said i to the fact that certain citizens travelling under safeconduct of a member of the committee of safety and with their papers in indisputable order are suffering a detention sufficiently unwarrantable to produce the gravest results the commissary snatched up his hat and ran to the door go thy ways he cried myself i will conduct you through the village for the rest when the englishman is found and if he denies thee he did not finish the sentence in a moment we were all in the rainy street my accuser was vanished from the neighbourhood of the barrier a single patriot only was in evidence this man made a feint of bringing his musket to the charge qui va l he grunted estce quil se sauve ce cochon fear lent the commissary anger to thy post he shouted am i to be made answerable to every dog that barks redbonnet fell back muttering we hurried forward splashing over the streaming cobbles the street by luck of weather was entirely deserted only a horseless limonire standing at the porch of the village inn gave earnest of some prospective interest suddenly i felt carinnes little clutch on my arm the englishman she whispered in a gasp my teeth clicked rigid i saw ahead of us a tall careless figure lounge into the open and stop over against the door of the carriage at the same moment inspiration came to the commissary his gaze was introspective he had not yet noticed the direction of ours he slapped his hand to his thigh as he hurried forward mon dieu cried he it is simple why did i not think of it sooner prove then thy knowledge of this englishman by giving me his name with the very words i set off running a startled cry to which i paid no heed pursued me i hold a hostage i hold a hostage screamed the commissary and immediately as i understood nipped carinne by the elbow but by then i was come up with the stranger he turned and received me straddlelegged his eyes full of a passionless alertness i lost not an instant monsieur i panted we are fugitive aristocrats in the name of god help us i could have adored him for his reception of this astounding appeal he never moved a muscle tout droit said he but give us the tip riouffe is dead his eyelids twitched at thati have his passports i am riouffeand this is madame my wife simultaneously in the instant of my speaking the frantic commissary brought up carinne and to a metallic clang of hoofs our fateful postboy issued from the innyard in charge of his cattle for a moment the situation was absolutely complete and dramaticthe agonised suitor proposing the humorous and heroic nonchalant disposing the petrified jockey right the hostage chevalire in the grasp of the heavy villain left then all converged to the central interest and destroyed the admirable effectiveness of the tableau goddam milor the englishman shrieked the commissary he does not know thy name the stranger put out a hand as he stood and clapped me on the shoulder so that i winced riouffe he cried in a very bantering voicenot know his friend jack comely ne savoir pas son ami jack comelypooh that he will swear to my jack said i the commissary released carinne and fell back gasping pardon les bras men tombent he muttered in dismayed tones and went as white and mottled as a leg of raw mutton but the stranger advanced to carinne with a blush and a gallant bow madame said he i cannot sufficiently curse my impatience for having cut you out of a stage it was an error entrez sil vous plait he spoke execrable french the angel it was enough that we all understood him we climbed into the limonire the stranger followed and the door was slammed to the landlord with a hussy or so gaped at the inndoor the postboy making himself infinitesimally small to the commissary limbered up his cattlethree horses abreast one of these he mounted as if it were a nightmare in a moment he was towelling his beasts to a gallop to escape one would think the very embarrassment he carried with him from time to time he turned in his saddle and presented a scared face to our view well said the stranger looking at us with a smile he was a fairfaced young man boldmouthed and ripe with selfassurance his dress was of the english fashionstraightcrowned beaver hat with the band buckled in front green tabinet kerchief claretcoloured coat tightbuttonedaltogether a figure very spruce and clean like a piqueur dcurie i regarded him in solemn amazement the whole rapid incident had been of a nature to make me doubt whether i was awake or dreaming ma mie said carinne reproachfully milord awaits your explanation i rose a little and bowed monsieur said i stupidly we are jorinde and joringel sir comely a fine scapegrace had journeyed to paris out of curiosity to witness a guillotining with him in the packet crossed monsieur tithon riouffe an migr returning under safeconduct of the ineffective barrre to snatch his wife from the whirlpool the two gentlemen met hobnobbed and shared a fourwheeled carriage as far as the tragic city whence as agreed between them on a certain day of the fifteen during which the vehicle remained at the remise at their disposition theyaccompanied it was to be hoped by madamewere to return in it to calais the day arrived m riouffe failed to keep his appointment the other awaited him so long as a certain urgency of affairs permitted at lengthhis own safety being a little menacedhe was driven to start on the return journey alone all this we learned of him and he of us the broad outline of our story a full confidence was the only policy possible to our dilemma he honoured it en prince he was quite admirably concerned to hear of the fate of his fellowtravellerle malheureux chevreuil he called him the extraordinary concatenation of chances that had substituted us for that other two did not however appear to strike him particularly but he strapped his vitalities that is as we understood it lashed himself into merriment in the insular manner very often and very loudly over this chance presented to him of hoodwinking the authorities its rich its royal its rare he cried thus to double under the nose of the old cull of a bigwig and to be sport in the next county while hes hunting for a gate through the quickset i pledge you my honour monsieur to see the two of you through with this but egad you must draw upon my portymanteau at the next post if you are to win clear grces au ciel for the merry brave it was like endeavouring to read inscriptions in the catacombs to interpret his speech but one phrase he had trippingly and that in itself was a complete index to his character je ne me mouche pas du piedi know better than to blow my nose with my feet and now if for nothing else i loved him for his boyish shy but most considerate attitude towards carinne and thus was our escape accomplished winged with our passports and cheered to the finish by the assurance of this gay and breezy islander we came to the coast on a memorable afternoon and bade adieu for ever to the family despotism of fraternity tell me ma belle pousefor five days the guests the property the protgswhat thou wiltof this sir comely this excellent philippe le bel we have shut our eyes here in this immeasurable london to our necessitous condition and the prospect that faces us carinne mon enfant it is right now to discuss the means by which we are to live i have thought of it little thibaut i will paint portraits i started oh i cried i am very hungry let us signalise this last consumption of the poor crpins purse by a feast of elegance be assured his ghost will call the grace we entered an inn opportunely near the spot whither we had wandered it was in an important part of the town close by the lionsurmounted palace of some monseigneur and coaches and berlines discharged themselves in frequent succession in its yard we walked into the salle manger sat down and endeavoured to make our wishes known to the waiter the room was fairly empty but a party of halfadozen young bloodshommes de bonne compagniesitting at a neighbouring table seemed moved with a certain curiosity about us and byandby one of these rose crossed over and addressing me in very good french asked if he could be of service in interpreting my desiresfor says he with a smile i perceive that monsieur is from over the channel alas monsieur i answered we are indeed of that foundered vessel la ville de paris the worthless wreckage of which every tide washes up on your coasts some compliments passed and he withdrew to join his companions a little whispering was exchanged amongst them and then suddenly our dandy arose and approached us once more with infinite complaisance monsieur he said i cannot i find convince my friends of the extent to which your nation excels in the art of making salads would you do us the favour to mix one for us i hesitated it is one of thy accomplishments said madame la comtesse at a hazard it was indeed though she could not have known it or that brillatsavarin himself had once acknowledged me to be his master in the art i shall be charmed i said i called for oil wine vinegar sweet fruits the sauces of soy and ketchup caviare truffles anchovies meatgravy and the yolks of eggs i had a proportion and a place for each and while i broke the lettuces my company sat watching and engaged me in some pretty intimate conversation asking many questions about paris my former and present conditions and even my place of abode i answered goodhumouredly on account of my dear philippe who was of the very complexion and moral of these frank rascals and presently they pronounced my salad such a dish as vitellius had never conceived and from their table they drank to its author and to the beautiful eyes of madame la comtesse it was all comical enough but byandby when having finished our meal we found ourselves in the street again carinne thrust a folded slip of paper into my hand what is this mignonne look then said she it was conveyed by the lgant under thy plate i opened and examined it it was a note for five pounds au diable i murmured flushing scarlet carinne placed her hand on my arm she looked up in my face very earnest and pitiful jourdain she said makes his living by turning his knowledge of weaving to account de courcy begs his by parfilage which is the better method mon ami is it not well to face the inevitable courageously by taking thy accomplishments to market i will become a saladdresser said i on the following day arrived a very courteous note from my petitmatre of the diningroom entreating me as a special favour to come that evening to a certain noble house and make the salad for a large dinnerparty that was to be given therein i went was happy in confirming the great opinion formed of my powers and was delicately made the recipient of a handsome present in acknowledgment of my services from that moment my good little fortunes rolled up like a snowball within a period of eighteen months i had accumulated by the mere art of selection a sum of near a hundred thousand francstruly a notable little eggsnest one morning not so very long ago madame de cranc came to me with her eyes shining little thibaut said she thou hast a great heart yetthough doubtless thou wert right to insist that the husband should be the breadwinnerit has grieved me to stand by and watch my own particular gift rusting from disuse well sir for thy rebuke i have at last a surprise for thee behold and with that she fetched a canvas from behind her back where she had been secreting it and presented it to my view is it not like she said her throat swelling with joy and pride i made my eyes two osi hedged as the sportsmen say it is indeed ma mie it is like nothing in the world except of course i stopped sweating with apprehension she relieved me at once ah she cried is it not baby himselfthe dear sweet rogue i threw all my soul into it for thy sake carinne i exclaimed passionately grateful i knew i could not be mistaken the end notes nothing would appear to more graphically illustrate the moral influence of the terror than that common submission to a force that was rather implied than expressed now it seems a matter for marvel how a great many thousands of capable men having nothing to hope from the intolerable tyranny that was massing them in a number of professed slaughterhouses should not only have attempted no organised retaliation but should by unstiffening their necks in a very heroic fashion be it said to be the footstools to a few monstrous bullies have tacitly allowed the righteousness of a system that was destroying them to go by implication escapes from durance were
