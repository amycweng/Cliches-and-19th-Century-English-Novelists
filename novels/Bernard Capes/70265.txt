the pot of basil by bernard capes author of a jay of italy bag and baggage jessie bazley london constable company ltd note for the attempt here made to endue with life and circumstance a little tragic romance of the past the motive is to be referred to a recently published book of memoirs in whose pages is incidentally made public for the first time the brief legend of which this is an amplification the author hopes that he will not be thought to have dealt profanely with the spirit of a little tale so old so new and yet so touching in its eternal simplicity contents i the nixie ii

chapter i the nixie it was a very hot day in colorno the petty versailles of the dukes of parma the little channels irrigating the plains all about and drawn every one from the near depleted basin of the small river which a few miles northward ran into the po were spun as thin as silver wire the effect from a distance was as of a network of snail tracks stiffened in a dry morning and all making for the oasis of the village where was to be found at least the shade of trees and gardens elsewhere there was little the domains of don philip wrote the minister maulevrier propos some hounds de toute beaut presented to the duke by his devoted father in law louis xv were no huntsmans paradise since they possessed ni bois ni fauve the country was like a green tray rimmed by the low blue ramparts of the alps and apennines far distant in the midst stood colorno a dainty confection as it were of puff paste and sugar it lay basking in the sunlight very white very sleepy very empty its duke and court were at the capital ten miles southward madame louise elizabeth its restless scheming duchess was hastening towards her cruel end at versailles she was to die like her father like her husband like her son like many another relation of the common scourge la petite vrole and only the three children of the marriage remained ensconced for purposes of health and education at the rsidence dt this country house lgante et spacieuse this colorno itself are very meet in these days to point the moral of vainglory the palace where the well beloveds eldest and only married daughter wasted her heart and her brains in the persistent endeavour to find kingdoms for her offspring as lesser mothers try to find situations for theirs the despised home where ne cesse de parcourir la carte deurope chasing this or that crown to its imaginary resting place on the head of husband or child has been transformed into a lunatic asylum the balcony whence our juliet leaned to whisper honeyed phrases to her romeo is either gone or witnesses to the rhapsodies of a baser madness the contiguous houses where officers and ministers and envoys plenipotentiary kept their state the lodgings where the smaller fry of parasites and courtiers worried out their little excited lives of intrigue and scandal all are delivered in this twentieth century to the dry prose of commerce and only the gilt tracery on a wall here and there or the sombre emblazonment of a ceiling testifies to the romance which once glowed and fevered there until it perished consumed in its own heart burnings the palace has achieved one might say its logical destiny it survives but in a bad state of repair mental and material the ducal gardens also survive but for the benefit of the people everywhere since those days the flood of democracy has broken through the social dam and robbed exclusiveness of its most picturesque privileges it was predestined it was inevitable but i prefer i confess for my part to think of colorno as it lay slumbering before the vulgarising cataclysm on that sultry june morning in the year there came lumbering up the high road from florence a great travelling carriage drawn by four bays with a sober suited postilion to each pair and a couple of travellers no more within one might have known that the younger of these men though plainly enough dressed in a suit of black velvet with his head in a powdered bag wig and a simple black beaver set on it was from the very serene authority of his expression a person of particular distinction he was in fact the archduke joseph of austria heir apparent to god knew what dominions the seven years war was then in the fourth of its perennial stages and on his way home from a minor diplomatic mission with which despite his youth he had been entrusted to the court of rome he travelled incognito as the comte de falckenstein and for the moment had elected to eschew display his entourage his personal equipage had preceded him on the road he himself desired to lag a little for purposes of observation for he was always observing was archduke joseph and provisionally amending the scheme of things after a process despotically philosophic which was all his own the archduke aetat concluded a pretty prolonged silence with an aphorism the last acquirement of ambitious minds my good tiretta is simplicity the gentleman at his side a humorous interesting looking young man of twenty six or so heaved a profound sigh at last he said i may talk then again joseph sniggered his own lean young face was not without humour but intrinsically of the pedantic order he was precociously inclined to that form of superior banter best described as scholastic jocosity which consists in demanding subservient laughter from the unamused that was largely the misfortune of his state he was a serious well intentioned young prince but since no one might question his conclusions they were forced to be their own single support he had platonic ideals of state but the individual liberty they embraced included no right to question his personal dictation of them he would make men tolerant by intolerance which was exactly what the jacobins by savager methods came to attempt and necessarily like them he failed he meant very well and under the circumstances did not do so badly in the end but he died after all in the van of pathetic failure seeing all his hopes of a world converted by force to reason overthrown that however belongs to another story the archdukes aphorism had capped some discussion terminated by himself on the notorious dandyism of the duke of parma through whose territories they were then passing you may talk tiretta he said why not god and your highness know answered the young gentleman i would rather go without food than speech any day and yet you impose silence on me and yet you condescend to call me your friend he was a romantic looking fellow for all the character he gave himself slender shapely with dusk mournful eyes and well knit features his mouth was peculiarly expressive whether in smile or sobriety and the voice whose freedom he so coveted was low toned and caressing he wore the nondescript military harness of his day scarcely to be called a uniform consisting prominently of a dark blue coat with white facings high jack boots and a heavy sword at his side his natural hair of a deep brown and slightly grizzled with powder was tied into a knot at the nape with a broad black ribbon and on his head was a hat like his companions but adorned with a pert black cockade i am your friend tiretta said the prince that is why i will not let you talk too much you will profit by it some day when i have inured you to a wise reticence the man of many words empties his heart of thoughts i could plead answered tiretta with a little curious amused glance at his companion that thoughts like pea blossom throng the thicker being culled only i fear fear what that you would wish to think it over joseph laughed well said he deliver yourself i can be reticent said tiretta i will talk your highness an hour by the clock to prove it and all the time you will never guess the secret i am keeping from you what is that that you have a smut on your nose the prince instinctively rubbed that august feature then his lips a little stiff sat looking out of the window certainly his indulgence had brought this on himself he had met and attached this tiretta to his interests in rome where the stranger was known socially as il trovatore already and always a student of humanity there was something about the man a mystery a charm which had curiously puzzled and attracted the royal young metaphysician not that tiretta had made any mystery about himself if he was a soldier of fortune he was still a soldier and a gentleman he had fought with distinction on the spanish side in the wars of the austrian succession he had been present at the battle of piacenza it was nothing in that general post of kingdoms and dynasties that he should find himself presently hobnobbing on friendly terms with a scion of the house whose claims he had helped to contest the european arena was all a welter of habsburgs and bourbons crossing interlacing intermarrying and having no particular aim in common but like a litter of pigs to empty among them the continental trough it did not seem much to matter which sat on what throne so long as all available seats were occupied by themselves a martial spirit with no genius for genealogy might very well under such conditions fight for the sake of his sword rather than his cause and likely that had been the case with tiretta he was a mercenary of the noble and romantic sort a free lance whose independence of mind shone through all his undertakings there is no permanence in the attachments of princes but for the moment at least it was this very quality of self possession in his friend which interested joseph and because it seemed the antithesis of his own tiretta possessed his own soul apart not by philosophy but by some secret bestowal of it in a dreamy rosamunds bower to which only he knew the clue when his eyes looked fixed and misty one might surmise that he was far away in that enchanted spot the spirit of which always appeared to speak in his voice and manner there was something magnetic about the man which in the philosophers view invited scientific analysis and yet the fellow was an irrepressible chatterer that was the odd thing and wont like all chatterers to blunder into offence here was an example archduke joseph tried to swallow the pleasantry but his vanity was not equal to the effort he swelled a moment then delivered himself with an icy hauteur you presume monsieur you presume upon my indulgence that is not to justify my condescension but to rebuke it henceforth i desire you to leave me to my meditations tiretta instantly compunctious ventured to disobey he was easily attached he really liked the young man his expressions of contrition won favour after a time he earnestly asserted that he was not the irresponsible garrulous magpie the other thought him that in the causes of loyalty and affection he could be silent unto death let his highness test him and believe joseph smiled too much protest too many words i mistrust all excess even of fidelity he said your highness begins your highness has said it cried tiretta where ordinarily old age is content to end in the last wisdom of simplicity be tolerant of us commoner minds who being little cannot afford like your highness to do without some ostentation even in speech an emperor can dress plain can dismiss his escort can sit in silence self contained and remain an emperor but we must een have some garnish of embroidered coats and sounding words to recommend us well talking like drink grows on a man so you give me your liking sum me up as a wind bag only a fond one i shall do nothing so foolish said joseph with a smile there is no human nature my good tiretta compounded of such simple ingredients to call a man a rogue a fool a miser or what you will is the mere refuge of an indolent mind which seizes upon some salient feature to express the whole remark upon a mans dandyism as we have been doing but do not call him dandy remark upon anothers loquacity but do not dismiss him as an empty chatterer do not dismiss him at all said tiretta gravely he will justify your interest in him yet he chaunted softly a little odd song they were rolling over smooth turf at the time something about a quarrel between a flower and its roots which he improvised for the occasion it was his faculty for doing this sort of thing which had procured him his name he had a very sweet voice his mandolin rested in its case in the rack above his head joseph had little ear or liking for music yet there was a quality in tirettas which constantly fascinated while it aggravated him if you would condescend to prose he said drily it was this said tiretta the flower despised its own lowly roots its poor relations which connected it with the soil i would stand alone in my exclusiveness it said and it persuaded the scythe to sever it but lo the flower fell and died and the roots sent forth another blossom fair as the first the archduke patted the shoulder next him patronisingly what does it mean poet nothing sir but that stand a flower ever so high and glorious the roots have their use all life springs at one time from the soil what is the moral o the moral only that i love flowers well you are a funny fellow for being a root it is natural for you to think so but i shall hope yet to prove my attachment the prince glanced at him queerly as if doubting his sanity then frowned and sat looking from the window the postilions had had orders to avoid both parma and colorno there were private as well as state reasons for this step the past month or so had been signalised by some cautious pourparlers in the matter of a suggested marriage between the heir to the austrian throne and the eldest child and daughter of don philip and both policy and punctilio forbade a visit which might lend itself to misconstruction if any curiosity as to the person of his possible bride affected the sedate young gentleman he had no difficulty in repressing it a glimpse had perhaps acted upon him to rasher effect for for all his youthful philosophy joseph was susceptible where girlish beauty was concerned he even fell in love years later with the looks of his own sister marie antoinette at versailles and playfully regretted that he could not marry her reports of course of the charms of the young infanta marie isabelle had reached him but then he was wise enough to recognise that princesses were always beautiful it was without emotion that he saw the roofs and towers of colorno appear and disappear at a distance among the eastern greenery the carriage took a ford of the little river and toiling up the slope beyond was proceeding on its way to join the milan road when it was called to a sudden halt by the archduke tiretta your highness that was a bewitching vision it sits very prettily among its trees to be sure pooh man get out and look back tiretta obeyed and this is what he saw the road ran straight across the river and within the south eastern angle made by the two was composed a little picture very quaint and ravissante it showed a leafy corner shadowed by chestnut trees and a patch of green embowered turf beyond sloping to a tiny curved backwater in which lay a miniature islet set like an aquamarine in a ring the whole lying secluded from the road behind a high close hedge of tamarisk and juniper in the thick of which was sunk a wooden wicket but between the bank and islet was the wonder for there thigh deep in the water stood a young girl plainly arrested in the act of reaching for a single golden lily which floated in the pool a yard or two beyond her grasp there she stood half diverted half aghast balancing herself by an overhanging branch one slim arm raised so that its sleeve dropped down almost to her arm pit the other snatched hurriedly from its essay pressing under to her knees her rebellious skirt which yet would rise and rise again in snowy bubbles the naiads umber hair had looped astray the little milkmaid hat upon her head with its cherry ribbon and saucy bow was tilted askew she stood transfixed a moment then with a laugh and shrug turned and waded ashore an odd small face peering from the green greeted her then both disappeared and only the swirling bobbing lily remained to tell of the picture a voice spoke at tirettas side the archduke had alighted fantastic lovely a spirit of the beautiful water how the sun and shade fought for her face her bosom tiretta sir i would not willingly forget that vision see take this ring he pulled a green intaglio from his finger carry it to her say that the count of falckenstein presents his duty to the nixie of the pool and begs her to accept of this gage in token of his thraldom no delay not a moment or you will be too late tiretta in his jack boots splashed back across the ford he found the wicket unfastened and entered a short hedgy lane carried him to the chestnut trees and the patch of sward over against the islet he half expected to find the apparition vanished beyond recall a dream an hallucination but there she stood withdrawn into the green a flushed and laughing reality her sodden skirts clung about her they were hemmed with mud as if a lily herself she had been uprooted from the water her raised hands sought to restore symmetry to her disordered locks there was a gleam of snowy teeth a flush of translucent rose he thought he had never seen a picture so captivating and hovering about the visions footsteps was a little grotesque boy comical preposterous a dwarf in fantastic keeping he advanced she saw him and was stricken into a stone eyed undine madam he said i bring a gage from the count of falckenstein yonder to the nixie of the water he bids me say that he will redeem it at her will chapter ii aquaviva if we are to accept the testimony of louis xv an experienced judge in such matters the beauty of his granddaughter eldest child of don philip of parma was in need of no servile flattery to recommend it the little infanta was in truth at seventeen most that heart could desire sweet unaffected full of charm and playfulness indeed in the eyes of some she erred on the side of condescension being a little disposed like her father to familiarity with her inferiors yet on right occasion she could assume a pretty air of dignity consciously summoned one might think to the protection of a yielding over lovable disposition she could not bear to hurt and though she was wilful and possessed and could not always resist the temptation to indulge a strong sense of humour her atonements generally more than expiated the faults that induced them to men her eyes seemed always asking pardon for the cruelty of their own kindness the pretty princess was born in december she arrived when all sweets were over to bless the year even like our own little princess elizabeth who came with the snow one childermas day and passed away with it like other holy innocents in her brief spring isabellas full name was isabelle marie louise antoinette either so or written in italian or spanish as you please to her kinsfolk she was always isabelita they spoke french for the most part in parma for although don philip was a son of the fifth haughty monarch of that name of spain his royal spouse was by far the more forceful spirit of the pair a true and steadfast daughter of france and her will and tastes prevailed above those of her vain good natured husband wherefore it was that this twelfth year of the dukes enjoyment of his italian possessions found the court largely weeded of its original spanish dependants and savouring more of paris than of madrid in its councils and pastimes isabella commonly spoke french and so through long habit of resignation did her gouvernante the marquise de gonzals a fat old rabcheuse who wishful long ago to escape this tiresome servitude of hers had only been induced to stay on in view of the inability of the ducal exchequer to settle her account she was a twaddling scandalmongering old woman who passait pour aimer lintrigue not the best mentor for an impressionable young girl one would think but indeed the old ladys wits were never the servants of her inclinations and i think isabella measured her fairly enough her pretence and her harmlessness and was never though she dutifully submitted more or jess to her duennaship in the least danger of imbibing from her principles derogatory to her maidenhood at the same time the girl not ignorant of the financial difficulties which had almost persistently beset the duchy was prepared to suffer sweetly enough the almost arrogant show of authority which the marquises consciousness of grievance emboldened her to assume the two drove out one fair june morning to visit the gardens of the queer old aquaviva a whimsical protg of the young lady they lay these gardens a mile or two from colorno along the right bank of the little river parma and were designed for nothing else than the production of perfumery the gouvernante hot and languid elected to remain in the carriage under the shadow of a friendly group of trees so isabella alighted alone she had hardly entered the garden through a green gate in a hedge before she was launched upon a very wilderness of flowers or at least so it might have appeared to one who knew nothing of the inner economics of that profuse and dazzling disorder here were roses not by the bed but by the acre bickering flame as the heat haze dances from the ground of orange and crimson and scarlet fields of jasmine in orderly rows knitted in like hop binds with horizontal stakes and loading the air with perfume plantations of yellow cassia of jonquil of tuberose of geranium each on inspection seen to be differentiated from all others the whole forming a vast mosaic of flower groups whose pattern symbolised the triumph of aquaviva over some natural conditions obstructive of his enterprise for aquaviva transferring at one time his little capital and his extensive knowledge from the flower farms of grasse in the cannes valley where he had been horticulturally educated to his native plains of colorno which were quite a degree higher in latitude had had to circumvent and conquer many difficulties before establishing his gardens on the productive footing which was to make of them something more than a joy to the eye and a feast to the nostrils isabella walked on steeped half drugged in the scents which rose like incense on all sides there were men working here and there bronzed italian lavoranti who uncapped to madonna as she passed and felt the sweet place sweeter for her presence she knew all its intricacies and details the sheds for raising seed the pergolas the nurseries the sunk tanks of water alive with wriggling gnat larv the little gleaming channels interlacing all there was something about the riotous profusion of the spot so greenly remote from the formal alleys and studied perspectives of colorno which touched a strange nerve in her as of some shadowy remembrance the mystery of antique forgotten things she loved it and its owner and presiding genius whom the marquise patronised and detested was a prime favourite of hers wending her way everywhere by great bushes of lavender and rosemary she came presently upon the old gardener himself busy near the laboratory a central bungalow where were achieved the processes of macration and enfleurage otherwise the capture and storage of the world of fugitive perfumes which diffused themselves around aquaviva carried in his sinewy arms a pile of glazed stretchers like small window sashes or a more appropriate simile in these days like large photographic printing frames and seeing isabella he paused with a sardonic pucker of the lips ah said he i could have sworn it a right morning for gadflies his torso was like a lean bellied fiddle the string which bound his green baize apron round his waist helping the resemblance great bent shoulders and thin bent shanks had he with enormous shoes to his feet and an enormous aquiline nose to his face his expression was by no means truckling or conciliatory he knew his value with the dames and exquisites of parma isabella laughed o grandfather she said is that the way to greet your princess see how i sting you with honey for your rudeness hey said the old man hoping to make me drop my frames but beware it is the treasure of a dukedom i carry within them she stretched up and pulled at a frame trying to peep what is it avolo mio is it lilies jasmine violets it is not for the common ruck i tell you it is of the ducal brand the essence of all flowers in one it is tuberose spoken madonna like an intelligent daughter between us we shall guess sooner or later what is his excellencys favourite perfume why this is it is it not capital on my faith she has guessed it already grandfather i do not like you i shall be severe tell me at once is the grease on which these flowers are spread well purified in boiling water and nitre it is well purified madonna has it since been boiled in a solution of rose water and benzoin that is so madonna he answered with an amused approving grin and was the grease originally of choice selection the most choice madonna the butcher who provided the ox who provided the suet is fourth cousin to a saint the odour of sanctity is over it all from the first that is very good then my father will like to acquire sanctity so easily and so pleasantly true on his handkerchief but madonna forgets one thing the fat thus impregnated has to be dissolved in alcohol a very devilish liquor before the fragrance is released from it wherefore sanctity does not count in the result i was forgetting so after all you brew wicked concoctions grandfather i shall ask to have you put in the escalero not you you would not hurt a beetle besides where then would you get your scents i would distil them from the simple flowers pooh that is what fools imagine but flowers do not yield their essence to torture any more than truth comes out of the escalero i did not mean it really aquaviva looked at the girl with a grim smile and wagged his head you holy love he said how long are you going to keep me in torment with this load she moved with an exclamation of remorse to let him pass going before her he deposited his armful of frames within the bungalow where were already heaped some scores of others now said he turning round and rubbing his arms repeat your lesson profumiere she put her hands behind her back as she stood before him i boil and refine my grease she said in the flowerless time storing ready a great quantity of it when the flowers come each in its season i gather them and place them on these frames every one of which is smeared thick with the fat which has the property of absorbing their fragrance i pile these frames one on the other to the number of o the heaps that you see there and leave them thus the light and heat penetrating for go on ever so long a time from twenty four to thirty six hours will do that is what i meant when the flowers have yielded all they can i remove them and put fresh ones and so on until the fat is so fully charged with their fragrance that it can hold no more i then scrape off the grease heat it until liquid then strain it and pour it into bottles ready for treatment by the perfumers with their with their alcohol capital madonna has my certificate and now about macration that is steeping the flowers in cold olive oil some like cassia answer better to such treatment excellent and so do not talk to me any more about your distillation which is an inferior process applied only to the leaves seeds and other parts of perfume bearing plants and in its results resembles no more the sweet breath of the blossoms than your ladyships vulgar camriste fanchette becquet resembles your ladyship grandfather what do you know about fanchette only what bissy has told me madonna and what does bissy know ask him he has all the wisdom of an owl you did not come here unattended madame de gonzals drove with me she is sleeping in the carriage i warrant it the old sluggard if they shot women she would be riddled like a pepper box for a false sentry you must not speak so of my gouvernante well i will not if it comes to that i could forgive all spaniards for your sake isabella turned her slim tallish young figure suddenly erect i will go and look for bissy she said stiffly you will find him in the orange grove called aquaviva and returned grinning to his work isabella had one of those small revulsions of feeling which sometimes came to her when it seemed her natural kindness had been presumed upon but the mood passed quickly as she walked beside the beds of flowers she did not like to think of these pure things yielding their essence to fat yet after all it was an emollient process not unlike the susceptibility of her sex to soft flattery she wondered if to lie on a bed of suet would have a persuasive effect upon her own soul coaxing it to part with its fondest secrets she was quite sure that distillation by boiling would have the opposite effect gardeners certainly were very wise people they had learned the value of cold oil over hot in extracting the truth from shy natures how cruel the world was would it ever learn in her time the illogic of torture archduke joseph in his carriage not so far away was already unconsciously formulating in his mind a like proposition but he lived to answer it in an enlightened fashion the orange grove was aquavivas pride he had nursed it through long years into a flourishing condition for in those latitudes where snow often fell thickly in the winter it was no easy task to protect and cherish the sensitive trees the grove was situated in a little green glade near the river so enclosed was it within trees and juniper hedges so hushed and fragrant were its depths one might have thought oneself in an antique bower sacred to love a place where silence itself stole into blossom and needed no more than the shock of a butterflys entrance to shatter it into a myriad scented stars so still was it that the bubbling coo of a dove the plop of a fish in the stream hard by sounded when they sounded almost discordant for true it is that noise like size is relative the man who lives amongst engines can find balm of nights in barking dogs and crowing cocks a student in a voiceless hermitage is driven to madness by a bluebottle the trees were all in flower and as if that were not fragrance enough the grassy floor of the grove was sown everywhere with clumps of violets many late blossoms on which still lingered out their beauty they too needed protection but in another way protection from the sapping sun which the others loved and monopolised so that here were light and shadow at their sweetest as isabella entered the grove she came plump upon the minor apparition she sought bissy to wit in shirt and breeches and an enormous straw hat he looked like a gnome who had taken refuge from a crow under a great mushroom and come away with it on his head its weight seemed to bow his little legs withal his important spirit walked unconscious of the burden or rather stooped at the moment for bissy hands on knees was peering intently into a violet patch a basket of blossoms standing on the grass by his side bissy incidentally was aquavivas grandson and only relative he was presumably a boy but of unknown age his squeezed elfin face showed the gravity of a man of forty he took himself immensely seriously regarding the flower farm as his heritage invited or merited no rebuke worked solemnly within his limits and took no fantastic risks and yet the boy was in him somewhere as naughty isabella loved to prove by probing it was just possible so to speak to scratch the horticulturist and find the mudlark bissy she said a twinkle in her eyes what do you know of fanchette becquet the imp did not even start he just looked inquiringly round with his large owlish eyes then straightened himself to his four foot six of stature it is blood that amuses mamselle fanchette he answered promptly that is what i know about her excellency blood you nasty boy cried the young lady with a little nose of disgust look you madonna said bissy i know what i say she comes to see the gardens once or twice and to praise the scents to ask them too a little rose water for her kerchief some geraniums to put in her bosom a spray of rosemary for her garters she is a poor maid her salary is paid irregularly which i do not believe she will justify the gift through her recommendations but that is all nothing to her passion for the orange grove i tell her what i will tell you about these trees they are grafted on a stock of lemon they are planted in a good clayey soil enriched with both animal manure and rotted leaf mould their roots are ventilated with plenty of broken charcoal but since they are gross feeders there is something else it is blood from the butchers that they are greedy at times to drink and it is that which pleases mamselle fanchette her eyes glitter like a tigers i like to hear that she says they are brave trees and earn their right to be the wedding tokens of women who love brave men and she sniffs at the blossoms as if she found a new savour in them o she loves blood you take a symbol for a sentiment cried isabella you do you horrid boy i know fanchette better than you and she would not hurt a mouse why do you try to spoil my pretty grove for me i think i will never come here again i should be sorry for that said bissy gravely then do not say such things any more what were you peering at when i came in bissy wiped his right hand on his breeches then nipping the ladys tender little palm in it drew isabella to the violet clump bend down and look in he said she obeyed and there was a monstrous toad returning her gaze its golden eyes stared unwinking at her its slow throat pulsated do you know bissy whispered the girl after a moments pause that he has a wonderful jewel in his head bagattella said bissy who told you so that is not respectful bissy i know because i know that should be enough for you come away and i will tell you the reason she had a lively imagination and she made up on the spot when the first mother ate the forbidden fruit she found a stone in it which her little white teeth could not crack so she took the stone from her pretty mouth and threw it away but it was really the stone and not the flesh which contained the secret of the tree of knowledge so that she gained nothing by her disobedience as it has always been easy to see but a toad being the lowliest thing on earth crept and found the stone and tried to swallow it which it has never been able to do to this day though you may see it all puffed and swollen with the effort for the stone stuck in its head where it still remains for anybody to find bissy put out his underlip with polite incredulity if anybody knows anybody can have it ah said isabella you are a very clever bissy but there is something more one must not take life in recovering the stone since it contains the principle of all life and therefore if you kill the toad as you must do to gain the stone you will find nothing for your pains which toad said bissy why this one but it is not the only toad in the world it is the only toad that matters to my story said isabella what a little plague you are with your questions come i want to see my golden lily is it full out yet yes madonna said bissy i will race you there quick is anybody looking the imp hesitated glowed a little then put himself in position one two three off they ran across the grove out of it by a green opening and so on to the slope of sward bending to the backwater visible from the ford isabella flushed and dishevelled was first by a yard or two o she cried the love bissy i must have it bissy i must gravity shook its head judicial theres no way but to wade and through the mud wade then i am too little and i have no love for the water madonna then i shall go myself and you shall look on i am your servant madonna it is my duty to obey o what an excellent servant he will not stir from his post though i drown laughing and wilful she stepped into the water staggered a little found her balance and went cautiously forward the mud sucked at her dainty shoes captured one and still she was not deterred she had almost reached the prize when the sound of rolling wheels broke upon her ears she paused aghast we have heard what followed chapter iii the compact even as he spoke tiretta regretted and blushed over the nature of his mission it was not its insolence that was nothing in those days it was its obvious misapplication for here was no rustic hebe no frolic campagnarde as he had at first inclined to suppose but a damsel of position as seemed somehow evident from her manner that eloquent to him of the inexplicable shibboleth of caste told him being a gentleman and a gileadite that he had presumed he awaited in considerable trepidation her answer it followed and without hesitation witheringly enough my will monsieur now and always is to be spared the impertinences of strangers if she could be more than gracious to her inferiors don philips daughter could repel crushingly the undesired approaches of her equals tiretta with a thorn in his heart could not but observe and admire with what grace the bedraggled little beauty commanded the situation how sopped and ruffled as she was she could triumph in her conscious indignation over unflattering circumstance her hair was tumbled her pretty hat was awry her two little feet peeped from their muddy fringe and one had no shoe on it yet booted and martial as he was she could make him feel his inferiority in a way that was at once a charm and a humiliation impertinence madam he said is the last thing i made myself deputy for if she interrupted him you know the terms of your own service monsieur better than i i would accept the lesser dishonour if i were you and go without more words he flushed up to the roots of his hair do you see this madam he said he held out the green intaglio i fling it from me as i do your unpardonable innuendo and he spun the accursed thing from him into the middle of the pool isabella paralysed an instant the next turned her back on him come bissy she said i need a gentleman escort and you shall be mine to the carriage but bissy hung back his eyes were fixed on the pool his thoughts on the covetable plunder so wantonly or happily committed to it was it conceivable a man might dare for profit what he had refused to gallantry the ring had shone and looked heavy the water in the creek was daily sinking and even while he pondered madam de gonzals flushed and peevish hove into view followed by aquaviva in a state of dancing irritation the gouvernante paused in heavy wonder over the tableau presented heyday she said what is the meaning of all this cannot i close my eyes a moment but you must be forgetting yourself and your position little infanta of spain an endless insufferable task for one is it not her thick lidded eyes travelled from isabella to the stranger and back again who is this and what have you been doing my god a fine state you are in all dumb and confounded too fie fie girl dont tell me it is an assignation she wheeled round on aquaviva red with fury it is a trick is it you have been throwing dust in my eyes you infamous old scoundrel you have been lending yourself to this tryst on the pretence of instructing her excellency in horticulture dust roared the old man it is the dust you yourself raise that blinds you what do you all mean interfering with my work and disturbing the peace of my garden i want nothing more than to be rid of the lot of you isabella cried the gouvernante i answer for myself madam said the girl her face quite pale and set and never you may be sure but with silence to insult i am sorry you are displeased with my state but your father the duke shall hear of it cried the old lady i will tell him myself said isabella and of your interpretation of it it is a natural one is it not said madam but with a falling face to the marquise de gonzals said isabella shall we return to the carriage madam tiretta with a fine red on his cheek came forward i also he said desire to answer for myself the count of falckenstein eh cried the marquise with a little whisk and start i said the count of falckenstein madam happening to cross yonder ford a few minutes ago on his road to milan encountered the vision of a nymph exploring these waters knee deep in quest of lilies and sent me with a compliment to greet the subject of so charming a picture that upon my honour constitutes my share in this assignation the old dames face while tiretta spoke was a study perplexity struggled there with amazement and relief she laughed as he finished on a little high note of understanding and indulgence and it was very natural of his excellency she said i for one decline to blame him for it when rank forgets itself in such naughty vagaries as misss here it must look to be accepted by strangers at its own valuation luckily as you will please to inform the count the like of this is with her excellency a rare ebullition she can do justice to her training as you have heard and i though made the victim of the principles i have inculcated can rejoice at least in such vindication of my teaching she dropped or rather heaved a profound curtsey and tiretta bowed as profoundly an obeisance in which he sought to include furious as he was at heart the object of this jobation but isabella standing pale and haughty was very far from responding an apology madam she said from us he will please to inform the count i think i have not heard you aright pooh child said the marquise good humouredly you have heard and i have heard but it is possible we may draw different conclusions bon voyage monsieur we had some news of his excellencys passing tiretta rejoined his travelling companion who during all this time had been chafing in his inability to detect what was passing within the enshrouding coverture of foliage the archduke greeted him with some impatience well he said did beauty accept the gage the gage said tiretta lies sunk and damned to all eternity within the pool she threw it there i threw it there you sir i your highness and may you be damned with it before i consent ever again to risk being mistaken for your pander the prince shrinking amazed a moment as if he had been struck stalked to the carriage entered it and sat down shall i walk said tiretta grimly at the door the other hesitated then silently peremptorily touched the seat beside him tiretta without a word occupied it and the carriage rolled on its way presently urged beyond endurance joseph spoke this is very amusing you would appear to have met with some rebuff surely in so harmless a gallantry you would not blame me for consequences quite unforeseen is it injured vanity or anothers innuendo that saddles you with that hurtful title anothers innuendo said the soldier shortly the ladys the ladys she said she said what the infanta isabella daughter of don philip was privileged to say to a poor devil approaching her with that insult in his hand it was the infanta it was the infanta tiretta my dear friend tell me exactly what were her words she desired sir to be spared the impertinences of strangers and when i answered with the respectful gallantry of my mission she retorted as only a woman can retort with impunity a woman yet the vision of that child i am sorry for you tiretta and i am sorry for myself you have need to be why did she know me for whom i was i can answer for the marquise i cannot answer for her likely not and if likely happily not else i think you would find her more woman than child if you came to woo be content for that if it pleases you i do not fancy from what i noticed that the marquise will enlighten her you can be sorry provisionally nevertheless the young archduke gloomed and was silent for a while it was not that he resented the others freedom tiretta was constituted his privileged favourite for the time being and might speak his mind liberally on most matters it was rather perhaps that he cogitated the invidious position of princes who having austere far seeing mothers to arrange matches for them must accommodate themselves at bidding to double leading strings without being given a choice as to the partner with whom they were destined to run in couple it made no difference that inclination in himself might jump with anothers policy he would have wished to be free to woo in the sense that tiretta being of the small and independent meant it he did not fear the issue he only coveted the free will which would have lent a glamour to the pursuit what if after all he were to find himself bound to one predisposed against him he wished that she knew him and knew him better so for the time at least had that rebellious vision wrought upon his emotions presently with a sigh he looked up she struck me as very beautiful tiretta he said well i am prejudiced answered the soldier drily i cannot admire unkindness that is to be the true child you are said joseph affection is the only beauty to a childs perceptions besides you are not very susceptible i think to feminine attractions i have observed that in you o have you come tiretta man cheer up after all the young ladys vindication of her position was the commendable thing one might have regarded her escapade otherwise in a less admiring light so the keeper no doubt counsels resignation to the poor wretch he has caught and mauled in a mantrap joseph laughed he thought the comparison in their relative positions ridiculous of course he did what importance had this dear fellows feelings in the context the point was that he himself might have been misrepresented to the lady following that train of thought he fell into a profound meditation from which he did not rouse himself for several minutes then he stirred like a man who had come to a conclusion which was to be immutable and final i wish said he satisfaction on a point or two as to whether for instance that escapade argued a characteristic lack of dignity on the ladys part or was due merely to a rare ebullition of high spirits instigated possibly by opposition yes said tiretta i wish if properly assured on that question to ascertain what is the ladys real opinion of me and if she was led in any way to associate my near presence with the episode yes said tiretta i am not a bad fellow said joseph am i tiretta you are a very good fellow answered the soldier grumpily and i am not a bad friend you too are a good friend one i am sure who would be glad to explain his comrade in the best light to one whose good opinion his comrade coveted tiretta did not answer for a moment his eyebrows were a little up his lips a little compressed presently he opened them let us speak without equivocation he said you wish me to go and act the part of paolo to your francesca joseph smiled to speak what your heart believes of me i am to talk of the fairy prince of his virtues of his graces of his capacity for romantic love and more lasting affection say the best you can of me would you not fear paolo no no my friend his duty his loyalty his insensibility and much more than that i flatter myself you mean well at least she would not flatter me it would be your chance to prove yourself to her to rectify false impressions in these matters troubadours are privileged let me understand you fully you think she may have formed a prejudice against you you want that impression corrected are you to marry her then it seems so and how should i be accredited leave that to me i will see that you are given the opportunity to approach her the rest your heart will tell you we are to communicate and she and i maybe when you have paved the way for friendships sake tiretta for none other you may be sure i do not like my task put it into a song into many songs that will lighten it for you i wish for the occasion i could sing myself but in spite of policy i will woo my own way in this he dismissed the subject in a little its temporary glamour evaporated after all he had much and of paramount importance to think upon apart from it chapter iv loves ambassador the italy of the eighteenth century has always given me a sense of distressing incongruity such a sense of incongruity as i feel in the presence of performing animals pitifully and patiently caricaturing their own native dignity in forced postures and mirthless habiliments to see a petticoated elephant seated on a stool drinking tea to see a dog on his hind legs with a shako on his head shouldering a musket makes me i confess uneasy and ashamed so in the land of the visconti of the sforza of the medici a land where both the magnificence of crime and the magnificence of achievement have always gone habited in a certain appropriate splendour akin to that of the leopard in his forest and the tiger in his jungle the vision of powder and patches with their concomitants of mincing uncleanness and affectation seems an outrage on ones conception of the accepted fitness of things if you would study that incongruity as at least i feel it in its more plausible phases turn to the finer works of canaletto if in its grossest read the memoirs of that arch scoundrel casanova memoirs which to me a fond enough student of the period in its prettier aspects reek with that sort of fetor which gets into ones clothes as it were and for a time infects all healthier savours the fact is i suppose that codes of manners and of conduct evolved under particular conditions of society are not always applicable to alien conditions during the era of the aristocracy in england powder and punctilio were some visible tokens of an amelioration in the old order of things which had considered overbearance and pugnacity essential to the man of spirit they spoke a real improvement in the attitude of class towards class and if that attitude was at first superficial its practice gradually engendered the consideration which it had begun only by affecting in italy it is to be feared society adopted the code but eschewed its moral all the observances all the extravagances of an accepted fashion were seized upon by it with greed only the underlying truth was never recognised or developed the essential inhumanity remained the same the arrogance of rank was unsoftened torture survived without a thought of its outrage not to man but to reason fashion in its baser aspects produced i suppose more preposterous fops in eighteenth century italy than in any other country of europe and all because that hot vivid latin race had accepted the imposition of a code which was quite alien to its blood and its instincts it was not yet ripe for the change implied it was idle dressing up for a part it did not understand it could not in bagwig and velvet shorts think garrick and play macbeth it is most natural to picture the monarchs and infantes of spain in trunk hose and with bristling stiletto beards fierce haughty tyrants of a piece with the colour and fury of their times you must picture don philip however under a very different aspect he sits at the moment at a table in his private cabinet at parma a rather solemn looking macaroni of thirty eight writing like buffon in lace ruffles with a gold pen and appearing more concerned over the right balance of his toupet than over the equilibrium of the european concert you would observe were he to rise that he has a defect still noticeable though mitigated by the craft of his tailor one of his shoulders is distinctly higher than the other which gives him in his efforts to correct the discrepancy a rather stiff unelastic appearance in his younger days he was said by flattering chroniclers to possess nevertheless a charming figure he had also an equable temper which for an infante of spain and son of that moody monarch philip v and his imperious spouse elizabeth farnese was something to his credit it is more to his credit now perhaps that through much and prolonged test of its qualities his temper preserves its even character he takes life in fact very easily and has no objection in the world to have his wife described and treated as the better horse he is quite willing to take the picturesque lead in the tandem while she pulls the cart of state after all he has played his effective part in the achievement of their present position and has laurels if rather withered ones to rest upon he was inclined as a youth it was said to the study of military science and he has actually been a soldier and has fought his way and stubbornly fought it to the enjoyment of these possessions of his which were procured him originally through the persistent restless intriguing of his mother now in the sense of prolonged security he has grown slothful and satisfied with minor triumphs the greatest of which latterly has turned upon the successful nature of the negotiations for his daughters marriage with the austrian crown prince isabelita is it would really appear to be an empress some day not so bad a match for the daughter of only a younger son of spain papa is very pleased and inclined to regard the occasion as in the nature of a personal reward for years of comparative privation and ducal cheese paring he has not in fact to this day succeeded in bringing the profit and loss accounts of the duchy into line now as he sits writing he strikes us as being a thought over bedizened for the task and the hour which is early everything upon him you will remark is conceived according to a taste slightly in excess of that which is the northmans limit his smooth fronted toupet stands up eight inches from his forehead and is surmounted by a roll of sausage curls which descend to two veritable pains caf behind his ears his cravat is a very muffler of valenciennes and is fastened by a brooch as big as a shoe buckle though presumably in nglig he wears over a lace ruffled cambric shirt puffed from elbow to wrist and garnished with mushroom coloured ribbons a pink silk vest covered with silver net and shoes and breeches to match dividing a space of white silk stockings complete the elaborate picture the only concession to business apparent about him is his ample loose sleeved camisole and even that is made of grey velvet lined with ermine altogether he suggests a hogarth beau a thing which somewhat travestying fact in the artists own country would pass for a faithful transcript here the room in which we discover his excellency is small but appropriately furnished there is a good deal of glass and glitter in it a characteristic perfume some bright sketches by boucher and a lancret fte galante and as noticeable a feature as any is a great dish of sweetmeats having a little table of rosewood with brass mouldings to itself the duke is writing to his wife at versailles he sucks a comfit as he evolves without difficulty his periods simple souls often better than intellectual write good letters i have known an ingenuous athlete express himself with a neatness and clarity i could envy without reaching here are some sentences which i extract as pertinent to our story from the ducal epistle all goes well according to our latest advices and the official demand for our daughters hand will certainly be presented to his majesty your father within a month from this date so far so excellent and the days when in your own phrase we lived like ragamuffins are buried even to their shadows let us have a mass said for their souls poor things for they possessed some virtues we have here lately arrived the most popular chanteur since farinelli he comes with a letter of recommendation to the marquise de ravilla from the archduke himself and is to charm our daughter into love with a shadow whose approach she has dreaded a little that suggestion is for your exclusive ear ma mie it emanates from one who is very cunning and very observant the gonzals no less and is founded upon the presumed consciousness of somebody that he had belittled himself his rank and his moral stature in somebody elses eyes you will recall that little incident of the carriage and the ford as i passed it on to you in madams own words certainly according to her it had its effect upon an over sensitive nature predisposed perhaps to prejudice somebody had already been pictured to this frank nature it seems in the light of a philosopher and prig she may not associate the two the stranger of the ford that is to say and the philosopher but she may come to or may have her suspicions and anyhow he may think that she does and be anxious to eliminate at once a bad impression so this tiretta is despatched to play the part of loves advocate with offended beauty i do not vouch for the truth of this or endorse its policy i repeat only for your private ear what the marquise of her shrewdness conjectures she for her part is so sure of the truth of her surmise that she wants the man sent to colorno that there amid romantic environments suggestive to the heart of contemplation the points of his fond advocacy may be sympathetically pondered she says that it would be flying in the face of loves providence to frustrate somebodys obvious purpose and design that that impression referred to whether it concerns itself with prig or rou or worse still with both is hardly one of happy augury for the future and calls for exceptional treatment that in fine if somebody has contrived this thing somebody knows what he is about and has made himself responsible for his instrument in the meantime our newly arrived improvisatore exhibits his qualities to triumphant effect he is a soldier and a fine man but this gift comes to him apart from his training god knows whence he will sing and rhyme you an hour on end and observe he is very flattering though veiled in allusions to a supreme lord and comrade who possesses his heart to these passages the sick duchess answered in due course and with a characteristic warning the whole gist of which may be conveyed in a single sentence as to this minstrel beware that the medicine my pippo does not prove a drug given for a definite purpose but afterwards indulged in for its own sake a really preposterous suggestion which it was incumbent on a cadet of spain to wave aside with the briefest comment you make me smile dearest wife you positively amuse me the man is to be regarded like a courier as a mere vehicle for the conveyance of an august document of the heart he would hardly commit the absurdity i think of associating his own personal insignificance with the message he was employed to deliver any more than the fiddle could it speak would claim to be other than a vulgar structure of wood and string obedient only to the hand of its master and denuded of all importance the moment that hand was withdrawn believe me ma chrie the percipience of the unelect is not so negligible a quantity as you would seem to imagine this instrument if indeed an instrument it is will play its part with a full sense of the momentary distinction that part confers upon it yet without a thought but of sinking thereafter into the oblivion which is its necessary destiny if it were otherwise there remain means to persuade it yet it cannot be otherwise i think i may answer for our daughter that she will entertain no delusions as to the relative values of the hand and of the instrument upon which it plays which certainly is quite enough said upon that small subject yet it was a very small subject who once crept through the keyhole of the kings treasury and robbed his magnificences coffers chapter v il trovatore isabella mistrusted few people and disliked nobody for long she was one of those happily constituted girls who are troubled with no problems have no quarrel with destiny and never resent their not having been born boys she had endearing looks and a fine spirit but without self consciousness in the one or arrogance in the other she was never in arms for the prerogatives of her sex because it never occurred to her that they were being either questioned or abused if she coquetted at all it was more with women than with men yet she was equally natural with both as sweet a princess as perdita as sweet a milkmaid she would have been had fortune deposed her impressionable poor child it was a pity only that nature not sparing her the softest of hearts should have done so little to protect its own rich achievement from harm but nature bent only on relentless propagation designs these triumphant things as lures isabella during all her young life had endeared herself with whomsoever she had visited grandpapa louis the cynic and impure doted upon his charmante haughty grandmamma in spain had on her death left her the solitary bequest devoted by that opulent lady to her lords relations isabella did not want the money but she wept over that proof of affection while papa philip tried not to weep tears of chagrin over being left out in the cold however in that dismal poverty of the exchequer something to somebody was better than nothing to nobody and i have no doubt that the legacy was taken into account in all subsequent dispositions of the young infantas household wealth after all is like the other things size and sound relative we are not to suppose you and i that because a certain thousand a year might appear to us opulence a duke might not consider himself a pauper on fifty times that income i do not know what the revenues of parma represented to don philip in hard cash i do know that he was constantly and piteously complaining to his royal relatives of his embarrassments one mans affluence is another mans necessity else you and i again might have criticised the expenditure of the parmese court have commented on the waste the idle profusion of a state which for mere vanitys sake must boast a superfluity of service which it was inadequate to support have suggested a drastic economy here a wholesale retrenchment there we should have been assured no doubt that all that could be done had been done and that only the indispensable remained a possibly unanswerable statement from the opposite to our own point of view from that standpoint the emptiness of the great palace at colorno during the absence of the court was so qualified an emptiness that its superfluous inmates could still have peopled a substantial villa or two and left something over for emergencies besides the personal staff which included attendants preceptors valets and grooms sufficient with a lady of the wardrobe two femmes de chambre and some minor officials attached to isabella alone the gardens the stables the kitchens the guard house all gave indolent occupation to a small garrison of retainers who mostly idle and mostly gossips numbered amongst themselves none perhaps quite so pert and so voluble as fanchette becquet the infantas first femme de confiance fanchette who hailed from paris had attained her present post more through private and particular interest than through particular merit there were reasons for this it was understood which it was not necessary to divulge but of which the girl herself was fully sensible and of which she would have been the last not to take ample advantage there was no high born lady of the court who presumed or was allowed to presume so much on her position as fanchette her very audacity and insolence of retort possessed for certain masculine minds a charm which was a perpetual source of indulgence and profit to her the duke himself had been known to suffer her impertinences with an enjoying relish which redounded in no ways to her disadvantage in style and temper she was a veritable parisian mondaine dapper and pretty though her lips were a little thin and her nose a little sharp she had no heart at all but her emotions easily responsive to small provocation blinded herself and others to that defect fanchette one evening was finishing her young lady in preparation for a descent to the audience chamber to which was coming m du tillot marquis de felino and secretary of state and was taking full advantage of the licence allowed her tongue by a spoiling mistress it is fortunate is it not your highness she said with a little simper that somebody whom we know does not approve of rouge for ladies she was daintily fitting as she spoke a spray of natural pink rose buds into the silken fillet which bound the girls unpowdered chestnut brown hair isabellas laced bodice was of the simplest meet sheath for the flower like neck and bosom which emerged from it a sacque like a drooped petal fell from between her shoulder blades her slender hips were innocent of the grotesque abomination of hoops so she was permitted in that court of burlesque and man millinery to indulge her own humorous navet it gave her an odd distinction not unagreeable to papas pride he would sternly repress any inclination detected in others to ape servilely that natural innocence isabelita should be the only sweet arcadian in parma if she was to be hebe in a raree show she alone should display the delicious novelty of acting humanly while the puppets reversing their part looked on and applauded and yet to isabella herself hers was no part at all but only the most natural of instincts fanchette she said your voice sounds very demure or else i am very stupid was it weighted or was it not with some meaning i did not understand only that mademoiselles cheek so sensitive to sudden changes of feeling is its own best interpreter interpreter of what and to whom fanchette ah i have blundered said the maid and now i am full of confusion it would be too daring in me to suggest well i will not ask you to said isabella does my cheek satisfy you now but it does not blush for what you think only to be made the target to gossips and impertinents o mademoiselle o your highness let me go and weep my heart out in solitude i have offended you and without the least little thought of offence o let me go mademoiselle dont be silly fanchette i am not blaming you for the idle chatter you repeat people may think what they like about rouge without its affecting my fortunes that is all sensitive there is nobody in the world so absurdly sensitive as yourself i believe come she rose to her feet with a coaxing smile the maid held in her hand a little ornament of paste and silver with which she had been about to fasten the flowers into place isabella took the trinket from her and putting an arm round the over slim waist tried the effect of the thing against fanchettes own powdered locks it is like sparkles of ice through mist she said it suits you ever so much better than it does me will you accept it for your own fanchette and bring me something else fanchette sobbed wiping an eye which yet had a covetous side glance for the toy im sure i meant no presumption she gurgled or to abuse the confidence your highness reposes in me i only thought your highness would approve sincerity better than an affectation of ignorance which your highness must know could not be real isabella sighed there girl she said there to be sure i like sincerity where what is to be is an open secret continued fanchette and somebodys tastes so coincide with your highnesss i i thought your highness would be gratified to know isabella laughed and then sighed again as she released her hold with a little conciliatory pat and reseated herself a movement which gave fanchette an opportunity furtively to examine her prize i daresay i am said the infanta it is gratifying at least she stopped it is gratifying at least said the maid who had resumed her duties to learn as your highness was about to remark that philosophy can so concern itself with natural beauties but indeed there are other proofs that a fine complexion is not the only thing honoured in vienna i suppose i ought not to ask you what you mean fanchette mademoiselle has not heard of the chevalier tiretta no such a voice your highness and such a man he is a gift from the archduke to his excellency and has been ravishing the courts of parma with his music these days past they say well i hardly like to repeat do not then that somebody in love has made this nightingale his avant coureur to overture his passion do they say girl i think indeed your idle fancy is the only gossip fanchettes head was seen in the mirror to nod itself and her strait lips to smile it is not fancy at least she said but simple reason your highness to deduce from this singer that philosophy may have its sentimental side else it would not choose for its close intimacy as is whispered to be the case so picturesque a comrade or having chosen select him for a mission so romantic isabella rose there was a little stately chill in her young aspect that is quite enough she said i do not wish to listen to any more of this nonsense or to seem to encourage you to repeat it give me my fan and mouchoir please it is time for me to descend at the door a couple of powdered valets de chambre greeted the young lady low bowing and candle in hand preceded her down the broad stairway to the salle daudience it was a fine chamber bemirrored bemarbled with a pillared balcony through which the soft night air flowed in penury or plenty there was nothing here no seat no ornament no picture between the painted ceiling and the rich deep carpet but declared itself in terms of gilt and splendour a thing of luxury the room was brilliantly lighted by a multitude of wax candles set in girandoles and as isabella announced by a gentleman usher entered it each separate flame bowed to her as to the goddess for whom they had all been waiting there were only three people present the gouvernante in an elaborate toilette and stupendous hoop m du tillot short complacent in a blaze of silk and embroidery and a second gentleman a stranger somewhat soberly dressed who stood in the background bowing low so that his face showed foreshortened the secretary of state came forward beaming ingratiatory tripping on his fat little pumps he bowed elaborately over the hand which isabella gave him and kissed it as if he were negotiating an oyster i greet your highness he said on behalf of the court myself and above all his excellency your father who i rejoice to inform you is very well and my maman monseigneur asked isabella her eyes full and shining she writes in the best of spirits said du tillot like one who finds in the promised fruition of her hopes a glad new lease of life he was a kind old man the formality achieved he pressed the little palm and looking at the lowered lids we will do our best will we not my child he said to justify maman in her convalescence i want maman to be well above all things in the world said isabella simply and then the gouvernante struck in in her high throaty voice eh bien it is very well to wish for others what our self will is inclined to deny them it seemed unnecessary but madam had that way of grudging its perfect bloom to harmony to which certain minds having a mistaken sense of humour are wont seemingly irresistibly to be moved she could not forego her grumble even where policy counselled silence she would deliberately invite offence and then resenting being treated as offensive would study though she had to bide her time for it to make herself as unendurable as possible am i self willed asked isabella appealing to the minister but though she spoke plaintively there was a spark of ominous colour in her cheek you are your mothers true daughter answered du tillot with a glance of annoyance at the marquise you will yield to loving reason what you would ever refuse to dictation but that is neither here nor there in the light of my present business which is to introduce to your highnesss good favour he wheeled with an expressive gesture the person of the chevalier tiretta a gentleman of the viennese court and as admirable a musician and improvisatore as he is a soldier of tried merit isabella was conscious of a little thrill and shock as she turned to the hitherto unregarded stranger then a flush mantled her face from chin to brow and she dropped a curtsey quite repellent in its frigidity she knew him at once how could she fail to or to associate this and that in the sudden leap of recognition a sense of indignation of recoil as from an astounding revelation were the predominant emotions in her mind then fanchettes gossip and the one conclusion to be drawn from it she hardly heard the purring phrases of the secretary of state as he improved upon his opening his excellency your father deploring his prolonged absence from his child sends her this voice to interpret sweetly for him the love his heart is withheld from expressing he entreats her to share with him a treasure his affection will not permit him to monopolise and to preserve and honour it against his soon return isabellas cheek as if to vindicate fanchettes claim had gone from red to white she turned her back on the stranger i needed no such proof of my papas love she said to du tillot or of any instrument however accommodating to interpret it to me but you will assure him from me monsieur that his daughter will not fail to give honour where honour is due heyday cried the marquise she had been effervescing where she sat her eyes glassy and a mirthless smile on her fat old lips this is not self will to be sure this is a graceful yielding to reason and a fine reception of his excellencys honoured protg what do you mean child abusing your fathers consideration and insulting his deputy in this fashion all this to be sure was grievously embarrassing to the stranger who had to stand during this dispute feeling very much like an actor who has come forward to make an unwelcome explanation and holds his ground biding an abatement in the storm of hisses and orange peel which greets him his mouth twitched it is true and there was a ghost of a twinkle in his mournful eyes otherwise his aspect was one of profound wonder and deprecation but the gonzals wrought up now to the full fury of her resentment would by no means consent to forego in the face of this wounded appeal the moral triumph it afforded her she got to her feet fuming and ejaculating and while m du tillot arched his brows in lost amazement over the scene hurried across to the chevalier and seizing his two hands in hers panted out a flurry of apology explanation protest no wonder you look surprised monsieur no wonder you look hurt this reception of his excellencys gift of an honoured subject and comrade moreover of one whose least recommendation should entitle its bearer to our utmost attention and consideration it is unaccountable it is infamous it reflects upon my careful tuition in a way which is humiliating to a degree i beg you to attribute to nothing but a spoilt caprice this seeming abuse of a favour which others less self willed can appreciate at its worth to forget a slight but here du tillot grim and peremptory thought fit to interfere the chevalier said he is i am sure more taken aback over this tirade than over any imaginary provocation to it her highness said nothing to which exception could be taken by a reasonable mind and as to the fine instrument if monsieur will forgive me the figure of speech she has as yet heard its virtues only trumpeted by others he turned to isabella with a smile the girl was quite white i did not mean to imply such offence she said if my manner suggested a spoilt caprice monsieur will know how to interpret it at its true value she would say no more she seated herself on a sofa and set to fanning her face as if its aspect were not already chill enough du tillot puzzled by the equivocalness of her words met the situation nevertheless with diplomatic tact this romantic essay if indeed it were one as privately surmised had not opened propitiously possibly the girls prejudice against her royal suitor was more deep seated than they supposed yet how could she have guessed this troubadours presumptive mission it was merely conjecture with the best of them it would seem that only to be accredited from vienna was offence enough in her eyes at the same time he was furiously angered with the marquise over her outburst what did the old fool manuvring to bring about this situation and then spoiling it by belittling her charge in the eyes of austrias representative he could have slapped her gross old arms viciously and with joy but he did nothing so impolitic on the contrary he tripped over to the cross old lady and bantered her charmingly and playfully on her temper the ardour of her spirit he said bespoke the youth which was perennially reluctant in her to quit the temple of its triumphs and conquests but was not the generosity of sentiment characteristic of that vernal condition a little apt sometimes to wax unnecessarily hot in defence of its enthusiasms there had been no slight intended here he would answer for it either to an exquisite gift or to her fine appreciation of it enthusiasms cried madam but she was already mollified i assert nothing for my part but an unquestioning faith in the perfection of those accents which the tenderest regard has chosen to be its interpreter and which shall answer to your faith i give my word said du tillot madam laughed high after such assurance she said the chevalier has no choice but to submit his credentials what shall it be monsieur love friendship philosophy say philosophy as applied to love the strangers mandolin was lying on the harpsichord he lifted it with the quietest air of acquiescence and caressing it in his arms as if it had been a dear infant touched out a disconnected note or two thence his fingers seemed to wander haphazard over the strings seeking while his abstracted eyes pursued their theme the point where thought and setting should blend into one alliance melodious and expressive and presently the words came apply philosophy to love as salve is applied to a wound and lo as the wound is healed so is the salve infected with its virus if love then shall live philosophy must die so ran his theme followed with an infinite elaboration of word and note to the little rippling cadenza on which it ended it was very finished very clever but with scarce a suggestion of real feeling behind it only the soft flexibility of the voice seemed to suggest itself a medium for nobler inspirations it was very sweet in quality and very moving the marquise applauded the improvisation sky high what do you think now little grudger she said with a triumphant look at isabella has not monsieur justified in himself his highnesss gift it is for you in turn to propose the theme i think responded the young lady coldly but with a faint rose of colour on her cheek that love is a vulgar complaint and philosophy a rare one i would let love for my part be the one to die since he is the easier spared monsieur perhaps will sing us his requiem monsieur bowed low a smile in his eyes while madam shooting a significant glance at du tillot set to fanning herself scornfully once again the fingers fluttered lightly on the strings and once again gradually disentangled from them as it were a flowering spray from a thicket a tender lydian measure love died of isabel and lay at rest slain by the cold sweet arrows from her breast and as he quiet slept came isabel to view the cruel work shed done so well when as is wont to hap the wound shed given broke forth anew denouncing her to heaven for whom death answered dropping from above now is my reign established quit of love for my sake did you do this thing then she ah no but that i loved philosophy so hardly had she spoke when with a spring love rose and laughing joyously took wing madam at the finish broke into rapturous applause il fait tourner la chance she cried with a rocking laugh il fait tourner la chance o that was very well indeed monsieur you have the true genius for improvisation but du tillot secretly watchful shook his head just perceptibly i hope not too daring he thought noticing the girls face isabella neither applauded nor dissented a liberty her aspect might have denoted was best rebuked by contemptuous silence only when presently the marquise called the stranger to her side she rose as if in quick avoidance of his neighbourhood and addressed herself exclusively for the rest of the evening to the secretary of state but when the gentlemen were gone one of them in the stinging consciousness of an obeisance unacknowledged she turned upon the gouvernante with real anger in her eyes did you not recognise him madame the old lady actually quailed before the inquisition of that look what if i did she said sullenly what then and draw the only conclusion that one can draw from his presence here you are a fool and a prude cried the marquise bursting out suddenly between fury and trepidation my god i think i have never known such another all this to do about a piece of pleasantry that was nothing in itself and should count for less than nothing in the context of that sincere and noble nature which condescends to honour you with its regard the selection by such a prince of an instrument to sing his devotion in your ears should be enough to convince you of the high character of his deputy but whether you like the chevalier or not and whatever your sense of filial duty you have got to endure him that is all aye and to listen to him too it will not be your fault at least madame said isabella if my ears by this time are not inured to offence and very pale with her head high she walked out of the room chapter vi non dolce far niente and so we reach a situation which having no least authority to complicate itself must suffice us in its simplicity to the end it is a situation as old as the human drama it has formed the groundwork for a thousand tales of passion and infidelity more fierce more involved than this that i relate it embraces for its essentials but three characters the lady and the diffident lover and the false friend yet although our version may not rank in poignancy with the tragedy of the rimini or in homeliness with the courtship of miles standish it can claim for its main details that virtue of truth which ennobles even little calamities above the finest ecstacies of the imagination it is into a brief idyll of love and summer then that we are now to penetrate would it might begin and end there in the green gardens to flow in tennysons words sweetly on and on calming itself to the long wished for end full to the banks close on the promised good but alas though the spirit of romance plead to us soft as his loveliest temptress to st anthony our historical conscience must remain cold and deaf to its entreaties as things happened so must they be recorded the lady and the lover and the false friend it is such a simple tale and so haunted by precedent that the least sophisticated reader given these premises could surely write it for himself only remember that no such friend was ever false by design nor was this one he began by detesting his task not from conscientious motives but because he went into it branded by the wounding stigma of her who was its object he knew in what comparative light she would regard his advocacy and he knew that in his own conscious acceptance of that estimate was foretold the failure of his mission what value were to be attached to the praises of such a man so would run her thoughts to be belauded by him were to be implied despicable so he would only end by confirming the very complaint he was sent to alleviate and serve those right who had commissioned him it would do them no harm to learn that to strain devotion too far were to have it snap and recoil on themselves at this beginning of things he really believed that he hated the young infanta a sentiment certainly little conducive to the successful accomplishment of his business and it did nothing to put him on better terms with himself to realise with what contemptuous confidence he was delegated to this task joseph or philip it was all the same moral of princely omnipotence he was with both of them just the insensate instrument to be played upon to evoke certain emotions at command and then to be dispensed with as a mere mechanical agent that had served its purpose that he might prove a self conscious agent possessing feelings and passions of his own never seemed to occur to either of them as remotely conceivable he was just turned loose into the green pastures of colorno as a lowly steer might be entrusted to the company of a pedigree heifer entrusted to excite her interest that is to say in the royal bull which was to succeed him by and by he laughed putting that image to himself yet really it was a not exaggerated one only apart from the pledges of so called friendship he was doubtful of his own capacity to excite if the lady started with a prejudice he started with a grudge and the two between them seemed inimical to a right sentimental understanding supposing panegyric were merely to react through him upon its subject in that case the logical course would be to represent joseph as undesirable yet he hardly dared to risk such a chance no he would be faithful to his mission and if that failed well he had not been the one to initiate the business of the green intaglio they must fight it out among themselves and in the meanwhile he would act according to his lights for some days after his installation at the palace he was scrupulous in obliterating himself so far as isabella was concerned he saw the marquise privately and took pains to convince her against her more truculent judgment that his policy for the moment lay in self effacement time and opportunity he said would best decide the manner of his next approach he brought her to agree with him the more easily as that old intriguing bosom could yet find in the attentions of a personable male creature the shadow of an ancient thrill she admired his bright volubility for the chevaliers tongue once loosened he gave it full exercise she admired his romantic looks and more romantic songs they were all for her for this time being and for her the frank confidence which confessed confirming her suspicions the true purpose of his mission they were conspirators together very humorous and understanding in truth the man did not know how to begin that unforeseen antipathy seemed to blight his inspiration and he was glad of the respite he spent much of his time while so temporising in wandering about the spacious grounds they were fair in the italian style with formal walks and fountains and colonnades of marble better still with remoter green recesses where one might lose oneself amidst flowering thickets set here and there with sunk gardens and lily ponds one morning when so strolling he came plump turning a leafy corner upon madame gonzals and her young charges those were three in all the two younger ferdinand and louise sharing pretty equally between them some fifteen years these youngsters drove in a little chaise with a pretty white goat to draw it and isabelita walked smiling at the head tiretta saw the smile fade and the slender figure stiffen in the moment of his appearance he bit his lip as he stopped to greet the cavalcade with a bow ah monsieur cried the marquise with a quick wrathful glance at the young lady this is well encountered we are all hot and tired and would welcome someone who would amuse us they had halted near a rustic bench and thereon the old lady seated herself fanning her moist face fretfully charmed said tiretta what shall i do turn catherine wheels down the alley or run after my own tail like a puppy the little eight year old boy laughed gleefully is that your tail monsieur he said stretching out to touch the chevaliers sword like the scorpions i fain would think young sir said tiretta it hath a sting in it for those who would approach it rashly the boy pulling at the reins looked up with large indolent eyes woa belletto stand still little hog are you a soldier monsieur i am what they call a soldier of fortune sir i fight when i fight to vindicate and extol her name as the knight of la mancha fought for his dulcinea you have heard of him havent i just but i would rather for my part fight for my country isabelitas little hand for all the feigned abstraction of isabelitas eyes and thoughts touched the childs shoulder approvingly he looked round at her wouldnt you lita he said what dear she answered stooping to him wouldnt you rather fight for your country than for mademoiselle fortune of course ferdy how can you ask such a question there was never a knight in the world more worthy than this quixote to wear his spurs said tiretta she was impelled to answer him against her will there was never one who despised fortune more or owed so little to her i do not despise her said tiretta quietly if i did i could not serve her as disinterestedly as this don served his peerless one but a man must have his ideal to inspire him though it be no better than a purse of fairy gold and though it leave him in the end as poor as he began my god what nonsense you all talk cried the marquise crossly and monsieur is the most wilful of the lot he is a brave soldier and he has fought for spain is spain your country asked ferdinand i fight for fortune always for fortune i tell you said tiretta with an obstinate smile the little boy touched his sword again with this monsieur has it killed many people the gonzals laughed loudly it has killed one person said tiretta whose blood mademoiselle your sister will likely tell you has dishonoured it for ever whose said the child eagerly tell me monsieur tiretta drew out the blade an elastic strip of steel long toughened by use and ran his finger along it it belonged he said to an old friend of mine i thought him one of the noblest of men but since like myself he was a mere soldier of fortune that may be nothing but my prejudice he had fought successfully in a number of causes but in the cause of self interest he failed he had many and grave faults a persistent craze for gambling an arrogant temper a furious hatred of the people to hear him fulminate one would have thought he ranked them with the grass ready on the least provocation to mow them down by the acre but he played straight while others robbed him out of his lean purse he pensioned a dishonest rogue grown crippled in his service his temper never impaired his perfect honour and as to his hatred of the people why here after all was the moral of it he met his death rescuing a drunken old woman horrible hideous debased from the hands of a party of miscreants but she was a woman you understand that was in castille and there i stood by his bedside and received this weapon from his hands as a last bequest i have tried to honour it since but never to such honour as when in piercing that scoundrel heart it was used by him nobly to falsify the asserted principles of a lifetime at least so being another soldier of fortune i regard its distinction he slipped the blade back into its scabbard while the children only half understanding him regarded the act in silent curiosity but am i amusing you he cried with a laugh to the marquise as a soldier of fortune i could bring many such pretty tales out of my pack pooh said the old lady impatiently why do you take this perverse pleasure in misrepresenting yourself we know monsieur what we know and that does not conceive the case of a certain exalted mind stooping to intimacy with a worthless adventurer there are patrons whose simple favour speaks all that is needed for the high merit of those they distinguish by it i am not denying it god forbid madam cried tiretta i would not so dishonour his highnesss noble character as to pretend it could find pleasure in base friendships as a prince he is without littleness as a man his instincts always lead him towards the highest it is so without question said the marquise nodding her head delightedly nevertheless said tiretta i hold by my title it hath the warrant of the noblest gentleman ever born of imagination or fact and so i do not use it in irony or self depreciation but as a title to be defended like a kings eh bien said madam indulgently let it remain then as a question of terms be to yourself what you will to us you shall be the knight errant eh isabelita pray do not ask me madam responded the girl coldly i am not a judge of what constitutes a knight errant she quite foresaw the angry protest her tone would evoke and yet she would affect no other everything this man said offended her she saw only design and insincerity behind it this mission he was engaged to fulfil must always be paramount in his mind and her consciousness of that preoccupation made her suspicious of his every sentiment she thought it a pity that one so recommended by his looks and soldierly reputation should condescend to lend himself to such finical rather contemptible practices but no doubt he had been demoralised by flattery there was nothing in the world like a fine voice to convert a man into an insufferable coxcomb the insolence of the light laugh with which he received her snub spoke a whole volume for his impregnable self complacency it brought a flush to her cheeks but the laugh had in reality spoken no more than a tickle of that humour which accepts its own failures whimsically stuff and nonsense cried the marquise you were ready enough with your definitions when you wanted to contradict monsieur but one can no more produce reason from temper than grapes from a thistle or music from that tree cannot one said tiretta hastily interposing with a droll look ah but i do not feel so sure there was a knot of frayed bullion hanging from his sword hilt and picking delicately he unwound from it a single strand of gold wire a yard or so in length this after testing he carried to a branch that overhung the walk and fitting it taut within a natural bow made by the wood contrived a tonic resonant string which daintily touched answered to his manipulation like that of a fairy guitar now he said his head bent to the string and his fingers lightly caressing it shall we see if the little tree will sing to us yes yes cried the children breathlessly you must be very quiet he said it will speak if it speaks at all so soft and shy that a sound would frighten it they sat as dumb as mice as dumb as the hot motionless air about them and presently his fingers moved the merest phantom of music and in the low phantom of a voice he took up their tale what music in the little tree the wind the bird the humming bee they yield their secrets up and sing with tirra lirra down my string the cricket with his shrilling call the little cheeping mouse and all they skip and dance like anything as tirra lirra sounds my string then tap the hidden wood chuck hark his tiny baton on the bark and nightingale stands up to sing his tirra lirra down my string the wire snapped and the singer threw up his arms with a resigning laugh more more cried the children delightedly and the gouvernante applauded with all her might brava bravissima it was the most perfect the most wonderful thing it was wonderful really this man had the inexplicable gift he could have produced music out of a key or a saucepan lid or an old shoe like paganini or some other he seemed to think in it and the appropriate words fitted themselves rhythmically to the sounds it was all done without the least appearance of effort and there was the woodpeckers tap and the nightingales trill unmistakable in their context of course the verse given is an adaptation and i daresay a bad one of the original but it supplies the sense isabella was moved as she could hardly fail to be certainly his voice was a beautiful one she would grant him that he had the right to be conceited about it if he was conceited but she felt all at once a doubt he had sung so prettily and naturally and solely for the childrens sake perhaps after all what she had thought the confident effrontery of his manner betokened no more than the conscious independence of a free spirit he would not be overruled she remembered about his self imposed title that hardly looked like conceit if she could only believe a little in his personal genuineness she might excuse him more it was something in his favour at least that he had undertaken a task so unwelcome as this must be from considerations of pure friendship yet had he done so he was a soldier of fortune he himself had declared it and the lure he followed must always and necessarily be a golden one and straight on the thought the unwarranted meanness of the accusation so recoiled upon herself as to make her seem in its silent utterance the contemptible one that momentary revulsion of feeling wrought its mood penitent and characteristic it was always this affectionate childs instinct to propitiate where she thought she had hurt and if only in thought thought none the less must plead for absolution the little louise leaning from her place had caught the chevaliers arm in both her own and was nestling her plump cheek against it that was pretty and significant it showed he was a man whom children naturally trusted and liked look said the little maid that is litas own lily pond down there lita loves lilies he felt the inopportuneness of the allusion and his lips twitched a trifle as he responded do you know what water lilies are ragazzina no they are the little washing basins of the nixies they do not hold water monsieur ah we who live on land wash in water you see but those who live in the water wash in sunshine if you look very carefully you will see they are all full of it a sweet voice spoke to him i am very proud of my pond monsieur he acknowledged the concession with a little grave inclination of the head you have reason to be madonna and turned and addressed himself to the child again chapter vii love in a mist the next day opened wild and wet in the night a west wind had driven in from the sea and drawn a rushing curtain over the rainbow summer of the gardens isabella for no reason that she could define felt strangely restless and uneasy she was not wont to weather moods or to feel impatience over enforced confinements to her rooms now quite inexplicably that prospect seemed insufferable something in her cried out for space and freedom the call of the wind and the rain reached to her for the first time as though an unsuspected door in her heart had suddenly blown open as sin or fever dreams of water eternally of a cool and cleansing stream so her soul turned with longing to the cold purification of the storm and presently unable to resist she put on cloak and hood and slipped out undetected into the gardens the rain came in her face and blew it as pink as a flower the wind snatched at her hair and caught and played with a fluttering wisp of it as she went on a spirit of exhilaration rose to possess her quite alone and at liberty as she was state and observance seemed unreal things there was not a soul abroad to remind her of them she and nature were in one confidence together as if like old companions long mistily estranged they were as mistily reunited involuntarily it seemed her steps took her towards the spot associated with an incident of yesterday there was a woven arbour near by the lily pond and her thoughts settled there as in a hermitage sweet for meditation she would like to sit and watch the drops plash in the water she pictured the lilies drunk to satiety on the element they loved and expanding their gorged cups till they could stretch no further she foretasted the wet solitude of it all as a refuge from strange unrecognised emotions a little distressful yet a little sweet which seemed suddenly to have overtaken her flowing from some primeval source the flowering borders as she passed them were all gravel splashed and sodden she saw an early blossom that she loved a little blue starry thing of the fennel tribe and stopped to shake its heavy hanging sprays free of water and to pluck one and put it in her bosom then she went on as she neared the arbour an instant panic seized her some sound more self betraying than her own light footfall had penetrated to her through the flapping shutters of the wind a voice a tuneful vibration she stood transfixed her thoughts poised on the prick of swift escape and then she flushed a little and remembered herself she was the infanta mistress of her own actions and of her chosen retreat very resolute she stepped on the trampling rain covering her approach and paused once more herself unseen within close hearing of the sound it was the stranger alone apparently within the arbour and communing with himself through the medium most natural to him for the first time she heard him witless of any audience delivering up his soul like an unconscious bird she felt it like a revelation while she stood spell bound there was no forced cleverness here no artificial display even of the sort that had won the childrens hearts it was just moving thought transmuted into music she hardly gathered the import of the words nor desired to it was enough that they blent themselves inevitably with the haunting melody his fingers drew from the strings and spoke with it a language that was articulate only to the soul the effect was no more nor less than a sensuous selection of sweet sounds gathered as they offered themselves into a fragrant bouquet whose scent to speak in symbols touched the deep tears of things suddenly conscious of something warmer than a raindrop on her cheek isabella started and moved the music ceased on the instant she took her shamefaced courage in hand and entered the arbour he rose from the bench on which he had been seated looking as if he saw an apparition she smiled at him a little faintly you did not know monsieur that this place was sacred to my meditations i did not know madonna what can i do to expiate such desecration not speak in mockery at least ah do i your eyes betray you i think i will be candid with you monsieur it is not the first time i have read them so is it that you regard your mission with so little seriousness he was startled enough on the point of prevaricating will you not tell me the truth she said sincerely his brows bent a little will you have it madonna he answered in a moment see i entered here all unguessing of its holiness to brood alone the weather i thought secured me but there are others it seems who feel its fascination no less will you not forgive the innocent sacrilege and bid me go are we then so distasteful to you that you must leave us in order to brood alone on your injuries perhaps i have injuries but i do not wish to speak of them monsieur i stood a little while outside i say it to my shame listening to you that is to confess and will you not reciprocate my candour please monsieur the pretty entreaty quite disarmed him i will speak the truth he said do you ask me if i take my mission seriously my answer to that is that his highness the archduke might choose a finer advocate to sound his praises but never one more earnest or convinced she looked down drawing in the dust with the point of her little shoe i have always heard of him as a very grave and virtuous prince she murmured believe it true i beg you said tiretta his ideals are the ideals of a conscientious ruler and a noble gentleman he has wisdom beyond his years but free of pedantry most sweet and natural affections a fine presence and a will which if strong is neither arrogant nor obstinate she did not answer for a little and then she looked up well you have fulfilled your part she said was there need to make such a mystery about it there was so little it seems he answered that your highness has guessed it unspoken and yet monsieur is it the whole what more madonna why this paragon of a prince should surely need no panegyrist so to recommend him unless indeed there were a conscious flaw somewhere in his perfection he looked down in his turn then suddenly up again and boldly if high born ladies he said will masquerade as rustic wenches wading for lilies it is no sin to accept them as they appear she drew back quickly i think you may go monsieur she said he bowed and was leaving when she stopped him one moment that sword of yours so dedicated a fine comment on your yesterdays sentiment a woman is a woman is she not and therefore to be saved insult the chevaliers handsome pale face seemed to go a thought whiter it is not in the code he said that princes may not bestow insults your highness took full advantage of that prerogative in refusing the token his eyes were suddenly burning his lips set grim as judgment i have some reason perhaps to brood over my injuries he said they have known no salve your highness will understand since for friendships sake i essayed a thankless task he was again turning to go and again she delayed him monsieur i entreat you a friend i know may act for a friend against his better inclination and only because he is a friend i do not doubt the independence of your mind or the honour of your principles tiretta bowed stiffly but in silence i ask you to forgive me she said it was so sweet and unexpected that for the moment he was quite taken back then his face flushed through all its even pallor it is i who should be the petitioner he said i am your highnesss sworn henchman from this hour she smiled rather tremulously and turning signified with a gesture that she would prefer to be the one to go no monsieur the grove shall be sacred to its songster i beg you to continue to consecrate it as for me i am frightened already over the scolding i shall get if madame detects me returning through the rain he ventured to delay her one moment i am to be permitted to speak henceforth as a true ambassador what my heart dictates o fie monsieur she said to think that perfection could need any trumpeting and with those smiling ambiguous words she left him for some moments after she was gone tiretta stood motionless frowning into vacancy then with a sigh he stirred and perceiving in the act a little spray of some blue flower which had fallen from her bosom to the ground stooped and secured it and held the thing wonderingly in his hand love in a mist he whispered so in the strange north lands my lands they call it love in a mist chapter viii correspondence a couple of communications relating to the rather fantastic business in hand were despatched about this date from colorno the one by tiretta and the other by the gouvernante the soldier wrote inter alia to his royal friend and patron you will recall your words that in this affaire one of policy it is true but still an affaire you were determined to woo your own way cest dire the way of a prince who cannot desire plums but he must have a lackey to put them into his mouth for him well as your highnesss lackey i have the honour to inform your highness that the plum forthcoming is a very blooming and delectable one promising satisfaction on all the points specified and indeed i think on others supernumerary the question is merely if the plum for her part wishes to be devoured but even so there is always a sweet provocation in coyness rest assured at least that i have left nothing undone to commend to it the fine taste of the connoisseur for whose enjoyment it is distinguished in being selected i put it so for the reason that whether by way of intuition or tittle tattle my mission as i soon discovered was suspect that made my task none the easier and none the easier the allaying of the prejudice which as your highness correctly surmised did exist against yourself there is no blinking the fact that the lady had learnt to associate the count of falckenstein of a certain occasion with the heir to the austrian throne and that the knowledge stood at first in the way of a perfect reconciliation between her impressions of fact and the laudatory image even a little strained which i was moved to draw of your highness but that impression i flatter myself and the true devotion which gives fervour to my poor art is surely if slowly in process of readjusting itself and i look confidently to the near time when the complete conversion i anticipate shall see eye to eye with me in the regard of your highnesss true character its essential greatness and nobility in the meanwhile i pray that that state of grace may be quickly forthcoming in order to my release from a task to which nothing but my sense of friendship i say it with all deference could reconcile me carpet mongering is not to my taste nor am i pleased to have my soul sit and grin like a monkey on a hurdy gurdy while i grind out the music to order improvisation to command is a pure paradox is it not so that to end if your highness is dissatisfied with my progress i have only to suggest that i possess another instrument at least as familiar to my hand as the mandolin and as ready to ring true in the service of austria and that your father the emperor waits at this moment for recruits in silesia this missive the young archduke received and pondered in his cabinet at schnbrunn he frowned over it a good deal it interested and yet irritated him truth to tell this romantic venture of his had in the multitudinous pressure of state affairs got rather crowded out of his mind fervours and enthusiasms have a distressing way of dwindling like toy balloons when put aside after an exciting game and of incontinently bursting when one seeks to re inflate them so this unphilosophical afflatus had come to appear just a little limp and puckered to joseph now he was invited to resume it and to threaten if incautiously reblown to explode into thin air the private mission it had inspired appeared to him all at once an extravagance and more calculated to cheapen than to vindicate the imperial virtues which were its theme this affected humility was perhaps a bad precedent to set in view of future relations after all he was answerable to no one but himself for his principles and actions and he was particularly annoyed in that connection to learn that his purpose had been more or less divined tiretta must have managed very badly to make such a thing possible he trusted at least that the suspicion was limited to colorno since he had an idea that the empress were it to reach her ears would strongly disapprove his action on the whole he regretted having embarked on a project which had grown or was growing distasteful to his better sense of fitness and yet that vision the archduke was unphilosophically impressionable as has been said to feminine attractions and fain where women were concerned to be admired for himself rather than his position perhaps all considered as things had progressed so far and so favourably it would be folly to recall his advocate at the crucial moment at the same time there was something in that advocates tone which disturbed him under its veneer of homage he seemed to detect a shadow of mockery a humorous independence of mind an imperfect conception of the sacro sanctity of the task imposed humour if the something was due to that objectionable quality was quite out of place in a matter so momentous he would be relieved to be satisfactorily done with a man whom he had never really fathomed or understood he answered tiretta commending what he had accomplished advising the nicest tact and promising to recall him the moment in the deputys own opinion his mission was fulfilled to the duke of parma madame gonzals wrote as follows your daughter appears irreconcilable in the matter of the chevalier there is so far so little cause for that apprehension once hinted at in correspondence by her august mother that the difficulty is to make either the man or his mission endurable in the girls eyes i should doubt the policy of continuing m le chevalier at colorno were it not that i cannot conceive of such an advocate failing in the long run to impress himself but how often we know the divinely inspired preacher to end by creating between others the emotional ardour which he is incapable of feeling or attracting on his own account such i trust will result from this propagandism of sweet sounds and to the most desirable effect the man is very cunning like a veritable troubadour in singing the praises of his prince there is no direct allusion but the reference is unmistakable at present there is no denying the seed has fallen on difficult ground but i have hopes she listens at least and her comments decreasingly savour of coldness and irony yet it would be to deceive ourselves to pretend that she is as yet more than a potential convert last night m tiretta being entreated to our entertainment and demanding as is his wont a text i gave him the posy he wore in his bosom a little spray of the blossom we call st catherines flower it is the blue flower of martyrdom i said and he answered then shall it inspire me to sing of one i know in vienna who is willing to die for his faith and so he improvised most meltingly on that theme yet to barren effect so far as her highness was concerned i have seldom known her more chill and unresponsive to a sweet ending her face was like a stone eh bien we must console ourselves with the thought that the uttermost resistance often betokens the near point of surrender don philip as has been hinted fathered his pretty daughter in a tendency to what mirabeau called le don terrible de la familiarit only what in her proceeded from an open and affectionate disposition in him was accountable to sheer weakness of character he was a vain useless good natured man whose foolishness perhaps pathetically beautified in the case of his first born was to find its supreme expression in the person of ferdinand the second child in whom a vicious imbecility came to develop itself but philip himself was not vicious save in the sense of the mischief that is wrought through idleness he frittered away his time in small local excitements he devoted the most of his mornings to the mysteries of the toilet he played faro and enjoyed an occasional intrigue he patronised the mass the opera and the promenade each in its due proportion he now and then entertained for his highest intellectual distraction some traveller of distinction visiting parma as to money he could never master its significance as to business he detested it on both counts his ministers had a bad time of it with him and his familiars of whom he had several a remarkably good one the confusion in the exchequer was their opportunity and they took full advantage of it the duke was easily responsive to prayers for assistance especially if they emanated from people dun tat peu remarquable he had the liking of the petty mind for impressing by his bounty those of such a far social inferiority that the full measure of his condescension could be felt between them amongst his closest intimates were the messieurs la roque and la coque two men of indifferent birth who caused endless trouble in the matter of palace factions the former was middle aged crafty smooth tongued and a flatterer the latter was a pert coxcomb and braggart jealous and mischievous he had a minor faculty for music which his conceit magnified into genius could set mediocre verses of the right butterwomans rank to market order to compositions as vulgarly primitive one might find his like in a hundred popular balladmongers of to day men who have the gift to touch out emotional chords to clap trap sentiments he and don philip whose measure he exactly fitted wasted much time together producing and practising over a number of such little sticky effusions they were sometimes moved to tears over their own lucubrations his excellency was at his toilet his two friends being present when the marquises letter was brought in to him its delivery had to be delayed pending the performance of an important rite this was no less than the placing of the ducal wig in position on the ducal poll m frisson the perruquier spotlessly aproned and with a comb stuck in the side frizzle of his own bob jerom as a clerk sticks a pen behind his ear received the august erection from an attendant who had just brought it in from the powdering closet and delicately shaking and blowing on it poised it a moment over the cropt scalp with the air of an archbishop officiating at a coronation before he deftly lowered it into place it was an action of ineffable and unfaltering elegance necessitating none but the most trifling of after touches to complete the effect a slight joining of the flats so to speak with a fragrant grease stick a whiff of powder a just more perceptible distribution of the rouge on the cheekbones his fingers fluttered like butterflies tasting the honey of flowers he stood back finally to admire his own work a valet offered the duke a laced mouchoir heavily scented with tuberose and the ceremony was accomplished don philip exhaling incense proceeded leisurely the attendants being dismissed to read the gouvernantes communication but first he put it from him with a nose of disgust toilet vinegar he said the very ink reeks of it what odds on the writer ten to one on the gonzals cried la coque no takers said the duke and frowning perused the thing at arms length both men sat eyeing him the one inquisitively the other covertly as he read the letter he pished and anathemad over it a good deal twenty gold ducats to a lira that she asks her wages in it cried la coque impulsively as the duke made an end philip sniggered taken he said and tossed the letter across to the speaker la coque made a wry face and la roque laughed softly and enjoyingly he was a full bodied man with small drooping lidded eyes and a small moist mouth look before you leap my little charles is a ver y good proverb he said bah good for cardsharpers retorted la coque angrily is that said the other smoothly a specific innuendo or a generalisation supposing it is the former said la coque insolently then i repudiate it with with what demanded the coxcomb rising with considerable indignation said la roque the duke made a laughing gesture put down your crest bully boy and either read the letter or hand it me back la coques curiosity got the better of his temper and reseating himself he obeyed muttering below his breath after a while he looked up a very sneering expression on his pert combative face her highness shows a better judgment in music than some other people that is all i have got to remark he said don philip prepared to amuse himself at his friends expense he was always ready to exact such payment for the familiarity he invited meaning he said with a just perceptible wink at the other intimate that she shows signs of succumbing after all to what for our part we found instantly irresistible i neither meant that nor detect here any such indication was the glowering answer you puzzle me charles said the duke what did you mean then may i ask i meant just what i said was ever such a cross enigma protested philip to la roque here is our daughter though in an unaccommodating mood almost confessing herself at last a captive to the charm to which we all yielded at the first assault and our friend will have us insensible by comparison but i say we shall refuse to surrender to the infanta that first place in appreciating m tiretta in taking which we were all unanimous say with one exception cried la coque one yourself do you mean certainly i do what you valued him at first at something lower than the rest of us he knew very well the spiteful jealousy aroused in this rival bosom by the strangers success and delighted to prick and goad it la coque ignored the exclamation his patrons amiable purpose was perfectly plain to him i recognise at this moment m tirettas art to be supreme he said only i spell it for my part with a little a elles ne sont point bonnes remarked the little low fox of the big high mulberries murmured la roque silkily the other darted a malignant glance at the speaker but restrained himself the duke his nose wrinkled in a covert snigger saw something in the insolent face which stiffened his own an innuendo charles my friend he said or are you meaning nothing but to belittle after your way m tirettas gift la coque set his white teeth and nodded he looked very much like a snapping terrier whom it would be dangerous to handle incautiously i do not belittle his gift he said i spell it with a smaller letter than you that is all and with another significance you imply something said the duke after frowning at him awhile what is it perhaps my ears replied la coque are more sensitive than most to the subtle nuances of sound to discords disharmonies so slight as to be imperceptible to less exquisite understandings perhaps her highness is likewise constituted so that within this tirettas mellifluous tones she is able to detect a something insidious incorrect which at once fascinates and repels her the duke did not answer and presently he went on i was over at colorno yesterday and listening not to him you may be sure but to one who observes things and reports to me in confidence see clever hyacinth laugh to himself there as if he guesses who that someone may be this hyacinth of ours monsieur has a marvellous gift for detecting smoke by its smell put his fat nose above a hearth and ten to one he will instruct you presently where the fire burns that is not the case with her highnesss governess whom we may certainly commend for an old fool saving her marquisate she cannot see an inch beyond her nose in any direction and when it comes to smoke a man may blow it in her eyes in the name of flattery and she will go blind rather than not accommodate him the duke still staring with a perplexed expression and still silent made a gesture to have the letter returned to him receiving it from la coques hands he sat awhile studying and frowning over its opening sentences presently he looked up i find no shadow of justification here he said for such an innuendo what innuendo monsieur that that don philip rose suddenly to his feet angry excitement in his eyes are you daring to imply that this man is capable of such a mad abuse of his mission la coque his lids stretched his chin hanging looked the picture of stupefied innocence why what can your excellency mean he said what did you mean sir by your art with a little a nothing whatever but that i do not rate the chevaliers capacity for music so high as you do and that was all what else in heavens name you suggest that he blinds the marquises eyes to what o to nothing in particular i insist upon knowing your excellency overwhelms me the mere thoughtless speculation of an idle mind i put two and two together not even considering that according to some people they do not necessarily make four come explain yourself why her highness by what we hear is not and very sensibly moved by this mans meretricious art with a big a and yet she is moved by his art well well monsieur you suggest a personal interest i suggest nothing nothing whatever who was your informant la coque smiled and shook his head the duke stood moody and preoccupied a moment he had never in his heart approved this fantastic wooing by deputy and had only abetted it for a diplomatic reason it was still an open question with him and his duchess whether maria theresa destined isabella for her son joseph or for his younger brother leopold and while that question hung in the balance he had been willing to contribute what bias he could to the desired result but supposing the girls own perversity was actually promising to confound that issue by way of an intrigue with the chosen instrument to its success it was the day of slack moralities and he had no hesitation in putting it so to himself with little resentment but for the offence it implied against policy and yet he loved his daughter in his way and believed in her believed in her of course she was utterly incapable of such a descent from all that constituted her his child and an infanta of spain the thing was insanely preposterous a vicious calumny his expression cleared my good charles he said ironically your discretion is beyond praise only evidence withheld is little better than false evidence i should recommend you for the future to modify your spite against a better man or it may get you into trouble and with these severe words he left the room la roque following paused an instant to whisper in the ear of the crestfallen coxcomb mum charles mum for your life mamselle fanchette was it and in her highnesss own suite it would never do to reveal the source would it but trust to my silence la coque grinning savagely struck his right hand softly into the palm of his left a better man he muttered well see let him conquer where he will then only if signs are reported true the victory will not be exactly as desired but from that moment his jealousy of the rival singer developed into a positive hatred chapter ix the decoy tiretta one morning was traversing an inner corridor of the palace on his way to the gardens when passing by a private door which gave egress from the infantas apartments he almost ran against a young woman who at that moment issued from the opening the lady effected a quite natural little scream and start notwithstanding the fact that her eyes had been but the instant before watching through the door slit the young gentlemans approach he apologised becomingly with many regrets for the alarm he had occasioned and was proceeding on his way when an exclamation from the girl arrested him she had pressed a faultless little hand to that region in her dainty bodice under which her heart was presumably lodged and with her eyes half closed appeared to be swaying slightly he returned at once and with an aspect of real concern offered his support mademoiselle becquet resisted though faintly the proffered assistance there was after all something of the moral hors duvre of the appetisingly unexpected about this early capture of her slim waist by a shapely masculine arm finally she turned her head away and with a sigh yielded herself to the embrace just as it appeared about to be withdrawn you are better said tiretta anxiously she gulped still panting a little it was the suddenness monsieur my heart is weak the wicked fibster it was as tough as indiarubber what there was of it he expressed his compunction and soft i am sure said he on behalf of a penitent sinner she smiled in a recovered way if you please monsieur but you need not take advantage of that absolution a soft heart is the most fatal possession a girl can own to in this bad world it were as foolish as to flaunt her jewels in the ghetto tiretta with a laugh released the slender waist if you can stand alone he said o yes she answered and indeed there was no doubt she could he looked at her with a twinkling gravity what is your name child she dipped him a demure little curtsey fanchette becquet at your service monsieur i am her highnesss confidential maid she is prettily served fanchette and handsomely i am sure monsieur you see i return the compliment he laughed again at her insolence and checked himself suddenly what on earth do you mean by that o she said innocently do you not love my mistress everybody loves her he breathed again there was safety in generalisations if everybody loves her then i suppose i must he said she clapped her pink hands i will tell her she will like to know that he stared at the girl aghast then nipped one of her slender wrists if you dare are you off your head perhaps monsieur you see you startled me so i dont believe a word of it i believe this was premeditated yes that is quite true it was i saw you coming before you saw me i thought i should like to be her highnesss proxy for your attentions i would have let you kiss me if you had offered he released her and stepped back you are certainly mad he exclaimed she laughed they were quite alone then came close up to him would you like to practise again on me monsieur to test the softness of her heart by deputy no i am no thief he said as if stupefied keep your jewels for what i care that is well she answered mockingly since they are bespoken by another only i love an intrigue he commanded himself by a great effort assumed a chilling masterfulness if he did not feel it listen to me he said i cannot pretend to know on what false and vicious assumptions you are daring thus to impeach my honour they are mistaken whatever they are and let that suffice for you fanchette set her lips tight and nodded her head once or twice o very well she said there is no harm done if i am mistaken i am mistaken that is all he should have gone but he unwisely lingered i believe he said i ought to probe this to the bottom only gossip takes good care to be elusive it cannot help itself monsieur said the girl it is all shaped upon signs and hints and glances upon a mystic code which only the initiated can interpret then in that case you are not one of the initiated i do my best monsieur hey day well from my own point of view i am sorry for my mistress especially as she looks for her entertainment to the company this afternoon of so chill a cavalier what do you mean o nothing but that we are going she and i to that old aquavivas garden and without the she dragon who will be engaged over m du tillot her highness expects me to accompany her i did not say that to think she could so commit herself but she sighs over the incompleteness of her dear orange grove which says she only needs its orpheus to be the sweetest garden under heaven it is melancholy to have to produce music to order is it not fanchette i think it is monsieur well i must respond i suppose it will only be a little while longer it has this use that you shall convince yourself by my behaviour of the wickedness of your innuendo convince herself as he convinced himself no doubt he told his conscience as he walked away that thus to go forward steadfastly and dutifully his eyes set to his mission his ears deaf to the jeers and chuckles of scandal was his only safe course there was a story somewhere he had read of a prince whose way to a definite purpose lay up a stone strewn hill every pebble of which when he came to the test was clamant with an agonised or seductive voice entreating him to turn and he did turn and was changed into stone well he must not be like that prince that was all an easy matter it seemed but the spirits of evil know their business better than man or they would not provide so simple a lure for his ruin it is the complicated trap which fails to beguile the confiding little mouse the deadly snare consists in no more than a fragment of bait and a wire spring just to go steadily forward yes but this unexpected halt with its startling revelation had suddenly made of that plain road a rather formidable maze had he appeared noticeably appeared to be making too personal a matter of this business then how was a part so impassioned to be played in a spirit of aloofness he swore he was loyal to his mission loyal to his friend that he was a man of honour that he had never consciously wavered in his fidelity of course he had not the devil knows better than to inoculate his victims perceptibly it is a very favourite trick of his to encourage a man who knows nothing whatever about moral architecture to build over heavily upon his moral strength tiretta was so confident in his that he had never thought of questioning its capacity for supporting any test he did not now he would not fanchette and all such mischievous gossips despite he was just he flattered himself beginning to succeed in his romantic undertaking and to feel a certain thrill in the near accomplishment of a task which had once promised to prove so distasteful to withdraw now would certainly seem to give a colour to calumny if only for the ladys sake he must prosecute his purpose to its triumphant end what a chivalrous tiretta to be sure but indeed he was not yet so conscious of his own state as to be guilty of lying to himself in the matter and in the meantime mademoiselle fanchette stood and looked after the retreating figure and curtsied derisively to its back you are a very pretty gentleman she said but i know a prettier she had that other in her minds eye he was also a musician but of a very different tone so to speak he did not deal in the visionary stuff of dreams but in the practical material of courtship the sort of suitor a woman could understand he set adorable words to intelligible music one was at no trouble with him to puzzle out sentiments which fitted themselves quite naturally into the love traffic they recorded and provoked and he too was handsome but in a braver bolder way wooing as a man should by compulsion she was in fact very much under the thrall of this cavalier though still coquetting for business sake as some frenchwomen will with the thought of capitulation and yet with a curious perversity she was jealous of the very quality she sneered at acutely jealous of the mistress who might command if she liked and as she liked that dreamer of dreams she did not understand m tirettas mystical rhapsodies she had often herself unseen or unobserved heard him improvise or the fine subtlety of his mind or the rareness of his gift she did not admire either his melancholy looks or his serene humour but an uneasy suspicion as to the superior value of these qualifications as compared with la coques showy and meretricious ones haunted her she felt them like supercilious reflections on her own vulgar taste or on what they seemed to imply to be such and the thought as with common natures did not drive her to aspire but to degrade she had no wish for herself or her lover to rise to tirettas level she would have liked dearly to pull him down to theirs wherefore in the prosecution of that amiable design she had been quite ready to lend herself a subtle instrument to the ruin of that rival favourite she would even if provoked to it have given her body to the task as she had her soul to hate and to seduce to seduce because she hated to risk loving because she had seduced that was something her mental attitude it was the passionist french view and fanchette was excessively french chapter x the orange grove all the glowing air was steeped in incense the mealy pollen of the orange blossoms washed out by the rain of the preceding days had dried and scattered its largesse powdering with gold dust the purple whimples of the violets underneath the smell of warm moistened grass rose to mix with and to freshen the languider perfume whose excess had otherwise been cloying no whisper breathed no blade stirred in all the lovely grove it was like a painted picture each leaf of it each waxen blossom each incandescent globe of fruit drawn clear and motionless against its background of vivid blue and so stilly luminous throughout that its shadows were but tempered light embroidered like rich velvet with spangles of brighter emerald while the very prismatic sparkles with which the air was dusted seemed themselves to float asleep an hour ago a nightingale had sung sweet as a little bell glass since when this hush had fallen on the grove sunk in warm drowsiness within its encircling green a quiet so profound one might have fancied one could distinguish the soft rustle of the cloud skirts as now and then they trailed across the sky a single blossom dropped and the whole illusion scattered like a mirrored image in a pool into which an acorn has fallen on the instant there came into this voiceless paradise the figures of a man and a stunted boy the man carried a lute or mandolin slung over his shoulder the boy large headed and large hatted like a gnome followed importantly in the others footsteps it is the enchanted garden of hesperus said tiretta pausing on the threshold he lowered his voice instinctively as if he had broken unexpectedly into some woodland shrine of the gods then went a soft step or two and paused again it is a very good plantation said bissy tolerant and superior we have established it against some odds signore i can tell you what odds he looked at the imp vacantly his thoughts elsewhere wind and snow said bissy the trees have to be protected and fed though they are grafted on sound lemon stocks they are capricious at first like infants put to a wet nurse and require a deal of coaxing when lusty they become strong feeders as mamselle fanchette will tell you tiretta caught the name who will tell me fanchette she is her excellencys lady she likes to hear that these trees drink blood they will supply right wedding tokens for the brides of brave men she says the old florist busy and preoccupied had not recognised the stranger when the latter had ridden over from colorno to visit his gardens but bissy had at once and had offered to escort the gentleman whither he would it is down there through the juniper thicket he said pointing suddenly with an air of shrewd confidence that one reaches the margin of the backwater where you first came upon her excellency wading holy mother what a state the old lady was in it looked at first as if she would have liked to drink your blood signore and then all at once she changed tiretta took one step and nipped the elf by his ear ow ow wailed bissy completely flabbergasted the chevalier looked formidable your tongue is too long whelp stand still a moment while i clip it for you no signore dont i think i have no choice for the love of the saints signore ow ow i will tell you something it is ill to hurt one who has tried to do you a service what service the ring signore that you threw away in a pet i hunted for it i did when the water sank low in the creek but i could not find it you had no thought of me in the matter you egg you wanted it for yourself he seemed to warm from counterfeit to genuine anger as he spoke he wrung the boys ear so that the poor mannikin howled again ive a mind to pull it off for you what the devil do you mean daring to criticise the actions of your betters suddenly conscious in the midst of his fume of its absurdity he released his prisoner and stepped back poor bissy holding both hands to his smarting headpiece stood wriggling and sniffing noisily stop that commanded the chevalier or i shall have a double reason for gagging you he could not tell himself what had provoked him to the assault the nature of a particularly unpalatable reminder might have been responsible for it no self respect likes to have recalled to it the processes of past humiliations even though it directly owes to them its present position help a nerveless subject to decision help a diffident lover to his mistress but never thereafter imply to either of them that he was once other than the masterful hero your assistance made him not that bissy had been of much assistance to our hero on a certain occasion only things had altered since then the old atmosphere of bitterness had sweetened to a strange new flavour seeing the boy with swollen lids and puckered face trying to repress his sobs remorse gripped tiretta that passion was always his besetting weakness it urged him to reparations which were even more ill advised than the hasty acts which led to them if he had been unduly angry he was inclined now to be unduly lenient come he said i havent killed you tell me the truth what would you have done with the ring if you had found it bissy morally chastened gulped and snuffled i should have done the honest thing signore good boy said tiretta and then he added magnanimously well if you are successful you can keep it for your pains that was generous of him since the ring did not belong to him to dispose of a conclusion perhaps shrewdly appreciated by the owlish urchin i do not want it said bissy aggrieved and righteous the most i should expect would be a lira for my trouble her excellency no doubt will give me that for her slipper what slipper boy the one she lost in the pool i found that though i could not find the other a sudden warmth seemed to suffuse tirettas whole being he held out his hand nonchalantly i am staying at colorno i shall probably see her highness this afternoon give it me and i will return it to her bissy still wiping his eyes shook his head i want the credit myself besides i have not got it with me listen here i will give you a golden ducat for it why signore why indeed the shameful fool blushed before that small inquisitor he stammered i i offended her highness that day it will serve as a peace offering a dirty one said bissy it is all stained and muddy tiretta had one infallible argument with the obdurate it was the one which came to him naturally and confidently he put his hand quite caressingly on the boys shoulder very well he said it does not matter but inasmuch as i have wronged you child i am going to atone with a song would you like to hear me make music if you please signore tiretta penetrated a little way among the trees and stopped resting his back against a trunk sit there he said and bissy allured and wondering squatted before him like a toad the troubadour unstrung his instrument and tuning it a moment softly at his ear wandered into a symphony as sweet as falling flowers his eyes as he played grew dreamy and remote he forgot his purpose and his company the spirit of the haunted place stole into his brain drugging it to oblivion of all else the words came when they came independent of his own volition it seemed i know not what i love a shadow a delight like the morning moon thin wraith of her that night bared warm to my impassioned dreams and now so cold and distant seems i know not that i love yet one flower from its breast doth breathe a sweeter perfume than it ever once possest and why this is i do not know but only joy that it is so i know not what is love but a thing of whims and hates since what my dreams fulfil to me her scorn repudiates the moment that my eyes awake would close for ever for her sake he ended on a tumbled note and to the sense of a sudden creeping in his heart something had moved on the threshold of the grove hard by bissy his mouth agape scrambled to his pudgy feet it is madonna said the boy and then approaching tiretta he whispered you shall have the slipper signore and retreating scuttled from the grove ducking his obeisance to the lady as he passed tiretta remained motionless a feeling of strange awe of strange guilt at his heart and as he stood she came on and passed him and was gone into the grove its sweet and fitting apparition her footfall had seemed to make no sound her robe was white as mist one moment she had turned her grave innocent eyes to his whether in wonder or rebuke he could not tell and so in silence had moved on he almost believed it in truth to be a spirit conjured up of his unconscious rhapsody had she heard it marked it resented it he hardly knew himself of what he had sung from what spring of unearthly emotion what passion had risen into expression only this he knew that no thought of friendship of loyalty to anothers interests had inspired him why should it have it was no new thing for such abstract sentiments bubbling up from the soundless deeps of his soul to find on his lips their irresistible utterance he was the voice on these occasions of something beyond his control of something for which he could not be held responsible he stirred in a sudden revulsion of feeling a little heat of anger overtook him and he consigned fanchette to the devil it was she who had tempted him into this situation with her common winks and becks and nudges so to speak tempted him and only to be snubbed for his pains why should he submit to being thus passed over as if he had sinned against some code of conduct or good taste he would follow and ask her highness point blank if his presence in the grove was desired or not yet a thrill ran through his veins as he moved to give effect to his resolution he felt it and set his teeth frowning as a man might who resents his own blushes over some innocuous malapropism into which he has been betrayed she had paused among the trees at a little distance away a slender spirit like figure seeming half diaphanous in the shadowy glow of things claimed both of fancy and reality like a leaf dappled hamadryad his mandolin slung over his arm he went straight up to her and standing erect the soldier uppermost spoke out his thought my presence here is unwelcome to your highness her face looked pale there was still a wonder in her eyes as she turned to him it was quite unforeseen monsieur he bowed i accept the rebuke my coming was due to a misapprehension for which i am not responsible but the mistake is soon remedied her eyes seemed to wonder more and more and then the faintest flush stole to her cheek do you not like my orange grove monsieur she said it is beautiful he answered i seem doomed unwittingly to desecrate your highnesss chosen retreats she looked down a moment a minutest smile rose to her lips i have no claim to it really she said only i love its sweetness and solitude bissy is its inspiring genius as you seem to have discovered he saw the sparkle in the eyes she raised and stood spellbound by it i had wronged the boy hurt him he said very seriously and my song was in the nature of an atonement a strange one surely for a boys hurt she was grave all at once what had he done to offend you will you please not to ask me i am a hasty fool in many things you mean you sometimes give pain without intending it he bowed his head monsieur she said very earnestly in that case will you throw away that flower from your button hole he seemed to have instinctively known what was coming he put his hand over the withered posy my theme he said that night it cannot have hurt you madame herself proposed it whence did you gather your theme she asked him from the floor of the arbour he answered what then it was of his highnesss martyrdom i made it the text she sought his eyes a wistful pain lined between her own ah he said before the appeal on her lips could be spoken do not insist let me buy my right to it with a song a dream a memory something i cannot explain elsewise he had caught at his instrument a madness seemed to have risen in his brain desperate inspired overbearing all in one he hardly knew what he was saying or doing only that some passion insidious unrealised till this moment was mastering and overwhelming him listen he whispered while she stood before him white and wondering hear what it means to me what emotions what old sweet agonies of death and parting the music came to him the words the throbbing anguish of it as he spoke love in a mist blue eyes in tangled hair wet eyes that brim through lashes of dark rain where have i known your mystery your pain in what green gardens kissed your soft despair there was a parting once but when but where i ask it of my heart and ask in vain only a wild voice weeps across the main love in a mist wet eyes in tangled hair he ended and a dead silence ensued then the girl moving like one half stupefied and with a sigh that seemed to rend her bosom took a single step away and stopped forgive me said tiretta his mood was spent exhausted for the moment he could only utter that broken prayer she put her hand to her eyes and seemed to stumble he was by her side in a moment i did not mean it he said hoarsely god knows what tempted me she looked up at him then very piteously what gardens she whispered as if she could have wept he answered like one in a dream there were green bays and the mist was over everything strange shapes came and went in it they shrank and dilated and the eyes of the women were like heaven in april strange wet blue eyes behind the rain they come out of sleep they have haunted me since childhood the strange eyes the wild visions of the north ah do not think me mad madonna his breast was heaving his hands entreating she moved on motioning to him to walk beside her as they passed slowly together through the sweet scented shadows he grew more composed and she also it seemed presently she spoke to him in a low earnest voice will you try to forget it never to let it be again she held out her hand and like a man who delivers his own death warrant he detached the faded flower from his breast and laid it reverently in that soft palm condemn me he muttered walking with bowed head to a traitors death i deserve the worst it was a momentary possession she answered the evil thing is gone he sighed as i must go as i must go lest it come again she did not answer stealing a look at her he saw something in her face which made him knot his fingers together as if forcibly to control some scarce endurable emotion and so they wandered on as it were in a tragic trance both soul stricken and both dumb threading the golden trees as if always to weave deeper the silences between themselves and the common world they came out presently unconscious of how they had reached it upon a green sward sloping to the river and there the man turned and gazed upon his companion do you not recognise the place he said of my shame he saw her lips move and the tears gather in her eyes no of mine could mortal fortitude forbear endure further with one mad step he had her in his arms and their lips met chapter xi sweet basil fanchette was chattering to aquaviva like the intolerable magpie he thought her when a couple issuing from the orange grove came into her ken approaching up a flowery path she was silent instantly a relief so grateful to the old gardener that he was moved to raise his head from his work to examine into the cause of it he grunted his satisfaction that is a mercy you will attend to your own duties now instead of interfering with mine fanchette tossed her head what an old bear to be sure i shall have to withdraw my patronage do said aquaviva it will be the better for my reputation she would have retorted only that she was intent on other things as the couple came near she ran to her mistress and smoothed and fondled her with a privileged intimacy ah you have been exploring you bad demoiselle careless as always of your poor fanchettes credit look at the moss stains on your skirt and the flower crushed in your bosom and the sun has caught your neck and face too naughty mistress as she readjusted things with dainty fluttering fingers she just glanced with an arch smile at tiretta a little telegraphic signal full of comprehension and meaning he looked away immediately there that will do fanchette said isabella flushing finely it is time we went home is it not what is grandfather doing there he is doing something horrible disgusting you will not like to see it more to escape an embarrassment than from any awakened curiosity isabella walked on tiretta dropping behind a moment whispered in the maids ear little liar if you please monsieur murmured fanchette demurely she never expected me did i not say so you implied that she did and was that why you came he drew up baffled she gave a tiny laugh it was to convince me of the wickedness of my innuendo was it not she whispered well i am convinced monsieur he had better have been silent from the first she put a finger to her lips hush she said you can trust in me you can always trust in me he should have answered should have repudiated then and finally the implication he hesitated and the next moment they had overtaken the infanta where she had paused beside the old perfumer grandfather what is that in your hand the old man rose groaning as he straightened his back he held by the handle a lipped vessel half full of a sluggish ruby liquid you should know he said it is what your loved oranges grow rich and fat on not blood bullocks blood isabella with an exclamation of horror shrunk back those are not oranges my friend said tiretta he pointed to a row of little shrubs or herbs set in earthenware jars against a sunny wall they were green and bushy and the vessels were of many colours fancifully designed and decorated they are sweet basil or basil thyme master said aquaviva a common stock until enriched by good feeding it is the way of the world all over it is blood which makes the quality meat juice and plenty of it these are having their first weaning and the result will show in a year or maybe two or three simple enough in themselves they will flower when they do fit to grace a ladys bower tis said they flourish best on the blood of murdered men come away fanchette said isabella but the maid lingered harkee my friend said tiretta i will buy one of your basils unweaned that pretty one at the end there in the green jar and back it against all the rest to flower first and smell the sweetest as you will master and be a fool for your pains tiretta saw the young lady into her carriage a service accepted by her very formally and silently and presently rode back to colorno his purchase under his arm chapter xii paolo and francesca deep into the dying day the happy princess followed him it had been one delirious moment snatched from the hands of fate so it was understood between them an impulsive contact passionate transient never to be spoken of or repeated isabella might if she would have made of that mute stipulation a definite compromise with her conscience since a princess no less than any other woman was free to barter her lips for one instant of delight provided she incurred thereby no after responsibility towards their ravisher there were flowers in the world of gallantry to be sipped as well as hives to be plundered and one was not called upon to hold oneself bound to every honey loving freebooter whom one permitted to settle a moment and taste she might have thought thus i say only if she had she would not have been the passion pure child innocent and affectionate of our knowledge she was in fact very troubled very shamed over what she had done or allowed to be done and yet her heart conscious guilty as it might feel would thrill in the memory of that moment though she had since made one to that unspoken compact of silence and abstention she never had a thought but that that instant of emotional self surrender had delivered her a rightful captive into the hands of her conqueror she could never now love another man only her love must be content to remain for all time an abstraction a pathetic dream impossible of realisation if only they would consent to leave it so to let her die unwedded perhaps in the peaceful seclusion of a cloister so a single kiss wrought on this loving nature that it had for her the tragic sanctity of a pledge it did not matter how extenuated by good resolutions the fire once kindled would not so be quenched nor would the cold water these two engaged themselves to throw on their own heart burnings have any effect but to make the heat glow presently the fiercer that is a mere chemical commonplace and unless love is to be accepted for something other than a matter of gases and combustion follows of necessity fire to be put out by water must be put out and not simply fed it is true that in the first of the reaction from that madness they had both shrunk back aghast over the magnitude of the peril they had touched and escaped yet the very sympathy engendered of that common fright was fatal it constituted between them a secret which by habit became a tender and a passionate one whatever distance was affected in their relations there was that knowledge to obliterate it they were at all times and in all places conscious of it and of one another and so what was to be the end an idle problem if love could think of ends and retributions love would not be love but sanity they continued to meet were they not expected to meet that was the mortal irony of it all omnipotence laid no embargo on their friendship applauded and encouraged it rather the signs of their better understanding filled the old gouvernante with jubilation he comes to vindicate my belief in him she wrote to the duke in a little you will find the girl converted to your wishes and tiretta he did not succumb without a struggle he hated his own treachery but he could not hate himself so sanctified of that idyllic passion for long he fought desperately to command his own humorous philosophical independent view of things to remain the master of his fate the captain of his soul and all the time he knew that his only resource lay in flight and he said to himself i await no more than her dismissal but she never spoke the word that was to banish him and kill his heart and he said to abandon her unbidden to leave her to bear the brunt of this alone were to play the part of a coward specious perhaps yet in a measure the truth only that his own defences weakened while he lingered and then at length he could battle no more but spent and exhausted gave up the struggle he was like a man who having swum too far from shore in a tide race and seeking to return grows slowly and agonisingly conscious of the futility of his efforts and yields himself first to despair and then to resignation keeping no more than afloat as he drifts out into the unknown he had done his best but the tide was too strong for him let those who had committed him to the effort take upon their own consciences the result in the first pitying her embarrassment in his presence responding as he believed to her unspoken wish he rather avoided her or when they met addressed her only with a grave and formal courtesy the inevitable change happened one day when they chanced upon one another near the green arbour sacred to an unforgettable memory she was standing there alone looking down upon her own lily pond when he came upon her and he would have withdrawn with a low spoken apology only she stayed him he stopped his every vein tingling beside her she did not speak for a moment and then she looked up in his face with a sudden desperate resolve in her eyes that day she said hurriedly when i spoke to you at last i had meant it to show i was sorry for my rudeness why did you snub me about my lilies i think you love the children better than you do me love he repeated the word like one stupefied she was so unsophisticated so incapable of maintaining in the face of apparent unkindness the pose to which her conscience had condemned her that she was unable to qualify her reproach by a word he stood as if stunned then very gently sought her unresisting hand and raised it to his lips if i might love you he whispered imprisoning the soft palm and gathering it fearfully to his breast but it is madness i thought you meant to show me so she answered that that was why you avoided me and if i did what else was possible a long ecstatic sigh quivered from his lips i must go he said it is the only way you must forget me and forgive me he bent suddenly and looked in her face and his voice broke o my love my love keep back your tears gently she released her hand turning away from him and he strode a step or two hither and thither in unbearable pain why have they laid this cruelty on us he said i cannot live and endure it tell me to go i cannot so near inaudible so whispered from a bursting heart he felt as if his own heart would break with the rapture of it again he turned from her and strode forth and back prometheus he cried give me my fire i defy the gods afloat on the long drift of dreams everything surrendered everything believed possible no to morrow to this ecstasy isabel we will be sweet lovers my sweet love one beautiful moment in that embowered place he held her in his arms then put her gently from him that i must teach you duplicity he said so truthful so innocent but we must be circumspect or the dream will end it is all a dream is it not dear love she could not kill the happiness in her eyes but she made them grave for his behoof if we might talk she said knowing what we know but never alluding to it keeping for ever that dear secret even from one another for ever he said well what have we to do with time i would rather be mad than sane talk on sweet music i have so much to say and yet i have nothing i think you have come into my heart and that no words are needed there yet we must talk being mortal for luciditys sake tell me how did i steal in i cannot your voice made me sorry and then my own cruelty were you thinking of that when you sang to bissy i suppose so i was frightened of myself monsieur monsieur what can i call you i will tell you my real name is not that i am known by a nom de guerre in literal truth my own i laid to rest long years ago never again to be revived but love knows its own resurrections i will tell you it is for your sweet ears for your sweet lips alone and you will keep my secret isabel she promised and to the end was faithful to her vow and now said he where is my flower to his rapture she brought the little withered spray out from her bosom and kissed it once and gave it to him it shall lie on my dead heart he said her voice was full her eyes were shining as she answered it gave me a living one i think o love the strangeness and the sorrow of your music it robbed me of my soul of my will that day i listened here he gazed at her his eyes rapt and dreaming it was the rain he said such a wild wet day after long heat brings to me always like no other the passion of the past your past how can i say old pictures old hauntings young dead faces the air is full of their streaming the wind of their voices and i know them yet they are strange to me i hear them yet they utter no word they were all born and perished ages before i reached the world they come out of the wild beautiful places the mists and mysteries of the green gardens where i kissed your eyes yes your beautiful eyes beloved not to part she whispered he did not answer but he put his lips to the dead flower before he hid it in his breast are you terrified of me he said do you think me mad and she answered dwelling on his face be mad if to abandon me were reason drowned in that sunny ecstasy they both stood silent for awhile then tiretta sighed and stretched his shoulders as if in blissful waking from a dream and he looked with a tender humour at his comrade i am not all moonstruck he said i would not have you think that of me lady i have rubbed shoulders with life i can be practical on occasion this tendency to rhapsodising is a sort of possession that visits me at times it puts visions in my mind and words on my lips hold the north responsible for it you speak so strangely of the north she said wistfully and often i think your eyes are turned to it over the long wastes of water it shines there so mistily he answered it blossoms so full of faint entreating faces is it the way home i wonder the path to that real unknown god the god of utter love to whom shrinking from the jehovah of israel we are for ever blindly stretching out our arms the god to whom we turn as the poor world broken turns from the high altar to the pitiful mother the lovely and grief hushing in some wonderful inexplicable way so it seems to me my isabel the long far lands of home the shores of unutterable consolation shall we go home together some day she answered like ruth a very passion of emotion in her voice sweet love he said deeply moved so dear and strange the north seems to me a symbol and a mystery and to reach it at last just a sleep and a returning you did not know i was of northern blood no i did not know but i am isabel when was it when your great great great great grandfather was on the spanish throne and his fleet sailed northward to destroy the heretic do you know your houses history child the magnificence and the shame of it how those little islands those little hazy islands planted like green ramparts on the threshold of the unknown called to their aid the winds and lightnings and smote the invader in his presumption from their seas and how of that vast flotilla few escaped and not one but was disabled while many beat round the northern limits only to be dashed to pieces on the rocks and shoals of the western islands and of those poor souls who found a landing there hundreds were slain and but a handful sheltered of passion and pity survived pity that gave protection passion that gave me my ancestors and my name the sun and the mist meet in my blood isabel the passion and the mystery of life and sometimes one prevails and i am human and sometimes the other and i am a seer or a lunatic she listened wondering a little and then said she my strange love let me look in your eyes smiling and unmoving he faced her and she stood gazing in silence presently she said i have always wondered and now i know they are brown and yet they are blue it is the sea gleaming through their shadows it is the north he answered whither we are flying some day you and i together dear love listen he took his lute and sang softly to her where the sea and sky meet kissing far away o come love o come love daring salt and spray there join earth and heaven each fulfilled in bliss o northward love come northward where the strange thing is where the storm bows shining standeth where god stood o set thy little foot love safe from wreck and flood dim and far in the raining lights gleam mystical o northward love come northward where strange things befall chapter xiii tokens he talked having a willing listener she laughed at him for a chatterbox he had long fits of silence she tried to enter into his dreams sometimes he was moody and troubled and she knew why and blamed herself for his self reproach sometimes and that most often they drifted soul to soul on a halcyon tide and let the world go and forgot everything but themselves and the rapture of living and they met and met and still were faithful to their platonic compact it was pretty to mark their idyll but nature while she hung them with flowers was for ever a little impatient of their content nobody interfered with them their intimacy was encouraged rather than suspected the world conspired for their ruin they were so little put to it to practise any duplicity that their consciences almost came to acquit them of the necessity for it in company they were called upon to display no greater decorum than good taste would have imposed upon a betrothed couple and elsewhere on the strength of that mutual understanding they could consort in honest seeming as if no guilty thought were at their hearts and indeed there was none in isabellas a child of seventeen and in love guilt is for criminals who work the other way and through hate of their kind fanchettes soul should have been the guilty one one day tiretta took a queer object from his pocket it was down in the deep gardens and they were alone together again do you see that he said it was a little white slipper woefully grubby if you please bonbec she answered it was her name for him quaint in its underlying confidence but betraying nothing to chance ears well do you not recognise it no stay she laughed and flushed is it really the recovered relic of that day relic indeed it is horrible dirty little thing may i keep it o bonbec that and the flower a priceless pair priceless indeed what presents i make you i gave bissy gold for this o then it is invaluable lady i have slept with it every night under my pillow i should at least have pulled off the heel if i had been you tell me may i keep it i wish i might give you something worth your taking bonbec saving yourself i could wish no dearer gifts they speak heaven to me yes the little soiled slipper and the little crumpled flower so much so that in fairness i want to make you as inestimable a gift in return isabel will you take my pot of basil and cherish it for me i will love to dearly i will it is so inconsiderable a thing it would pass for a mere compliment i have a strange feeling about it now do not wonder why or whence it comes that its flowering will coincide with our loves triumph that it waits to be the symbol of our bridal is not that an odd superstition irrational meaningless and yet somehow i cannot shake it off he smiled but his eyes were serious she answered as movingly if love can make it flower dear my heart that day shall come quickly so i feel it he said tend it touch it breathe on it no more will be needed it will think the spring is in its green veins it will open its little smiling eyes like a waking infant to you its mother fancy it our sleeping baby isabel they were silent for awhile the girl looking down with flushed cheeks presently she said will bissy wonder do you think bissy why you gave him gold for it that other ah ha bissy is astute a shrewd calculating elfin he will not kill his goose with the golden eggs the mine is not emptied of its possibilities for him trust him to be silent and perish all scruples he deprecated meeting trouble half way he bade her just drift and be happy he was in one of his irresponsible moods indolent and garrulous sometimes he told her he felt like a warm mass of animated jelly afloat on a tropic sea and just dreamily conscious of the sun and the soft swaying of the water if only he could roll lazily round and feel the contact of his lady radiate and with her drift on for ever through the glassy silences but i think there would be two sides to that responded isabella very sensibly and only one would be turned to the sun picture the black abysses underneath and what might rise up from them he laughed then we will be two birds floating on tranced wings through the limitless blue and the storms bonbec then two angels it must be and think of another side to that if you can i can only think of god bonbec he looked at her and laughed again but suddenly was silent that night fanchette preparing her mistress for bed made an impromptu statement quite innocently i have put the pot of basil in your highnesss chambre coucher isabella guilty of an involuntary start paused a moment to recover her self possession what pot of basil girl o i thought your highness would know it was delivered as from m le chevalier with his respectful compliments i recollect now m tiretta uncertain of his movements begged me to hold the stakes as it were between himself and aquaviva you remember the challenge indeed that explanation of his gift had been offered to the infanta by m tiretta himself and not as a contingent one if there was to be any question of subterfuge the guilt should rest with him fanchette remembered very distinctly i think then with your highnesss permission it is well placed where it is she said isabella her colour a little heightened found a difficulty in asking why o i have a sentiment about these things said fanchette warm thoughts will make the flowers in ones bosom open prematurely i have noticed that are you proposing to me said isabella to wear this entire bush as a posy well warm dreams then said the maid they will make a very forcing house of ones bedroom mademoiselle will see if she has any love for this plant it will come to blossom while she slumbers or perhaps she would rather i removed it it is not good say some people to breathe in sleep the same air with flowers they are like sweet tongued suitors best shut the other side of the door that will do fanchette you are allowing your tongue too much freedom o i did not mean to imply anything quoth injured innocence your highness if you please is so ready to think the worst of fanchette only what i will venture to say is that if you are not on the side of m tiretta in this business it will be sensible of you to let me put the basil pot elsewhere i am not however the least troubled with these scruples said isabella courageously as you have put it there it may remain since its leaves at least smell sweet and if i find i suffer from its neighbourhood it will be simple to remove it o if you ask me i do not think you will suffer from it said the maid airily pert good night fanchette good night your highness and fruitful dreams the alcove where the infanta slept had in it a little dim hanging lamp which burnt all night it was enough and no more to betray in shadowy contour the half visionary sweetness of the face upon the pillow the rounded shoulder the waxen hand she lay on this night so still she hardly seemed to breathe she was listening her lips just parted to the sounds in the great house dying away in the distance one by one the last door boomed its remote thunder the step of a sentry passed beneath her window and attenuated and ceased a profound stillness reigned everywhere then sitting up she sat thrilling a moment and slid softly from her bed listening again as if half fearful of what her own longing might bring upon her she crept barefooted in her ghostly night robe to the table where her treasure lay and knelt and put her arms about it and buried her face in the fragrant leaves my baby she whispered open open your pretty eyes and make me happy did i deny you it was for loves sake and your fathers most dear he would tell you so if he were here chapter xiv confession somewhere i have read or heard of a marine invertebrate which when its stomach disturbs it throws the oppressive thing away and gets a new one it is a beautifully simple solution of the problem of life which problem unquestionably has its centre in those regions and as triumphant in its utter banality as the method of columbus with his egg or of alexander with his gordian knot without doubt if man had been constructed on that principle his history would have needed not a thousandth part of the apology which is now a necessary accompaniment of its recital the myriad ills attendant on digestion the brutalities the tremors and the hallucinations would have entirely lacked their excuse conceive the practical humour of the statement that one had no stomach for an enterprise conceive such a solution of the saturnalian difficulty as vitellius never dreamed a permanent and undetachable stomach was certainly the actual curse which satan inflicted on mankind the nearest approach to this impossibly beatific condition consists as popularised by the catholic and universal church in throwing away ones conscience and getting a new one the priest conducts the process and the medium is the confessional therein the distressing load may be cast and therefrom the patient be discharged re equipped it has all the efficacy of the other though at the same time hardly its simplicity for one thing one cannot do it alone by oneself for another a dose of penance is conditional on the treatment usually a trifle but sufficient to leave a taste in ones mouth however it is a useful alternative fanchettes conscience did not often oppress her but on the rare occasions when it did there was always this means at hand to rid herself of its burden she would go to the little church in the village ring up father leone and empty her reservoir of sins upon that good mans devoted head then cleansed and chastened she would come forth in a rare condition for fresh frolics the first taste whereof would be comparable with that of a cigarette after a turkish bath these moral drenchings however though easeful in their results were painful enough in their process to make a resort to them unwelcome fanchette had a constitutional dislike to confessing herself guilty of anything except of the best intentions and it was only the recognised destination of those abstract virtues which drove her from time to time to appeal to providence in the matter of their better understanding so far as she was concerned it was in some ways in this connection a convenience that father leone was both old and deaf that he was moreover an absorbed herbalist and if the truth must be spoken far more interested in vegetable physiology than in christian ethics yet again to accuse oneself to dull ears had its drawbacks since the self exposure necessitated could command no consolation of sympathy to ameliorate its own ugly nakedness on the whole perhaps she would have preferred an intent and properly responsive listener but since that was not to be had she must put up with what was after all to confess was the thing and if the priest was deaf it was no business of hers to question providence as to its selection or affliction of its own ministers fanchettes conscience had been troubling her and one afternoon fanchette went across to the church to renew it she went very staid and unapproachable paying no heed to the jests of rude men or the quizzings of gossips a cavalier walking up the street espied the demure figure at a distance away and dodged behind a corner to avoid recognition by it peeping thence he saw the young woman approach the church and disappear within its portals when convinced of her mission he immediately came forth and followed in pursuit the church of santa maria was a dull little edifice and had been rendered duller by the former duke don philips elder brother who on his promotion to the crown of naples had transferred everything of value from it to his new capital without it was a mere whited sepulchre within its necessary appointments exhibited just what decency demanded and no more don carlos had fairly pillaged the building in fact and the dross of plate and pinchbeck which remained was hardly worth the considering from its tinselled high altar to its little paper petticoated virgin in an alcove near the door it was all cheap and tawdry there were some depressing stations of the cross on the walls and in a dark place under a painted window a single confessional box having a stall for the priest in the middle and on either side a curtained recess for penitents when one of these latter desired relief he or she must pull a little bell handle in the wall near the altar rails the sound caused by which summoned the sacristan who in his turn summoned the priest from his presbytery hard by the cavalier passing the church portals went straight up to this presbytery and knocked on its door he was a little pinchbeck in seeming like the candlesticks eloquent somehow of polish without and cheap metal within he was rather short than tall neatly built with very black eyebrows and in his face a pert insolence suggestive of a popular caf chanteurs perfumed self assured and brilliantly veneered m la coque was able to pass with the vulgar for a very complete gentleman women who alone in nature exceed their lords in the gorgeousness of their plumage found his fine colouring vastly attractive fanchette we know found it irresistible after a short interval the door was opened by gaspare the sacristan who was also general servitor to the meagre household he was a snuffy old fellow hoarse spoken and with a leery acquisitive eye he greeted the visitor with an air as of being on a footing of sly pleasantry with him ha signore what plenary indulgence now for what mischief is the market closed to your worship in parma that you must come all the way here to get relief la coque pushed the old man within and closed the door after them coquin he whispered be quiet the indulgence i ask is at your disposal and worth to you just a silver ducat come along now is his reverence safe bestowed what wickedness is forward i dont budge until i know hark to that chink gaspare a double silver ducat to line your old breeches withal where is his reverence i say where the last trump wouldnt disturb him in the garden reading excellent when the bell rings for confession i will go and be his substitute the sacristan fairly gasped in his breath what you will do you understand that at the first word the devil will pull you down by the legs through the floor o the devil loves a jest gaspare as much as you do o a jest is it of course what else quick there goes the bell find me a hood and cassock who is it well there is no harm in confessing mademoiselle becquet ah ha the old rascals face puckered like a monkeys an assignation he shook his head and waved his hands in rebukeful protest then turned and shuffled before sighing sighing it is sacrilege i wash my hands of it you will pay in advance signore fanchette kneeling in the church alone gabbled little prayers and reviewed her programme between whiles then she rose rang the bell summoned the sacristan stated her requirements and withdrew to the confessional box where she disposed herself on her knees behind one of the curtains shortly she heard the altar rail click a slow step approach and her view through the grating towards the chancel was suddenly obscured by the interposition of a bowed scarce distinguishable head she settled herself for the ordeal please father give me absolution for what i am about to confess a timore inimici eripe animam tuam responded the seated figure in a low mumbling voice deliver yourself my daughter the penitent hesitated a moment as if calling up her nerve bit her lower lip and began i have to accuse myself first and foremost of infidelity that is bad is it spiritual or secular infidelity to which you refer my child infidelity to my lover father a sudden cough seemed to catch the listener he crowed a little as he answered to be sure there will be some good reason for this apostacy no doubt it is to be found father in my own conscience which shrinks from the load he would have put upon it what load be specific child has he tempted you to wrong not in that way he knows better but he desired to use me as his instrument in the ruin of a man he hated it is admitted my daughter that it is lawful sometimes to do evil that good may come of it possibly this lover of yours may have seen in his enemy one of those human abnormalities whose destruction though demanded by every moral law can only be compassed by craft in that case you would be doing a positively pious work in helping him but as to this infidelity the word implies according to my reading of it a positive no less than a negative sentiment an attraction as well as a repulsion yes father may it conceivably be hinted then that you have turned not so much from one lover as towards another his rival in your fleeting affections the penitent did not answer speak daughter said the confessor rather violently clearing his throat i cannot with confidence answered fanchette thus adjured with an air of distressed hesitancy certainly i have felt pity for the man and i have heard it said that pity excites in one a feeling of fondness for the pitied but i do not know you do not this is not confession but equivocation tell me the truth at once if you would be absolved how unsparing you are father what if i do love him a little it is the fault of the first one for imposing such a task on me he knew my tender heart he might have foreseen the inevitable result i think he might indeed besides though the first one is a musical box the second is a nightingale damnation said the confessor father what do you mean i mean that you may go to the devil mademoiselle fanchette becquet after you if you please m charles la coque what you know me i saw you first in the street i saw you afterwards through this grating as you approached could i mistake you you wicked wretch may you be cursed to all eternity for your profanation of this sacred office la coque sank back a little into the shadows then bent forward again and spoke softly do you know fanchette i think i am coming out to strangle you the young lady now verging on hysteria answered with a scornful gasp it would be worthy of a man who could commit such an unutterable meanness and without a shadow of excuse o i had my excuse i was uncertain of your fidelity and you see how i was justified in my doubt then this opportunity offered and i couldnt resist taking it it was gaspare i suppose you corrupt everybody and everything you touch well you know now i hate you alls one for that its not your hate but your love that weve got to reckon with a nightingale forsooth that hired automaton that painted jackdaw mimicking his betters you shall answer for the insult what are you going to do i told you actually with the words he unbuttoned the hatch and stepped forth she crouched away from him huddled within the curtain her breath coming quick the church was quite empty and silent come to my loving arms fanchette she uttered a little whimper if you were not such a vain fool you would understand understand what that knowing who you were i should not so have betrayed myself if it had been true it is not true then it is true i do pity him and her pity excites a fonder feeling you have said it she hesitated saw no way out of the impasse and took refuge in the long threatened collapse he succumbed at once o hush girl for heavens sake all the world will hear you o o i dont care to be so doubted and put upon to have served this man as i have stifled my better feelings for his sake sought to ruin a mistress who has never shown me anything but kindness as good as offered to be the chevaliers abettor and their go between and then to be treated as if i were a perfide and a wanton i will never give my heart to anyone again i will beg admission into a convent and end my days a spouse of heaven o o he was terrified he knelt down by the struggling figure and crushed it within his arms seeking to suffocate its outcries fanchette you are betraying us for gods sake compose yourself there there girl i did not mean it i believe you on my soul to be true to me we must make our compact binding indissoluble never to be questioned from this time by either of us come with me through the sacristy gaspare is always my friend he will be my friend again and the priest is safe elsewhere any moment may bring discovery upon us come lovely and adorable let us kiss and forgive fanchette little by little coaxing and caressing he got her to her feet and away with him father leone pacing his garden was left undisturbed to his vegetable meditations and fanchettes conscience had to defer its unloading to a more convenient opportunity chapter xv a bolt from the blue surprised and beset in that moment of unguarded emotionalism fanchette had capitulated and there was an end to her scruples as a reluctant confederate with the sacrifice of her self respect went her last feeling of charity towards hard pressed virtue she regarded that now with the eyes of the qualified chre amie as an hypocrisy to be derided and shown up thenceforth she was in all things her showy tyrants most devoted auxiliary to be cursed or fondled to be used and abused to be dragged by him by the hair of her head should he please and so to revile him and spit at him and turn with raking fingers on any humane champion who should come to her aid that is to speak conditionally of fanchette but not of the type to which she belonged and to which she would sooner or later conform not that jimp figure of hers in its striped sarsenet frock with the slim waist not that demure smile and young mealy complexion would save her presently from the fate of the termagant swollen of feature and foul of tongue to which she was destined there was in her that seed of xantippe which is wont once quickened to sprout and increase and burst into riotous blossom in a night she was of the substance of the true virago vulgar incorruptible animal rending the lust she has provoked ready to die whether to spite or to save the object of her desire ecstatically courting her own destruction at the hands of the rage she has wantonly excited and all to prove her utter devotion to and absorption in the one such was fanchette in promise a sufficient foil even so undeveloped to the nobler passion she was called upon to assist in betraying that idyllic love should lie at the mercy of such coarse understandings but so is it decreed in this paradoxical world of ours where the myriad inanities sit in judgment on the sapient few where the rabble overrules the senate the dunce the scholar the loud illiterate voice the cultured wit la coque stood for the vulgar majority in this case his hatred of a finer spirit was simply the expression of an envious and ignoble mind he was avid to ruin tiretta and indifferent as to what other fair fames he besmirched in the process at the beginning he had had no least grounds save his own inventive malice for the scandal at which he had obscurely hinted later when he came to learn that appearances were at least beginning to give colour to his fiction his joy waxed great and fierce he began then seriously to contemplate the means and methods by which he might bring this belauded cockerel to his knees he set fanchette to watch and to report enough was soon gathered to give him a clue to his policy he aimed at nothing more at the outset than the disgrace and recall of his detested rival as he chose to consider him an end nevertheless which must be effected without compromising the infanta he was sharp enough to see that any mistake in that direction might involve himself in ruin it would be sufficient for his purpose could tiretta be led somehow and definitely into an amorous self betrayal armed with the evidences of which it would be easy for anyone to procure the reptiles dismissal he instructed fanchette to affect sympathy to worm herself into the chevaliers confidence to inveigle him if possible into a pretended intrigue with herself on the score that it would at once cover his real design and afford him particular opportunities for prosecuting it he instructed her so to manage appearances in fine that at the right moment m tiretta could be represented to the duke for the traitor he actually was and to the infanta as having been secretly prosecuting all this time a discreditable affaire with her own serving maid and to this pretty programme fanchette a procuress for loves sake was amiably prepared to subscribe even though she might endanger her own emotions in the process for she certainly found a fearful joy in playing with the fire kindled for anothers consuming as material for the plot that little scene in the corridor had had its timely uses it had put her and her gentleman on a confidential footing which that later whispered colloquy had encouraged and his own indecision confirmed thereafter he must suffer her secret intelligences meekly and little by little cease of any pretence at misreading them in truth poor fool in the torment of self reproach he must endure the solace of a sympathetic ally was hardly to be refused somehow it seemed to make him feel less guilty not that he frankly countenanced fanchettes partisanship or ever appeared to assume an inner meaning from it but like the artless receivers of stolen goods we hear of he accepted its fruits unquestioning and when she made profitable opportunities for him took them with the most ingenuous air possible he thought in truth she was a friend and so played in all things into her hands the main thing was for his greater exposure and degradation to discredit him in isabellas eyes fanchette took a peculiar pleasure in that moiety of her task one day having manuvred to come upon him alone in the grounds she met him point blank with a question which brought him up aghast are you in love with me monsieur he stared a moment and then bungled out a monosyllable why o she said it is a fair challenge is it not tell me do you think me pretty he was beginning to recover his self possession yes certainly i do fanchette he said do you take an obvious pleasure in my company if it is obvious it is obvious he answered evasively i will put it another way she said is it for my sake that you seek it so often do i seek it often she put up her face quite close to his and said mockingly would you like to kiss me now monsieur he drew back with a smiling shake of the head i honour your good fame too well fanchette she broke into a shrill little laugh o the darling the joseph and yet he cannot be happy apart from me why i wonder he will never say wherefore it behoves the poor rejected one to give him a morsel of advice she came close again and perked her chin at him do not think for a moment monsieur that i want your love and as for my good fame it can look after itself but for my company that is another matter from the point of view of your own interests and if you follow my advice you will continue to pretend to take pleasure in it if you do not feel any but i do feel pleasure girl that is well then and i say let your pleasure be as obvious to others as it is to yourself he looked his bewilderment and she derided him how slow of comprehension you are why for the reason that they may think this no more than an intrigue with a femme de chambre and so spare you the gossiping and eavesdropping which might otherwise work you mischief o understand me monsieur it is friendship which suggests this not inclination i do not propose to you to do more than pretend he looked stupefied i believe you are my true friend indeed he stammered and she laughed and snapped her fingers in his face and left him feeling as if he had suddenly pulled up on the brink of an abyss a pretended intrigue the very thought was profanation to his love an outrage and a shame but it embodied a quasi revelation which was even more ashaming fanchette knew his affectation of artless misunderstanding of her hints and innuendoes was exposed and finally for the guilty sham it was he positively blushed like a child detected in a lie was it a fact too that gossip was beginning to whisper he had been so absorbed in his dream had held it in truth so sacred from the world that he had never so much as imagined that danger from without not while the dream lasted the mad impossible beatitude and was it already threatening to an end he would not believe it so perfect and so uplifted risen above the reach of mortal hurts these shadows were but conditions of its brightness after all what had he done but follow the path appointed him and if by the way he had wandered into paradise that chance was in the itinerary he had not abused his paradise he had simply turned its inspiration into song in appearance at least there was nothing to convict him and so he ended with derision for that monstrous suggestion and a determination utterly to discard it yet the thing being always in his mind may have given him thenceforth in fanchettes company an air of self consciousness which the vicious might interpret if they would into a secret understanding let all that pass for the moment our theme is still of isabel and her young palmer in loves eye wandering yet unchallenged in their unsoiled eden now june with these bewitched lovers drifted down a golden haze into july and july itself burned stilly on towards harvest time it was the midsummer of their happiness all the world one soundless tide of light on which their dreaming hearts like the fairy nautilus made rainbow sail by mystic strands and silent moon drenched gardens and paths of rippling flame which ran into the sunset all time was rapture to them and most when they were silent and together for speech is but the sorry change of thought and cannot for all its volume match one golden maxim of the soul what they felt each to the other was better understood unspoken in sleep alone it found the perfect utterance one day loitering so rapt they came upon a terrace corner by the house where at a mans height above the ground was a window with a little balcony looking towards the lower gardens here were myrtle bushes growing and loading the air with their scent beyond the turf shelved down to meet the leafy margin of the thickets which enshrined the flowery walks and lily ponds dear to the girls heart she paused and pointed to the window did you know she asked that was my bower my oratory he shook his head smiling it is she said have i not a beautiful altar to worship at he understood this view the green dale of quietude with all its lovely secrets i like best madonna the lilies of your altar piece ah if one could but see them it is enough to know they are there as i know the love that is in your heart it is sweet i think in hiding but some day it will be sweeter to go down and drown among my lilies is the basil in bud yet not yet she called him by the name it was only hers to know he sighed it is shyer than these myrtles why did we not make them the symbol of our bridal they have the better right i wonder what it waits for my lifes blood perhaps aquaviva would say she cried bonbec and looked at him with such a white piteousness that his heart smote him beloved he whispered that was a senseless and a wicked thought forgive me for it but i wish the basil would blossom where do you keep it in that same dear bower he stood on tiptoe to peep but could catch no more than a glimpse of daintily flowered silks and hangings and gilded mirrors and a sheen of marqueterie and ormolu all in the richly fragile fashion of the day no she said still pale and troubled in my bedroom which is above he wafted a kiss to that lily sanctuary could you not unsuspected come down from it he whispered just to the little balcony and speak with me when all the house is silent to be alone together in the night my beautiful her cheek had turned from pale to pink but she looked at him with unfaltering eyes i will do anything you tell me to she said even if it were that isabel it would not be wrong if you told me much moved he touched her hand and bade her sleep undisturbed for him and speak for me in your prayers he said every night she answered when i kneel to our unknown god bonbec and pray that some day we may find the print of his footsteps under the rainbow it was his song that was in her mind that had become indeed her new faiths inspiration that passion of the past of which he had spoken and into whose ghostly texture her own life seemed woven those long far lands of home towards whose unutterable rest and understanding his spirit sought to convey her to what more soothing wings of mysticism could she confide her burden of fearful joys and apprehensions northward the worlds unfathomed mystery of the pointing finger the threshold of the great wonder and home not home new made but home recovered that was the ecstasy of the thought they had been wanderers apart these long centuries and now at last were come together again upon the starry track fond nonsense was it not and yet so strangely real to them that that flight together up the white staircase of the world for ever took them in fancy homewards when they thought of escape not spoke for that had not come yet those little outpost islands in the cold seas were always their mental refuge and first breathing place but these transcendent moods were not for every occasion they had their living eden to engage them and it was sweet to tread all day on flowers and hear the drowsy doves murmur and take the sun into their hearts and so fate allowed it until the golden cup was brimming one night long cause had tiretta to remember that night with rapture and with grief the gonzals left the two alone together in the salon whither the chevalier had been invited to improvise sweet ditties for the ladies behoof he had not perhaps acquitted himself very well he seldom did under compulsion and the marquise had shown signs of boredom she was overfed she was sleepy she was cross moreover she had an indescribable air as of resenting the lagging close of an entertainment which had lost its point and its motive there was patronage in her manner to the soldier there was even a hint of insolence at last she said with rude impatience well minstrels stale i find like other sweetmeats and there comes a time when we wonder why we cloyed ourselves with them after all they only appear at the feast to prove how well we could have done without them she had gorged herself at dessert on marrons glacs the old pig and no doubt spoke feelingly yet there seemed a motive behind her ill manners too i have sung badly said tiretta good humouredly i admit it eh bien said madame it does not matter in the least you have done your best and there is an end of it she got up almost immediately having delivered herself though with a hurried manner as if she doubted having gone too far and saying she had an appointment to keep and would be back in a minute waddled out of the room to sleep whispered isabella she will say to herself it is only to shut her eyes for a moment but it will be an hour she will expect to find me gone when she returns said tiretta it was a very palpable hint he stood before the girl she rose and they looked at one another their hearts were somehow conscious of a vague foreboding then she moved and made a sign to him to follow her to the window together they stepped out upon the balcony which overlooked the dreaming grounds it was a night for love and lovers the moon burned large behind a film of mist whose gauze just veiled the barren spaces of the dark and charmed the sleeping trees and shook within its tissue a spangled star or two caught like fireflies in a web deep and shadowy below them lay the gardens their far solitary sentinels two dim and grey colossi hercules and a satyr whose hugeness alone had in past days saved them from the hands of the despoiler now mere unsubstantial phantoms of the mist they seemed to move and palpitate as if some antique spirit in the night stirred in their stony veins here and there low down a light twinkled from a distant lodge or villa not a sound broke the utter stillness save now and again the drowsy burr of a cricket or the swish of a bats wings as its shadow dipped and fled silent in that breathing trance of things the two stood together and drank in the beauty of the scene their pulses throbbed in unison to its sensuous appeal they touched and did not draw apart never before had he seemed so dear or she so fair in the others eyes he marvelled how he could ever have dared to lift his to this white miracle of girlhood to dream of possessing it as she stood near him the sense of her proud young loveliness so submissive to his love of all that maiden treasure and he the chosen master of its sweets and secrets swelled in his heart until he scarce could bear its rapture mad thoughts were surging in his brain he felt that he was losing command of himself when suddenly she turned and spoke to him a tense emotion in her voice whatever happens keep me in your heart isabel he breathed he held out his arms and she came instantly into them and gave her lips to him yielding herself utterly with just one sigh like a dreaming childs all discretion all good resolutions were forgotten in the passionate stress of that moment he strained her to his breast with a fierce tyranny of possession and her face lifted close to his she whispered out her soul i shall not be false even though o you will believe me you will believe me will you not hush he said what is there to fear i do not know she sighed not the cryptic utterances of that rude old woman your mind too is troubled how can i be so close to you and not feel it bonbec i am afraid of to morrow come away with me then here to night i will get horses and we will fly northwards isabel to the unknown eros he gave us to one another o long long past in the beautiful gardens and i cannot live without you beloved duty honour reason throw them all to the wolves so that our love alone remain to us she clasped her white arms about his neck and with one soft hand caressed the hair from his forehead would it remain dear my lord or would you not come to grudge the price you paid for it and yet i love you so that i must risk it but not till every other hope is gone what hope isabel ah i do not know but give me that plea of desperation for my pretext then at last if you call to me i will come my princess my true heart not your princess but your slave bonbec my bird then o yes indeed caught captive by a song and trembling in your hand some noise real or imaginary startled them he stirred but she would not let him go yet one moment beloved is it she returning he said well let her find us to die for you isabel what a little thing it sounds beside my love just to change this mortal suit for one more meet to await our nuptials in yet how sweet the body clings to sweet she struggled to free herself to push him from her no go she said for pitys sake bonbec o you kill my heart with fear one last kiss to comfort it she tore herself from him and he left her going gaily through the empty room all that night he slept on roses and all the following day he walked on air his brain drugged with an exultant ecstasy which bore him far above the world of common thoughts and common apprehensions some instinct holding him from presuming too soon on a transcendent favour he took horse and rode far into the country returning only to the palace when night was falling and presently hardly knowing what to hope or what to fear from it the summons reached him to attend the ladies in the salle daudience she was not there when he entered it only the old marquise who rose with unwonted condescension and alacrity to greet him ah monsieur she said you are to congratulate us and yourself on the happy termination of your labours there was a sort of leery jubilance in her manner sufficiently significant in the context of late forebodings he looked at her stupidly i do not understand he said what she cried you have not heard heard what i have been absent all day and no advice has reached this amorous proxy from his indulgent principal eh well monsieur wonders will never cease it was for us to suppose that your periodical reports to the archduke were lately of such a favourable nature as to decide his highness upon thus bringing matters to a head and he has not informed you of his decision no madame that i then should be the first to enlighten you if you please madame it is only monsieur that her imperial majesty has despatched an ambassador to parma to request for her son joseph the hand of the infanta such you may consider if you like is the fruit of your fond advocacy if he was staggered he took the blow standing and like a soldier no hint of what he felt must betray itself here even the old lady was half imposed upon by his manner and her highness herself he said in a voice whose very desperation lent it coolness she is reconciled hoity toity cried the marquise a fine expression to apply to her else said the chevalier why should i be here well answered madame that is true enough but it was not diplomatic judged by the alacrity with which she obeyed her fathers summons to court i should say she was very well reconciled indeed she has gone to parma to receive the betrothal ring monsieur and so your task is ended henceforth so long as you favour us with your company here you are free to command your own time and your own inclinations i can appreciate believe me the relief it will be to us all chapter xvi fast bind fast find it was a very impressive ceremony this betrothal by ring conventual almost sacramental in its character the ambassadors face had been flushed his voice hushed as he had presented this visible symbol of what was to him but something less than a hypostatic union in which he himself modestly represented the third figure in the trinity whereafter not as bride of christ but of christs more confident vicegerent the heir of austria stood isabella pledged by token of the shining gem half slipping from her listless finger the words were spoken the gage hung there in witness of their numbing actuality she was left alone with the duke her father its first heat of transport had faded from don philips cheek and been succeeded by a rather rigid pallor a look of hardness both furtive and resentful he uttered a little sardonic laugh the most extreme expression of humour to be allowed himself by an infant of spain and pacing an aimless step or two turned with a sudden violence on his child well he barked she shook her hand and the ring dropped from it fell and bounded on the carpet it is too big for me she said piteously he stood transfixed a moment then forgot his dignity so far as to dive and recover the desecrated trinket god in heaven he began then checked himself and choked down his fury a defect soon remedied he said his voice quite hoarse but not my unfitness to wear it she answered o father have pity on me he went off like a madman flinging back and forth the length of the room and ended by stopping suddenly his fists raised and clinched to apostrophise space that our dearest hopes should have come to be realised and for this that we should have devoted our love our diplomacy our peace of mind to the welfare of this monster of inconsistency and ingratitude she cried out o no no o lord and father not either he came round actually grinding his teeth i foresaw this i read indifference and rebellion in your reception of his highnesss plenipotentiary but i tell you that your protests will be of no avail that we refuse to listen for an instant to any one of the fancied scruples which would deprive us in the very fruition of our hopes of the reward of so much disinterested self sacrifice she let the storm pass waiting with bowed head and presently with an effort to command himself he put a question to her what is your unfitness speak she looked up then the tears brimming in her eyes i do not think i was born for a throne she said so movingly that his heart should have been touched a little its grandeur frightens me he waved that absurdity aside with hauteur to scratch his pride was to find the cold inflexible spaniard you were born your fathers daughter he said with a brevity which was final then he bent his eyes searchingly on her is there nothing else no romantic folly of a young and foolish brain for one moment so temperate his tone had fallen she had a mad impulse to tell him the truth to throw herself upon his mercy and his love but the thought of whom she might endanger thereby came to her in time to stay the confession on her lips i am so young father she said if it is romance to want to keep my youth a little longer and then to yield it to a humbler state than this i am guilty of it i suppose but i do so love the simple things of life and i am not heroic in the least what need of heroism here you fool o much much to throw away all that is dear to me to be an empress still he searched her young innocence with that frowning stare at length stirring and setting his lips grimly he made to close the colloquy all folly and madness as you must know the step is taken it is irrevocable and you must reconcile yourself to the position imposed upon you imposed imposed she wrung her pretty hands and writhing pressed them to her mouth o that is it no choice for me to give myself away from all i love she ran and threw herself at the dukes feet and caught at his hands and wept to him in mercy father do not make me do this thing he sought to free himself from her in his fury he even dragged her as she knelt so that she almost fell before him i think you are mad he said yes mad she answered i am mad you must not wed a mad woman to an emperors son he was frightened a little over the vehemence of her despair whatever was to account for it it was not to be laid it seemed by coercion he must try other means a different appeal if a startled suspicion had risen in his heart he must not betray it his pride indeed prevented him he passed a hand across his forehead and forced himself to address her in calmer tones come he said control yourself and try to be reasonable why consider my little isabelita what it is you ask of me how utterly wild and impossible you have not been ignorant of our plans for you or of the steps by which they have reached at last this triumphant consummation and all this time you have shown no sign of revolt of anything but a tacit conforming to our wishes what has suddenly changed you his face darkened in spite of himself i think she said there are no slaves in all the world like princesses it is not for me as with the free and happy to say to my father i have tried with all my heart because you desired it and yet i cannot and i know it would be wrong to give myself rather with aversion than with regard it is enough with more fortunate girls to say i do not love him but what does that avail with us aversion he breathed the word in deep scorn when you have not even met him o father you have said it i have not even met him what then he burst out again in spite of all his efforts at self control have you no sense of decency of what your rank demands of you there should be loftier motives than mere personal feeling behind these great alliances but i will hear no more my patience is exhausted i will not marry him he stared at her in amazement sullen and obdurate he said you will not we will see o i knew very well you had started with an insane prejudice the mere peevish humour of an unreasonable child but beware kingdoms are not to be bandied on such terms of spoilt caprice what or who has instigated you to this rebellion i say if any has abused his trust to do so let him look well to the consequences of his daring she was scared in her turn now so scared that her heart for an instant seemed to stop i am a woman father she said faintly why should you look for anything beyond a womans natural repugnance to being pledged against her choice or will he did not answer for a minute and then in a softened more persuasive tone he said a woman child to be sure and i had thought it enough to appeal to the woman in you the daughter first of all how we had laboured for this alliance prayed for it rejoiced at last in its reality ah mon dieu you cannot know and yet you should know it has been the hope of our maturity our comfort and solace in our days of bitter trial it was to set us right with the world to relieve us of our embarrassments to enable us to do justice at last to the many poor souls long devoted to our fortunes and with you it rested to be the almoner to all these pathetic needs father no you kill me with your words kill you ah child what if it kill your mother in the frail state she is in to learn of this final blow to her hopes she had thrown her arms as she knelt across a chair and now laid her face on them abandoned to hopeless grief am i to speak her death sentence then asked the duke in a broken whisper her face still hidden she held out her poor left hand understanding he slipped the ring upon the quivering finger and wise in the resolve to let well alone went softly from the room and left her to her despair in the corridor outside he came upon m la coque who scanned his agitated face with a furtive curiosity the duke motioned his favourite to follow him and led the way into his private closet where he threw himself into a chair and began to fan his brow exhaustedly with his handkerchief charlot he said presently looking up from under languid lids is the door shut it is fast monseigneur the duke signed to him to come nearer you were witness of her reception of the pledge of the infantas now who else the infantas of course well how did it strike you that mademoiselle perhaps made a little light of the gift the duke dabbed his forehead and sat up suddenly with a sigh charlot your highness what was that you once hinted to me about someones art with a little a your highness thought fit at the time very properly i am sure to reprove me for what was merely an idle speculation very likely you declined to state your authority if i remember do you still that must be conditional on what on your condonation of a certain liaison well well who is the other party to it charlot i must crave your highnesss absolution you have it coquin it is fanchette becquet then the infantas first femme de confiance ah rogue the duke frowned then sighed again that is to bring corruption very near the fount of innocence not corruption monsieur but salvation if i have sacrificed myself to serve your highness o la la o to be sure you are a very disinterested scamp but that sort of sacrifice will never get you into heaven and what was innocence doing to risk its salvation my friend has your highness formed no opinion the duke shrugged his shoulders pettishly wearifully you smile and hint and shuffle round the truth as if you would seek to have me understand it without compromise to yourself why the devil cant you speak out what encouragement have i when my motives are misconstrued into spite and jealousy i was told once how this envious spirit of mine might get me into trouble with deference monseigneur i think you sometimes hardly recognise your true friends maybe charlot and maybe i did you wrong only if you are one and the best of them as i do now incline to believe in honesty speak out and prove it be candid as the day i bid you i beg you charlot my friend well then i start on this you sneer at my disinterestedness as illustrated by this little affaire but i will tell you i have a true passion for this girl i desire to monopolise her affections and yet i have bidden her so to contrive as that she shall fall under suspicion of an intrigue with the chevalier tiretta o just under suspicion that will not harm you monseigneur well knows that what is begun in play will often end in earnest i risk that and why out of devotion to your interests here is a case which i will put so far specifically a lover sends a friend to plead his cause for him a mad thing to do and the madder the more persuasive the friend we know the proper advocate lives in his part the cause is just worth him and no more if he wins he takes the credit and the fees but supposing there are those among us who having recognised the danger are decided that the advocate must be foiled in his design at whatever cost there is nothing for us then but so to brand his character that he will be forced to withdraw prematurely from the case your highness smokes me par exemple that is where your little cocotte comes in that is where fanchette comes in and with what result as regards the subject of the real intrigue why that she learns at last with indignation that what is offered her is but the reversion of a passion she believed so single to herself that a thirst she deemed divine is content to slake itself in the common ditch you flatter your fanchette and your own taste charlot that in short her god of gold is revealed a god of brass i thank your highness so this m tiretta if i have judged aright falls from his estate of perfection after all a woman wears a lover as she does a robe exclusively that is to say a thing for her sole possession fashions grow out of fashion when the lesser ape them the duke meditating darkly awhile rose from his chair and went pacing frowningly to and fro so said he stopping suddenly in his walk i am to understand that you have taken these means on your own responsibility and that you consider yourself justified in taking them why because in doing so i believe myself to be acting as your highnesss true friend but why man why in what lies your justification that is what i want to know in my little friends reports of an intrigue of an intrigue in the making at least and now nipped in the bud if you authorise the process she knows nothing as yet of this amiable scheme to disenchant her nothing but the ground is all prepared you do not sir imply for a moment that my daughter mademoiselle is as guiltless as the angels i stake my soul on it i should have preferred something of more value but let that pass you approve the scheme then if necessary but i trust that folly is ended that all will be well henceforth nevertheless i applaud your true vigilance my friend upon my conscience monseigneur i think you should admit that i have manuvred well both to circumvent scandal and to make his own treachery recoil on the head of the betrayer that i could hold that forfeit but the charge is too shadowy and he is the archdukes protg still the time may come now the man must be got rid of and without delay you will see to that i think and in the meanwhile the infanta remains with us here at parma under watch if i might suggest charlot your highness i think perhaps it would be as well to put your scheme at once to the proof i will instruct fanchette forthwith sir yes that is right it will perhaps relieve the situation his mind cleared he hummed a little stave and turned roguishly on the other i hope you will not find that the little cocotte like your other advocate has accommodated herself too realistically to her part that were a cursed return for your trust in her i took it into the reckoning sir if she has my own with her will come as soon as she has ceased to be of use that is all o shocking shocking come go call la roque and we will forget all this tedious stuff over a game at ombre chapter xvii the lost presence it is a pathetic paradox that we never truly acquire anything until we have lost it to possess rightly what is ours we must be deprived of it must come to view it down the perspectives of the past and gone to enable us to get its real proportions into focus that would seem to imply that as the mystics teach us matter is the illusion and imagination the reality since loss opens our mental vision to a thousand truths to which while possessing them we were blind the miser robbed and pauperised realises too late the countless opportunities for happiness he has forgone the desolated lover knows at last the devotion which risked death to pleasure him rather than deny to the lesser faith that proof which to its own more strong and pure was inessential so it often is that to die is to live for the first time as ones true self even in the hearts of those who cherished us ah death who clears the vision in whom all revealed truths corradiate give us back the child the friend the lover whose worth we never really estimated until you opened our eyes to all that it had meant to us the qualities we were impatient of because we could not understand the motives we misinterpreted even the small vitalities that often worried us got in our way seemed importunate and tiresome what would we not give at last to hear again one tone of the insistent voice to feel again one touch of the restless hands whose very tyranny expressed a fearless confidence in the love that would not see but it may not be our knowledge comes in loss and were these to be restored to us the veil of flesh would again close in and blind our vision to their truth that lost presence if with all our memory of its faults it can figure so ineffably dear to us be so comprehended at last for its lovely indispensability how must it live in a heart which has never learned to associate anything with it but the gentlest perfection of form and nature so the widowed heart of tiretta regarded its deprivation with him the larger knowledge was but as the knowledge of a transfiguration from love the saint to love the goddess at first he could not realise that she was gone even from the house that her voice and light step had made so beautiful that she could have gone out of his life would have seemed a desolation too monstrous for belief and yet he had known throughout on what a precarious tenure he held his lease of light and how wilfully how infatuatedly he had blinded his soul to its impermanence it could not but be blinded still while the glamour of that last meeting hung in his brain like an intoxicating incense in his ecstasy of sure possession there was no room at the moment for doubts and apprehensions it was only when he came fully to grasp the fact that in the official view he was wholly done with her that she had been taken from him like a patient cured and that no reason existed in the world why they should ever meet again that a sense of his own incredible position seemed to break in upon him she was not gone for a day a week a month she was gone so far as their intimacy was concerned for ever henceforth her august and his obscure destinies separated to flow continually wider apart no road of his conceivably led to parma where she was established not again to return not to return he had to grip himself to realise that stupendous fact to get at last on terms with the conscience he had so long eluded and then flowing flowing in from that outer darkness to which it had been relegated came the deadly spirit of guilt and remorse and he awoke to blank amazement of his dream and whither it had brought him now he had to stand up a desperate creature and parley with his soul what was he going to do in this crisis of his affairs the just the expiatory thing since mercifully it might be said heaven had snatched him from his self delusion in time to make atonement possible if hitherto the odds against him had been morally overwhelming here was the psychologic moment of respite the breathing the renewing time when he could still withdraw with some honour to himself and so what of her sacrificed in her innocent trust like piteous iphigenia to appease the anger of the gods no it was unthinkable he was not hero or coward enough to condemn his own soul to that renunciation let the gods visit his weakness on his head as they would to go to let her believe him faithless spiritless believe his love to which she leaned in wistful confidence a thing of straw he could not do it not though reason pointed to it as the wise and noble course what had he to do with reason whose bliss had been in defying it he had sinned to his friend already beyond redemption would it mend his salvation to play the traitor to his love o his love his beautiful love if it had been madness before to relinquish that dream how much more impossible was it now when loss had made of it an immortal ecstacy had transported it from earth to heaven had exalted its little madonna of the white feet to those starry heights where no breath of gross desire might reach her now she belonged to him tenfold by right of that immaculateness he was jealous of her virgin fame since she was enthroned there by his will a tender thing no longer for the rough wounding of mans passion let her thus dwell for ever in the skies serene and chaste and adorable the world was free to kneel with him and worship though her chosen one he would demand no closer privilege for himself but they would not let it be they had haled her from her heaven meaning to despoil her and what alternative had he then but to claim her bodily for his own friendship good faith policy what were all these as against his age long title the wild mystic compact made in those far green gardens that was the older the more binding troth of which when he accepted his credentials from the archduke he had guessed nothing now if honour bound him it was there he could not help it if the humour of the thing jumped with his inclination he would recognise all this sometimes for the casuistry it was but mostly so strangely was the mystic in him blended with the rationalist it would possess his mind with all the force of an actual memory but it mattered little after all with what he chose to salve his conscience since angry or half healed he found no solution in it of his difficulties those were to know what to do now the inevitable against which he had made no provision was upon him he had sung like the improvident grasshopper and the winter of his rapture found him unprepared was it still possible they might communicate and arrange some plan of action and if so what plan at the least it must be a mad and a desperate one staking their all on the cast hopeless from the first of compromise yet he was ready if she was brave he must learn that must force the knowledge somehow or would she find means to provide him with it unasked not for one moment would he believe in the reality of her asserted reconciliation to her doom he was as sure of her true heart as he was of his own imperishable constancy yet what to do he did nothing as i opine all but the resourceful heroes of romance would do under like circumstances so did he he temporised he could not bring himself to believe indeed that their separation was final he was always in the hope that the formal betrothal achieved she would be allowed to return to colorno and he was doggedly resolved pending such blissful restoration not only to outstay his welcome but to ignore the broadest and least delicate hints of which the marquise was not sparing that he might with advantage to everyone be gone his amiable persistency even had its effect at length on the rude old lady especially when for diplomacys sake he brought the persuasion of his voice to bear upon her still responsive susceptibilities the suggestion that the main theme withdrawn he could find even freer inspiration for his songs in her ripe understanding came so to captivate her that in the end from suffering his flatteries she quite coveted them and finally she made love to him thereat a little alarmed he drew back and perhaps so obviously as to precipitate his own downfall but of that in a moment in the meanwhile he spent the most of his days in wandering about the now desolate grounds his heart a prey to vain longings and vainer expectations no word or sign came in all this time to solace or decide him he walked the very spirit of loneliness and brooding melancholy a being most pathetically haunted once he went to aquavivas gardens and talked graciously with the little bissy because he was a pet of hers and spent a sweet sad hour in the orange grove absorbed in one delirious memory but mostly he frequented the palace walks retasting unforgettable delights he could have kissed her lilies one by one on their open mouths to stand approximately in her footprints was a fatuous joy to him often he stole to her vacant windows and committed his soul to their sweet inaccessible mysteries the children he rather avoided they worried him with their unfeeling prattle yet still he lingered on it could not last much longer and he knew it could not but what was to be the end he never doubted her love not for one instant he pictured her like himself waiting waiting for the deliverance that would not come for the reunion that hard fate debarred them she would yield herself to him she had said when hope was gone he had but to call and she would fly to hide herself in his breast so it was hope that parted them yet how was he to banish hope and still regain her it was upon hope he lived once he wove this sorrowful exaltation of his into a rhapsody of love and loss the sense of which may be rendered in the following lines once for a thousand years twas spring love reigned and death stood still the world paused at its burgeoning of may and daffodil like buds from spiring lilies thrown time blossomed over time it seemed ere yet its sweets were blown that earth to heaven would climb it seemed all wrath all hate were fled and sole bright sense remained that something evil had been sped and some new knowledge gained then no fruits were but endless bliss of love that knew no sting and laughed him on from kiss to kiss like bees ahoneying the rains were gone the skies were blue nor any cloud had birth save but to drop a gentle dew like balm upon the earth nor grief nor grievance ere could be in fields so fair bedight and above the fields of eternity soft blossomed through the night and there the moon the witch of dreams her web of slumber wrought till in its soft and silken beams ten thousand stars were caught and there the moon with shining eyes her silken web prepared to catch the stars like fireflies and kiss them being snared o sweet it was in woods and bowers and no fear to conceive but meal of honey gave the flowers and dew the cups of eve o sweet it was o sweet it was no sweeter could befall while love the end was and the cause god knows what changed it all a kiss too much too full a sigh the vessel brimmd oer and the creaking wain of destiny moved onwards as before and so he lingered on amidst the golden ruins of his paradise wondering as if his brain were stupefied over what he had done to bring it thus in a moment about his ears he was not permitted to wonder long whether it were that she soon realised the hollowness of his attentions to herself or the real peril of his continued presence in the neighbourhood or which is most probable that she was wearied with the whole business the marquise took steps to make his further stay in the palace impossible to him once resolved she went about the business after her uncompromising fashion she opened upon him one night without relevance or preface like cupid monsieur you are everyones match maker it seems and nobodys gallant and yet sometimes i wonder over what madame why as to there being possibly a subtler purpose in your advocacy than you let appear what purpose for example call it the purpose of the first fruits such as it is said our provincial monseigneurs claim on unions to which they give their blessing he drew back as if he had received a blow in the face but she went on with perfect serenity there was for instance that little volage fanchette now in parma with her mistress whom you made happy with her gentleman i made happy did you not or was it only that having taken your fee the case resolved itself without your help he rose from his chair as pale and grim as death what purpose can you have in thus insulting me he said she gave a high little laugh quite placid insult such as you o i can assure you monsieur your methods have not failed to interest us you have been very discreet but walls have eyes as well as ears do not think i blame you for insisting on your price such devotion deserves to be paid in kind you lie he said quite quietly now i have only that to say eh she cried it was not for that then that you intrigued with her or was it possibly that you thought to use the girl as stepping stone to higher things his amazement showed in his face i have neither used nor abused her he said i know nothing whatever of her affairs of the heart it is a base and wicked slander whoever uttered it i say so much and no more because my honour demands it you will permit me to withdraw madame i quit the palace to night that is as you please she answered unruffled and he left her he had no alternative his raging heart assured him he must go at once whatever his departure might portend to his hopes but to stay on here thus vilified thus enlightened was impossible o into what foul passes had his sin allured him and that they could have been existing all this time unsuspected by him like filthy slums environing the places which her very footsteps had made holy the thought of them of himself in such connection was a profanation to her memory his soul cried out to him to claim and bear her away to a purer atmosphere to a lovelier knowledge into the white grave mysteries of the north whither first as he halted a moment undecided a palace functionary pursued him with a despatch he opened it and read it was from the archduke recalling him peremptorily to vienna chapter xviii an interview i would have laid down my life for my friend my friend asked of me a harder thing he stood before the prince his head erect his hand motionless upon his sword hilt joseph sitting as quietly in the chair he had pushed back from the table regarded him steadily dispassionately even at last with an odd touch of pity in his expression the season was early august the place a private cabinet in the old imperial palace called the burg so much i have inferred said the young archduke his voice not cold but even from the duke of parmas recent advices to me recommending your recall i had not known before tiretta that a soldier looked upon the vindication of his honour as so difficult a task he noted with an observant interest the spasm that twitched the set features at his words he was in all things curious and analytical i have deserved this was the low answer stab sir and turn your creese in the wound you do me an injustice said joseph calmly it is to the scalpel not the sword that i would have you reveal yourself if i probe i probe for instruction the soldiers code for instance is it not a strict one what harder thing did i ask of you than to obey orders i seek simply for information no need to i am a villain tut tut my friend that is merely to beg the question you know my views very well a man is not to be summed up in that convenient fashion is it for instance the assertion of a villain that he would sacrifice his life for his friend would to god i could do it and so cut the knot the eyes watchful inquisitive in the pale narrow young face canvassed the speaker curiously well said their owner at length will you not answer my question you ask me sir what was peculiarly hard to me a soldier in that mere call to obedience nothing i answer that you could send me into the fight having first broken my sword in its scabbard that was the hard thing the prince seemed to ponder a little sitting without movement save for a slight corrugation of his brows no i do not understand he said presently you would seem to imply that i wilfully dedicated you to destruction wilfully yes i do not say consciously can will be unconscious of itself in princes sir because no one dreams of questioning it in them there can be no conscious force without conscious resistance the young philosopher considered again as appraising a plausible theory very well he said then to return from the abstract to the particular what is represented in fact by this symbol of the broken sword my broken honour sir for which you were responsible no you must explain what have you forgotten the incident at the ford from which all this luckless mission derived to send a convicted pander to sing his employers praises god in heaven who but a prince could have failed to foresee the end well sir continue i begin i think to perceive not justly sir nor the whole i sang your praises i was loyal to my friendship and my humiliating task never doubt that for one instant but what was the force of an advocacy so recommended what any but a prince might have foretold i was scorned i was repudiated and rightly because my honour was in question and that i could not endure it was above all things dear to me and i wrought to exculpate it i could not have gained a hearing without and that is my excuse and my crime he ended breathing deeply still the unwinking eyes canvassed him and without emotion it seemed you sought to convince her of your honour i had no alternative by converting it so vindicated to a dishonourable purpose i never ceased to extol your highnesss noble qualities no not to the end the end for the first time some emotion showed itself in josephs face he started as if he would rise but leaned back again resolute to control himself you may question my honour sir said tiretta in the name of god leave hers unsullied by a thought steadfastly for some moments the two regarded one another then joseph rose from his chair and walking to a window stood looking out upon an inner court of the palace which it commanded presently without turning he spoke you are very severe on princes my friend yet it seems they can be guileless in their trusts if sir by guileless you mean despotic they are the most trusting souls on earth so might we all be if a wish with us overruled without question every possible or impossible objection how can princes enter into common human feelings when they have had no least experience of them to feel one must suffer and be denied do i not feel i think i could convince you you feel for yourself sir i do not doubt it in this disillusionment about one you had thought to be your true friend and servant i feel for you tiretta he had turned as he spoke and now came forward until he stood face to face with the man who had wronged him there was a look in his eyes strangely like compassion truly i can feel for you he said as for anyone who lets his heart go out towards the unattainable a shadow seemed to fall upon the soldiers face so speaks the prince he said generous and fine minded but still the prince can a prince be slave to love sir history would seem to say so ah he may rule everything else but not that he cannot rule what in common with all men he is subject to a prince in love is just a man in love he too may suffer the unattainable for some moments the archduke stood silent then slightly nodding his head made answer true tiretta that is quite true i cannot command love i might possess and murder to possess its form still not to me but to the shadow of the dead would belong all that was worth possessing in it have you deserved death i do not know i only know i would not have the thing i seek made unattainable and that would it become were i to kill you yet what to do tell me my friend for i am in your hands in mine emotion sudden and startled shook the inflexible voice tiretta the young prince put a hand quite movingly and unexpectedly on his erst favourites shoulder the action generous and manly spoke the real heart under all its philosophic veneer admit said joseph have you not a little exaggerated the cause in order to justify the end the name you gave yourself it was given me sir by implication by whom or what the sweetest and most innocent lips in the world you wrong them i am sure even more than you do yourself or me but the fault was mine you say yet i had always honestly thought you insusceptible to such emotions a dreamer a wooer of abstractions well i was mistaken it seems your strength was unequal to the task my faith in it imposed on you which of us was most to blame i in directing you in accepting what need to quarrel about that now we have made a botch of it between us and the thing for us to discuss is how best to mend a lamentable case will you not tell me the whole truth tiretta my friend before god i will the man was profoundly touched then say are you to her what she is to you that were impossible nay you equivocate on my soul then i believe that heaven helping us she would give me her hand to morrow a slight tremor seemed to take the archdukes features he stood back quitting his hold on the other a minutes tense silence ensued well he said at length just repressing a sigh i repeat i am in your hands again impulsively he advanced and renewed his caressing touch there can be no issue but one you know it tiretta man you know it we are all in the bonds of fate and helpless now listen and believe me if it were possible i would yield her to you it is not possible then would you condemn your friend to a loveless match what would you have me do his voice was quite wrung and broken i would have you said joseph atone in the only way you can the wrong you have done not to me but to her i am to go never to see her again to leave her believing me faithless better a faithless lover than a faithless wife so only can you heal the wound you have inflicted for her sake tiretta why do you not call in your guards and have me silenced for ever i will make no resistance because i am human though a prince tiretta for a while desperate still mutinous the mans torn soul fought out its tragedy of renunciation and at last impulsively surrendered with bowed head he spoke the words you have a noble mind sir if you will not retaliate on me as you might death is always somewhere waiting for the soldier i will go do what i may to seek an honourable one and so heaven forgive me and requite your highness he took the gracious young hand in his put his lips to it and turning left the room walking with blinded eyes and upright head like a prisoner who passes from the dock to the condemned cell chapter xix mariana the real tragedy of separation is not for the banished lover it is for the desolate home keeper who knows no distractions of change and movement to solace her aching heart he at least has his freedom his new interests she none but the old grown now so flat and unprofitable since the glorifying light was once flashed upon them and withdrawn how darker than darkness looks a room when the lamp is blown out how stale and charmless seems life the morning after the play how remote from the witching darling of last nights masque appears this love sick chloe yawning biliously over her untouched breakfast plate perhaps strephon this morning also looks a little off colour and feels a little sick but he has the imperative duties of office to call him to a sane resumption of lifes prose and no doubt by lunch time he has earned himself a vigorous appetite no less hearty for the sentiment which has intervened between his chop of yesterday and his curried prawns of to day but for poor stay at home chloe some zest has gone for ever from the old placid satisfactions she cannot recover at their past valuation the humdrum routine of things she has seen the commonplace transformed and henceforth life to her to be life must reveal itself on a higher plane so she still toys with her food at luncheon and again at dinner and sighs over the insufferable dreariness and monotony of that social existence which once made her full content what made the assembly shine o what indeed poor isabel since your days have fallen into so sad a melancholy and the light has fled from your haunted eyes because lorenzo came not alas he did not come he did not speak and to what was life reduced lacking his voice and presence so thinking the same thought of unaccountable neglect these divided lovers mourned apart sometimes in her heart she would upbraid him calling him false and cruel but more often she accused herself saying she had been his ruin his evil genius and again bemoaning her own fatal weakness in not flying with him when he had bidden her yet granted they were well parted he might have salved her anguish with something kinder than this killing silence had he so soon forgotten her forgotten how she had bidden him call to her when all hope was gone and she would fly to him no she could not she would not believe it it was only that he did not realise how cruelly souls condemned to pining inaction might suffer out in the free air it was so hard to enter into the feelings of the dull prisoner hidden from ones ken she made every loving excuse for him and still poor thing she hungered for a sign and hungering trembled at the thought of her own wickedness for was she not a plighted bride enslaved by token of the hateful golden fetter clasping her finger she wore it in public to the duke her fathers vacuous content but at night she would fling it from her and kneel to her basil and kiss its perfumed leaves and moan out her passionate penitence for even that show of disloyalty she had brought this her treasure of treasures with her and it was her one comfort and reassurance in all the grievous time one day it came to her did he know of the formal betrothal perhaps he had looked to her loves high courage to resist to the last and learning the mortal truth how at the first onset she had failed him had renounced so frail an ally o in that case how could she let him know that her heart had never once wavered in its fidelity to him let him know that whatever bitter fate forced their steps apart she was his in everything but seeming to all eternity poor child she was always more loving than wilful no forceful heroine to command her own destiny she waited for the call only bewildered as to what to do to evoke it she could obey but she could not initiate perhaps at first she had hoped like that other that the ceremony once achieved she would be allowed to return to colorno if so it did not take long to disillusion her at the first hint of such a wish the duke angrily suspicious half revealed himself understand your salad days are over and for ever henceforth you await here the completion of the contract which is to make you woman out of child all romantic follies of the past must be forgotten you renounced them in all faith and honour when you accepted his highnesss token from my hands she shrank back as if detected in her guilt and don philip continued i look to you not to force me into some very drastic measures to cut this trouble at its root think well of what i say for much concerning another welfare than yours depends on it he had found the way to silence her she could not misread the hint or blind herself to the understanding which lay behind it his life lay at the mercy of her conduct if she would preserve it she must assume a placid resignation seem to repudiate the very suggestion of any arrire pense in her proposal the shock was stunning but having surmounted it she bent herself with piteous eagerness to play the deceivers part her fear went on tiptoe she smiled and sang in the dukes presence so that it was pathetic to see her a thing to turn ones eyes from he may have approved the effort yet in truth she could not so suffer without betraying a sign to clinch the matter he decided to play in collusion with another his reserve card one day the infanta being present his highness began on some pre arranged provocation to banter la coque upon his former jealousy of a rival musician admit he sang divinely he said in truth monseigneur i saw but little divinity in the man o you would not chirruping with your nose to the ground thats as it may be i fear no test before an impartial judge what you would back yourself in a competition of voices aye and of improvisation this day this moment if you will let m tiretta be summoned and give us both a fair hearing coquin you dare the challenge knowing he is gone on my faith no sir i believed him at colorno whither is he vanished to the devil to vienna to anywhere for what i care so he remains to shock our sense of decorum no longer truth is the rascal claimed too many of the prerogatives of the troubadour free sport among the petticoats for one the scandal grew notorious there was a wench for instance but ware bully boy i tread on dangerous ground my ground sir how he threats us with his brow spare us good charlot i but quote the common report yet admit the fellow had an endearing way with him curse him la coque was half caught in the snare of his own setting he stood glowering sulkily while don philip with a little stealthy sidelong glance at his daughter turned with a snigger to some other of his suite a flush of colour to her cheek a just perceptible lift of the lip the duke was scarce intelligent enough to read the signs that they could think her capable of being trapped by such a shallow artifice her heart swelled in her breast over the base wrong to him the despicable meanness to herself o how fine and proud he appeared by contrast with these ignoble minds how remote from them in his living intensity his spiritual dignity she would not even condescend to defend him in thought against a slander so gross and obvious its effect was to confirm her tenfold in her faith she is pricked thought the duke we may leave the poison to work but the poison was not as he surmised it was shame not for the slandered but the slanderer that burnt in her veins her father that he could have debased himself to such methods all in a moment he seemed revealed to her for what he was a prince with a clowns heart a whited sepulchre behind the mask of elegance a soul like a shrivelled kernel without life or savour she turned from him in a very sickness of repulsion but that night as fanchette was preparing her for bed she rose suddenly from her chair and turning upon the maid clasped her convulsively by the arms tell me of him or i shall die she said the girl for the moment was completely taken aback she did not know what to answer and could only stare and gasp the feverish clutch closed more urgently upon her i have no friend but you in all the world fanchette have i not been kind to you o be kind to me and tell me you know very well you have always known i think forgive me if i pretended not to understand you i tried so long to fight against it and i could not and my heart is breaking startled unnerved as she was fanchette could not but be touched by that piteous appeal hush she said what do you want to know there sit upon this couch and speak low while i kneel to you so now tell me are you always thinking of him always always fanchette all the weary day and night why does he not send me one least little message it is said he is gone to vienna o cruel would you kill him with your rashness do you not know he is suspected fanchette my god tell him to keep away you must you can find means what is the good when by your every look and act you betray him i will not o i will not but to hear him so slandered and maligned it is hard to suffer and to smile do they slander him are you sure what do you mean o nothing she gave a little affected laugh she was beginning to consider her part only it does not do with us to idealise our fancies too much she failed for all her effort to meet the inquisition of the true grief stricken eyes fanchette o we know how gossip is to be discounted for myself at least i never took him seriously in what it is only natural to propitiate the maid if you would come at the mistress did he make love to you o that is too definite a term he said enough to put me on my guard against him that is all you need not have been so scrupulous he is ever courteous and considerate attentions that woman in her vanity is always too ready to accept as single to herself o i took his for what they were worth i was under no delusions as to their value she tossed her head there was a spot of anger on her cheek some venom in her tone i am sure i had no intention she said loftily to disabuse your mind about him no one could do that but himself answered isabella proudly though all the world slandered him i should not listen or believe she drooped her sad head knotting and unknotting her fingers i hoped i had a friend she said but i think i am quite alone fanchette sulked a little though with a certain bewildered contempt in her mind how was one to circumvent this loyal fool so obdurate in her loves faith if all evidence was so to be discredited by her what was the use of their conspiring to produce it and as she thought even with some grudging sympathy with a pertinacity which was after all characteristically feminine two soft arms came about her neck and two soft entreating eyes looked into hers fanchette in pity tell me what am i to do the girl sniffed and caught her breath if she had but little heart the emotionalism in her was always a responsive quantity she answered almost hysterically o what is the good of asking me he is gone i tell you some say summoned by the archduke to answer for his conduct perhaps he is dead by now she saw the roses quit the cheek and clutched at the slender form as it swayed backwards she was full of passionate remorse and alarm in a moment mistress dearest it was a lie look up listen to me i am a wicked heartless wretch he is not dead i know it i was told by one who knows it he has been to vienna and left again it is thought he has gone to the wars she wept and upbraided herself and fondled the scarce animate form calling upon it to speak to forgive her not to die and curse her to eternal despair and presently her urgency prevailed and a tinge of colour came back to the white face and the ghost of a voice reassured her without one word to me she took her in her arms and rocked her soothing and protesting in one they are all alike for that loin des yeux loin du coeur is it not there dont give way so it is wiser anyhow that he should disappear for the time being and like enough he sees it and sees clearer than you if hes all your fancy paints him hell come back again when the dust hes kicked up has settled and in the meantime she ventured to coax trusting to the impression she was making id try to forget him dear mistress an i were you if for no better reason than to prepare yourself against emergencies hes not strong enough to fight against a throne and if he hasnt realised that by this time a little reflection will be sure to convince him and then it isnt as if you were asked to make your choice between honey and gall his highness by all accounts is a very proper man tender but self willed as we women like and with all the advantage of youth on his side she submitted falling silent to the quick passionate rebuff which her words evoked isabella putting her aside rose to her feet and stood breathing spasmodically her hand crushed to her bosom there she said panting a little you have said enough i have been weak and foolish and i am ashamed forget everything i said fanchette and let me forget it i am very tired and i wish to sleep with a face of formal duty the maid rose from her knees and very stiff and punctilious completed her young mistresss night toilette not another word did she speak until presently the parting benediction which she uttered in a voice so cold that it might have been mistaken for an anathema and isabella once alone she crept and found her basil pot and sighed her loves orisons among its muffling leaves where still the envious flowers delayed to show and eased her sore heart in silent tears gone to the wars and without one word or sign to her perhaps to be slain and so to leave her for evermore bereaved and desolate o was it true was it did he want to die perhaps because his hope was already killed she had killed it it was her silence that had driven him to despair the anguish of that thought was exquisite he had trusted to her and she had failed him o for some poison in these gentle leaves to breathe and sleep and die upon her love she never once doubted his fidelity not once all those cruel calumnies had left her unshaken her pure heart was incapable of such treachery they might as well forbear to hurt a faith that was immortal in the midst of her agony a thought stole upon her like balm a report it was nothing more than that was it possible that he himself had given it currency in order to throw dust in their eyes that under cover of it he had returned to parma and was somewhere in hiding waiting till he could communicate with her there was life passionate exulting in that reaction to hope how could she ever have believed he would abandon her so after what had passed between them her lord her noble heart she was a poor trustless thing unworthy of his choice steadfastly she strove to keep that dear belief before her eyes and little as it was it was enough to steel her to endure the long long days of waiting for still they passed and passed without a sign drawing her hour by hour nearer to the fate she so unspeakably dreaded she did not ask herself by what miracle she was to escape her doom she felt only that to see him again to rest upon his heart were to solve all difficulties and so the year sped on to fanchette she betrayed no more of herself only her basil was her only friend and she would speak softly to it and with pretty wooings ask it to blossom soon very soon now lest its tardiness should prove their undoing it was odd and pitiful how she had come to regard this plant as the sure symbol of their destiny about the court those who knew and watched her privately believed her to be truly reconciled she was very quiet and gracious with all they took her sweet seriousness for first flower of the solemn election to which she was called as one fits oneself with gravity for the sacrament and yet she was guileful a most wilful and passionate rebel under her seeming repose since love had first taught her his outlawry only she had learned discretion of necessity she could play a part with her spies and lead them on to false conclusions because for her loves dear using alone she preserved the perfect treasure of her truth and loyalty what did anything else matter once or twice during this time she received a letter from her royal betrothed documents of the heart inevitably a little pompous but kind and manly there was no least allusion in them of course to a dismissed episode no condescending to a reference to so inconsiderable a spark in the orbit of the imperial system as a certain m tiretta had there been isabella might have cast them aside the formal pretence of reading once achieved with less impatience than she did and yet in honest truth they were more than she deserved and still the year like a celestial lamplighter ran down its golden ladder from the topmost heavens and as the sun dropped daily from its high estate and the earth grew slowly chill so into the girls heart stole ever more and more the killing frost of hope deferred all her first despair crept back and now with renewed terror that it must indeed be as fanchette had hinted and that he was gone to fight perhaps was even now lying stark and dead upon some battlefield or weeks long buried under the bloody sods for all her frantic longings and strained listening no reference to him in her fathers court had ever again since that shameful day reached her ears and there were already wedding rumours in the air then in the loneliness of her room she fell upon her knees and called miserably upon death if he had taken her love to take her too to save her from the unspeakable anguish of the fate with which she was now nearly threatened and death responded after his manner with those who impiously take his name he saved her as she prayed him to but inasmuch as her plea to him was conditional on a life with a life he answered early in december came the news that the duchess louise elizabeth had been seized with the smallpox at versailles and within a few days she was dead isabella had her desire the wedding was indefinitely postponed chapter xx the face in the crowd isabella had loved her mother truly if rather fearfully and in return had been loved by her with as condescending a devotion as a spirit so incessantly restless and ambitious as that of louis xvs eldest daughter could lavish on a child not born into the first order of creation how the indomitable sick woman had rejoiced in that early fulfilment of her hopes when the austrian ambassador had come to put an end to her doubts and apprehensions her communications to her husband show she was jubilant and so was impure old bien aim who wrote the most touching and beautiful letter to congratulate his son in law on the event a letter full of sentiments de les exprimer pourrait les diminuer and now before she might see brought to ripeness any one of the countless schemes she was perpetually revolving in her feverish brain for her familys aggrandisement she had herself dropped in a moment from the tree like a rotten medlar the shock of her death did more to bring poor isabel to her senses than the harshest tyranny could have done it seemed a very retribution on her for her sins and i doubt if it had been possible to marry her then offhand but she would have acquiesced in her fate with despairing perhaps but without further revolt the thought that during all this time while her mother had been sojourning for her healths sake at versailles she had been planning in her guilty soul an act which if committed would have struck the deadliest of blows at the pride and trusting affection possibly at the life itself of that beloved parent filled her with inexpressible remorse she went in these days with a face so pale and scared that one might have believed her haunted by the thought of her own direct responsibility for the tragedy the very memory of what had been seemed to her a profanation to the sainted dead she strove to cleanse her conscience of all offence even to the lingering shadow of a dream which now could never come to be realised she told herself so it was ended and finally how even if but one star from its firmament were allowed to twinkle on could she kneel and pray without blasphemy for the repose of her mothers soul to her father in this emotional reaction she wistfully and naturally turned their common sorrow brought them closer together than they had ever been as yet and while mothering his weakness and his distress she bitterly reproached herself for all that past unfilial attitude of hers towards what she had considered his shallowness and vanity now she recognised or believed that she recognised how much more fondly wise than its chosen expression had been the purpose underlying that attempt of his upon her faith she no longer blamed him for it because his method had been simply characteristic it had been characteristic indeed as was no less the selfish quality of his present grief he bewailed his loss almost as if it implied some treachery to himself having grown resigned in submission to the stronger will to which he had conceded the practical management of all his affairs of state and policy he felt as if cruelly abandoned by it at that moment in the promised maturation of its schemes when its support was most needed it was always his helplessness rather than his sorrow that came uppermost in the tale of woe and perhaps to the heart of the woman and potential mother that made the surest appeal in ministering to his despair isabella forgot her own and yet it is not to be inferred that don philip had been other than devoted in his way to the vigorous soul who through such long years had been his spirited coadjutor and support to do him justice he had purposed on the first warning note of tragedy to set out for versailles an intention for which the king his father in law when he came to hear of it had gently rebuked him and indeed the journey would have been in vain short shrift and shift was the order in all cases where that dreaded scourge proved mortal and scarce was the breath out of the august body before it was being hurried away by night to the royal mausoleum of saint denis where it was lowered with scant ceremony into the vault from which thirty years later the ghouls of the revolution were to tear it with fifty others to scatter its still impregnated dust to the winds it was from marly whither the court after its custom had already fled the terror that louis wrote his mild reproof ending it with the words mes yeux baignent de larmes so don philip frustrated in his dutiful design stayed on at home and regarded and pitied himself with something of the stupefaction of the dreamer who thinking himself standing among company discovers suddenly that he has forgotten to put on his clothes thus he felt as if delivered naked and aghast to a situation with which he was quite unable to cope he had leaned so long on that imperious will that he seemed to have lost his capacity for standing alone his prostration was even abject while it lasted but the true quality of grief is to be measured more by endurance than collapse those who succumb easily revive easily and it was not to be supposed but that that volatile brain would quickly rally from its depression under the stimulus of such local distractions as offered those were necessarily at first of a mortuary complexion touching such matters as the depth and period of the court mourning the fasts to be observed and the masses to be sung the opportunities presented by obsequies are only fully appreciated by two classes those standing at the opposite social extremes a funeral is the poor mans chance and the princes since each in his way borrows a relative distinction from the majesty of death in the one case it is a brief affair in the other a protracted but at the bottom of both there is the same sentiment of reflected glory whether it be a lying in state or a hearse with one poor coach to follow it is the corpse which ennobles the relatives and makes them greater than themselves by reason of their kinship with it now the widower awoke to the exciting potentialities of his position as chief mourner and to the realisation that a living ass might command more attention than a dead lioness as executor to the mighty departed it was his to rule and thereby to take the credit for the quality of the honours to be accorded her he extracted at least some revivifying comfort from the process some soothing flattery from the profuse condolences of his subjects when the dead was declared great and unforgettable and indeed whatever the personal trend of louise elizabeths ambition her forceful character had left its stamp upon her times he inhaled the incense as proffered to his own nostrils his vanity swallowed the innumerable eulogies monodies and elegiacs extolling the deceaseds virtues and waxing fat upon them like jeshurun kicked where then ended one passionate encomiast frugoni an abb o where then death is thy sting it is certain that if it lay rankling in that bereaved heart there was also much solace of honey to alleviate the pain it caused in short the duke only took means according to his lights to forget his trouble and what should we all do under like circumstances but so study to fight the brooding demon of morbidity did he find a wholesome diversion in discussing with la coque the details of a mourning coat the braided sorrow of its cuffs the sad expressive disposition of its buttons why grudge him that comfort simply because we ourselves could see none in it if a man can find solace for his grief in cats cradle by all means let him play with strings the two played with strings in another sense composing between them a touching threnody thick with the most harassing sobs and wails to which their own tears responded plentifully they enjoyed it all immensely in a sort of smug lugubrious way his highness looked double the man he had been after a week or twos enjoyment of these softly melancholy preoccupations to isabella standing wistful and sorrowful in the background the improvement in her fathers spirits brought with a greater ease on his account some vague feeling of distress she was glad to see him shed his despair for a healthier sentiment yet she could not but marvel over the choice of the means he could adopt and find sufficient for the medicining of a sick soul she tried to blind herself to the essential shallowness of the nature which could thus console its tragedy with sweetmeats she tried to make allowances to be steadfastly loyal to her own converted sense of duty yet the conscious truth in her would not be so hoodwinked or wholly justify to her the self sacrifice of which she had been so lavish still she would have remained faithful to its ideals if only he had continued to cling to her but as she felt herself her sympathy and loving support needed by him less and less even at last as he developed these other healing resources impatiently rejected a sense of such loneliness settled upon her as brought her own soul near the verge of despair she shrank back like one who has put out a confident hand to caress a dog and has been savagely torn for ones trust thenceforth she seemed to realise as she had never done yet the complete misery of her state she had thrown away the substance to grasp at the shadow and her reward was in the righteousness of utter desolation one day fanchette alluded before her with a disdainful lip to a poor little neglected herb which had stood long untended on its table in a sunless corner shall i throw it away your highness she said i think it is dead dead the word brought a shock of colour to the girls cheek which fled as quickly leaving it ashy white she seemed to have awakened in an instant as from a distressed dream to the reality of something left beside her when she fell asleep so a mother irresistibly overcome might startle to reconsciousness of her baby weakling and sit up aghast with panic ears strained for reassurance of the soft drawn breaths her baby theirs and dying or dead she looked with wide eyes glazed staring at the pretty piteous thing which her heart in its stupefaction had forgotten and then a rush of anger swept her coming from what source the power that made the feminine must answer why do you refer to it like that she said am i to submit for ever to your insults and innuendoes you should have made it your duty to water it without consulting me what has it done poor thing to be so cruelly treated please to attend to it at once and she walked haughtily away scornful of the storm she knew her reproof would evoke in that hysteric bosom careless of how her words might rankle and give forth poisonous humours but that night she dreamed that she awoke and saw her lover stand beside her and his face to her ghast eyes appeared all thinly laced with blood and in his hand he held a shrunk and withered plant dead he moaned o faithless and untrue look here dead dead and so wailing while she strove madly for speech he passed and faded seeming to melt away into the darkness and struggling she awoke in truth her cheeks all wet with tears and held out wild entreating arms no she whispered beloved no no not to take it with you not to kill me like that i will be true i will never sin to it or you again and so she lay sobbing a great fear and rapture at her heart then suddenly listening with panic pulses she rose and the cold moonbeams playing on her white breast and feet stole to a shadowy corner and gasped with joy to find it still was there and felt the soil to see that it was moist and let her tears drop on the shrunken leaves she remembered all this the next morning as something that strangely hovered between fact and fancy a half actual half dreaming ecstasy like a sleepwalkers but while she could not kill the impression of joy it had recreated in her she still strove to remain faithful to her resolution of duty to her mothers memory that was an impossible compromise of course but it sufficed the situation while matters owing to the mourning hung in abeyance on the nd of february following that fatal december a solemn requiem mass for the repose of the soul of madame louise elizabeth of france eldest daughter of the king infanta of spain and duchess of parma was sung at paris in the cathedral of notre dame there were present the dauphin and dauphiness mesdames adlade and victoire younger sisters of the deceased and a host of court notables the funeral oration was pronounced by the bishop of troyes who says the chronicler found nothing to say about the deceased except the usual banalities and who even pushed hyperbole so far as to eulogise don philip representing him as one adorned with every talent which makes for the first success with every quality which merits it unshirking the least labour which assures it that flattery when it reached the ears of its object may likely have stimulated him to an emulation and more than an emulation of the pomp and circumstance of the parisian service solennel anyhow to the public obsequies of the late duchess which were announced to be held in the church of the madonna della steccata at parma on the th march following all the ingenuity of symbol and device of which an upholstering brain was capable was brought into play with a result calculated to impress the most flippant with the dignity and majesty of death as interpreted by a master in the art of make up to quote somewhat loosely the words of the same chronicler the interior of the church a fine renaissance structure in the greek form dating from the early sixteenth century was hung with black cloth embellished with a mosaic of bones and tears six corinthian pillars fluted with silver had been erected at intervals round the nave medallions representing the virtues of the princess and ornamented with inscriptions and ermine lined draperies filled the intercolumniations of the arches both great and small the octagonal catafalque set in the midst bore the arms of madame on a field of tears and fleurs de lys below this rose a pyramid draped with black velvet having on its summit a crown veiled in crpe while around were grouped six white marble statues representing religion faith hope charity and two others that stood for death from the vaulted roof hung a great baldaquin ornamented with five sable plumes the presence of the court bishop the stately and melancholy intoning combined with the throb of the organ the wailing of the stringed instruments and the countless lights to give to the ceremony a majesty worthy of the infanta rather an abrupt pull up that as if the author in the midst of his declamation had been hit suddenly in the middle but enough has been described to illustrate the fertility of the brain responsible for the decorations on the day of the service the streets from an early hour were thronged with sombre clad citizens all hurrying to anticipate all others in the securing of the best places for viewing and hearing it was a cold clear morning and the soaring dome of the church surmounting its four shallow cupolas seemed to glitter very remote and quiet up in its blue vault more than all the glooming symbols in the depths below it spoke the free tranquil thought of immortality lovely and consoling and so it seemed to two sad unmothered eyes that caught a glimpse of it through the window of the state coach as that solemn vehicle approached the porch by now all business was suspended in the city a tithe of whose population was packed away within those close and throbbing walls while hundreds unable to gain a footing in the building crowded the piazza and all the approaches outside awaiting the arrival of the ducal party among these watchers was a young gentleman who had come riding in that morning from mantua thirty miles away he had left the old virgilian town at midnight being hard pressed for time and had entered parma to the clang of tolling bells many and monotonous the sound at first had knocked upon his heart with a strange foreboding and he had reined in with a thick catch at his throat what did this melancholy music portend and these sombre crowds all silent all intent all streaming in one direction his slackening steps pause at the gate does she wake or sleep the time is late does she sleep now or watch and wait she has watched she has waited long watching athwart the golden grate with a patient song a mad conceit an insane fear and yet he bent put a brief hoarse question to a passer by and learnt the truth her mother dead some months now as he knew he breathed out a little laugh of relief reckless self scornful and pushed on his way in so far at least the occasion was opportune he might see her and not be seen it was for that very purpose he had taken advantage of the sudden armistice to hurry from lusatia while the fighting he had been engaged in was suspended and speed these long leagues back to the lombard plains he had travelled day and night he was war worn and spent with weariness yet he would think his pains well recompensed by one glimpse of the loved face only for one moment to stay the insatiable hunger of his heart to acquire new nerve and resolution for the end that could not now be long delayed he desired he told himself to learn that she was reconciled and happy that the ruin with which he had threatened her young life was averted and then he would leave her once more this time never to return and so men will go out of their way to lie to themselves knowing that the truth stands steadfast to the good resolution which first inspired it he put up his horse and strolling out mingled with the people he was reckless of discovery as one must be who is reckless of his life he had timed his approach to the church so fortuitously that he could see over the heads of the mob the ducal cortge as it accompanied the carriages the nearness of her presence though penned as he was within that living wall he could distinguish nothing of it made his veins throb between rapture and agony and then he bent himself as the pressure of the crowd relaxed and it resigned itself to the long hour of waiting before the reappearance of the august mourners to edging a passage to some nearer coign of vantage where he might watch himself unobserved his cool persistence his military bearing and assurance perhaps gained him his purpose by degrees when within two or three of the foremost row under the shadow of a buttress he stopped and stood fast abiding the mad moment the swell of the organ came to him the sweet voices of the choir something seemed to rise in his heart half suffocating him and then a magnetic thrill ran through the crowd and he knew that he was to face the ordeal the ducal carriage already waited at the steps there came out first from the great portal a little group of her highnesss women and he saw that one of them was fanchette at that very moment a surge of the crowd drove him forward and almost from his feet so that to save himself he had to rush two or three of the steps and to pause an instant to recover his balance before re descending them in that second the girl looking round was aware of him and bending immediately as if to withdraw her skirts from his neighbourhood whispered at four oclock on the mezzo bridge the next moment hustled by the guards he was down again and near his former position but the slight disturbance had attracted the attention of a young lady just issuing from the church on her fathers arm one instant she turned her eyes and saw him the next with a little swerve momentary scarce perceptible she was going down the steps to the carriage chapter xxi across the bridge with the afternoon the town had resumed its normal aspect the shops were re opened the stream of grave and frivolous circulated with its wonted restlessness and volubility only the ashes of a lenten disposition seemed to have survived from the morning the human traffic going sad suited and with a mock attempt at seriousness in its demeanour still the sky was blue the little river sparkled and the harnesses of the mules would not stop tinkling for all the enforced sobriety of the occasion a veiled young lady coming from the direction of the palazzo della pilotta hesitated an instant before setting foot on the crowded thoroughfare of the ponte di mezzo and then made up her mind and went boldly forward half way across she just signed to a loiterer who stood leaning against the parapet whereupon detaching himself from his position the man accompanied her footsteps neither of them speaking a word making westward from the bridge which continued across the water the main artery of traffic that ancient via aemilia which exactly bisected the town they presently reached a less frequented quarter and coming after a time to the open spaces neighbouring on the barriera dazeglio the girl at length with a shrug of resignation slackened her pace and in the same moment invited her companion to speak to have selected for a meeting place she exclaimed the most populous spot in the city bah but i had no time to think what does it matter fanchette she stopped and looked at him with a little fretful stamp of her foot are you tired of life that you say so is my life in danger what do you suppose here in parma i do not trouble myself to suppose anything you are too courageous to think of yourself is it not that would be very fine if only sometimes you would think of other people he looked at her meekly without answering nor did she speak for a little but she had all the advantage of her veil in that mute inquisition you are altered she said presently you look older and graver than you used i am both he said well you have need to be serious also i do not think you even as moderately good looking as you were but you are bronzed which is something and you have a scar on your temple what have you been doing with yourself these eight months i have been helping to fight austrias enemies and have run away from them at last yes during a truce while they are trying to negotiate terms of peace you have come to the wrong place for peace you will soon find it so unless you study more discretion my god the shock it was to me this morning to see you back again amongst us what devil brought you and why having done wisely after all couldnt you let well alone i couldnt that is why for no reason i suppose but just that i am my own weak illogical self i wanted to make sure that i had done right to find out what if she were happy of course she is that is to say as happy as it is proper for her to be under the circumstances o yes it is quite consistent with your illogic is it not to give that sigh if i had told you she was miserable your face no doubt would have lighted up with a holy joy is the wedding day fixed it will be sure and soon enough when once we can cast our black this misfortune it is enough to make a saint blaspheme but for its happening it might likely have been fast bind by this time and then her felicity would have been her husbands affair and all would be gallants might forego their tender concern for her happiness god preserve us if she is happy and contented fanchette what makes you so angry over the postponement it aggravates me so to see you turn up again when we had all thought you comfortably laid ah ha now we are revealing who are the we you are like to find out soon enough unless you disappear as you came i can tell you monsieur you went none too soon in the first instance i was beginning to realise myself that i was getting unpopular and yet i was only too attentive to my task fanchette what do you want i want you to raise your veil certainly i shall not you are afraid that your eyes might betray what your lips conceal o indeed and what is that that she is not happy at all that she is miserable it is not true o fanchette is it not you professed to be my friend once am i not proving my friendship by meeting you like this by running a hundred risks to save you from the consequences of your own madness i am indifferent to all consequences so i may but see her well you have seen her you have disturbed again the waters that had settled down so peacefully and now i hope you are satisfied how can i say she saw me as i saw her but with what result do you not know never mind what i know that is as much as to confess that i have done harm in your opinion by coming harm my god i should think you have done harm he gave a little odd crowing laugh you cant help betraying the truth you see for all your efforts but what does it matter i have seen her face and it is enough fanchette he touched the scar on his temple do you note this it knocked me silly for the time being and while i lay insensible i think my spirit left my body and flew to her she was asleep i could not wake her and i turned to see how near the basil was to flowering o my god girl it was all shrunk and neglected and i thought i took it in my hand and turned to her with wild reproach but at that moment she opened her eyes and seeing the deathless sorrow in them the words died upon my lips and on the instant i awoke to find someone staunching my wound tell me does she keep the basil still she has not forgotten it fanchette like all fundamental worldlings was helplessly superstitious she stared and gasped behind her veil hearing of this ghostly coincidence how was she to dare henceforth shrinking conscious of her guilt under the detective eyes of the unseen she could only gulp and shake her head in answer he laughed again and you pretend to me that she is happy o monsieur said the girl inclining at last towards the refuge of hysteria if she is not have you any way to make her so no way at all that is possible that can conceivably end in anything but death to yourself and disaster to her if she had not learned to forget she had learned to be resigned and now you come to undo again the work of months it is cruel is it not fanchette a most damnable cruelty but you do not know the full measure of my baseness i promised the archduke himself that i would forbear would withdraw myself from the temptation would endeavour at the eleventh hour to vindicate my honour but death was in the bargain and if in my despair i have broken it it is the fault of death that would not come to me however much i sought and called him it is useless to threaten me with death o in heavens name walk on i shall betray myself confess at once she is not happy then there i confess it o you have driven her mad come on fanchette now listen to me and believe me i had truly meant no more when i came than to see her myself unsuspected to comfort my eyes and my conscience with the assurance of her happiness at least of her resignation and then to go as silently as i had appeared and what do i find a tragedy of unconquerable faith that in its every look and gesture stabs me to the heart now you must tell me all yes all all she accepted my supposed desertion how as you would have wished her to no doubt she still believed in me yes and in your truth even after she heard it reported you had gone to the wars god bless her o god bless her will you not go away again now monsieur fanchette are you not our friend dear fanchette it is madness i say i can do nothing i will not listen is she not happy since this morning you will tell me that at least you will ruin her ah you do not know what we know ruin is in separation only to meet to speak together once again why should i help you to what i feel is not only wrong but useless likely if i were to be found out i should be given to the death you so despise you need never be discovered tell me no more than where to come upon her then she can dismiss me or not as she wills i swear i will go if she bids me and if she does not it would be out of your hands only it is just that the decision at last should rest with her i feel that now as i have never felt it before mad fool that i am always to be so governed by impulse what right had i to judge for her to repudiate my trust to banish myself unbidden she gave me her first beautiful troth long before that other had made up his mind and it was for her not me to cancel the bond if she would and though i yielded to him i took no oath i made no promise i said only i would seek a solution of the impossible in death i was faithful to that and death refused the test he fled me while i sought him everywhere and then i knew there can be no solution of the impossible in death the destroyer but only in love the creator from love i must seek the final decision if it had been evident in her happiness i say i would have gone again as i came but now i will go no more until she bids me he ceased on a note of deep emotion but of inflexible resolve and for a space they walked on together in silence then presently the girl spoke in a cold restrained little voice whose tone might have been meant to convey anything between acquiescence and defiance you do me honour monsieur thus finally to throw off the mask before me to favour me for the first time with your full confidence if i notice an inconsistency here and there why it is only natural in a lover and what inconsistency fanchette your cruelty to her highness for instance which suddenly becomes consideration for her your bad faith to monseigneur the archduke which all in a moment becomes righteousness but it is all one for the moral which is your determination to have your way at any cost i have no more to say then only this i have warned you and you will not be warned therefore do not blame me for any consequences that may ensue for me i have my duty to my mistress and that is enough for you if you are resolved to rush upon your doom there is this piece of information which is in truth open to all her highness goes to morrow to colorno whither the duke her father will follow her in the course of a few days it is just possible in the interval before he comes that she may be tempted to visit aquavivas gardens of which she is so affole but i do not know au revoir monsieur i wish i could say adieu he would have detained her to protest to explain to pay a glowing tribute to her friendship and generosity but she would have none of it thank me when you are out of the wood she said for the moment if you value your own safety hide deeper in it that is my advice we may be watched and observed at this instant for all i know and peremptorily bidding him stay where he was she turned and hurried away chapter xxii anticipation it is a mistake to suppose that it is the manly qualities in a man which invariably appeal most to womens affections very often indeed it is their exact antitheses indecision dependence helplessness which excite in tender breasts the fondest response paradoxically every woman is a mother before she is a virgin else save in foretasting the guerdon of love could she never suffer the ordeal which is to qualify her for that reward she becomes a mother by right of the test to which she has submitted which is in truth the test of her capacity for cherishing the weakling for nourishing for protecting and for sympathising in all ways with its weakness wherefore as she is the instinctive nurse of frailty her affections turn more naturally to it than to the strength which is independent of her there are women of course who would always rather be coerced by a brutal husband than consulted by an irresolute one there are women also of the manly tailor made type to whom a sick dog or horse appeals with fifty times the force of an ailing child but i make bold to think that they are in the minority and that the mass of the sex is inclined to be attracted more by the weak than by the strong qualities in men for weakness may be lovable while strength is only admirable and a woman defrauded in her helpful instinct is a woman deprived of her essential meaning if i have made it appear that tiretta was a masterful character i have sketched his portrait awry and must revise it he was in truth in many ways an entirely weak creature impressionable emotional and lacking the first quality of decision one sees how he had been persuaded to dance attendance on fortune lingering on in her ante room in the vain hopes of that summons to her presence which a more resolute soul would have enforced one sees how inconsistent he could be to his own self sacrifices when their fruits seemed to him to be unjustifiably delayed he was full of passionate impulses and impotent remorses a man in courage a woman in regrets yet he had two qualities which were enough to redeem him utterly in all eyes that were truly feminine and those were charm and lovableness he was above all things lovable and by virtue of that disposition alone might easily have captured and absorbed into his own a more guileful heart than that of the simple affectionate child in whose soft bosom he had awakened the unconscious instincts of motherhood isabella startled to the knowledge of his reappearance with the mad rapture of a mother receiving back her long lost child now all would be well her fluttering unreasoning heart assured her now all would be well her illogical sex proclaimed she could think of nothing but that he had returned that the long long days of doubt and anguish were ended that the good reasons he had had for imposing them on her would be made lovingly clear all the sorrows the remorses the dutiful resolutions of the past drear months took wing in a moment like doleful crows for that no doubt her cruel disillusionment about her father was part to blame yet all said love without question would have had its way with her in the end she had not the power to resist so dear an importunate she was swayed in all things by affection and she had no one trustworthy weapon in her souls armoury to oppose to it he had come back to her because he needed her because they could not survive apart to realise that was to forget all else the danger once implied in her fathers half veiled threats fanchettes assurances that a certain one must sooner or later come to be convinced and resigned to the thought of his own impotence the terror she herself had had that she had been cast off by him because she had been found wanting in the crucial test if that had been so his masculine resolution had been no proof against his need of her and in proportion as he needed her his weakness was a thing for transport it is characteristic of the needs of lovers that they appear insensible to the fear of or the reasonable consideration for any obligations whatsoever outside their own very dimly the thought of her engagement shadowed isabellas mind it seemed like an illusion that change of circumstance had already half dissipated she had a vague feeling that were reference to the fact to be craftily avoided the fact itself would gradually be overlooked and forgotten she was like a punished child dismissed back to her play bearing with the infinite pathos of childhood no grudge against her unjust judges happy only to be forgiven and thought no more about while she revelled in the sunshine from which she had been so long debarred she was happy happy laughter frolicd in her eyes a bird sang in her breast she did not know how her crown of bliss was to realise itself only somehow he would find a way she was to see him hear him be loved by him once more all night her heart went dancing it danced on to the joy of the morning and awoke as if to a sense of wild reprieve she kept her secret to herself the secret of her knowledge of his return but its fumes were in her brain and she could not altogether hide the exhilaration they caused there fanchette attending to her highnesss toilette was in a curiously silent mood morose even and uncommunicative her mistress sought by every merry art to coax the girl into a response to her own bright spirits she laughed at and rallied her she overflowed with kindness she would not be denied for all the icy rebuffs she encountered but without much avail it seemed in truth the camriste perplexed and a little conscience haunted was in the last temper for welcoming such approaches she could have wished rather for affront impatience inconsiderateness anything that would have appeared to justify her in offence to provoke her to retaliation but this unassailable sweetness was so disarming that for the moment it confounded her in the afternoon she accompanied her mistress to colorno and there in the carriage urgency at last lent her desperation she stiffened herself and spoke you are glad to be returning mademoiselle o how glad fanchette to colorno with its unutterable memories to paradise regained to the gardens where the wild love flower grew which his lips and hers had kissed that she was bidden on her way thither seemed like a tacit surrender by authority to the inevitable it must have known what associations that restoration would awake all the journey hitherto she had lain back in a blissful trance listening to the ponderous rolling of the wheels as they gathered up the reluctant miles incessantly framing in her mind a picture of the reunion that was to be with its joys its tender reproaches its loving reassurances the past was to be resumed as if no black winter of separation had ever interposed and spring was coming spring with its wakening birds and the blossoms breaking in its orange groves smiling she looked at the faithful little basil pot by her side and secretly caressed its leaves now long recovered from the neglect to which she had once in her cruelty committed them she would have bent and kissed them but for fanchette the maid setting her lips resolutely did not answer for awhile then i am not she said suddenly isabella glanced at her a little surprised you do not like the country fanchette o as for that said the girl the value of a place to me is the value of its company well you will have plenty in a little while plenty and to spare said fanchette drily what do you mean child i foresee just one too many for my peace of mind that is all one what one cannot your highness guess yet i saw very well that i was not the only one of us two to make note of somebodys reappearance in parma yesterday isabella gave a little gasp but subterfuge was impossible to her only she sat silent and breathing quickly for a few moments well she said presently with difficulty what if you were not i do not see how your peace of mind is affected by m tirettas return hush i implore your highness said fanchette i would not betray the poor man whatever distress his persistence may cause me possibly your highness may have observed the recklessness of the act which brought us for that one instant together i shuddered i can tell you for his safety and it was all that he might whisper to me to meet him later on the mezzo bridge and you met him there was soft eagerness a restrained rapture but no least suspicion in the fervid tone fanchette shrugged her shoulders perceptibly what would you one in the last extremity must take a bull by the horns it is safer at least than to run away from him yes i met him mademoiselle she hardened herself to the passionate entreaty of the eyes of the lips that mutely questioned her he had in truth she said been to the wars and now taking advantage of a truce had come back like a roaring devil to renew his assault upon me to renew what o mademoiselle i would have spared you but you know you never would believe be assured nevertheless that i was not to be so harried from my honesty i entreated him to release me for once and for all from his importunities to abstain further from compromising me with one to whom my heart was given ah bah i might as well have appealed to a blood thirsty tiger and now i shall know what persecution to expect in this quiet place even as she ended her voice faltered as if in some instinctive misgiving and she hung her head and isabella incredulity amazement indignation in turn each emotion flashed its light across the beautiful face and quivered and passed to be succeeded by scorn scorn so sovereign so consuming that calumny shrivelling in its overriding flame died in an instant on those lying lips fanchette yes madame fanchette look at me the girl obeyed caught her breath with a start and lowered her lids look at me i say abject already in that revelation the maid half whimpering again essayed to lift her hang dog eyes and in the very struggle to brazen out her falsehood collapsed and burst into tears liar said isabella softly she was wrought beyond her gentle self the wanton wickedness of the slander never for one moment believed else by her incorruptible heart had transformed her from a hebe into a megaera are you not a liar fanchette weeping hysterically sought to gasp out an excuse if i misunderstood his meaning but lovely scorn swept the cowardly pretence aside you misunderstood nothing it is i who have misunderstood who have been blind all this time to the true character of the despicable creature i have trusted you vile thing so to hire yourself out to traduce a noble name who urged you to it in whose pay are you tell me for i will know she was translated the sweet tolerant soul stung to a passion the more deadly by reason of the sunshine and happiness from which she had been torn fanchette completely cowed sobbed and shivered in her corner she had never even guessed at the existence of these slumbering fires had never calculated on a faith so obstinate as to be utterly impervious to the assaults of jealousy she was overwhelmed terrified not only by the crushing nature of the retort upon her but by the particular insight which it revealed o o she gasped and cried i will tell you mademoiselle i will tell you everything if you will only give me a moment to recover you want time cried scorn to invent new lies but you need not hope to deceive me again i see it all at last the hints the cunning preparation of the ground the snare you thought to lay for unsuspecting feet and while i was confiding in you resting on your sympathy believing you my friend o shame upon such infamy i will have you whipped tortured unless you confess to me at once that it was all a lie fanchette fell upon her knees in the coach with a suppressed scream she knew enough to know that offended spain in so small a matter as the castigation of a servant could find easy means to have its threats fulfilled to the letter even in the face of obvious injustice it would be the question first and exoneration if any after she shook with terror i will confess she cried o i will confess it was a lie yes yes the infantas red lip curled who urged you to it tell me o mistress tell me i say fanchette choked and battled for breath writhing her fingers about her face was it your own mean jealousy of one too noble to stoop to an understanding of your designs upon him in that case again the camriste too debased in her terror for resentment cried out no no mistress listen to me it was one his highnesss own favourite he advised it he who fanchette writhed my fathers friend who i will know m la coque la coque that painted coxcomb amazed for all her scorn the girl sat a moment dumbfounded there was revealed here a knowledge a conspiracy she had never suspected fanchette frantic once she had betrayed her lover to exonerate him went on half coherently he he is devoted to your highnesss interests he he only wanted to save your highness the consequences of a fatal step it was our tr true regard for your highness that made us conspire to open your eyes to the real character of an adventurer to open my eyes by a wicked lie still she sat as if stupefied then leaned forward strangely quiet you have opened my eyes i think this gentleman is your paramour is he not fanchette was silent hanging her head come be bold girl said the infanta it is not your jealousy is it but the jealousy of that small and envious nature towards a nobility he can never reach that has bribed you to this baseness she leaned back passing a hand across her forehead as if suddenly overcome that such as you she said should dare to sit in judgment on your betters some note of weariness of shaken emotion may have struck upon the acute intuitions of the culprit she ceased crying and raising her head a little dared a breathless retort not in judgment but in sympathy mademoiselle since in imitating our betters we feel with them what is that you say no one should know better than your highness how love intoxicates our reason isabella gazed at the speaker with eyes in which the indignation was slowly giving place to distress yes she said low an intrigue is an intrigue said fanchette growing bolder as the other wavered if it is wrong we look to high example to make it shameful to us in the meantime one is powerless where one has given ones heart away no doubt the blame is less yours than his said isabella indistinctly ah said fanchette if your highness would only believe in the fondness of the intentions that actuated me but since they are misunderstood it is no good to dwell upon them only only what fanchette since our smallness and envy and painted coxcombry are not to your highnesss taste we had best retire and leave you to your own devices you will do what you will do and i have done in all disinterestedness what i could perhaps you will believe me that even while i was outraging my own feelings to try and safeguard your reputation i was providing alternatively for the step from which i foresaw you would not be easily dissuaded she spoke at last like an injured saint but the venom in her heart over that contumelious reference to her lover was rankling and growing in bitter intensity as she recovered more and more her confidence what step fanchette asked isabella faintly the girl shrugged her shoulders slightly into the dark that is all i can say except that i know where someone is most likely to be found within the next few days she knelt back sniffing and mopping her eyes while a silence of some minutes prevailed and then a sad little voice came to her who shall throw the first stone o fanchette we are all sinners together chapter xxiii in the silent woody places bissy had a lodger strictly bissy be it understood grandfather aquaviva had declined from the first to be mixed up in the affair or to do more than subordinate for the occasion his own domestic authority to that of the self sufficient imp who was wiser than an owl in his precocious generation to bissy was due the happy thought the conduct of the negotiations which followed and the ultimate agreement he accepted the guest and any responsibility attaching to him which nevertheless he did not anticipate would be serious report in that detached province of horticulture dealt mistily with reputations and bissy while having his own clues to the strangers identity had no reason to connect that with any definite scandal in any case where ignorance was cash it was folly to be wise let the lodger call himself what he would il signor tal or by any other mocking pseudonym the essential consideration was the ducats of which he was not sparing for the first time in his life bissy enjoyed the gratification of realising handsomely on his own native shrewdness grandfather always preoccupied and unsuspecting was content to laugh to shrug his shoulders and secretly to admire the elfish self importance which had so much worldly foresight in it he had the same clues to identification as the limb himself but they lay unnoticed by him men and women always passed him by like shadows they were only to be regarded as coming between the sun and his flower beds and the sooner they were gone the better for his content as for the guest himself he had flown upon them by his own account from distant battle fields arriving errantly in their midst in a moment like a fragment of spent shell it was the happiest of accidents he declared which had deposited him where he fell repose after that long flight being the thing of all things which he most needed together with the opportunity for restful self communion apart from his fellows he said this to bissy whom he first of all encountered at work in the orange grove it seemed some instinct had drawn him there though of course he was ignorant of the geography of the place his assurance was astounding petrifying but quite captivatingly compelling what sweeter spot he declared could have offered for his purpose than these fragrant ambushes wherein one might bury and repose oneself as in the dreaming thickets of avalon was it possible that providence could have knowingly directed his footsteps to this haven of rare comfort where he might hide himself away deliciously unsuspected and undisturbed in that case of a guiding will it was conceivable that search might reveal some adjacent bower ready to welcome the wanderer into its hospitable arms did the boy know of any such he would be willing to pay handsomely for the boon of a temporary lodging however primitive however homely which neighboured on these perfumed solitudes bissy gulping down his wonder in a toad like obstupefaction suddenly pricked up his ears at that there was promise here of a golden salve for the tweaking they had once received only it seemed discretion was to be the order he betrayed therefore no sign of recognition but then and there he had his inspiration and acted upon it there was only their own little house he said on the southern limit of the gardens if the signor fancied he could accommodate himself to such simple quarters he would go and ask his grandfather if he would be willing to take him in for a time and he was careful to add for such a tempting consideration as the signor had suggested the signor was greatly obliged and greatly amused despatch my fine lad he said i am not going to haggle over the inestimable value of peace and privacy to a war sick spirit and so it came that il signor tal imposed himself charmingly on the oddly contrasted couple only always it was understood as bissys guest aquaviva for his part affected an entire detachment in the matter as though he himself were an independent visitor in his own house but for all his somewhat caustic reserve he too was not long in falling under the irresistible spell of the strangers personality the house a mere plastered and whitewashed cottage stood at the extremity of the grounds on the parma side aquaviva it seemed believed in that ideal condition of happiness a lodge in the wilderness the gardens were the life the living place but an insignificant if necessary adjunct to the life so nature teaches us the right proportions of things the nest on the rock the form in the grass the hollow in the tree trunk what are these but trifling accessories to possessions which embrace the infinite seas the open hills the rolling forests it is the fit way to regard the values of existence i am sure in these days an old railway carriage and five acres of garden should it sometimes seems to me suffice a man for his true proportionate needs the house then was small and it was moreover inconvenient and none too clean it was after all only the principal feature in a tiny steading which included sheds a miniature fowl run and a dove cote an indian fig tree grew untrimmed against its wall the flags of its yard were broken and moss grown a stave of its water butt was broken and so on but it was enough for its purpose which was to serve as a simple shelter from the elements a dining and a sleeping place and now in its enlarged scope as a retreat and belvedere at dinner time the pigeons would fly down from their cote and entering the house by its open door strut with bobbing heads about the stone paved floor watching for scraps they soon came to recognise in il signor tal a sympathetic spirit and to congregate about his chair with a persistent confidence which delighted him in other respects he found in his quarters a seasonableness which glorified all shortcomings his humble bed smelt of rosemary the sparkle of insect life in his ewer testified to the living freshness of the stream from which it was daily replenished appetite lent to the homely cuisine an epicurean relish raw ham salted sausage macaroni thin broth followed by the lesso or anmic meat boiled down to produce it sometimes a cut of manzo which was hobbledehoy calf cabbage served alone and always ricotta a sort of buttermilk cheese on such country fare he was enthusiastic to batten and his enjoyment of all things was as convincing as it was captivating he had not been established two days before everyone was in love with him annina the deaf old contadina who did the marketing and general housekeeping solemn bissy whose particular property he was even aquaviva himself whom his charm and virile interest in all things won from reticence to an astonishing horticultural communicativeness they all succumbed to him and became his unconscious confederates and abettors jealously guarding the privacy it was understood he desired jealously possessing him and shutting the world from their knowledge not that in that respect there was much need for finesse the season was yet early the spot isolated the gardens not sufficiently advanced to attract visitors yet it had been a mild winter and crops for the time of year were well forward everything was flushing green not with the chill reluctance of a northern spring but with a fearless confidence in the loving kindness of a climate which was always a true bountiful mother to its nurslings here but to peep was to open and expand and the growth of a day was the full measure of its trust in nature it was seldom that that trust was abused by cold winds or belated blizzards but even when this happened the sun was quick and sure to staunch all wounds inflicted and to win back the earth to smiles and reassurance so tiretta came actually to inhabit the beautiful haunted place so associated with his first enchantment it was no fortuitous choice of course which had led him there laden for all his baggage with one soldierly valise yet he had hardly hoped at the first to realise so easily and so compactly his scheme of opportunism now if she came he would be always on the spot to greet her in what way circumstance must decide his life his whole happiness was bound up in that chance but would she come he had only fanchettes hint to go upon it might have been wholly unwarranted it might have been actually designed to confine him to a given place whereby the risk of meeting him elsewhere should be avoided the thought necessarily suggested another was she actively or negatively in collusion with her maid to procure such a fiasco he had again only fanchettes admission for comfort but fanchette was a liar he knew that instinctively still the girl had obviously sought to get rid of him and the truth had been drawn from her only with reluctance she would not have conceded even so much unless the pressure of facts had been too strong for her to resist on the other hand she might have suggested the compromise entirely on her own responsibility and with the intent having definitely disposed of him to keep the knowledge of his whereabouts a secret from her mistress that would be a stultifying development in the lack of any yet what could he do now to counter such a design if it existed he understood that for some reason fanchette always a capricious quantity had joined the forces against him at the instigation of what or whom or by the tacit acquiescence of whom not of her his whole soul his whole knowledge rejected the thought of such shallowness such treachery on the part of one proved so incorruptible they were inseparable affinities bound by that subconscious compact whose roots were in the mystery of the past and then if confirmation were needed his pathetic dream this man of dreams indeed trusted their evidence beyond the most convincing that could be offered by any living witness he had seen his loves eyes once in that trance once on the steps of the madonna della steccata and had read therein a message of deathless fidelity it was enough he could not be mistaken he would not wrong her or himself again by the shadow of one suspicion and yet watching the passage of the fruitless hours he would sometimes grow despondent or angry with his own irresolution or with the easy way in which he lent himself to the designs of his enemies would she ever come then he would stand listening as if he heard in the deep places of his heart the voice of his love crying to him to hasten and deliver her from the hostile forces by which she was watched and environed that was the worst of all for what was he to do how escape from the mesh of uncertainty in which he had involved himself to break from it now were to betray himself and her to invite the very tragedy he had come here to avoid not to avoid for his own sake for he was reckless but he must be wonderfully tender and considerate in all things which touched upon her wellbeing for himself he held his life lightly lacking the reassurance which alone could give it a purpose and a value he did not seem to care much what happened to him what precautions he took were really nominal that bissy should know him was of course inevitable yet there seemed no object in confessing himself to the boy no object in anything in particular indeed it was that very indifference which was his unconscious safeguard where there is no atmosphere of concealment nobody suspects he was accepted generally on his own showing and specifically on his own merits those were characteristic and sufficient his mental suspense his perpetual soul hunger never seemed to affect his winning attitude towards his surroundings outwardly he appeared that lovable interested oddly humorous creature who endearing himself without effort or design to all about him seemed troubled by no sense of responsibility towards anybody or anything in the world he could not help himself there the faculty of ingratiation was native to him and quite unforced but it is wrong to judge such qualities as necessarily superficial popularly the sparkling surface speaks the shallow current it is as true as to insist that beauty is only skin deep there are many of these old saws that need re casting is there no deep thinker who has his playful side it was sage harcourt was it not whose half awakened bards so offended the poet as to exteriority one might say with as true a proverbial sententiousness that the pint bottle of champagne is not to be told from the magnum by its effervescence the fact is that manner is no indication of matter and that some men can jest under torture while others cannot it is just a question of constitution think of keats confined in quarantine on his death journey desperately summoning up more puns in a week than he had ever been guilty of in a year so as il signor tal loitered in the wakening gardens asking innumerable questions making innumerable impracticable suggestions delightedly absorbed to all appearance in floricultural lore no one might have guessed from those rising bubbles the darkness of the tragic deeps from which they ascended these to be sure with whom he lived were simple country folk unsophisticated save in the one direction of their business and little apt at reading character they were quite ready to accept him for what he palpably was a charming and profitable addition to their mnage without puzzling their brains as to what he might be parma was almost terra incognita to them it was ten miles away it might have been a hundred for any influence it bore upon their lives the pulse beats of it came to them like a sound of bells so distant as to seem no more than a pleasing rumour they were indifferently interested in its events hardly more so in its personalities once or twice the dead duchess was mentioned among them but chiefly it seemed because she was associated with their local experience tiretta gathered that her memory was respected though with some reserve due to the not yet forgotten resentment against the spanish occupation but with isabella it was different they all loved the young infanta so sweet so natural so prettily friendly the visitor cunning man found no difficulty in drawing them on that subject though for net result he learned no more of her than he knew already they were quite uninformed as to the general march of events knew nothing about the proposed austrian alliance were as unworldly disposed as though to their minds it was all wilderness outside this their garden of eden he could have found their pastoral navet wonderfully refreshing had the ferment in his mind been more amenable to such soothing influences as it was he could at least endure it good humouredly one day it was the third after his arrival he came upon aquaviva busily employed over a number of little shrubs which he had just fetched out from their winter shelter the sight brought a shock of colour to the visitors cheek a rather wistful smile to his lips what memory was here laid bare and bleeding it was like the disinterment of still breathing hope for some moments he watched the old man in silence it was whimsically wonderful to him that the handling of these things should awaken no associations in that abstracted mind yet so it seemed not once had aquaviva appeared nor did he appear now to connect him with any figure of the past presently tiretta spoke what are those mi amico he waited intent on the unsuspicious answer they are basil thyme signore little boudoir delicacies which we cultivate for their scent they will be very popular with the ladies when they flower when will they flower aquaviva hunched his shoulders who can say it may be this year or the next they are capricious and fastidious but fat feeders when they like sometimes they like and sometimes they do not these have all had their christening how do you mean their christening aquaviva leered round with puckered lids as he stooped blood signore good bullocks blood they thrive on it will they not flower without they will flower but it is all the difference between the weed and the exotic so it is with human folks we talk of blood in a man it signifies nothing but generations of meat eating as against the minestra the cabbage soup which the many the nameless have had to be content with for the replenishing of their veins i see it is the lord of many joints who is the lord of creation and yet there is a virtue in blood it can produce superior beauty as well as superior men wherefore the basil signore whose appetite like the human grows fiercer with what it feeds on till nothing but the blood of men will appease it come aquaviva so it is said signore of murdered men is that what your aristocrats here are delaying for o they are young their tastes are not formed but i daresay a dose of it would facilitate their blossoming tiretta watched a little longer in silence then turned and strolled away it had been on his lips humorously to repeat a former challenge to see if even that would succeed in evoking a response from a suddenly stimulated memory but something had prevented him at the last a quick springing emotion which urged him into search of solitude for its indulgence inevitably his steps led him towards the orange grove they were never long from wandering in that direction and not only because of the magical associations of the place elsewhere the gardens were but lately rising and expanding from their sober winter levels and they afforded as yet but little cover for a would be solitary spirit but for a green thought in a green shade there was always the hushed welcome of this deep windless sanctuary and it was therein that he looked to find a solution of the perplexities that beset his present condition he knew very well what form that expectancy conjured up it could not be but one in a spot so haunted here if anywhere he felt the end would be decided the place was luminous now with young vivid gold and emerald no sound broke its silences save the running footsteps of the little river beyond whose unseen glitter seemed actually vocal splintering the misty limits of the grove as with spars and points of iridescent laughter tiretta entering but a little way into that enchanted solitude stopped abruptly and gave rein to the thought he had brought in with him could it be that death waited on their reunion he had only jested at the superstition on a former occasion somehow now he did not feel inclined to jest at it this pretty basil thing which they had elected and consecrated for the symbol of their happiness its flowering was to be the sign and when was it to flower not yet nor remotely if it was to be judged by these others not even so soon as they if aquaviva had prophesied aright and yet they had reached a crisis whose solution it seemed must be a matter of days of moments the duke if not arrived at colorno already was hourly expected why did she not come and at that very instant aware of a stealthy step behind him he turned and saw bissy there was something in the boys face a suppressed emotion a sort of furtive excitement which startled and arrested him at once bissy carried a basket and a spud with the latter of which having deposited the former at a tree foot he began to prod in an aimless way about the roots obviously to give colour to some supposed business conscious of an odd unsteadiness in his feet as if they had lost the sensation of contact with the ground tiretta approached the worker and stood looking down what is that for bissy he said to let in light and air the boy did not answer for a moment then suddenly ceased digging and stood up leaning on his spud like a perspiring goblin once or twice he gulped and at last brought up resolution to let in light and air the signor has said it he answered tiretta studied him a strange smile on his lips there is some mystery here he said low what is it bissy it is of your own making signore it has never been of mine if you wish me still to respect it i shall do so in all dutifulness understanding that there is no reason in the world why il signor tal should be interested in the arrival this moment of someone in the gardens of someone of whom bissy his voice did not seem to himself to belong to him of the owner of a little shoe i once pulled out of the mud signore bissy he was as pale as death he stood as if suddenly stricken mute the boy all honour to his elfin intelligence showed his instant appreciation of the situation he did not consider right or wrong it was enough that these two his dearest patrons wished to meet for whatever reason was their own business go through the grove signore he whispered to the little sward by the river i will fetch her to come and look at my oranges she has that cagna fanchette with her as sour and sullen as a duchess but she shall not spy i will see to that go signore and tiretta obeyed a mere pawn at last in the game of this conquering strategist he put his hand one moment on the squat shoulder then turned and passed to his destiny ecstasy filled the air the voice of the little river rose jubilant to greet him he paused at last on that embowered isthmus amid the inviolable trees minutes passed his heart was beating to suffocation and then a quick light footfall a quick febrile whisper bonbec chapter xxiv rapture it is only for one hurried moment i dare not stop o my heart beats so he held her hands he gazed as if he could never fill the hunger of his soul for a minute he failed to speak in all his passionate dreams he had never pictured her as returning to him like this black clad like an angel of death the contrast between her lily complexion and the deep sadness of her robe was even startling in his first glowing stupefaction an odd thought hung like a mote in his mind like a travelling speck under closed lids it was a perplexed association of this mourning with something he had just been thinking about with something with what dead men and green things that blossomed what was it he expanded his chest over the idleness of the fancy easing it away in a great rapturous sigh and then it came to him the dead mother and he had been thinking only of dead love he drew her towards him without a word and she made no resistance she lifted her face to his as he bent and conceded to him all that he wished now he said deeply it is all as if it had never been these dark disastrous months shut your eyes my souls beloved and listen hark that was a bat that flew past and do you hear the whispering wash of the moonlight against the trees and the tiny crackle of the stars what is all this talk about a parting to us who have never moved from this balcony where to night we put an everlasting seal upon our love have we been dreaming while we clung together though it were a dream isabel tell me i was not forgotten in it they slandered you dear love do you think i believed them no more lady than i believed that you were happy in my banishment in a passion of emotion she clung about his neck laying her soft cheek to his bronzed one let all the lies and the slanders go she whispered they are not worth one thought from us o cancel them with these cruel months we have never left the balcony we have never been parted there is no explanation needed from either of us to the other not one isabel it was a dream we have awakened from it to find the truth yes awakened cling close my soul and whisper does the thought of to morrow still terrify you how can i help it o my love my love will you come with me now away from all the stress and sorrow into the wild white places where we can hide and be forgotten bonbec not now it is impossible to morrow then i will have horses ready i i must not stay my gouvernante is waiting for me in the road to night yes to night isabel after the gates are shut come to the little wicket in the eastern wall my maid will let you in fanchette ah yes you know her enough to mistrust her but if she is our friend she is always her own best friend i think but she will be there and i you know the way he held her apart questioning with impassioned eagerness the face which drooped a little from his its lids half closed its cheeks just tinged with flame then bending put his lips to the soft white rapture of the throat isabel the little balcony above the myrtles it is secret there i must go i dare not stop to say more bonbec let me go we can talk there alone and decide what is best to be done but not now lingeringly reluctantly he let her slip from his arms she put a finger to her lips stay here she whispered with a radiant smile and then once more she approached him as if irresistibly and looked with wistful ecstasy into his face how thin and worn you are dear love she said pitifully and yet how can i wish you to have grieved less once more moved beyond endurance he caught her to his heart and shamed the rosy colour to her lips and neck until gently upbraiding him she broke away until to night soul of my soul he said the faithful bissy was waiting for her in the grove she kept him blithely chatting a little while and then hoping the best for her face went on to rejoin her maid fanchette acknowledged her reappearance as tart as crabs im sure i wish she said that i could find in those trees the delight your highness seems to borrow from them your highness looks quite another person since making the little excursion and in what after all had their enemies succeeded against these lovers surely was never such an impregnable perversity as their faith chapter xxv delirium the balcony whence our juliet leaned to whisper to her romeo do you recall how it was mentioned earlier with wondering if in these days lunatics still came there to gibber to the moon i say still for if passion is the reverse of reason then is not love a sort of madness and were not these two demented things to think that in a chief province of despotism love would be allowed to override all distinctions of rank and fortune or did they really think so or think that disgrace and ostracism were the worst alternatives they had to face what does it matter what they thought or failed to think their need was not in thinking the fire of immortality is in the transcendent passions which take no thought and of their seed is born all that beauty which redeems the ignoble materialism of the world at night all the eastern side of the palace where it faced upon the sunk gardens was veiled in deep shadow only in one place above a secluded myrtle grown terrace a faintly luminous oblong showed where secret wakefulness kept still its vigil in a lighted room the hangings in the window parted revealing momentarily a running shaft of gold and a man stepped forth paused an instant on the balcony then climbed its stone parapet and dropped to the turf beneath even as he alighted another form that of a slim enamoured sweet fleshed girl appeared catching light draperies about its neck and bosom in the opening and letting the curtains fall to behind it stood ghostly pale in the darkness leaning down o love you are not hurt he laughed low and musical as she leaned he could reach even up to her shoulders with his hands only in my vanity o why that i should have outstayed my welcome sweet not your welcome but my terror then if ive outstayed it your terrors gone alas no this night has made it tenfold it increases with every minute that you linger why isabel whats to fear all the worlds asleep is there nothing to fear indeed nothing on my soul will you not go dear love not while you ask me see how your voice holds me in its silken leash i will not speak then so i shall know you weary of me well i will go no stay a little i cannot spare you to the dark there is something fearful in it the trees look as if they were watching us everything seems as if it draws near it was one of those crystal clear nights which give the impression as of an unnaturally close approach of all objects earthly and celestial there was no moon but every star was like a sharp splint of light cut upon a background of purple glass austere immense the inky masses of the ilexes seemed in their apparent contiguity as if their very shadows had taken root filling the vacant spaces of the lawn between with menacing growth a night when all things seemed to stop and listen as in the deep midmost of sleep when breathing almost ceases and the soul hangs at the neutral poise between life and death even the stars he said and most that beautiful bright one that stoops to guide us on our way look to the north faint heart she caught his two wandering hands in hers and imprisoning them brushed them with kisses as soft as flowers home she whispered where the strange thing is where we can love and be good o sweet i would you could sing to me shall i sing it is not the time of nightingales no i dare not let you as well perhaps i have been out of tune of late ah me were you so sick at heart have i not told you tell it me all again a thousand times and a thousand times my tears shall drop like hot rain upon that winter until not a speck of frost is left to upbraid me it is already melted in your arms o love am i not a villain if you are i love a villain isabel my dear lord think always well of that other i obey my lord he is a noble heart princely magnanimous he deserves you more than i well he has his deserts to keep him his claim was open palpable mine only visionary i will think well of him when i think of him look when you turn that way the stars make little babies in your eyes isabel if it were not i i think i could say make him happy what do you mean if it were not you o god what have i done to forfeit my love to forfeit child have i been too forward too complying cheapening in myself the thing you held so dear will you give me to him as one having too easily betrayed her easy nature i am not like that not fickle indeed indeed i am not i will be cold forbidding if it please you more maidenly chary of my favours no smiles no kisses ah no i cannot it is too late in pity do not despise and cast me off you very woman come bend lower give me your lips i say how can i help it when you bid me my gentle slave what reprisals your fond loveliness does invite i could almost wound you just to taste that lust of dear submission and yet i did not mean to wound you girl but only to say were i to die atone as best you can as best i can then shall i promise to marry him promise what you like ah now i hear you set your teeth as if clinched on some secret pain and i am happy once more if you were to die did you say yes my own love look you cannot forbear the truth give him the empty husk you mean so long as the sweet kernel remains your own you called me your own love are you not by every fibre of my soul that clings to yours how could i live then if you were dead make room i must come up to you again no no you shall not i am content at last in everything but your safety hush o hush what was that noise i heard none where is fanchette she is waiting within to take you to the gate stop while i fetch her not yet let me listen at your heart child how it beats it is your own caged bird it beats to get at you come into my hand dear bird and lie warm and rest there is a long flight waits you on the morrow o i die to think of it what of fear or rapture of rapture that is fear listen bonbec it is midnight striking the hour of sweet augury you will not fail me will you by a minute here at the window i will put the clock forward if we can reach the mountains and thence make by way of zurich across the german border and so northward to the wild green gardens o heaven speed us never doubt it will think of my mascot what mascot that to which i owe my immortality cinderellas slipper two arms came lovingly about his neck and the tiniest cooing laugh was smothered there what tickles you you rogue i do not know it was either that or crying and the laugh came first shall we not exchange talismans my lord will you give me your jack boot to keep so you will wear it in your bosom in very truth isabel i should have died but for it i believe i am sure yet it did not save you this very pitifully her fingers fluttered over the scar on his temple ah love she sighed how could you leave me so for a minute she held him close with little murmurs like a dove then looked up fearfully the trees draw nearer is it not deadly still indeed you must be going well he said shall we begin to speak good bye o no the briefest parting must it not be so tis for you to say i say it then bonbec good bye lady one moment there was something one last thing i had to say what was it it has slipped my mind consider on it while i hold you it will come in a minute or ten or twenty no you must go how prettily your hair grows from your forehead was that it wait it is always on the tip of my tongue yet it will not come the basil flower perchance no but let that serve was it not a strange dream of ours not strange that i should come to you in dreams it had been my practice had you known shall i come again to night sweetheart do you call the basil by the name i told you yes bonbec a tiny whisper faith ill whisper back isabel well make the pretty darling flower between us yet so they lingered out their parting postponing and always postponing the dread moment that was to separate them to what issue by ways of bliss and pain they had reached this supreme crisis whence if they would the blind ecstatic plunge now aware in truth that he must delay his going no longer the man closed fast his arms about their enamoured burden and spoke his last words very low and impassioned isabel before i go there is a thing to say it is as a woman do you realise it that you lie here i would be anything so to lie here for ever so to lie and dream but dreams must wake to reality when childhood ends as with the dropping of the flower comes the fruit are you prepared for what for whats to come tell me what is to come god knows only for what it cannot be think of all you must forego name honour luxury an empire i thought them all shadows are they the realities think before you decide the whole world against a sentiment is it only that indeed to you ah to me but i lose nothing and gain all an empty gain when i shall have lost my all it is the gain of the deathless child what is the value of the mortal residue to that so after all you think i cannot love like you o i would prove my love no more than that even to this last renunciation do you fear then i say it is not too late yet to draw back she gave a little gasp and would have withdrawn from him but he caught at her hands and held them fast isabel o she said despairingly after all that has been between us listen to me it is only to free you if you will so that free you can choose how can you hurt me so when you say you love me i would not be so cruel to my love o child child cannot you understand she gazed at him a moment with impassioned eyes then let herself slip once more into his arms i cannot lose you bonbec no not for all the world now he said deeply the last is said and we are one and inseparable to eternity yes to eternity that i could have doubted you o my soul forgive me presently she stirred and the starlight shining on her wet lashes yielded herself to one last long kiss then gently put him from her good bye beloved o good bye good bye it is like death to leave you isabel then do not go come back here into my room only till the day breaks there is something fearful in the night i feel as if once we were parted it will never give you to me again he laughed whispering away her terrors the dark is my true friend how but for it could i creep back into hiding the long long way o go warily for fear of hateful things be comforted i hold my life too dear send fanchette to the little door remember at midnight the horses will be waiting bonbec yes dearest call me your slave my gentle pretty slave good night kiss the basil for us both o yes yes chapter xxvi within the presbytery the northernmost of the five gates of parma discharged direct upon the highway that led to colorno at intervals from this embouchure came shooting as it were the disjecta membra of a disrupted state bodies of high functionaries coach loads of subsidiary officials staffs civil and military clerks grooms secretaries mounted perched in dancing carrioles or drawn heavily behind teams of ponderous flanders mares these and their like appeared issuing intermittingly all day from the open culvert whence they rolled leisurely on their way towards that crystal oasis in the plains ten miles distant the duke in short was changing house and this anticipatory exodus which looked like the decimation of his capital represented no more after all than the adequate personnel of a great lord retiring upon a favoured sylvan retreat so do our needs enlarge with our state until so far as self help goes we reach the condition of the paralytic to don philip a fifth and sixth valet de chambre would have appeared more indispensable than a single knife and boot boy might appear to us at colorno itself connected with the city by this scattered procession of men and vehicles the business of preparation was being pushed forward as assiduously as though the duke were visiting his summer residence for the first time everyone was in a state of agitation and either tetchy or nervous or both cook lackey chambermaid and the rest they seemed all overtaken as those roused ones in the sleeping palace might have been by a vague sense of guilt and a feverish desire to make up by haste for something unaccountably lost was it a minute or a hundred years a general air of rush and panic pervaded the place extending itself from garret to basement and affecting the marquise in her salon no less than the little mop squeezer whitening the boards in her attic they felt the change in their blood like the first irritating processes of a tonic drug madame herself was as obstreperous and intolerable as in their excitement she found her young charges she waxed shrilly voluble over the information that isabella was confined to her rooms with a headache it was monstrous unnatural she cried thus to shut herself away in the face of this imminent arrival to dissociate herself from the atmosphere of general rejoicing that prevailed her relations with the infanta had long been strained she was never so gratified as when she could cite evidence of unnaturalness against this natural soul it is always for such as she to suspect hypocrisy in what is purely genuine like mistress like nan amongst those rendered especially captious by the coming event was to be numbered it seemed mademoiselle becquet fanchette bristled with spines it was dangerous to touch her almost to approach propitiation only appeared to feed her choler as oil fire she screamed at her inferiors was insolent and defiant towards authority defending her mistress against the charge of undutifulness with a fury which ended by actually routing that formidable autocrat the utterer of the slander she was in that state it appeared to which we are all whether fanchettes or otherwise occasionally subject when our whole nervous system seems transferred like hartley coleridges fantastic skeleton to the outside of us for every breath however softly sympathetic to gall now a tempest of voice and whisking petticoats now a white rush of tears into solitudes which gave no relief she was eternally on the move and eternally inviting retort for the sake of retaliating on it tooth and claw she left her mark indeed on one overconfident gallant who derisively offered to confess and absolve her for the nominal penance of a kiss her nails ploughed a furrow in his cheek which it would take a month to obliterate as he stood cursing and ruefully laughing the sight of the running blood appeared for the first time to sober her she stood gazing at it fascinated then suddenly putting her hands to her face turned and ran whither she disappeared none cared to know or enquire it was comfort enough that the wildcat had retreated for the time being to its fastnesses she did not issue from them again until late in the afternoon and then only upon receipt of a private communication from a correspondent which was put into her hand by an emissary sent to seek her for the purpose she was in the infantas rooms but not with her mistress when the message that someone awaited her without on particular business reached her the shrinking page who delivered it could not but observe how her cheeks blenched at the word he could not but marvel moreover after recent storms at the apparent tranquillity with which she accepted it she asked him with an affectation of carelessness where the messenger was to be found and learning that it was at that door into the corridor where she had once before encountered tiretta dismissed him with a smile and a pretty vifs remerciments that made his heart throb then when he was well gone she rose a little unsteadily a wave of blood seemed to sweep through her brain making her momentarily giddy she put out a hand to a chair back and stood supporting herself it had come but only what she had expected looked for she was desperately pledged to the issue and there was no escape from it at this last it was even a relief to her to be called from the horrible suspense of inaction suddenly the memory of that crimson streak she had torn upon the insolent face returned to her a red light came to her eyes the blood ensign of women who love brave men in bissys creed she was not going to falter now or be untrue to her ideal of manliness besides the end justified the means taking herself forcibly in hand she went down the stairs to the door into the corridor this was a deserted part of the building and now even unwontedly quiet by reason of the infantas desire for repose thus and for such purpose to take advantage of its abandonment might have seemed a double treachery to some people such moral niceties were beyond fanchettes appreciation she descended softly and found a man at the door he was a strong truculent looking fellow unknown to her swagger in his attitude an inhuman animalism in his small sunken eyes and bushy bearded face on which a thick smear of lip stood prominent she had had no personal intercourse with his kind but the hall mark of the assassino prezzolato was stamped on his every feature he was well enough dressed to pass for a fanfaron but she knew without seeing them what there was under his cloak to point the moral of his trade face to face with the loathly thing she had helped to call into being a revulsion against her own bestial weapons seized her this brute to hold a fine destiny in his hands her narrow lips went up as in the presence of something physically offensive she had no fear for herself not an atom the man swept off his hat with a leer that in its suggestion of hidden confidences was fulsome he produced and handed to her a little folded tuck of paper un lettera amorosa signora he said in rather guttural italian his nose wrinkling the sender awaits a reply she plucked the thing apart and barely glancing at its message crumpled it in her hand and answered tell him i will come he grinned saluted her again and swaggered off she could have called upon heaven then and there to strike him dead that her nature must be thus subdued to what it worked in not like the dyers but like the butchers hand be claimed to an affinity with this abomination it was horrible yet so her own compliance had decreed it henceforth and for all time he was her loathed confederate and by reason of that understanding her master her hands might be purely white and her little feet as playful as a lambs for all that lay hidden between she was the foul bondslave of blood now a conscious corruption the vindictive termagant to her own debasement she did not hesitate but having hurriedly veiled herself went off to the assignation demanded she repudiated all responsibility for what was to follow she had done all that was humanly possible to warn a madman away from the certain consequences of his rashness and as he would not be warned she had no choice but to fulfil her own destiny as a contributor to those consequences she let herself go as the devil listed her way lay to the presbytery as seemed fitting to the unities of this tragedy which had first claimed her there to be its victim and tool the streets were full of the bustle and animation of returning life but the precincts of the church were deserted she mounted the steps to the silent house and knocked on the door which was opened almost immediately by gaspare the old rascal peered at her curiously a moment then putting out a lean hand drew her swiftly within his reverence she muttered half choking he sniggered he is out visiting the sick but non importa you will discover all you need in the parlour he motioned her thither opened the door pushed her in and closing the latch retreated he was too deaf to make eavesdropping profitable the room was sombre and almost empty of furniture and other appointments its most noticeable feature was a crucifix of ebony and ivory standing in the middle of the one bare table a melancholy shaft of light falling through the dusty window touched the white figure on the cross with a startling radiance fanchette shrunk back why did you bring me here she whispered la coque stealing from the shadows stood before her i did not wish my coming to be known what is to be done must be done with promptitude and in secrecy we are playing a part do you understand and the actors in it must not appear on the stage until the eventful moment else suspecting the plot those antagonistic to it may cause its miscarriage hearing a little gasp come from her he bent as if to look searchingly in her face and put a hand towards her shoulder but she repulsed him why should i be dragged into it she said dragged he drew himself up as if realising timely what he had to encounter were you not the first to volunteer i told you he had returned that was all was that all that he was in hiding in the neighbourhood yes go on there is no more not that they met in the gardens of aquaviva not that last night you let him in and out of the wicket in the eastern wall not that he will come again this night with what purpose but it will never be fulfilled my god how do you know simple deduction my fanchette you know the proverb a nod for a wise man and a rod for a fool i have had my instruments at work since the first hint there are horses ordered for to night did you know that no i do not doubt you let her thank providence thats all that she has sharper wits plotting to save her save her then but spare him do you say it why do you want him spared for her sake only what harm has she ever done me there are some growths infatuation for example that can only be treated with the surgeons knife o my god you cannot reduce them so long as the root cause remains do you realise where we stand in this at the fork of two roads disgrace or an empire a life one mean poor life must count for nothing in the decision you always hated him if i did it was because of you

wicket and i shall come upon you together i see a quarrel between you two about your mistress you are sharp enough when you will so you gamble with my good name which is after all nothing to you on the contrary his blood shall prove its particular value blood she seemed to gulp then whispered on hoarsely will there be much blood you need not wait to see for some moments she stood silent staring at him as if fascinated charlot she said if i do what you want will you marry me we will see i think there is good cause very well we will see i shall be ruined with my mistress the duke will find you compensation the duke does he know he knows and approves approves thunder of god how do you suppose he regards this outrage to his pride this abuse of his love a common adventurer a mere tavern thrummer without voice or standing and to practise his damned arts on the very soil of a newly turned grave whatever tolerance was shown him once is over and done with he stands sentenced like a poaching dog o be sure the duke is in it what if it be too late too late he made a step and gripped her arm they are not gone already not that but for an hour they were alone together last night he gave a deep sigh and dropped his hold it is never too late there but i trust the vestal in her and his own discretion an hour is nothing you must besiege these shy fortresses a week before they surrender then i will not be a party to his murder you will not what harm has he done that cannot be mended alive hell do it yet ill not help to hurt him youll do better to think again why better lest you be made to take his place what youll kill me not i unless i kill my love with kindness but i cannot save you now your knowledge of anothers secret be sure if your scruples refuse a part in it means will be taken to keep it fast in you the duke will have me poisoned who said the duke o how i hate you all from the first he had foreseen what must come and had been prepared for it he saw imminent at last the hysterical collapse long threatened and the look of the dog came to his face his teeth showed tight puckers gathered over his eyebrows he held her with a glare as he moved on her with a little sob half terror half defiance she struck out at him and on the instant he had her in his grip his sinews for all his slight build were like thongs of steel her mad struggles availed nothing against their vicious devilry she made no tumult uttered no scream but in silence fought and writhed biting at his hands at his clothes at anything until falling upon her knees he had her torn and dishevelled at his mercy he showed her none seizing her by the ears by her tumbled hair he forced her head back and snarling put his knee against her throat presently her struggles weakened grew spasmodic and a desperate imploring look came to her eyes then for he knew his lady relaxing the pressure and releasing his right hand he felt on the table behind him for a riding switch he had laid there and holding her down with his left applied it furiously to her shoulders one of them had been wrenched bare in the tussle he did not spare the naked flesh for that but rather lusted to see it quiver and crimson under his blows and all the time she made no outcry that was the strange thing but only writhed and shrunk away with now and then a panting sob or a quicker gasp when a crueller cut went home and at the end when his fury spent he ceased looking with hard breathing down upon her lo and behold she flung convulsive arms about his knees and with the released tears running down her cheeks put her head against him like a poor conscience guilty dog begging pardon surely the immortal thing in womans love is its illogicalness la coque knew his lady i say he took the satisfaction of a tyrant in making her know him he did not spurn her now but he stood unmoved and unmoving get to your feet he said do you hear she obeyed and stood before him a woeful girl streaked and torn by his brutality waiting breathless on his word have you come to your senses he demanded yes charlot her voice still caught in sobs though she tried to command it will you do what i tell you yes that is well at last now mark your instructions come here bend your head to me there will be two of us we shall be waiting in the sunk garden in the shadows of the trees below the terrace but not in sight of it lead him that way from the wicket it is very private before you pass i shall step out and challenge you both there will be an altercation between us as much to take him off his guard as for the benefit of the witness lurking in the background it is he you understand who is brought to testify to the real cause of quarrel such as he thinks it already a dispute about you he will do what he is hired to do while we wrangle but by then if you wish it you may have escaped is it all clear yes quite and you will not fail me no he searched her quivering face with its heavy eyelids all wet and swollen intently for a little then softly touched one of the poor ears he had so cruelly ill used ma pauvre petite he said pitifully ma pauvre petite the sobs came faster and thicker he drew her gently towards him and whispered why would you rouse the devil in me did it hurt so much she clung about his neck come he said lets sit yonder theres no one in the house but gaspare with lips like salve he touched the wounded flesh chre amie fanchette no ill not loose you over his shoulder the white figure on the cross blazed in her opened eyes not here she whispered hurried and febrile not here take me where he cannot see us chapter xxvii the cry in the garden the clocks were pointing near to midnight the village was long silent the flurry of the day had subsided everywhere and sleep and quiet had usurped throughout the palace the place of tumult only in that one remote corner above the terrace where the bridal myrtles grew was a shrouded light still burning unquenchable it seemed as the steadfast spark that glows before a shrine and there was the young wakeful postulant for loves service awaiting half rapt half fearful the mystic call somewhere in the shadows there was a watch ticking its tiny pulse beat out the seconds in a fury to outstrip the lagging hours for it had been worn near its mistresss heart and the throb of its hairspring had fallen into time with the fever of impatience it had touched there but at length the end was in sight and the round of long drawn minutes rolled up to the starward pointing hands isabellas own hands were cold as she lifted for the last time the little restless engine to consult it all day she had lived for this moment that was near truthful as she could not but be her headache had served her for no guileful pretext but it had served her nevertheless since it was solitude she craved she had some things to do not many but essential to write a letter to her father was one of them and she wrote it from her simple heart a little plea so pathetic so impossible that it might well have wrung a colder breast than his perhaps it affected him when he came to read it for he was not uncompassionate when the end was gained but of that we have no knowledge there were some jewels she would take with her indisputably her own she would not come to her lover empty handed to be a burden on his charity but the part of jessica was impossible to her and she robbed no one at this last she had only herself for all vital purposes to depend on fanchette whom alone it had once been possible to take into her confidence fanchette the fallen and unclean in her eyes was no longer an auxiliary to be trusted with other than the material aids to these meetings for the purer finer sympathies she was necessarily disqualified isabella blamed herself for this judgment for what was she herself better than fanchette save in the constitution of her passion yet surely that alone redeemed her for love to her was nine tenths a spiritual ecstasy and only the little residue the mortal drug to achieve it for all the best it meant to her she could have been content to play st catherine to the pure divinity in love well we may doubt but she was chaste at least chaste in the sense of utter truth to one supreme ideal this man was her god to whom she had given herself body and soul and if earthly passion was a detail of that surrender there is no use or profit in calculating its proportion to the whole now all things prepared she set herself to abide with what patience she might the weariful interval but first she took off her betrothal ring and looking at it remorsefully a moment placed it gently with the letter on her dressing table often during the long day she would caress her basil and speak to it as if it were a sentient thing and chide it for its too tardy blossoming it was not keeping faith she said for surely now the longed for hour of their union was approaching and yet its stubborn little twigs remained tight closed all day she would hear faint and afar the low thunder of life returning to deserted rooms and echoing corridors and listening was conscious of an already strange sense of detachment from the world of her knowledge she could think of it tenderly kindly but without one emotion of regret for its loss there had never been that in common between them which a first glimpse of the eternal truth of things could not dissipate and truth had come to her when it did in a transcendent form her soul stood on tiptoe foreseeing only the moment when love was to call it to the starry altitudes night when it fell at last came with a little moaning wind which ever seemed to grow in fitful spasms as silence deep and deeper settled on the house listening she seemed to hear without a sound of small voluble voices and little footsteps running like pattering leaves and giggling laughter that caught at her heart with fear but it was nothing only the mad spirits of the dark taking toll of the unrest which served to cover their antics in the pauses of the wind they would all stop as still as mice and then again when the blast rose high star its shrill volume with their bodiless cries they were nothing but to over tense nerves the voices of nothingness are the sounds most ill to endure and so poor isabel found them terrifying inscrutable until she could bear to be alone no longer better the company of the restless night itself than this vigil of haunted loneliness behind enshrouding curtains as the great castle clock chimed eleven she left her upper chambers and stole down soft footed to the fateful room whence she was to make her flight she had only to wait and bide the moment only to wait but fanchette had had her sure instructions and what else was there for her herself to do only to wait she extinguished the solitary light and putting aside the hangings stood looking out into the darkness it was profound among the masses of the ilex trees yet overhead there was still a cold shine of stars the wind came on in heavy gusts swaying the black heaped shadows so that they seemed to distort themselves mouthing and mowing like chaotic giants she did not dread them as she had the unreal voices not even when their movement seemed momentarily to betray the presence of odd white faced things crouched within their glooms but these were tangible at least tricks of fancy that one could grapple and defy gradually all sense of them faded as she stood and she lost herself in glowing dreams the striking of the third quarter brought her with a shock to herself even as the resonant jangle ceased on the instant cut off by a swooping blast she could have thought she heard through the tumult a faint sound of wrangling voices very distant inarticulate not to be detached from the general confusion but it ceased as the wind fell and she told herself that her fancy had again deceived her but not for long now her whole soul thrilled in the thought of the rapturous reality that second by second must be approaching to claim her for its own suddenly an intense feeling of awe came over her a thrill of hushed expectancy as in that solemn moment of the mass when the host is elevated above the bowed and death still congregation her eyes were on the velvet spaces out of their silences dripped a sudden star which descending slowly disappeared behind the trees and on the instant there came a womans scream harrowing heart piercing rending the darkness once and fainter it was repeated and then the wind took up the tale of fear and swept it onwards into obliteration the watcher stood as if stricken into stone all the blood in her body draining back upon her heart no fancy there could be none in that horrible cry who had uttered it and whence it had come from the direction of the trees down by the garden edge o god o god his time his path she leapt as one from the brink of the grave called back to the solace of some infinite pain he was there he needed her without an instants hesitation she climbed the little balcony and falling anyhow upon the turf beneath rose to her feet and ran she ran down the terrace across the sloping sward a small white spectre against the towering blackness of the trees her feet sparkled in the inky pools the wind charged at her and tore loose a wild strand of hair it was a figure to haunt those glades for evermore she ran and ran making straight in the direction of the sound as she skirted the plantation edge she seemed conscious of shadowy forms swiftly glimpsing and disappearing among the trees she heeded nothing of them of their flittings and sibilations real or unreal of what importance were they any longer in this context of death for it was death and the end of all things she never doubted it it was in her soul as she ran that scream had shattered at one blow the whole rainbow fabric of their loves illusion it could not be it could never have been by human consent only by way of this agony was it possible for the heaven of their dreams to come true down among the flowery paths she stopped suddenly and fell upon her knees beside him he was lying crushed into the green border there in that very place where the love in a mist was wont to grow so thickly it was quiet in this sunken spot no sound but the bubbling it seemed of a low spring it came from his lungs god pity her and ran over his lips beloved she sighed in a little voice but all hopeless heart break was in it with the intense vision of subconsciousness she could distinguish as surely as if it were daylight every detail of his face his eyes were closed but she knew he was not dead would he die without recognising her she put an arm beneath his head and tried to lift it to her bosom not without one word she said with a small wooing moan it is only you and i and at that struggling back from the shadows he raised leaden lids and knowing her faintly smiled she tore a handkerchief from her breast a little perfumed scrap of lace and cambric and with it tried to staunch the gushing life and then she bent her face to catch the gasping words what is it most dear most dear believe nothing only my deathless love and mine o and mine his left arm crooked feebly a moment and then fell a spasm of scorn twitched his dying features in the back there were three of them and one a woman again the murmur tailed off and ceased in a numb agony she spoke the name that was only hers take me with you she whispered with a quivering sigh o take me take me with you and then suddenly and strongly he rose in her arms and an unearthly light great and triumphant was in his eyes and he spoke with a clear voice sweet in the north in the beautiful gardens we shall meet in three the blood rushed from his mouth a slight convulsion shook him he fell back they found her they the shameful ones when they slunk presently from their ghastly ambush clinging insensible to the lifeless body chapter xxviii a posthumous existence and she forgot the stars the moon and sun and she forgot the blue above the trees and she forgot the dells where waters run and she forgot the chilly autumn breeze she had no knowledge when the day was done and the new moon she saw not but in peace hung over her sweet basil ever more and moistened it with tears unto the core in that strange long sleep of swoons and haunted wakings there was a dream she had something had always troubled her a sense of something left undone on the fulfilment of which a rapturous tryst depended it was associated with a promise which yet was a promise conditional on something to be performed at first in her half lucid intervals she had been content to lie quite still and resigned secure in the thought that no more than the third day was needed to see her broken heart made whole in the transport of a swift re union but the day came and passed and she was still lying unreleased in the quiet room why was it so she had made so sure of the promise and yet the sign had been withheld weak tears dropped from her eyes if not three days then what soon it must be in this state of bodily and mental prostration into which she was fallen but when o death had been cruel to cut short and confound that message in the very moment of its utterance if only she could know she could endure and then came the dream or so it seemed she thought that once quite suddenly and blissfully enlightened she rose in the sweet clear morning when all her watchers were asleep and descending the stairs softly passed out into the gardens by way of a door that had been strangely left unlocked then swiftly her bare feet were on the dewy grass and she was running she ran down by the trees to that place of delirious memory and there were the crushed flowers and the trampled ground to convince her of the truth of what had been the spot it seemed had been avoided since and only a hurried attempt had been made to obliterate the traces of the tragedy but deep in the bushes she saw half hidden what she had come to seek what she had never doubted that she should find a little blood soaked handkerchief she had cast it from her when she had clasped him at the last hurriedly she secured her prize and kissing it hid it in her bosom the blood had dried upon it and it left no mark upon her lips she turned and ran again she thought then that she was back undiscovered in her room and that she went to her basil pot and with little labour coaxing the sweet thing whole from its nest laid the handkerchief in the void and therein replaced the plant burying her secret out of sight and so dropping tears upon its leaves she went again to lie in her bed trembling in a very ecstasy of reassurance she had solved the heart haunting mystery it would blossom now when they came to wait upon her she was asleep she slept as she had not done as yet the burden of that riddle once lifted nature must have its way with her when she awoke at last it was to a sense of peace such as she had not known for days she was convalescent the grave physicians said so congratulating her discreetly on her recovery from what something malarial or tertian probably her constitution had been tried by the strain of recent events the obsequies and so on and so on what did it matter if they knew if anybody knew she was only in a fever to substantiate her dream and the moment she was left alone she rose to do so she was very weak her eyes were unearthly bright there was a pain upon her heart those were all very well and dearly well if only her dream would yield the thing she prayed of it when she was convinced it was there she wept for very joy it was truly there indeed no need to trouble how it was brought whether in a dreaming or a waking trance the end was assured and the promise would be fulfilled thenceforth physically indeed she was restored the restfulness engendered by that assurance helped her bodys healing she felt it so herself but without uneasiness for the result what was to be was written and no fretting could either alter or anticipate the end in the meantime untrammelled by material pains and weaknesses her spirit was free to soar into those regions where life and love awaited it this lower state had ceased of any meaning for her like the dying poet of that other isabella she felt conscious somehow of leading a posthumous existence as if her real self were elsewhere blissfully sleeping out the hours like the dead adonis until the appointed moment when love should wake it this sense of detachment was so absolute as to deceive her father into a belief in her complete resignation to what had happened and was destined to happen she had been mad and was sane but being so he had no desire to torture a point which with her convalescence had ceased to be material she awoke one morning to see him standing at her bed foot he stood stiff necked immovable searching her face with his inquisitional spanish eyes presently he stirred and coming round the bed lifted the pale slender hand that lay upon the coverlet and slipping a ring upon its betrothal finger stood retaining his hold silently looking down she smiled at him then and spoke a little faintly si mio padre it shall remain there no mention of the letter none of the crisis that had produced it the act and the look were sufficient in themselves to cover the whole of the situation regret for a stern necessity forgiveness for an unspeakable offence assurance that thenceforth all would be overlooked and forgotten in the promise of reparation he might have gone then satisfied but in some redeeming impulse of emotion he put the little fingers to his lips before he replaced them gently on the coverlet and as he went isabella turned her face to the wall and wept she felt no resentment towards him for what he had done or caused to be done but only an infinite pity he did not know he could never know her reparation was only nominal for what had she to give at last other than the mere mechanism of a being which his own act had deprived of its essential meaning and which must soon perish for lack of that vitalising principle her soul was already with her love only her body remained for insensible submission to those brief mortal uses which men might desire of it she came downstairs after that and resumed her formal existence there was something gone from her but it was of too subtle an essence to affect the common mind with a sense of definite loss what suspicion of the truth was abroad she did not know or care to know she was like one regarding in herself the unfamiliar antics of a stranger they did not much concern or interest her either introspectively or in their visible relations to their surroundings but she was very sweet and gentle with all for the habit of kindness remained to the desolated heart the scent of the roses still clung round the broken vase only the old spirit of merriment seemed to have deserted her for ever no laugh was once again heard on her lips regarding so little of the past it was not strange that she never referred to her vanished chief femme de confiance or appeared to notice that she was deprived of her services it is even possible that fanchette might have resumed her place at her side without exciting any repulsion in her she seemed to bear no one a grudge for what had been or to discriminate between this and the other in the ruin which had befallen her she may have surmised who were the chief instruments in that tragedy she never betrayed by word or look her knowledge of them it was not their guilt which was the poignant thing it was the irreparable loss it had entailed on humanity one did not condemn a viper because it achieved its nature as much in biting the heel of a saint as of a sinner that all sweet absence of the spirit of revenge that utter absorption in the effects of the deed and noble contempt for its perpetrators should have been felt by base minds as more crushing than any retaliation perhaps it was neither la coque nor mademoiselle becquet was to be found at colorno in these days and the mortal body of her tragedy she never learnt or tried to learn where they had laid it what did it signify that poor broken prison was no more concerned now with the ideals which had once made it animate and beautiful than was her own body with the little mortal lusts and policies which contended over its brief possession to all that its life tribute meant to her at last the basil contained the clue it was there alone her real being centred and became volitional alone with it her soul seemed to return into her from the spaces where it had hung aloof and to become articulate with a remembered ecstasy she would dream with the green thing and talk softly with it as if it were he himself recalling a hundred little secrets of love and loving converse she had no knowledge when the day was done but only that the darkness meant the joyful nearing of her basil time and always and for ever she prayed it wooingly to flower growing more pathetic in her sweet entreaties as the third month from that night drew to its close but still the stubborn sprays showed no sign of breaking not for all her tender plaints and bedewing tears alas it was not to be yet chapter xxix at rest sound mournfully upon the winds and low for simple isabel is soon to be among the dead she was married early in september when she had been told that it was to be she had simply acquiesced quite quietly quite gravely to make him happy she had not forgotten the wistful words almost his last and the withholding of the sign was proof that the sacred injunction was not rescinded if his dear ghost still held her to that sacrifice there must be reasons for it hidden among the inscrutable silences perhaps that way alone lay the end she so wearied for if this poor residue from all which exalted life above its material perishableness was enough for josephs content she valued it too little to grudge it him let him be happy with it if he would and could and so she was married quite quietly as befitted her mourning in the ducal palace at parma the ceremony was performed by proxy the prince of liechtenstein representing his royal master and immediately following it the new archduchess set out for vienna it is enough for our remaining purpose to record the whole heartedness of her reception there by that susceptible young man her husband who had only once before in his life seen the face which was now to awaken in him the liveliest emotions of love isabella much more than justified the archdukes earlier impression of her he found her beautiful and desirable beyond all expectation and he laid his soul then and there at her feet with assurances of its eternal dedication to her love and service eternity was a big sad word in that connection of expediency and tragic because it could never be more than a one sided compact she had nothing but a temporal gift to offer him in exchange for it but she lent to that what grace she could through the pathetic sweetness of its giving he deserved only kindness of her he had had no voice no hand no knowledge in the deed which had been his gain and what a little gain after all it seemed hardly worth all this plotting all this wreck of lives and ruin of souls to end on such a paltry acquisition it were as though a party of musicians had fought for the possession of a delicate instrument with which in the meantime they had been belabouring one another it is said that on the bridal evening when left alone together in their room the young wife turned to her husband with some expression of this thought upon her lips she had been looking from the window into the blown star lit darknesses of a night such as that which had imprinted for ever its death shadow upon her soul and the emotion of that piteous memory was alive and terrible in her she looked into his face an intense and appealing sadness in her own and clasping her hands as if in prayer spoke to him i will try to be to you a good wife during the three years we shall remain together how he answered amazed what is this arbitrary limit i do not know she said sighing only something tells me it will not be longer what had he to do then but in his exultant happiness laugh to scorn her fears take her to his impassioned arms declare the immortality of their union she was overwrought he said oppressed by fancies born of change and recent sorrow in the creative fire of love all those dismal spectres would pass consumed leaving new life and hope to spring from out their ashes she shook her head but he would not be gainsaid the confidence of the autocrat was in him he read in her mood nothing but the diffidence of a young soul temporarily overweighted by its own aggrandisement there is no reason for supposing that he knew anything whatever about the real state of affairs there is every reason for surmising that the truth would have been jealously withheld from him he never once in after months alluded to tiretta or appeared to have kept in mind the part played by that romantic agent of his in the sequence of events it is possible that even had a hint of the truth been conveyed to him he would have scorned to attach any consequence to the story the cicisbeo of his day was almost as formal an institution in society as her ladyships pet lap dog or confessore sometimes even he was solemnly inducted in family conclave and not seldom he was quite the most harmless member of the domestic circle the first condescension of an archduke and destined emperor was sufficient to sweep all such ephemeral fancies into oblivion well if princes must be princes in these matters joseph had got let it be admitted the best that he deserved i think so myself i feel a little impatient i must confess of that enamoured philosopher who having sent as it were a professional appraiser to value his fancy could behave to her when acquired as if she were the prize of his most single and determined devotion but he was really devoted to her even passionately so and if she repaid him with duty rather than affection he was not the man or the philosopher to complain he knew well enough that there must always be something lacking in unions of policy which nothing but a miracle of chance could make soul unions and joseph could not be unjust or unreasonable save perhaps when he regarded the quality of his own reason and found it pre eminent so he was satisfied to remain the positive pole of love to his wifes negative for the rest the young archduchess did all or almost all that was expected of her she was a dutiful wife a gentle mistress a timely mother and if the one babe she bore to her husband was of her own sex not her disinclination to oblige but nature was responsible for the reservation infanticide by unsophisticated girls is often due to terror and repulsion over the totally unforeseen on a higher plane we find the fruit of lovelessness regarded by its bearer with cold alien eyes that is far too harsh a description of isabellas attitude towards her little infant yet the thing seemed oddly strange to her something queerly remote from her own knowledge and volition a changeling as it were that had been deposited by her while she slept it attracted her she was curious about it but in a detached way it gratified her most in its relation to the task she had set herself and which was now accomplished she had given a potential heir to the throne she had made him happy surely now she might look with confident eyes to her release this poor physical residue of her had played out its part it had in truth and so we approach the end there is no need to linger over it now the little ground is cleared and the other actors in the drama are put away like inessential shadows into the background it is the passion of the moonlit garden once more the rapture and the meeting it had been evident that the young wife was drooping it had been increasingly evident since the birth of her child always frail and delicate marriage it seemed had never with her as with some fragile constitutions stayed the tendency to decline but had rather confirmed and increased it something was gone from her indeed which no vital force of love could replace she seemed to fade where she stood like a spent lily as the months drew on she grew weaker and still weaker her husband saw but without understanding it was a transient indisposition in his eyes autocrats are incredulous of death one night at the opera she fainted some moment in it had stabbed her with a too poignant memory there was consternation then but she rallied yet never to the ground she had lost and was still steadily yielding she grew to be the shadow of herself yet not so much the shadow as the phantasm her beauty did not go nor her young symmetry only it was strangely refined as if some light within shone through dissolving walls and yet she was never but gentle and lovely sweet with all very patient uncomplaining but always without merriment or laughter and so one day there dawned upon her the third anniversary of her lovers death on that day she would not look upon her basil for a week past she had put it aside where her eyes could not encounter it there had been signs which yet the wild longing in her heart could not find courage to verify now she dared not put them to the test she dared not risk the ruin of her hopes until the last possible moment of endurance it came with the dying day in the last lingering hour of light she hurried towards the spot something greeted her even in the instant of her approach something like a sweet hand held out she gasped she gave one little cry of rapture so intense that god in his high place must have wept to hear it the little bush was mealed over with fragrant flowers as thick as snow that night she was to sup with the archduke privately in the schnbrunn palace as she came in to him he seemed conscious of some change in her which was like a startling revelation and recovery it was the nixie of the pool he saw again girlish radiant captivating her cheeks were like fresh roses she sparkled over with merriment and audacity a little staggered at first he rallied quickly to the delight of the challenge and responded buoyantly to her mood he was jubilant in what he believed to be the first definite sign of her restored health that and not that alone was it conceivable that he detected here a hint that she might come to be to him something that she had never quite been yet something which he only seemed now to recognise for the first time as a fully achieved desire a fully satisfied hunger a perfect realisation of a dream which had hitherto lacked its best fulfilment he thought he would sacrifice much philosophy much pride to ensure that gain to be to her at last not the husband but the lover as soon as possible that they might be alone he dismissed the attendants it was a lovely moon drowned night the long windows of the room opened upon wide spaces of tranquil garden whose trees and beds and slender rosaries were but soft accents on the universal glow all liquid and milky green it might have been some under world of strange waters from which they looked up to see the bright globe just misted through that deep transparency somewhere a fountain falling with a little flop and tinkle gave voice to the illusion the dewy lawn looked a though frosted over with moonbeams it was a long fairy track fading into ineffable
