his rent thus he hath sold his land so broad both hill and holt and moore and fenne all but a poore and lonesome lodge that stood far off in a lonely glenne for soe he to his father hight my sonne when i am gonne sayd hee then thou wilt spend thy lande so broad and thou wilt spend thy gold so free but sweare me nowe upon the roode that lonesome lodge thoult never spend for when all the world doth frown on thee thou there shalt find a faithful friend away then hyed the heire of linne oer hill and holt and moore and fenne untill he came to the lonesome lodge that stood so lowe in a lonely glenne then round his necke the corde he drewe and sprang aloft with his bodie when lo the ceiling burst in twaine and to the ground came tumbling hee astonyed lay the heire of linne ne knewe if he were live or dead at length he looked and sawe a bille and in it a key of gold so redd he took the bill and lookt it on strait good comfort found he there itt told him of a hole in the wall in which there stood three chests infere two were full of the beaten golde the third was full of white mony and over them in broad lettrs these words were written so plaine to see once more my sonne i sette thee clere amend thy life and follies past for but thou amend thee of thy life that rope must be thy end at last the lake of wine chapter i some time in june of the year as privately chronicled there came a famous evening at whitelaws club in st jamess street off piccadilly london there and thenaccording to the unattested evidence of an eyewitnessmr ladislaw lost his head lord dunlone his mistress sir robert linne his fortune and major dalrymple his life thus it appears these four were all losers and each of a material property save the first who alone of the quartette commuted his selfpossession for a very real equivalent in hard cash whitelaws in those days ran of a host of gambling clubs the deepest it was there all heavy potations and long stakes at which many a selfmartyr burned but the first of these were put down and the second up with an accepted solemnity of decorum that was traditional to the place and the sign of its moral endowment fox in his heavier moments had been known to hazard in its glooms occasionally and to lose of course andequally of courseto find immediate balm for his scorched fingers in the inevitable herodotus selwyn also and topham beauclerc and many another georgium sidus had played and hiccupped within its pregnant walls but always with gravity and a weight of personal responsibility towards the foundation brookess might have held in its time more showy revelry almacks have gambled in broadbrimmed straw hats bedecked with flowers and masks to hide the play of emotions whitelaws would have none of these it had ever stood coldly aloof from flash and notoriety accepting todds definition of a club as an association of persons subjected to particular rules rather than that of johnson the rendering has a warm personal flavour who calls it an assembly of good fellows meeting under certain conditions from first to last it remained ponderous in selfimportance and rigid in exacting the observance of its unwritten codes of conduct if its gaming operations were large it desired the company of no featherbrain plungers but rather of players of substance to whom cards were a market not a raffle therefore when on this particular night no fewer than four of its memberslike those in the fablesuddenly revolted against the central system and for a space of minutes made havoc of its respectable traditions it is no wonder that whitelaws rose at the outrage like one man and in the upshot pronounced sentence of club ostracism upon the delinquents this as it affected three is matter of private history the fourth escaped the distinction there and then through the interposition of the man with the scythe faro was the game and the stakes were swingeing the four had played from three oclock of a thursday afternoon to six of the friday morning in the white spread of day their eyes showed up bloodshot their cheeks grimy with candle soot their hair slack and unstrung my lord dunlone who was a slipslop youth colourless and jejune with stains of wine on his chin and high cravat brooded in fathomless sulkiness the only pronounced expression he was ever real master of his neighbour sir robert linne had the look of a fine tormented devil desperate and at bay these were the losers of the winners mr ladislaw was a perspiring cabbage of a man stunted and overheaded and he seemed drunk and amazed with his good fortune and the major presented a lean and hungry appearance as if his passions were devouring wormswhich indeed i believe they were about six of the clock there came a pause in the gamethe lull before the crash mr ladislaw twinkling prosperity bent obsequiously to the baronet his cards clumped together in one hand the stakes as before sir robert he said in a small confidential voice the other gave a hollow laugh checking it frowningly in midcareer i think so he said if there happens a margin whywe must make it a broad one on paper as you please sir major dalrymple with his thick lips dropped apart was gazing breathingly at his sulky neighbour the latter conscious of the inquiring scrutiny pulled himself erecta cub of illtemper curse it he muttered with a surly sidelong glance what am i being stared at for curse it your pardon my lord said the major in a high stiff voice i looked only to inquire your stake i can settle it myself sir without your helpand with a very meaning action he held his cards facedownwards upon his breast the major went back in his chair his corded hands thrust out rigidly before him on the table my lord dunlone he said impugns not only my judgment but my honour oh curse it cried the viscount what have i said it was your action spoke sir sir robert laughed recklessly youre hard on my lord he clasped his dear love to his bosomno more tis an amorous way he has the dyspeptic face of the soldier went dark he recognized an allusion in the bantering words the viscount dunlone in fact it was notorious had outbidden him in the favour of a certain mademoiselle carminelle a figurante at vauxhall in the suit of mr tom restless and popularly he was supposed to have aged under the disappointment come cried the baronet give us the privilege of driving to the devil our own way you mustnt criticize the actions of dying men we writhe with wounds sir while you are soundhe turned to mr ladislaw who sat staring apprehensive i stake my all he said and named a sum sufficiently desperate there were a few late habitus in the room one of these a dry long man with a face like a puckered medlar and a shortsighted contraction of the eyelids had been for some time a stealthily intent observer of the quartette now this individual humouring a habit of his by drawing in his breath with a wincing sound gave his chair a shift and seemed to be awaiting results at a distance with some secret interest stake and have done with it cried sir robert boisterously to the young lord the latter turned an insolent languid glance on major dalrymple they were a contrast the soldier set spare bilious with a great hooked nose and cracked heavy lips the other a ruffled petitmatre of the first folly pearlpowdered cherrymouthed a model of sartorial elegance from his choking cravatso amplified as that his face looked like a peach stuck in a napkinto his full pantaloons of apricotcoloured velvet i stake lisped this exquisitei stake your reversion sir there were influences of wine and illfortune fermenting in the fools empty head otherwise he would have hardly dared such perilous banter i fail to gather your lordship said the soldier going red the adorable carminelle began the viscount drawlingly when the other jumped up with a furious face upsetting his chair in the act and clapped his left hand instinctively upon his thigh there was a moments commotion one or two in the room rose but the dry shortsighted stranger sat on quietly rubbing his chin nonplussed for the moment as it seemed by the absence of his weapon major dalrymple gasped hesitatedand sat down again as he did so some were aware of a blue streak across his forehead that remained there after his flush of passion had subsided i stake a thousand pounds against that he said with a sudden fall to intense quietness of intonation the incident passed and the deal there was a stern spirit of expectancy in the room this was not whitelaws wayeither as regarded the outburst or the nature of the declaration that had produced it then all in a moment sir robert linne had leaped up and flung his cards in mr ladislaws face and the major was on his feet again stamping and declaiming the baronets victim taken completely by surprise started and fell over on his back his chair splintering beneath him the place was in an uproar at oncered and angry visages on all sides only sir robert stood placid with folded arms smiling grimly down on the havoc he had wrought i call all to witness screamed the major panting and struggling in the arms of two who had seized him that i accepted my lords stake but not his infernal insult i have won the right of protection over an outraged lady and i now call upon him to answer for his brutal abuse of her name in publicand despite his captors he whipped up a glass of wine from the table and dashed it at the stupid face of the lordling who still sat sullenly defiant of the spirit he had evoked the glass cut his forehead and halfstunned him for the moment mr jephson cried the soldier glaring round and selecting one from the excited group about himyou will do me the service to ac the word snapped in his teeth like a pipestem with a groan he sank upon the ground and his face was purple from ear to ear an instants silence followed then babble of voices and the pressing inward of the spectators around the fallen man lord dunlone sat mopping his red forehead in foolish vacancy and sir robert linne strode over to mr ladislaw who had been helped to his feet and stood apart and alone i took full licence for a ruined man said the baronet and am prepared to give the fullest satisfaction the injured one almost whimpered that is the devil of luck he said hysterically you force a quarrel on me and deprive me of the fruits of it oh sir not necessarily you know im damned bad at shot and thrust the loser smiled wickedly the only stealthy witness of the little scene was the shortsighted man you desire to compound the insult then said sir robert oh surely sir with your kind permission the other laughed shrugged his shoulders and turned away mr ladislaw took a forward step and ventured timidly you exaggerated i trust when you spoke of yourself as ruined do you question my statement sir he flapped round with a mockery of fierceness the little man fell back scared oh dear me no he cried sir robert laughed again shot a contemptuous look at the group by the table and went quietly from the room in the clubhall he came to a momentary pause the fellow should have fought he muttered i would have made myself a broad target to him then he sighed but theres a shorter cut chapter ii sir robert linne as he left the club had no thought but to sever the tangle of things by cutting his own throat he intended to do this agreeably and decently and to step off the world into chaos with as little inconvenience to himself and to others as was compatible with the severity of the deed after considerable reflection the plan that suggested itself to him was to proceed to some riverside station hire a wherry work his way down stream an indefinite distance and then sitting on the thwarts neatly and philosophically put a weight in his pocket and a bullet in his head and so overboard ordinarily he permitted himself some nausea and illtemper after a nights debauch this morning he would have none of them it would be churlish he thought to hand in my credentials with an illgrace if i have represented his sable majesty faithfully he has his own good reasons no doubt for recalling me therefore to prove how the will can overcrow the nerve he whistled on his way and was very affable and kindly to all his fellows with whom he came in contact they were not many at that early hour an amazed roysterer waking on a step a kennelscraper driving his broom before him at a shambling trot giles the apprentice yawning over the shutters and a pretty mopsqueezer or so who affected a demure propriety as he waved a kiss to them in passing and blushed and giggled when he had gone by he turned into st jamess park where moll and meg were tethering their cows at the sweetstuff stalls and bought and drank a glassful of white innocence with a sort of pleasant bravado of geniality it made him feel good for the momentpastoral and boyish once more whats your wish in life molly he said turning with a smile to the girl who had supplied him sure your honours quizzing no im not in truth now tea at bagnigge wells then with china and a gilt spoon he burst out laughing and then looked grave your ambition hath a gooseflight what would you give for the treat anything but my good name i stand corrected sweetling here take your golden egg and never part with your goose he took her chin in his hand bite he said and clipped a guinea between her white teeth that shall go to my credit he said to himself as he walked off and made his way slowly to his rooms in whitehall therein he did not remain long but came out very shortly a pocket of his ridingcoat bulged in a sinister manner he went down the strand and fleet street at a faster pace now passed temple bar with its three gaunt spikes yet shooting from the topmost arch like dry stalks from which the ugly blossom had long withered and fallen and turning into the cloisteral recesses of the temple fell loitering again moved by the silence and antiquity of the place it was a freshblown morning sweet with virginal sunshine and the old haunted walls and windows of the courts seemed elbowing one another in eagerness to obtain largesse of light glancing upward he read on a dial set in the stained red brick wall of a house in the inner templebegone about your business a sextons motto he murmured must leisure be always a stolen happiness and every clock a treadmill for time to toil on but i accept the churlish reminder and he made his way with a melancholy smile to a rearward gate in the river wall and came out upon a flight of stone steps that went down through ooze and slime to the water level the muddy stream as far as the view could reach was all patched with sunshine like a beggars fustian with cloth of gold life was awake on the flood but in such enchanted guise that for the moment his eyes filled with tears wherries shot the ripples like bobbins traversing a loom of silver tissue hay barges soft applegreen along the thwarts and stacked high with yellow trusses slid placidly past until the blue distance covered them with a haze like glass from the happy shoreward mists voices and anvils chimed in intricate harmony but so subdued by distance as to seem the veritable bells of elfland sir robert gazed in that entrancement of the spirit that is impersonal and momentarily divinethat comes of a complete surrender to influences outside the bourne of nature a voice hailing him brought him back to the ugly prose of being boat sir boat hi my lad pull in here the wherry came alongside the steps and the man touched his hat waterman whats the value of your boat shes not to sell sir perhaps shes to buy ill give you ten guineas for her the craft was old and cranky the man scratched his head grinned and spat into the water im at your service sir and damn your company say i i dont want it if youre for selling theres my offer if youre not ill go elsewhere short and sweet what dye want of her thats my business mind you your own and he thought he caught a glimpse of a figure moving the other side of the gateway in the wall come he cried hurriedly take or reject ive no time for barter he brought a handful of gold out of his pocket as he spoke there was the sum he had named and a little over the man hesitatednot from any doubt as to his own advantage in the bargain but from a dread that he might be lending himself to some compromising transaction the glitter of the pieces decided him he stepped forward hollowed his two hands together and looked up greedily take it a bargain he said im for your honour a moment later he was holding the wherry while the baronet climbed in sat down and unshipped the sculls the stern swung out into the stream at that instant a figure came softly and hastily through the doorway with a finger on its lips it slipped a crown into the watermans ready palm the prow of the wherry held by the latter jerked and bobbed and settled steady he in the boat was at wrestle with the sculls let her go he cried without looking round the waterman gave the craft a vigorous shove and stepped back whats in the wind with you my dandy galloot he murmured watching hand on hip andyour honour makes better time with tonguepad than with sculls he added with a grin and indeed it must be confessed that sir robert was no accomplished oarsman however he shuffled his craft out into midstream somehow being indifferent to the manner and then he poised his sculls letting the boat drift down with the tide which was running to sea even now he could hardly take himself with that seriousness that the nature of his intention would seem to demand did ever man he said aloud meet the devil halfway with such a sense of humour you have none said a creaking voice in the bows he twisted his head aboutscarcely marvelling at the response so you have taken me at my word he said you think i am the devileh you flatter yourself a monarch to condescend to the practical executive i take you for one of his imps well siri dont despair of you i gave the waterman a douceur and slipped in as you pushed off so you are not the devil no only one of his impsan attorney then i am lost indeed hmmay i have a little bout at reasoning with youbefore youeh before iehjust so my friend now balance the pros and cons i pray here am i going to damnation and thinking myself equipped with all decent loneliness for the journey i turn my head and find counsel waiting to argue the case for you congratulate yourself heaven is no no state your case without blasphemy very well take care of that bargei revert to my original postulate you saiddid ever man meet the devil halfway with such a sense of humourand i answered you have none you didand i throw the word in your teeth no man i make bold to say has more than i yet you propose killing yourself yes why my mission in life was to be foil to the virtuous tis a costly business and not to be maintained save with luck luck has coldshouldered me i have staked and lost my last penny and so my mission ends and i jump off the cliff of the world with a light heart and with a poor sense of humour i repeat it pardon me you said with no sense of humour welli qualify that that is a concession from a lawyer now has it occurred to you that you have obtruded yourself upon a reckless and desperate manthat to a lost soul standing on the brink of cocytus it may seem a small matter and the humouring of a very trifling aggravation to push a fellowtraveller over into the gulf before he leaps himselfat this moment it suggests itself to me that no ghostly letter of credit would serve me half so well down there as an attorney in esse the devil needs lawyers to argue his case generally they evade him at the last by some technicality shall i take you to prove at least that suicides come not without exception of the humourless class i made no such statement but this i saythat any man who contemplates selfdestruction has for the time being lost his sense of humour i am in no hurry why because he is taking himself with that exaggerated seriousness which is the trademark of the bore is a suicide a bore certainly he is a man with a grievance who professing to accept life as a game of chances cries out if the cards are against him his tone may be clamorous or subdued but it always carries the same refrain at a certain point he would almost resent good fortune for he hath persuaded himself that he is born the butt of providence and his vanity is such that he would not have even a diseased judgment of his refuted vanity vanityhe is the very maggot of it continue continue my friend this is not coke or lyttleton sir i will continue you decry my profession but what doth it teach a man if not to look below the surface the suicide is he who will not take his own destinies in hand for at heart he is a sensuous fellow who hath subordinated his instinct for combativeness to a poor sentiment of fatality in a world of noble struggle he would lie down and ignobly sleep thus like a distempered cur he turns and gnaws his own flesh or weakly despairing stings himself to death like the fireringed scorpion the baronet sat amazed this is no lawyer he cried but a wesley come to judgment the driedstick of a man in the bows drew in his breath and leaned forward with moist eyes the lids whereof were like dead seaweed oh sir he cried in a full voice let me entreat yousee the game out if i lose and am disqualified there is no whit the less interest in the play that goes on there are plenty to continue itplenty to profit by the lesson of my downfall from being pupil i have become teacher and shall i by selfdestruction diminish the number of that blest company my good sir said the baronet with some emotion and pull your right scull said the lawyer anxiously you have a great advantage of me but i respect and honour your sentiments why i should find you here or why you should take an interest in my fate passes my comprehension no doubt said the other i know you i think by sight said sir robert you are a member of whitelaws if i am not greatly mistaken i was elected five years ago recently i have presumed to take a watchful interest in your fortunes as they were presented to me by report and by actual observation i have sorely marked youi crave your indulgencein your race to the devil i have a good mount i shall win sir sir why what a todo is this do you disparage your master i am no attorney yet i could prove black the very moral of innocence as how as thus to desireconscious of unworthinessones own salvation is to aim at selfaggrandisement to be careless of ones own salvation is to be unselfish to be opposed to ones own salvation is to be actually virtuous the devil may be considered the apostle of this creedergo the devil teaches virtue well and well i take you on clause two of your reasoning if in being careless of your own salvation you are careless of that of others and surely it so follows having regard to precept and influence you are selfish but if you think of others you are not careless of your own for no man would of his true generosity help his neighbour to that which he himself scorns now the manner of your purposed exit the unexampled sweetness sir with which you have met my most impertinent intrusion convince me that you are far from feeling a careless indifference to your fellows i have a measure of goodhumour i would not kick the stool from under my neighbour because i sit upon a stone but the first test of humour is to know itself bested to succumb to the finer witand that the devil hath shown disprove him he hath stood so long in his own shadow that he fancies himself a giant he tiptoes against the setting sun and his dead image seems to embrace the world upset him and he lies but a pigmy my friend he is not to be felled but by the stone of godliness that i never possessed for it is not purchasable and if it were my pouch is empty yet you gave in hard cash ten guineas for this crank vessel that is worth it was my alli swear it and now i have bought charons ferryboat and future souls must swim not much consideration for my neighbour in that so i have said nought to move you from your purpose i greatly regretnothing the spare stranger groaned it shall be a lesson to my selfsufficiency well sir i must play a better card if you please run the boat into the hard there and accompany me to my office i will hand you the titledeeds of an estate that shall give you a new lease of life chapter iii like one who accepts an indifferent gift rather to pleasure a friend than for his own gratification sir robert linne held his reprieve in his pocket as it were with a careless hand and accompanied by the lawyer reentered the humming lists of life silently the two made their way westwards the man of deeds accommodating his pace with some secret chafing to the leisurely progress of his companion now and again he would glance stealthily aside into the latters face and give a halfcomical shrug of chagrin over its expression of tranquil goodhumour that seemed such a genial satire upon the situation if he hobnobs with death so calmly how will his philosophy accept a living estate thought the uneasy scrivener and light come light go he groaned in his heart presently they were in holborn without the rag of a sentence to pass between them and so came opposite the block of houses known as middle row here suddenly sir robert stopped and took his companion by the arm you itch to improve on the situation said he with a twinkling gravity harkee nows your opportunity here am iyonder stands branscomes lottery office draw your moral my friend and ease you of your load the lawyer drew in his breath his face crinkling well said heforeread and embarrassed but conscious of rightthe man was an earls fellow once it proves him the more admirable for being a rich man now sir robert sir robert tis an evil system and a mistaken how is he rich on the pitiful savings of shoeblacks and servant wenches tis such as he bid industry sit hands in lap and starve on illusive hopes for a single chance in fifty thousand he buys her ruin and what is all this but bitter gambling ha ha old gentleman we reach the point at once but believe me sir i never starved a servant wench or took anything from her but a kissand that i returned the lawyer sighed go your ways he said you have your fathers laugh whatyou knew him i had the fortune to do him a service oncetwas during the riots of when foul john wilkes was committed to kings bench on a writ of capias utlagatum and the redcoats let fly at the mob your father commanded they called it the st georges fields massacre and all concerned in it gained a mighty unpopularity yet he was but a simple soldier and obeyed orders well sir an unpopular king must needs have unpopular ministers and so down the scale let a tyrant fall i speak in illustration onlygod bless his majesty and his very scullions come down with him i did sir robert a service i say and he repaid me with his confidence his son is beholden to you you repeat yourself on behalf of a scapegrace i fear you were not his adviser in one matter only that you shall learn now my friend the last words were addressed to an oddlooking individual who had come up to them as they talked and who now presented certain savoury goods to their inspection with a dumb gesture of invitation the creature was a lank middlesized man with a meagre face of decorum and rather delicate features set in an expression of confident apathy he was scrupulously attired in dresscoat vest and kneebreeches of stainless black broadcloth and black silk stockings ending in shoes decorated with large steel buckles encased his neat deliberate legs a great shirtfrill stood out from his breast like a table napkin from a tumbler and his neck cherished the spotless embrace of a lawny cravat on his head he wore no covering save its natural one but this was so clipt and bepowdered as almost to give the appearance of a close cap of linen a short apron of the softest texture which concealed a third of his glories seemed designed rather to advertise his calling than to protect his broadcloth thus apparelled he presented to the talkers a little round tray on which was set for consideration a pudding neatly sliced and sugared that gave out a pleasant fragrance to the obvious merits of this he silently drew attention with a short bright spatula which he carried in his other hand no no said the lawyer not today my friend not today he smiled goodhumouredly and the oddling dropped a courtly bowthe loss is mutual it expressedand carried his comestible elsewhere sir robert said the attorney with a droll kindly look the lottery office missed fire but i have another moral for you it shall have my respectful attention sir in honour of my fathers friend the words were spoken with gravity the other gave a twitch of surprise then said he in a pretty gentle voice tis from him with the pudding they call him the flying pieman but his proper business is to paint pictures at which he has a fine skill they say fortune missed him however he married for lovea course for which there is plenty of precedent but no authorityand love begets a family but nothing to put in its empty crops at the last pinch he kicked over his easel and went out to sell puddings he did nought by halves if his pictures are half as good as his victuals he deserves the presidency he hath made himself a character in the neighbourhood but a finer one in gods eyes i will venture tis said that no whit faithless to his art he trades all day that he may indulge his real bent after hours that is to be a man and an example to me sir to me you would say and so he is i have no family but that is an accidentnot an excuse i take the pieman to my heart and see no ostentatious vanity in his shirtfrill i read another moral here too this is heavy hill and goes to tyburn oh heaven send you to the house of correction come on i beg my office is close by then your prayer is answered you shall do the overseer and whip me with maxims the lawyer smacked in his lips as if he were sampling some sharp but not disagreeable berry regarded his incorrigible companion a moment through covert eyelids then turned and led the way across the road and under the old gatearch of grays inn beyond this portal a short distance pleasant tranquillity prevailed it is the humour of the law to hatch in antique solitudes the plots that vex many lives with turmoil and disquiet around its inn halls the devils cloisters invite to peripatetic contemplation of quibble and sophistry and its silent gardens cherish that grimy tree of death whose trunk is freckled like the serpents with discs of yellow up a step or two through a venerable doorway with fluted pilasters the long man ushered his visitor and so to a dusty comfortable room on the first floor where tiers of japanned boxes the caskets of dead passions and aspirations were piled high against the walls like coffins in a family vault mr creel said the baronet sitting up on a high stool and crossing his legs the lawyer bowed so i read it on the door sir believe me i hold the name in honour for my fathers sake it is a good sign said the other and so far of happy augury here i hope is soil that may be renewed and yield yet a plentiful crop of wholesome grain he sat himself down and toying with a pencil fixed his eyes steadily and gravely on the young man i crave your permission he said gently to speak very plainly very freely andwithin proper limitswithout reserve surely sir for should i not be dead by now tis a postmortem examination out with your scalpel and cut and dissect as you list it is a family matter and very private to your ear mr creel who so taciturn as a ghost even a lawyer may give his confidence to a shadow you please to jest will you be serious for once what i have to say affects you nearly i represent your dead fatheram his agent not in authority but in lovingkindness i listen i listen perhaps i am a little lightheaded i have thrown out all my ballast remember you saw but little of the late sir robert i was eleven years old when he died that was in the war of he fought under clinton and lies in charleston where he fell he was always a soldier in my vague memory of himsaturnine preoccupied with a rare smile for odd moments he feared god and loved his kingrest his memory he had one other lovehis only child but him he was troubled for troubled for but why should i ask the boy was of high spirit reckless generous he wore even at that age his heart on his sleeve for daws to peck at they have left all threadbare well well sir roberts was not a great fortune but it was sufficient with management for his wants they were fewer than mine good man i feel sure sir this retrospect is for a worthy purpose otherwisewell it is obvious i was acquainted with the extent of my own inheritance i ask no account of your stewardship that is no part of the solemn commission i accepted from my friend maybe you have been more sinned against than sinning yet is it not true that your fathers apprehensions were justified why else was i in the wherry you are ruined i am ruined the lawyer sighed it was foreseen he said by him who was dearest to youforeseen and provided against provided against mr creel made no answer but he quietly arose went to one of the japanned boxes unlocked it and took thence a bundle of papers these he said are the titledeeds of an estate that is yourson certain conditions the young man had no word to say but watched the other in amazement as he took from the little heap a certain paper that was folded and sealed with his fathers monogram i follow my direction said the lawyer and break this seal the contents of the document are for your ear but they are addressed to me i ask your attention while i make them known to you he shifted so as to secure a full light knitted his brow and without pause or comment read out in a brassy legal voice the lines before him to my honoured friend mr james creel of grays inn i have committed to hold in trust for certain purposes the estate of delsrop in the county of hampshire whereof are dwellinghouse and messuage ninetyfour acres together with two farms held on long leases the which it is not my desire to particularize in this the present connection but rather to state clearly that in event of the bankruptcy at any time after my death of my only son robert which calamity i considering the bent of his nature do sorrowfully foresee and in no other event the said estate is to be handed over to him to work to a profit if he will and so redeem the past but on the condition that from that time being he shall forego his honourable title and know himself and be known as robert tuke which name of tuke hath his mother borne before him to her maiden honour and renown and this i state clearly that he may take or reject without further question knowing the estate to be mine to give and else seeking to know nothing and i offer it a last chance of redemption that he sloughing all that foulness of the past with his dishonoured name may turn the fruits of evil to the account of good in the minute of amazed silence during which the listener sought to ponder the import of this astonishing message mr creel refolded the paper returned it to the packet and sitting down again tapped and scraped his chin with the latter in a dry manner of expectancy well he said at length sir robert tilted himself to his feet and stood rumpling his hair i am at sea he cried in a lost voice what does it all mean i never heard of this estate nor i protest did the executors how did it come to him and when that i may answer you it was in the year not many months before his death and from whom the lawyer shook his head grimly ah said the baronet you love a secret of course am i never to know more than this sir you understand the conditions you are to take or reject a messuage and the rest of it and where is the working capital these many years i have nursed the property against this contingency it has yielded fairly and there will be an accumulated sum to your credit and if i reject then the whole reverts to me the young mans eyes took a sudden softness he was only thirtyone and susceptible yet to impressions of unworldliness i fail to see your profit in the matter he said my profit answered the lawyer sternly was in a good mans confidence then he went on more gently i sought no profit in the transaction i would have sacrificed more than the estate to save you and myself the necessity of this explanation it was my affection for your father bound me to this solemn compact as it was my regard for the latter drove me unknown to you to set an anxious eye upon your career and so pluck a fool from the burning and lose an estate sir robert advanced impetuously and seized the others corded hand you are a noble soul i will learn to pray and you shall be my saint to intercede i take my life from you and this strange trust doing my duty by it and asking no questions the old lawyers eyes moistened but he answered somewhat caustically i wont say it is your deserts but the gift is from heaven where your father his battles over sits at peace tis he hath interceded and the almightyto satisfy his importunity maybegives you a new house as erst he did to job but for a better reason then he added a little inconsequently youll find it in a damned bad state of repair chapter iv it was six oclock of a cold september morning when sir robertor mr tuke as we must now know himwoke in his room off the stableyard of the old george inn at winchester lying lazily snoozed amongst the pillows he reviewed with some amused satisfaction the first courses of that scheme of reformation he had mapped out for himself whereof two rather sleepless nights at farnham and his present quartersthe result of an abstention in the matter of numerous nightcaps which habit had made necessary to slumberwere the prologue now the little battle fought and won he preened his moral feathers smugly and felt cleareyed and very good indeed as to the mysterious estatethe last stage on the journey to which he should cover that dayhe had soon learned to accept its acquisition with that sweetness of irresponsibility that was his most engaging and aggravating characteristic but after all he had an excellent digestionin common with a great many men of the eighteenth centuryand was little inclined to dyspeptic brooding over problems now as he lay his halfdreaming glance was arrested by a coloured print after george morland hanging on the wall over against him the like he remembered dimly to have known in a nursery of long agoa picture that had often set his young soul wandering by lanes of enchantment nothing could have served better to confirm and make abiding his present mood he was a boy again an appleskinned ulysses with the limitless possibilities of the unknown before him without stain or guile he passed beyond the narrow margins of the print into a land that no mortal foot but his own had yet trodden indeed for the moment he was a child again and there is nothing in afterlife like the pure imaginings of such to the child every incident is a picture framed and hung upon a wall the memory of these pictures abides long then fades a little and a little more we are hardly conscious of them in old age or at least feel hardly the ecstasy of their atmosphere in acquiring our identities keatss phrase what dont we lose we find a fact for a dreama wretched exchange but the first possession doesnt altogether go it recurs to us at odd moments in little sweet mental vertigoesnever so much perhaps as during that halfwaking hour of dawn when we are least conscious of our material selves then to think of a dewy morning down of a pleached alley of fruittrees in blossom of a windy common of the mystery of snow and brooding distances of a christmastree even and the mingled ravishing smell of lighted tapers and banked firbranches is momentarily to recall the amazing romance and illimitableness of life is to be quit of the dreariness of conviction and to stand once more at the foot of the green slope and look up and wonder whither the clouds are sailing over the far summit a few artists a few writers a few musicians have the power or the instinct to inspire us with these ancient imaginings and such as can we must dearly love though they may never stand in the front ranks of their fellows the child is the only real genius and perhaps these have remained morally children in midlife they can arrest and record the fugitive retrospections that to the most of us are only bubbles broken away from the fardistant spring of life to be caught at and to vanish on the prick of possession god bless them they are our best earnest of the spiritual out of his luminous stupor on that grassy borderland of dawn the dreamer came with a full heart and it must be confessed a biting consciousness of emptiness in his stomach he sprang out of bed and bathed and dressed to the hissing accompaniment of ostlers in the yard below and to the clank of horsehoofs on the cobblestones he breakfasted as men did in those days as if he were victualling for a siege and had great thoughts of kissing the chambermaid when he feed herbut refrained by halfpast nine he was on the road with a heart full of gaiety and a recurring wonder for his destination and clattered under the old west gateway of the town with a song on his lips she was throated like the stare welladay she was white as buds of may welladay and all with their sweet scent her bodie was besprent that to kiss her was a joy beyond compare if her mouth the scarlet hips welladay would for redness all dismay welladay ah it took its comely stain from the truths that she had slain for falser than the serpent were her lips once with passion i did rave welladay now i will not though she say welladay for the cry of damnd love all her beauty doth disprove and her heart it is a stone above his grave mr tuke had not a good voice the chords of vibration were beyond his control but his breast was lined with romance and this led him to give some melodious effect to the sentiment of words that did not seem it must be admitted appropriate to his rather riotous character he left the old city and took the stockbridge road and presently entering between country hedgerows looped his reins slackly and let his horse amble fairly as he listed the sunshine in his soul was constitutional inextinguishable and not reflected from his surroundings for the day was bitter for the time of year and the wind stuck as rigidly in the northeast as if the stiffpointing weathercocks had nailed it there the greyness however emphasized the sparkle of hip and holly and all red berries for every dull mood of nature has its compensations to shame us out of peevishness a squirrel ran from branch to root of a beechtree like a stain of rust a cloud of fieldfares went down the sky and wheeled disintegrated as if they were so much blown powder the ruddocks twinkled in the hedges like dead leaves flicked by the wind the horseman had an eye and a heart for all he was of good lovable material whatever the hitherto courses of his bad days and worser nights by and by he came out upon country very wild and barren the road heaved and dropped by way of grim and treeless downs through whose cropped surfacegrass the white chalk smote upwards like death in a sick mans face for leagues the sterile slopes seemed stretching onwards and no sign of life was on them all but here and there a flapping crowno music of it but in some more sheltered hollow the sweet larks broken groundsong and the further he rode the more confirmed in desolation grew the scenery there was a wild forlorn beauty about it all neverthelessa cleanblown freshness that seemed to set the hillsides pulsing with opal tints like nearextinguished ashes breathed upon something familiar to those days was wanting however and the solitary rider peered for the something unwilling to believe that a tract so lonely could be innocent of a certain unchancy landmark he had already loosened his pistols in the holsters and was riding with a greater regard for surprises he topped a hillock and ah quoth he i could not be mistaken on a high swell of ground right in his path as it seemed a structure like a massive clotheshorse open at an angle stood up against the sky from its crowning beams a short slack or two of chain depended but these were quit for the time of any ugly burdena void that by no means pleased the traveller when the boggart tumbles the crows regather he murmured sententiously but he set to singing again though with an eye alert for mishaps nothing occurred however nor had he sighted a solitary soul moving in the breadth of the wide landscape whenwithout a change being obvious in the character of the latterhe found himself descending a steep slope to a little long township of queer and ancient houses here at a pleasant small tavernon whose signboard as he approached he read the legend the first inn the reverse slyly exhibited to the eternal merriment of chuckleheads the obvious antiperistasis of the last outhe drew rein and found he had reached the village of stockbridge which was in truth that haltingplace on his last stage from which he was as he had learned to take a byroad some five or six miles to his destination into the tap he strode and there were a few gaping rustics swilling their muddy quarts and the landlord a wizened bentstick of a man behind the bar oblige me by sending some one to look after my horse said mr tuke to this person the person shifted a glass or two covertly eyeing the stranger through rheumy slits of lids but answer made he none mr tuke repeated his requeststill without result he turned sharply on one of the grinning hinds what ails the old faggot he said he be stone deaf master then the fellow bawled jarge jarrge the genleman warnts s oss tended the old man put a wrinkled claw to his ear and shook his head eh said mr tuke you refuse he flushed in surprised anger when at the moment a girl came into the bar and addressed him in a bright civil voice grandfathers deaf sir she said and i was out of the way ill send your horse to the stable and what shall i draw for your honour she was fresh and desirable as a spring of sweet water to a thirsty traveller an old yellow handkerchief of cherished silk was knotted about her head yet none so jealously but that a curl or two might escapelike tendrils of tantalus his vinefor the teasing of fervid souls and her gown girdled under her bosom and fastened there with a favour of michaelmas daisy smelt of lavender and was the colour of it she was tall too for a hebe of the downs and her arms bare to the elbow were tanned of a soft ivoryas were her hands that were fine and capablelooking she gazed honestly at our gentleman from eyes as full of brown harmonies as a starlings back and he had no thought but to return her gaze with complete admiration can you give me to eat he said anything will do and surely sir she answered if simple fare will serve your honour she showed him into a queer little parlour with a long latticed window that looked into a vegetable garden ruddy with appletrees and fetched cloth and salt from a corner cupboard while he sat down by an old grumbling grandfather clock and watched her movements who is the landlord of this good tavern said he george pollack sir and i am his granddaughter at your service would you were and what is your name my pretty maid elizabeth i was christened said she and betty am i called his last words suggesting an old nursery rhymeand what is your fortune my pretty maid he could not help murmuring selfpossession said she with a smile and whisked out of the room chapter v mr tuke had ridden a mile along the last lap of his journey when he suddenly drew himself together gave a whistle and set to communing audibly with his inner man this will not do roberto he murmured thou hast eaten of the dangerous fruit and the sweet poison courses in thy veins he shrugged out a laugh why what has my drugged headpiece been conscious of since i left the innwhereat i dwelt a pernicious while by the way the wind whistles betty pollackthe lark twitters betty pollackshe smiles over the hedgerows she sits on every stile the rose of the sun looks through the grey welkin like the fire of untouched maidenhood in her delicate cheeks and i am a squire of acresa man of substance and a good man prospective i believe he laughed again flicked his horse to a canter and broke into a fragment of the oldworld song that seemed queerly inapt to his character sweet sun sweet air and a pilgrims scrip shoon to my feet and sword on hip flout or kiss on a ready lip and the green byways of the worlda his voice rang down the lonely swales and made their austerity human for a profound silence reigned on all the hills and in the valleys by way of his passing and the wind had ceased to cry of its own desolation still no change marked the aspect of the country he traversed downsendless downs with occasionally a wryed plume of beechtrees on the peak of a slope occasionally a row of white stones in the cleft of a hillside as if nature like some disturbed beast were setting her teeth for a snarl at the end of another mile it came as a breathing relief to him upon topping a long incline to see its downward pitch break away into a spread of meadowland whereafter began trees at first singly or in clumps further in copses and little shaws until the distance rolled with their billowing in fair modulated waves the sight brought a cluck of satisfaction from him for he was not made for loneliness and he paused to drink in the glad prospect indeed he had come to think that his acres would prove but barren sheepruns and his house but a magnified shepherds cottage on a swept table of pasturage till this good view opened out to reassure him down below at the foot of the hill lay a little lusty field with a noble girth of hawthorn about it and through the green of this a shining burn floweda mere crooked rindle it looked pencilled white on the grass it was like the image of a lightning flashearths engraved memory of a sublime momentso still seemed its course from the travellers coign of regard and for some reason unaccountableunless it typified in its innocence the cleansing spring of repentanceit drew him to dismount that he might stoop and wash his throat with a mouthful of its kindly rippling he rode down tied his horse to a stake in the hedge and crossing a broken stile strolled over the long grass that gave up a spicy smell of peppermint as he neared a fat bush of wayfaring tree that stood against the margin of the brook he became aware of a man whom he had not at first noticed fishing in the shadow of the green covert the very creases in the back of this individual who was to all appearance absorbed in his sport excerned a suggestion of watchfulness that somehow convinced the intruder that his every approaching step was being marked and listened for careless of the fact however he came alongside the stranger who moved not so much as an eyelid but continued to observe the slow voyage of his float with inexpressible serenity any sport friend quoth our hero the stranger without turning his head answered nonelike a dog snapping at a fly he was not a wellfavoured person it must be said either as to his clothes or features any of which seemed to have assimilated a common frowsiness his long yellow jaws were cleanshavedif so spruce an epithet could be applied to a handbreadth of mouldy stubbleand dry tags of neutraltinted hair fell over his cheeks and little hard eyeplaces a greasy cocked hat whereof one flap had been roughly seized down to give shade from the sun was battened on his head and the length of his gaunt body was expressed only by a rusty brown ridingcoat that fell almost to his heels there was something elsesome peculiarity that marked him apart from the ordinary and in the first moments of their meeting the newcomer vainly cudgelled his brains to find out what this was but presently when at length the stranger turned to read him fullface with a single covert glance he saw in what the abnormality consisted the man had no ears but only little corrugated holes where these features should have been mr tuke gave a whistle then a laugh i disturb you i see said he that be damned said the stranger icily you disturb the fish sir he had a great hooked nose the corners of which were sensitive of his every word one would have expected them to vibrate like lamin of talc if he should ventilate his anger mr tuke laughed again why do you swear he said cheerfully i dont though i think i have lost my way then let me put you on it again in the devils name you will pardon me i cant undertake to travel with that passport even if countersigned by you sir sir whither are you bound do you think the chub are interested in your converse i dont know the wise man baits his hook with inquiry and the fool his with impertinence you fish in empty waters sir oh you are churlish but i understand an angler sports for the love of solitude you are perfectly right wellconvince me that i have not wandered abroad and i will go you are out of your path here that i can assert for delsrop house the long mans fist jerked so that his float bobbed on the water for where said he the float slid out of sight mechanically he reeled up bungled and lost his fish curiously he seemed little affected by the calamity what place he repeated busy with his hook delsrop tis calleda house somewhere in the neighbourhood why what dye seek thither surely sir you are a fool by your own showing rest content i only seek my own your owndelsrop mr tuke sniggered with amusement preserve the man he cried but i understand sir and appreciate the kind of welcome like to be extended to an absentee landlord for a moment the stranger seemed at a loss for speech then suddenly he turned upon the other with a strained smile on his lips and his nostrils in a lively state of convulsion you must pardon me he said i know the house which hath been so long untenanted that the fact of a claimant to its wildernesses appearing fills me with a sense of the abnormal he trailed his rod staring at the intruder so you own delsrop said he with a musing hand caressing his stubble i suppose you knownow i suppose you know the place is reputed to be haunted mr tuke was growing impatient can you direct me thither he said curtly surely sira lean smile creased the leathery skin of his cheeks you have only to follow the road you left over the crest of the first slope you will pass a tavernthe dog and duck the gates of delsrop break a plantation of firs three miles beyond the baronet expressed his thanks briefly and stalked away his informant looked an unsavoury piece of goods in all truth and he was growing conscious of a sense of weariness that inclined him to resent undue eccentricity he remounted his horse and pricked him to the ascent beyond the dip looking back as he neared the top he noticed that the fisherman was disjointing his rod with a snapping impatient hurry of action that seemed to signify his sport was no longer the uppermost interest with him i am destined to be stalked for some weeks as a black swan thought he crossly my advent will be better than a rareeshow to these local blockheads he breasted the summit and rode on almost immediately he came in sight of the alehouse alluded to and read dog and duck on its flaked and blistered signboard that hung posted in the roadway opposite the tavern the latter was a forlorn and barrenenoughlooking little temple of convivialitya mere whitened sepulchre for the entombment of deaddrunks it stood in a sterile patch of garden that was so flogged by bitter winds that the very cabbages lost heart and the stunted potatoes cowered in their trenches like the rawest of natures recruits there was a vagabond look about the building too that was rather accented by a strip of lead over its dinted doorway that gave to the two round bosses of opaque glass let into the upper panels of the latter the appearance of weak bibulous eyes protected by a monstrous shade to one side of the door a wooden bowwindow with its lower panes lined with some stuff of a crimson hue projected and on the outer sill of this a figure quite in keeping with the character of his surroundings lounged at cumbrous ease and drew the while at a long churchwarden mr tuke caught only a fleeting view of this figure as he rode past but an impression of it was taken on the retina of his minds eye with curious fidelity yet there had been nothing so remarkable about the man who was a thickset burly fellow of low statue and unobtrusive physiognomy only his cropt hair and eyebrows had been very white and his face very red and somehow the combination had had an extremely ugly look a hundred yards further on looking backwards with the common selfconsciousness of the wayfarer he saw that the lounger had slouched out into the road and was watching his recession with weighty curiosity andoh he groaned that i should come to be the eyesalve of such a parcel of oafs on he rode by swale and hillock and presently the sombreness of his journey wrought a little mood of discomfort in him he had loitered so much by the way that dusk was beginning to gather in the hollows and the melancholy of his surroundings found something of a kindred feeling in his heart the rising of the mist along watercourses as if silent trains of powder had been fired to give warning of his passing the monotonous progression of thorny hedgerows the flickering of sudden bats and rustle of unseen things in the roadside tangleall oppressed him as if with a certain alarm of ominous expectancy often now he dived into swoops of lower ground that were mere pits of blackness from the density of the trees that grew about them then the wind that had lain coiled awhile reared itself anew and went moaning through the branches and met the traveller fullface on ascents so that he shivered and greatly desired the comfort of a cloakbut still nothing like a house appeared in any corner of the desolate and lonely landscape it was in one of these dismal plunges into gloom that as he began to toilfully breast the incline beyond the memory of a gate halfhidden in the bushtangle at the bottom occurred to him as something he had passed but a minute before with an abstracted eye at the thought he drew rein turned his horse with the sound of a tired trailing of hoofs and retraced his steps a length of fifty paces sure enough set in the height of a dense shrubbery was a tall twofold gate of wrought iron that sloped off into the bushes on either side but years of neglect had assimilated the paint of the metal to the colour of the leafiness about itblue and mossy greenso that little wonder was that it should stand unobserved by the belated passerby now the star of my destiny guide me said the baronet peering curiously through the dusk is this the road to my inheritance it seems weird and neglected enough in all conscience he dismounted found the lock of the gate to be burst and useless and decided to at least push his inquiries into the mysterious twilight beyond it needed an effort to force open the structure on rusted hinges and against the mat of weediness underfoot but he did it led his horse through and swungto the gate behind him it went into place with a scream and a clang that cut piercingly into the sombre stillness a bird or two fled twittering from the thickets and then all sank into silence again the intruder paused a moment before pushing further peering hither and thither through the dank obscurity of trunks whose interlacing boughs made a high fragrant vault at a lofty distance above him he was aware of a little ruined lodge ancient tenantless and all overgrown with lichen an eerie inheritance in good sooth he shivered and taking his horse by the bridle led him on the brutes pasterns rustled in dead leaves his hoofs thudded softly on spongy moss to all appearance he traversed a drive making for the house but from its character it might have been a natural alley in some primeval wood he had been given to understand that the caretaker had been forwarded certain directions for his reception now as the wild and unordered nature of his property was brought home to him he thought how inadequate to his present needs any preparation possible to the estate was like to be and was halfinclined late as the hour was to ride back to stockbridgeso cosily figured in his imagination the lights and good roast of the first inn with pretty betty pollack to serve them it was the reaction of a moment and in a moment dismissed for whatever the spirit of the man the good horses was already sufficiently tried dismally cogitating he continued his way and suddenly a new uneasiness was added to his apprehensions something was moving alongside himkeeping pace with himflitting in and out at a little distance amongst the trees it was spectral and softfooteda suggestion rather than a shape but when he paused to look more closely it was always gone still if he moved again there it was undiscernible in the dark thickset slipping forward on a level with him and so noiselessly that sometimes he thought it a mere trick of his fancy the tension on his nerves under this shadowy ordeal grew at length so taut that he was fain to stop and cry out if only for the relief of hearing his own voice in that ghosthaunted solitude who are you he shouted why are you dogging me like this like this a little laughing echo threw backand silence closed upon him again he felt the thrill of sweat prickle down his neck but stubbornly pushing forward of a sudden he saw the drive swerve into open spacea twinkle of light gleamed upon himand there grown out of the dark before his eyes was a long low house of crinkled white with either end fashioned into a protruding gable too weary and out of humour with the situation to note anything but that here presumably his quest ended he drew up at a central porch with a peaked roof and seeing a dark ironstudded door before him rained a shower of blows on it with the butt of his ridingwhip a step hurried along the passage withinthere was the click of a latch and the figure of a tall man holding a candle over its head appeared in the opening as the two stood thus a moment a white shape came out of the darkness passed horse and traveller and with a tiny laugh fled into the house and vanished chapter vi any man but a bayard is apt to lose the accent of courtesy in the rebound from a sudden fright mr tuke fell back a pace breathing quickly then he advanced in quick fury so that the man in the doorway shrunk before him are you whimple he demanded in a harsh voice with a slight tremor in it at your good service sir the caretaker spoke up timidly and made an involuntary motion of retreat who was that that went in before methat has been stalking me all up the drive ah sir you must hold her excused i did not know she was out it is my sister darda the fiend take the jade ill have her out bag and baggage if she trifles with me here sirdo you know who i am take my horse and see that he has food and water he stalked angrily past the shrinking figure and made his way into the passage go now he said with an impatient stamp and join me when your service is done the man went forth silently and the newcomer turned to look about him it seemed that his most dour apprehensions were realized in that first view of his surroundings he saw a long hall not too wide that in its panelling of black oak looked a very catacomb of dismality in the light of a single flaring oillamp that stood up on a bracket halfway down and whose greasy radiance rather emphasized than relieved the enwrapping gloom somewhere in the further obscurity the first steps of a stairway with old carvedend posts were evident and here the windy darkness seemed to rise into vacancy like smoke up a chimney the traveller uttered a fretful expression and pushing open a door to his leftthrough which a weak shaft of light issuing appeared to give promise of a certain comfort beyondalmost fell down a couple of stone steps that led straight into a large massivebeamed room with a great hearth in it on which some smouldering faggots glowed with a dull crimson here at any rate was a board spread with food and drink and amongst them a couple of candles in brass sconces the revivifying sight led the baronet to look about him with a wider geniality certainly the room was beautiful in its proportions and in its air of antique solemnity the floor was paved with solid stone flags the walls were oak up to the ceiling and a long oriel window now heavily shuttered was set deep in the masonry of the side over against the hearth the tired man sat him down on a wooden stool before the embers and fell to a fit of musing over his queer destiny so this was to be his fateto plunge from the fever and glare of fashionable dissipation into a lonely and halfdismantled dwellingplace situate in the heart of an isolated thicket well he had accepted his life on the terms and the powers of destiny should find that he had the will to shake the life out of a resolution into which he had fastened his teeth in the depths of his pondering he heard the front door slammed to and bolted and was aware the next moment that the caretaker was standing in the room silently awaiting his notice he twisted round on his perch and regarded the man frowningly the latter hung his head under the scrutiny he was a hectic bashfullooking fellow tall and weedy with pale eyes and a weak sloping chin his age might have been thirtyeight or sowas in fact though there was a curious suggestion of youthfulness in his smooth shaven cheeks and soft uncertain voice mr tuke waved his hand towards the table these preparations are for me the best we could compass sir he spoke with hesitancy and in a manner of deprecation the notice was very short i had no instructions to provide but what the house could supply and no means of learning your wishes there is little in the house i suppose little indeed sir but some linen and a trifle of silver and a good store of wine in the cellars of whose providing the man did not answer the other repeated his question in a more peremptory tone alreadyhe could not have said whya prejudice was forming in his mind against this patientspoken servant of whose providing i say whydont you know it has always been here sir it was here before i came and when was that the answer followed so soft that the baronet could scarcely distinguish it speak out sir said he angrily when was that i ask the caretaker cleared his throat it was in november of the year the year before my fathers death why man do you mean to tell me you have lived here all this agelived and vegetated in this isolation for twentyone years it is true indeed sir you were a boy when you came your ambition is a tortoise and who was the last tenant again the soft distressed answer i dont know sir indeed i dont know how can i tell how trulyfor one who can be content to rust in a solitude for a double decade wellyou take your service from mr creel i suppose and he knows his business and whither do you wend now the man was emboldened to step forward his eyes shining with a pitiful anxiety oh sir sir if you will only continue the service we have no home or hope or prospect without delsrop and mr creelmr creel sir he bade me throw myself upon your bounty i am beholden to him he looked a little sourly on the flushed weak face perhaps there had been small charge of powder behind his shot but anyhow in the long run goodnature was sure to incline him to generosity i will consider of it he said coolly perhaps you can prove yourself worthy of my interest for the present at least you may stopyou and your sister to whom i conclude you desire me to extend the permission if you will sir and i can only thank you from my heart his broken tones found a weak spot in the others breast well he saidwell what are you called my name is dennis and your sister she is darda hm a pet expression i presume indeed no sir tis hebrew and signifies pearl of wisdom and is she that ah sir twas a fanciful notion of her mothers god help her poor stricken loveling sure the fiends of pride suggested it in a bitter irony what ails her her mind keeps no growth with her body in this her twentyfifth year she is nought but a wayward and fantastic child my household figures out apace and you two are alone on the premises alone sir and have always been well mr dennis whimpleand i would say as i would be too leave me my good fellow and light me presently to bed the caretaker withdrew with a humble obeisance and mr tuke sat down to his meal this proved homely enough but acceptable to a ravenous stomach and no doubt the wine made rich amends for the poverty of the repast his supper finished and a great wave of sleepiness threatening to overwhelm him he called for his henchman and demanded guidance to his bedroom up the broad stairway dennis bearing a candlestick in either hand preceded him and his drowsiness inclined him there and then to little observation of the passages by which he passed but presently he was aware of standing in a great gusty room strongly shuttered like the one below and having for its one conspicuous piece of furniture a mighty fourposter with curtains and tester of heavy faded brocade dismissing his guide with a curt goodnight he crawled shortly between sheets fragrant of lavender and fell almost at once into a profound slumber he woke in the morning to the sound of a tap on his door panels come in he groanedfor his head was like lead with the close atmosphere of the room a broad spurt of light flooded him from the opened door and dennis entered with shaving water and a towel ah said tuke recollecting himself its you is it oblige me my friend by flinging open those shutters and for the future refrain from closing them at night the man did as he was ordered and then paused sir said he with the same painful hesitancy of mannerif i may presumepray let me entreat you to reconsider the question the other raised his head in staring surprise what question said he that of opening the shutters at night mr tuke sprang up into a sitting posture with an oath what the devil he cried are you to begin by disputing my orders but leave the room sir when he was alonemr whimple muttered he you must have that hangdog mouth muzzled if you are to stop he looked forth through the broadlatticed casement it was a fair still morning and the sun made idyllic glory of what had overnight appeared so haunted and so sombre the house lay so far as he could make out in a wide basin of ground cut out of the heart of a thronging woodland and must from its position be very private and remote before him was stretched a noble lawn with a couple of gnarled and buttressed oaks to break its greenness but the grass was a foot long and so weighted with dew that a kilderkin of sweet water might have been gathered from it to his right he saw the opening of the drive by which he had come to his own this so far as he could see down it was less an avenue than a passage driven through a wood and all over its mossy floor the light fell in brilliant smears and patches as if the branches dripped green fire elsewhere on every side visible were trees but with here and there scant openings in them they closed in the further line of the lawn they packed the hollows and mounted the slopes in every direction they filled the prospect with an ardent leafiness the gazer turned and pursued his inquiries into the room he found little to reward his curiosity beyond the general beauty of an ancient interior for the chamber was panelled in oak like the other where he had supped and the window was a fine oriel with heraldic devices in stained glass in its topmost squares for furniture there were the great bed whose posts were richly carved in antique foliage a wardrobe no less generously designed a washhandstand and chairs of plain solid oak and an oak table in the embrasure of the window with a cracked mirror of old repouss brass work standing on it this indeed was the one exception to that tasteful substantiality of accessory with which a mysterious destiny seemed to have supplied his needs else there were no pictures no carpet no curtains no adornments of any kindonly a severe simplicity in which was suggested a certain methodical cleanliness which it pleased the man of fashion to think was far remote from the systems of society with its accumulations of glittering rubbish he went through his toilet singing and opening his door found himself on a broad landing wherefrom halfadozen other doors gave access to as many rooms into each of these in order he peeped they were empty one and alldusty spiderhaunted and not a room of them it appeared but had had at some remote period its oak flooring roughly jarred up and as roughly thrown and stamped into place again in one or two moreover bricks dislodged from the chimneys were cast pellmell upon the hearths or fissures gaped in the walls or in the plaster of the ceilings one would think he murmured that the place had withstood a siege that it was designed with an eye to such a contingency the massive nature of its windowshutters would seem to point theseall of which had been obviously only recently thrown openwere of a common pattern of studded oak and their hinges were sunk deep in the masonry of the walls closed their power of resistance would have been as that of the stones themselves throughout the house when its owner came to explore it this same feature was apparent the building in an emergency could have been sealed as securely as a castle mr tuke found his breakfast laid in the room where he had supped as he entered the figure of a girl that had been busy at the table came forward as if to pass him he barred her way and she stopped immediately are you darda said he she gave a shrill laugh and yes she answered she was an eldritch creature and undersized but the clean symmetry of her limbs was perfect and her manners of movement showed all the mingled grace and selfconsciousness of a child of ten in her face was a marvellous contrast of colour that was even startling on first acquaintancefor the skin was white as bleached kid but the eyebrows were very dark and the piled heap of hair that curled down upon her forehead was of a bright coppery tint she nodded at the intruder and showed a line of even teeth you come in good time for the shadows she said in the autumn the house is dark with them what shadows girl ah you will know they moan and look from corners or swing from the cobwebs and clutch at you as you go by you will know did i frighten you last night you startled me you jade she clapped her hands merrily her laugh was the most weird concatenation of rippling discords the baronet had ever heard poor gentleman she said perhaps you shall see my museum for recompense will you come by and by maybe is my breakfast ready she nodded again with her lips set and vanished from the room chapter vii about midday mr tuke sat himself down like a man thoroughly wearied in his great flagged hallwhich with a fancifulness of conceit he had dubbed his diningroomand summarized with a completely depressed air the fruits of his mornings exploration briefly these included in the matter of furnished apartments the chamber in which he restedwhereof the plainest of necessaries was comprised in a table and a few chairs his bedroom already described two little closets in the north wing appropriated to dennis and his sister and very modestly equipped and a kitchen embellished with a basketful of odd pots and pans for the rest a score of rooms large and smallof direct access or approached by way of tortuous passages whereby unexpected steps to nowhere were the least harmful of many pitfalls and obstructionsrepresented the present value of his inheritance and so far as they went a purely negative one inasmuch as it seemed that the small fortune that would be required to put them into a moderate state of repair would be sufficient to purchase elsewhere a messuage in sound and habitable condition and without it had been the same the stables substantial as the house were in a like condition of neglect his horse he had found ensconced in a battered stall and feeding out of a bushel basket all the contiguous offices of less durable material than the main buildingwhich was of stone coated with some form of plasterwere lamentably dilapidated and threatening to a collapse that should be general clearly unless the sum standing to his credit should prove to be a considerable one he must give up all thought of adequately repairing the ravages of time as he sat in melancholy cogitation he heard a suppressed chuckle at the door and slewing his head about caught sight of darda standing above in the hall what do you want he said sharply she nodded at him with a fantastic gesture my curiosities she said do you wish to see them he was about to return a peevish refusal but bethought himself that with such an one a promise unfulfilled was like to prove a recurring annoyance therefore he rose resignedly and went to the door lead on said he and i will come she flitted before him looking back from time to time with a changeling coquetry that was halfrepellant halffascinating her actions all lithe and graceful were yet marked by an exaggeration that transcended the bounds of reasonable selfcontrol she led him to a narrow back stairway mounting from a sort of stone closet set in an odd corner of the north wing where meagre light entered by way of a square aperture cut in the masonry and barred with a sturdy grate of iron the spot was like a prisoncell in the black melancholy of its surroundings arid moss grew in the crevices of the stones and everywhere the viscous tracks of snails laced the walls as if in a feeble attempt to beautify what was obdurate crossing the floor the boards at a certain place gave up a booming sound as if there were a vault underneath the girl paused with a light foot on the stairway you hear it she said that is where the shadows sleep at midday but when the sun loses his hold of the white ladder he has climbed by they come out and grow and grow in joy to see him fall then all night they can fill the house for they are brave and big what is it said the baronet a vault she moved back a step and stamped with her slender foot they call it the priests hole she said perhaps they hid there and became shadows in time you may open it if you will it is too heavy for me he saw a ring in the boards and tugged at it a square of flooring yielded and came slowly up screeching like the mandrake beneath was revealed a stonelined chamber some seven feet in depth and four in width into which a weak gush of light found passage from some distant grating a dismal hidingplace in all truth where it seemed a man might perish forgotten in the racket of the times that gave it existence it was hard to find once said darda hidden and tucked away in the hollow of the wall tis said then the shadows must have been short and the world always day a weary thing for men my lass lead on he let the flap fall into place with a slam of thunder and followed the girl up the stairs these led to the servants quarter where were situated the two little sleepingplaces of dennis and his sister into her own room she flitted and bade her companion watch while she unlocked and threw open the door of a tall wooden press that stood in a recess of the chimney he lounged idly looking while she revealed her treasures and she stepped back with an expression of covert triumph on her face do you know what they are she said name them to me all he gave an involuntary exclamation of repulsion for verily it was a gruesome collection that met his gaze many old mummified skins of bird and beast with beak and claw still adhering to them yellowing teeth of cattle and skulls of smalldeer picked out of brake and warren the sloughed skin of an adder the desiccated presentment of a cat with a mouse in its jaws found behind a stove amongst them all carefully arranged a host of common pebbles selected for some distinguishing mark and even withered roots and potatoes that accident had embellished with some grotesque resemblance to twisted limbs or facessuch were the principal features of dardas museum there was yet another treasure that stood prominently forward of the rest in a place of honoura human skullno lesswith wisps of gritty hair yet clinging to the scalp and the flesh of the face withered to a corrugated substance like bark the baronet gave out a note of extreme disgust the eyeholes of the dead horror were wrinkled like a toads back and one of them was bulged with a chalky lump that gleaming through the slit looked as if the last dying terror of the soul that once inhabited had petrified it seeing his expression the girl gave an eldritch laugh and clipped it in the bud that is dennis she said listening a step came up the stairway mr tuke strode into the passage without and met the brother approaching she has been showing me those abominations he said they must be cleared out every one of them i wont have the ugly rubbish in my house you hear me he understood the man to give a little gasping nervous response and walked on fuming at the stairhead he turned again whimple had not moved and his face was drawn and white where did she pick up that filthy relic said he sternly the head sir the head of course there is no need to misapprehend me the other seemed to have some difficulty in replying more than once he cleared his husky throat and when at length he spoke it was in a strained mumbling voice she wanders far afield it was at the foot of the gallows on the downs she found it fallen and brought it home lately oh sir no it was the first year of our coming well it must be got rid of i wont have it here the words had hardly left his lips when darda sprang into the passage her eyes blazing like a maniacs it shant go she shriekedit shant it shant dennis kill him her brother closed frantically with the mad creature and sought to still her cries he looked imploringly in the midst of his struggling at his master the latter took no heed of the uproar but simply saying over his shoulder remember it is to be done as i sayturned coolly and descended the flight but the noise of the girls screaming pursued him far into the house it was an hour later when dennis begged leave to speak with him as he sat awaiting his dinner the caretaker was palpably in a state of semiprostration his face was white and his hands shook it was perhaps not to be expected that a man of sir roberts calibre should be prepossessed by an exhibition of nervousness so pitiful well he said the contempt in his heart finding some expression in his voice i wanted to ask you sirto beg you not to hold me responsible for thisthis scene the girl has ever been a wayward unaccountable body i will not be troubled with her if she is to stopand god knows why she shouldshe must learn to keep her place and to do what service she can i know sir i never guessedshe must learn to appreciate your goodness we are quite homeless but for your bounty i dont wish to be harsh but you must see my good fellow that her way of looking at things is not that of a servant towards her master no doubt these twentyodd years of caretaking have led her to assume a sort of semiproprietary attitude towards the estate i grant her that excuse and see of course that you are very much bound up in her oh i am sir that is commendable said the baronet dryly onlyyou understand i understand fully sir she shall not annoy you again i have made away withwith the things as you ordered and the skull is gone it isyes it is gone was there a shifting devil in the fellows eyes his master looked at him keenly everything about the manhis humility his gentle voice his poor physique and more beggarly resignation to a life of long inactiontold against him with the robuster individuality and after all were these qualities in a measure assumed so much of doubt and mystery had entered into the baronets days of late as to give birth in him to a gloom and suspicion that were hitherto foreign to his nature he foresaw himself with dark apprehension the lord of a bugbear estatebeset with a thousand trials and difficultiescut off from the world of his custom and ever sinking into deeper sloughs of melancholy and despondence he roused himself with an effort that very afternoon he inwardly determined he would ride into winchesterwhere was to be found his agent to whom creel had entrusted the moneys standing to his creditand satisfy himself as to his prospective position as a man of more or less substance then if all figured out well he could arrange for the purchase of furniture and hire of servants proportionate to his means at any rate he would rub shoulders with his fellowcreatures once more that perhaps was not the least that induced him to the purpose he most piously longed to shake off if only for an hour that sense of sombre isolation that had lain on him from his first coming like a dark fatality you can go he said sharply and fell to musing again his meal was served by darda if in her halfcrazed consciousness she resented with a swollen passionate heart the cruel order that had deprived her at a blow of the chief fantastic interest of her broken life she had disciplined herself already to give no sign of it no doubt her brother forced to be the instrument of a harsh despotism had appealed to her by love of himself to control the emotion that expressed could only read their ruin no doubt also the sense of bitter wrong driven down would by and by stimulate certain nerves of action that had hitherto slumbered unrecognized she moved to and fro with set lips and white face and shot no single glance in the direction of her master the womanly instinct for grace and neatness that not the most debased intellect altogether foregoes led her to give what order to the arrangement of the meal its poor accessories allowed when all was finished she went softly from the room and closed the door mr tuke did not permit a certain pity in his heart for this tender bud he had so lacerated to interfere with his appetite but his dinner over he fell as men will to a more genial view of circumstances and as he sipped his wine was inclined to regret his precipitancy of the morning yet after all he thought the monstrosities were incompatible with any forms of feminine attractiveness and she will soon learn to find her pleasure in more wholesome interests he laughed reviewing the items of the hideous collection from the gallows quoth he and a relic of twenty years standing and did she let the rest of the good gentleman lieonly plucking the head like a withered medlar from the stalk it dropped with i am made a receiver of stolen property by gadherodias to some bloody cutpurse what a drearyminded wench and what a pretty the sweet old wine flushed his brain with a glamour of roses he was inclined to take a more humorous view of his state and position no doubt withheld for the time being from considerations of worldliness he felt that relapse from reclaimed barbarism which coming to us all in certain moods and before certain aspects of nature restores us momentarily to the primitive joy in life untamed and unmalignant that is our proper heritage after all it is not for the trimmed parterres of existence to yield those glad surprises that are the basis of our yearning to the immortal who ever wandering in an ordered garden lost himself in a luminous mist of paganism here the infinite possibilities of nature were before himthe search for her glimmering and elusive shrine in an endless variety of thickets he would slough the skin of conventions and plunging naked into the green glooms of enchantment pursue the way from which only is hedged off by leafiness the menacing face of death more than this workthe work that should be in touch with that of the great mother adapting her harmonies imitating her linesappealed to him with sudden force so that he was to find a purpose in living that he had never guessed at hitherto he was fascinatedabsorbed in a dream of sun and woodlands and the mossy sparkle of innocent springs as the spirit of the wine evaporated however that hideous token of a felons fate would slip into his thoughts with a recurring persistency that this was so first angered then depressed him he was not a particularly squeamish individual and certainly his rough times were not favourable to sensitiveness in so common a respect still he could not drive the sordid keepsake from his reflections curse the jade he muttered wasnt the place lonely and dismal enough without that acute accent on its ghostliness he laboured out a sigh well at any rate he breathed its got rid of now as he spoke his glance wandered to the long latticed window a casement of which stood open and there upon the sill a black blotch in the sunlight lay the grinning horror itself chapter viii for some seconds the diner sat too astounded for speech or action that either of his dependents should have dared to thus defy him at length he rose and took a step or two towards the window it was no trick of his fancy there lay the abomination its dry dead hair stirring in the draught its stuft lid winking a dirty white as if it cocked an eye at him in a hideous merriment he strode to the door and thundered for his henchman the latter came immediately apprehensive already and doubly so when he marked the others face you see that said his master in a voice whose quiet was more appalling than any outburst of fury whimples very lips went ghastly he tried to answer and broke down at the first syllable i dont accuse you of putting it there now tell mewhy didnt you get rid of it as you undertook to do he made out the man to say that he hadthat he had removed it to his own room intending later to find some means of disposing of it in the midst of his stammering explanations darda came softly into the hall her brother seized her arm with a shaking hand how could you he muttered how could you do a thing so stupid and wickedand you have ruined us she followed the direction of his wild eyes and her own opened round in wonder i didnt put it there she said does he say i did it is a lie he whispered hush in a fearful voice but his master broke in at once no matter who did it one of you has thought fit to make a mock of me and you must both pay the penalty the girl laughed scornfully you only wanted a pretext she said to get rid of us i thought you would sooner or later perhaps you put it there yourself her voice was rising to bitterer significance when she heard a sound at her side and turning made a frantic clutch at her brother as he slid to the floor his head came with a little thwack on the boards and there he lay with clinched teeth and a face like a stone thenoh oh she wailed and threw herself down beside him mr tuke was very embarrassed and a little shocked he took no resentment over the girls spirit though he still firmly believed she lied about the skull but after all it was patently unjust to hold the man responsible for the cantrips of so unmanageable a charge he seized a jug of water herepour some of this over him he said hes fainted like a woman she looked up at him with fierce eyes but she took the jug nevertheless hes a better man than you she cried he can suffer and endure and fight too when theres need she was human enough in her fearless championship of her own flesh and blood the gentleman laughed uneasily and feeling himself under the circumstances a little de trop left the hall with a certain consciousness of shame tingling in his heels outside he thought did she get the better of me if this sort of thing goes on i shall lose the sense of how to be master in my house stung by the thought he threw open the door once more and looked in hell come round in a minute he said hardly listen to me i shall sleep out tonight you can he broke off suddenly paused a moment in indecisionthen tiptoed gently away the girls face had been drowned in tears as she bent over her brother he passed to the neglected stables and was fain to saddle his own horse and lead him forth and mount in the weedchoked yard he rode down by way of the long slumberous drive its whole course was matted with woodland moss smooth as green felt and thereon the beeches staking their aftermath of glory flung golden counters softly as if on a cardtable at the halfruined lodge he paused and dwelt upon its desolation curiously ivy like a cluster of swarming snakes held the writhed chimneys in a deathgrip and had fractured the spine of the gabled roof the ribs of the structure showed through gaping rents like those in a stranded ship not a melancholy windowplace but gaped a black mouth full of broken splints of teeth and dead sticks of sashes the whole building seemed sunk into the moss and leafiness that engirdled it he went out through the iron gate and spurred along the road that was yet unfamiliar to him the air was at once soft and keen as the taste of olives and as such stimulated his new appetite for nature life seems never so desirable as in typical days of autumn when the year rallies of its disease and makes a brave effort to renew its thoughtless morning with a few withering leaves of all the motley months none is so pathetic as october in its likeness to an aging lady striving to salve by gentleness the unhealed wounds inflicted of her earlier pugnacity mr tukes spirits rose as he advanced he seemed already in touch with the world againa butterfly of the second brood emerged from a buried larva he met a few clowns and acknowledged their salutations brightly his voice rose and cracked in snatches of romantic song and he greeted with pleasure whatever landmarks he remembered of these the dog and duck stood as unchanged as any tree or hillock for on the windowsill of the tap the same figure lounged and smoked the rider got a better view of the fellow as he stood broadly in the sunlight he was built sturdily with something of an air of the sea about him and his coat was bedecked with trinketry of faded gold like an old galleyfoist but his face red as brick and patched with eyebrows like tags of wild clematisdown was a cutthroat one by every sinister mark as beforethe traveller pasthe swung heavily out into the road to watch his going ive an eye for you my friend murmured the baronet what do you do in this happy valley where winds and waters should be the only forces to strive with he was pondering a little all the way to stockbridge and there betty pollack came upon him with a blush and a smile like a posy of sweetbriar and drew his honour a mug of ale she knew him now by report of course and was curious with the gossips of the neighbourhood as to the history of his mysterious coming near all the years of her short life delsrop unclaimed and deserted had been lonely enchanted ground for the builders of local tradition to lay their airy bricks on is your honour for winchester she said the evenings draw in and its well to be over the downs by sunset there have been bad characters about of late betty said he will you give me a curl to put over my heart for a charm she laughed and then looked grave im not that sort she said i keep my favours for my inferiors and what am i but one well said she i think you are to talk so it was like a glimpse of an orchard through a wallwicket to tarry with her a moment but he must needs be up and onward if he wished to reach the old burgh before dark fell therefore he mounted and went his way whereby we need not pursue him for it was devoid of incident and of much emotion but weariness he slept that night at the george and the next morning sought out his agent and went deep into matters of business with him the upshot was so satisfactory that he felt justified then and there in giving considerable commissions for furniture and in arranging for the hire of such servants as were at least indispensable he dined early and had made his return journey with a heart considerably lightened and braced to content by three oclock as he came within sight of the iron gate he noticed to his surprise a horse tethered amongst the bushes off the road and still more did he marvel upon nearing it to see that it was a wellgroomed animal and a ladys by token of the sidesaddle he dismounted and leading his own beast over the turf pushed open the gate and stood still to reconnoitre no sign of the owner of the horse was thereno sound of voice or footstep in the green glooms beyond uncertain what to do he remained a moment looking this way and that when suddenly there broke upon his ear a shrill scream of terror it seemed to issue not twenty paces away from the direction of the ruined lodge he dropped the reins and sprang forward here he shouted what is it where are you crying frenzied words came back to hima womans voice but inarticulate guided by it however he ran round by way of a little tangled garden that brought him to the rear of the low building nothing was to be seen but here the voice appealed to him in agony from out the very ground he fell upon his knees by a sunk heap of rubbishsaw in a moment and snapped vigorously at two gloved hands that wavered up at him from a ruin of weeds and broken earth as he held on frantically hauling with his jaw set square the matted ground shook and crumbled under his feet he saw what was happening and throwing himself back with a mighty effort of resolution drew slowly from the bowels of the earth as it were the collapsed and almost senseless form of a young woman then scarcely might he stagger with her to a place of security when a rent opened in the spot whence he had struggled and a great pad of undergrowth went down with a roar and hollow splash of water to ugly depths mr tuke laid his dainty salvage on the dbris of a bench and looked down upon it all amazed it presented the form of a girl of nineteen or twenty perhaps with a quantity of pale golden hair dragged and tumbled over her very white face and her dress and velvet spencerboth rich and fashionabletorn and stained in twenty places her eyes were closed and her gloved hands daubed with mud and roots of grass he was quite at a loss as to what to do and could only stand helplessly above her wondering who she could be and what the chance that had brought her into so perilous a position vaguely he recalled certain specifics for faintness that seemed scrawled illegibly in the commonplacebook of his mind wringing her ears or her nosehe could not remember whichsuggested itself as a remedy dimly familiar burnt feathers alsobut whether for in or external application he had no recollectionfluttered faintly in the background of his fancy now he thought he would lay her flat and now seat her upright like a limp eastern idol in the hope that the position most favourable to natures purpose would induce recovery while he was speculating in great embarrassment the young lady solved the problem for herself by opening her eyes and giving out a little tremulous sigh like the flutter of a scorched moth oh she whimpereda line of pain coming across her browwhere is my saltier it was her chain ending in a little medallion called a brviaireat that time fashionablethat she missed life devoid of this trinket was a petty possession it must have gone whither you nearly followed into a disused well said mr tuke becomingly grave he added with some humour of impertinence how a foot too light to bruise a daisy could tread so heavy a measure passes my comprehension a little flush as when a spoonful of red wine is dropped into a glass of milk came to her cheek and delicate ear i felt it going she whispered and screamed out did you save me and are you the new squire of delsrop oh sir i am ashamed she broke off abruptly and blushing a more vivid pink rose to a sitting posture and put back the hair from her face in a bewildered manner i hardly know what i say or do she said i was so frightened and i have lost my saltier my horse is somewhere outside will you help me to it you are not in a state to ride wait and rest and i will escort you whither you wish by and by no i must go now my brother will be home from cockfight and raging for his supper it was wrong of me to venture in and i have lost my saltier and nearly my life will you have search made for it in the well it is gold and the brviaire is shaped prettily like a ridicule it shall be found if possible if you must go i will ride with you no no yes indeed and whither may i squire you madam to chatters if you must tis his housemy brothers your brothers he is sir david blythewood sir you must pardon me i have only made my dbut in the neighbourhood this day or so yes i know she looked at him with a vague little smile her eyes swam as pale a blue as plumbago flowers her features were cut to a sharpish pattern but their complexion was of snow berries and the softness of youth triumphed over all angles suddenly she put her hands to her rumpled hair my hat she cried i fear it has followed the saltier we must make shift without it she rose at once and took the arm he offered the shock and the fright seemed to have confused her so that her actions and most of her speech were mechanical when he had helped her to mount and was riding beside her he had full opportunity in the intermittent silences that fell awkwardly between them to study her very dainty personality she managed her grey like one finely educated in the science of horsemanship all graces of mien and action seemed exhibited with the cultivated art that conceals art now and again he would be conscious of an inquisitive glance shot in his direction and the little confusion that followed upon discovery was skillfully expressed a long two miles they rode together by further way of the delsrop road and presently skirting a sweep of parklandin ordered contrast with mr tukes domaincame in view of a lodge and gates of the most admired substantiality here the gentleman would insist upon delivering up his charge and returning the way he had come no pretty remonstrances would avail to make him spoil the romance of the situation by so much as a yard of anticlimax i am too happy in having been the means of help said he if you are beholden to me at all a word of thanks from your brother would make me a debtor instead of a creditor she smiled back delightfully he shall come in person she said and bring you a receipt of my safe custody she laughed and waved to him and was gone up the drive he stood hat in hand until she had disappeared then he mounted and rode back with a heart full of sun and merriment indeed it was like a sail to a castaway this vision in his waste of days to know that refined civilization was within a couple of miles or so of his gates did more to reconcile him to his embowered lot than any philosophy of nature he felt friendless and isolated no longer but rather inspired to a pursuit that should make of his thickets a garden of hesperus in this mood of exaltation he reached his own door rapped on it with the butt of his ridingwhip and as it was swung open encountered the figures of whimple and his sister arrayed as if for a journey chapter ix the mans face looked fallen and hectic but he was recovered at least of his fit darda clung to his arm a frail defiant wisp of a thing her hair a quivering mist of fire in the light of the lowdown sun whither away said the baronet in surprise my horse whimple dennis put his sister gently to one side and took the bridle standing thus he turned to his master and spoke him quietly we stayed to deliver you the keys sir i have made all snug against our going and where do you wend now said mr tuke mockingly i dont know sir indeed i dont we must make shift in a barn for tonight and your belongingsyour personal effects the servant made a sad expressive gesture only our poor clothes it seemed to imply now my good fellow said the baronet a little grimly i decline you know to take the responsibility of this selfmartyrdom it is a weak attempt to put me in the wrong which is no improvement of your case i gave an order which was not carried out she gives her word sir she never put the skull there nor you nor i indeed sir hm it must be one of those remnants of mortality that provide for themselves it seems anyhow it is gone now i presume i will swear i took it away and locked it up very well then let us say no more about it do you wish to stay on i wish sir with all respect to do my duty by the place that has so long harboured us which means i am not included in the contract and that you would take service elsewhere if you could get a better the man was protesting but the other stopped him with a laugh go your ways said he i see no reason why you should love me we will make it a question of duty and abide by that throughout the little discussion darda had stood in the entrance passive and indifferent now foreseeing the upshot she turned and walked away into the gathering dusk of the house mr tuke followed jovially whistling all the evening he was in great spirits and at supper he had up a bottle of muscadine jacketed with a halfcentury growth of cobwebs and tartar and drank to the blue of a couple of eyes that were comically and a little sweetly in his thoughts he went to bed slept like innocence and woke like justice and as he lay on his morning pillow pondered the oddities of his new life one small matter exercised his mind perplexinglyhis antipathy to the man whimple whence it was born and on what cherished he found it difficult to decide the fellow was respectful obedient and so far as he knew honest yet from the first he had felt an inclination unusual to his bent to bully him and depreciate his efforts something in the manhe could not tell whatwoke suspicion in himunjustified he verily believed he would remedy this if possible would look with a broader view of toleration on the conduct of his spiritless dependent the resolve was frank and characteristic enough and he was decided to give it immediate expression but so it happened an incident of the coming day was to reawaken and confirm his deepest distrust in the unhappy caretaker all the morning he spent riding about his ragged estate exploring investigating calculating possibilities and planning improvements it was past midday when he turned his horses head homewards and then he was by a dense thicket that skirted a little long wood of lofty trees here he dismounted for it struck him that this was the fringe of the very holt he had penetrated on his first coming and he must put his conjecture to the test he tied up his horse and plunged amongst the branches and presently was rewarded by catching a glimpse through the thronging trunks of the mossy lap of the drive and the dank stones of the ruined lodge right opposite the latter but well hidden in the brush he sat himself down upon a tumbled log for he was hot and weary and the high green silence of the place smote upon his senses like a cathedral anthem far away the tap of a woodpecker rang like an elfin hammer things unseen pattered from a height upon the dead leavesmere accents on solitude the caw of a sailing rook came through the leafy canopy overhead with a weight of drowsy utterance he closed his eyes blissfullyand opened them again with a start something softfooted had entered the drive by way of the iron gatehad paused and was peering forward with a concentrated gaze he made this outcautiously shifting his body for the better viewto be a tall darkfeatured womana gipsylike creature by every tokenkeenfaced very poorly dressed presently she moved secretly a yard at a time in skirmishing advances as a mouse does suddenly she gave a little run stopped drew her ragged shawl tightly about her bosom and uttered a low exclamation of greeting to whom it was with a curious wonder that the watcher saw coming from the other direction his man whimple he the latter moved as the woman with a like air of secrecy and he had a scared look in his face too as if he were on some errand of a disturbing privacy the two met with a hasty familiarity of welcome and words passed between them these were earnest rapid vehement but mr tuke could not gather their import more than once the womans voice wavered up for an instant into a tone of scorn and indignation which was as quickly subdued then in a moment something had passed from the man to the strangersomething wrapped in an old chequered handkerchief that she received delicately and hid under her shawland they had parted and the woman had gone to the gate with a sound of sobbing mr whimple mr whimple thought mr whimples masterif there was only a little more brass in your hangdog face i could respect if i didnt encourage your tactics he saw the fellow turn and scurry away as he had come and gave an indrawn whistle deflected at the stop as men do who vent upon themselves an emotion of surprise now what is the riddle he muttered our effectless friend can find the means to a little barter on his own account it seems but where is in all the house to tempt his honesty well forewarned is forearmed and there is an end of the reaction in your favour mr dennis he left the wood by and by and made for the house lost in speculation for the present he was resolved to allude in no way to the interview he had been witness of and to alter no whit of his manner towards his servant so should he be clad in double proof who keeps secret his discovery of his enemys ambush despite the decision however he found it no light matter to give to his consideration for his dependent that air of spontaneity he had made it his task to exhibit he could hardly tell if it were his own reawakened suspicions they saw themselves reflected in the mans face butso it seemed to himthe latter was full of a covert significance of guilt and trepidation that was expressed in a certain watchfulness most difficult to ignore he was sitting having finished his dinner deep in thought when this very fellow entered to say that a man without craved the indulgence of a word with his honour a manwhat man said tuke he is a stranger to me sir did you ask his namehis business no sir go and do so blockheadhe lost his patience for a moment then recollecting himself tell him to walk in here he added more mildly in response to this amiable permission an individual whose wooden face wore the perpetual smile of an aunt sally and whose clothes smelt of stables and were mere patched horsecloths in appearance advanced to the threshold of the hall where he stood after touching his forelock with an expression on his features of the most engaging vacuity now my man said the baronet what is your business i come to enkvire master if ye has a gawdner a gardener no i have not the odditys little eyes looked anywhere but at the speaker he seemed to be joyously calculating the dimensions of the ceiling mebbe ye vants a gawdner he said roguishly maybe you want to be engaged where do you hail fromany place hereabouts not i squeer i comes fro suthamptn and what are your qualifications im joe corby what are your qualifications for the post i say alls one for that im a gawdner squeer do you know a cabbage from a rose aye and a spade from a stallion mr tuke scanned the fellow in silence for a moment and a barrow from a rakehell i suppose said he quietly you are too accomplished for me whimple show this person off the premises meaning im to go said the man in a sort of genial surprise certainly whimple lookee here master said the intruder hesitating and apparently embarrassed ill ventur to speak gawds truth with your honours kind indulgence im a jackotrades i ama handy man ye might call me and tough as a dawg in bout or brawl you live lonely says i to myselfthe gent lives lonely and there be reskel characters about in every lonely byway he might find me useful

i know a thing or two them shutters nowhow be they fastened actually as he spoke he was stepping into the room smile and all with the apparent intention of setting his mind at rest on the subject however the gentleman jumped up and barred his way what cried the latter take yourself off fellowyou arent wanted here the man stopped scratched his head with a laughable expression of chagrin and retreated muttering no offence master no offence said he and either a very comical or a very wicked light glinted in his little eyes as he retired dennis escorted him without and the voices of the two in low converse came to mr tuke where he stood he rattled on the window angrily and the man slouched off going in the direction of the drive now the oddness of this apparition and of the interview it had brought about was filling the baronet with a sense of uneasiness there had been that in the fellow that had seemed to belie his assumption of stupidity and after a moments thought tuke left the hall quitted the house by a back door and started rapidly upon a private dtour that should bring him upon the drive at a point near to the ruined lodge he wished to satisfy himself as to two little matterswhether or no the man had confederates in waiting at the gate and whether or no he would make his exit in proper course he sped so energetically that when at last he struck the thickets at the back of the lodge and moving cautiously peered through the trees he found that he had fairly outrun his quarry and must await its coming for this purpose no better ambush could offer than the deserted cottage itself stepping warily he moved round by way of the garden he had entered once before and passed with a little thrill that torn patch in the tangle that remained an intimate mark in his memory it was with a tickle of nervousness that as he went by he paused an instant and looking down caught sight of a glint of slimy wall on which the very canker of death seemed to lie in an oily scab at the back of the lodge stood a crazy porch of rustic woodwork and therefrom a door lolling on broken hinges gave access to the interior of the building there was a gap here sufficient for the entrance of a man and he went through it swiftly and along a stonepaved passage beyond that was dumb with dust and littered with flaked rags of plaster and crackling wallpaper so he made his way to a front room that looked upon the drive and here he paused with a certain measure of astonishment for on some mouldering shelves that spanned a recess by the chimney lay in orderly arrangement of ugliness dardas banished museum of curiosities soho he breathed this is how the law is evaded he nodded to himself with set lips and moved to the window in the moment of his doing so a low crooning voice broke upon his ears and the fantastic figure of the girl herself came out from amongst the trees opposite and stood in a shaft of sunlight that broke from above into that luminous well of leafiness she smiled and sang making a harmony of weird discords and throwing her head back with her hands beneath it received the touch of the sun upon her mouth and seemed to return it with a fond little sound of kissing she was so near to him that he could see the pulse in her throat fluttering like a birds as she murmured her strange musiccould note every movement of the spirit that rose from her heart to her lips suddenly she was silent and gazing before her dropped an odd little curtsey and stood still mr joseph corby had it appeared come down the drive and was slouching into view he stopped before the girl yet not it seemed as one who was altogether unacquainted with her or ignorant of her reputation for he stood at gaze with some expression of hilarity but none of wonder upon his face thats right missy he said drink the sun like the new wine it is for a merry maid its yaller for youth as is cowslips and buttercupses and pretty gildilocks but give me the old red of oporto for a seasoned skin and a ships bucket of it to drink against bedtime darda laughed shrilly you could swallow a lake of it i expect said she like the troll in the fairy tale thats it he said a lake of wine he came quite close to the girl and advanced his red face so that his injected eyes looked full into hers a lake of wine he repeated have you ever heard tell of one she shook her head smiling come now said the manand the watcher saw his jovial face suddenly assume a very evil and menacing look have you ever heard of one i say youd better answer again she shook her head you must know you know said the fellow his eyes staring and his mouth creasing at the corners you aint a lively sucker o the old stem and growed up here all these years not to have heard on it what is it i say whats become o the lake of wine he gripped her wrist as he spoke she uttered a little shriek of pain and angernot of fearand sprang back from him she even made a feint of aiming a blow at him with her soft fist you dare to touch me she cried my nails are like thorns aye and sos your mind muttered the man he looked at her in savage gloom a moment then his broad face cleared and he grinned in a conciliatory manner come missy he said with an upward jerk of his chin well be good friends i can see i not expeerunce spurit in a gal without knowing how to admire it of course if youre set on havin a secret from old joe joes not the man to appint to find it out his wits a rumfusticus sort o target to put up agen your bright arrers i only axed out o curiosityhas you ever heard tell of a lake of wineand no says you the girl was silent you never did now did you said the man his face all one bunch of geniality she nodded and laughed in an elfin manner perhaps i did she said what then he breathed out a great grunt of satisfaction i thought so said he well whats become on it she was laughing again when denniss voice came from a distance calling her at the sound she sprang forward immediately evaded mr corby who had made a clutch at her and was sped out of sight up the drive before he could collect his faculties missy he had called as she ran from him you and me must meet agen and have a long talk missy mums the word but she had given no sign of hearing him left by himself the fellow plunged into a ruminative mood spat thoughtfully upon the ground and then all of a sudden made rapidly for the gate and vanished up the road chapter x mr tuke and his man were employed upon a very profitless and monotonous task the onethe firstwas engaged in drawing stagnant water from a well in a bucket the other received and toiled away with each vesselfull in succession and flung it broadcast about the garden they had cleared from the wellrim the torn earth and rubbish that encumbered it a flap of wood had originally protected the mouth of the hole but the slobbering tooth of time had chewed this to the veriest pulp upheld only by the clutch of the grass roots that had spread over and beyond it and it had become the merest question of accident as to whose foot should first break into the pitfall despite the unchancy look of the place measurement with a plumb revealed the fact that not so much as four feet of dead water lay at the bottom of the inky funnel and this four feet mr tuke had set himself patiently to withdraw in fulfilment of a certain promise made to a couple of rather colourless beaux yeux now for an hour had the two been regularly dipping and spilling in the remote hope of finding a gold chain and brviaire curled snugly in the pail after some particular haul but it seemed a forlorn and fruitless search if the gewgaw had in truth slipped in it was for a certainty imbedded in the silt and slime at the bottom fatigue was telling a little upon the loose physique of the servant his cheeks were hot and his breath laboured but the master worked on vigorous and preoccupied and gave little thought to the others condition indeed his want of consideration could plead the excuse that he had much present matter to meditate and digest he had inherited it seemed the lonely lordship of many mysteries and to the devils captured attorneys he could have thought had been committed the task of drawing up his new lease of life so teeming was it with uninterpretable perplexities after the most admired human models once or twice he spoke to his servant in a stern even voice that was really little of an invitation to confidence whimple he had said had you any previous knowledge of the fellow who called yesterday i have seen him about sir had he ever spoken to you before he hadhe may have once or twice it was always an aggravation that this man could never it appeared give a direct answer what do you mean by may have has he or has he not he has sir on what matters i dont know sirof no importancei really couldnt tell mr tuke glanced up angrily you part with every word as if it were a tooth now mind he said sharplyyoull give him a wide berth for the future ill not have anything concerning me discussed between youconcerning me or my house or whatsoever connected with the estate once again as the man took the bucket from him he had looked into his face and said so your removal of the abominations belonging to your sister was an evasion after all whimple gave a gasp and dropped his eyes sir he muttered piteouslyi thought you would never know or knowing never mind shesheit would break her heart to part with them altogether they are abominations to you and me you can leave yourself out of the question fellow i dont concern myself with the quality of your emotions the other twined his nervous fingers together over the bucket handle suddenly he spoke up with a flushed face if they are to go sir i would rather take the girl with all her cranks and fancies and do my best to seek a living elsewhere the baronet looked hard at the poor baited creature am i losing touch of humanity in face of a little botheration he thought then he added aloud with a spirit of scorn words words but you would force me again into being the agent of your selfmartyrdom it wont do my friend the lodge may serve as museum until it is pulled down i see at least that the most disgusting item of the collection has vanished the skull sir yes it is gone they laboured at their task once more and once more mr tuke fell into profound musing over the perplexities of his later lot in this connection were two matters for worrying considerationtwo flails that beat up the dust of his mind in the absence of any sound grain of evidence of these the first was a certain hyperbolic expression used and reiterated by yesterdays roguea preposterous inquiry that had yet seemed instinct with a subtle undermeaning and so weighted had sung and buzzed ever since in the eavesdroppers brain the lake of wine the term had been surely employed to cover or suggest a tangible fact its persistent repetition by mr joe corby precluded the idea that it was merely an accidental fancy played upon for the girls behoof then what was its interpretationto what did it allude beyond the surmise that it must refer to something concealed upon or connected with his bugbear property it was obviously impracticable for him to reach so rebounding from a blank wall of speculation he would stumble against his second trouble this in its essence was nothing but a fear or the shadow of one it amounted to sounds about the house of a nightsounds indistinctly acknowledged by a consciousness on the borderland of slumber and acute to nice impressions of the senses he could recall them thundering on the drum of his visionary ear and could remember starting up wildly awake to be aware of nothing in all the atmosphere of his room but a ticking silence still the feeling would remain that something had been moving creeping breathing in his neighbourhood only a moment earlier and more than once he had risen with a wet forehead to satisfy himself that he had been merely dreaming this recurrent uneasiness he had experienced on every night but the first of his inhabitance of the room and it was beginning to thread his being with a little strand of nervousness oddly he felt himself in some telepathic way to be the centre of a nebulous mystery without having the remotest idea as to what was its nature but his present lot was so strange his position so isolated that even as a fearless man he felt he was justified in adopting some nice precautions against the possibility of midnight surprises now it occurred to him that upon that single night only of his arrival had he enjoyed immunity from this shadowy sense of unseen company in his room and he could not fail to remember that upon that occasion alone had the shutters of the broad window been closed and fastened ever since by his own order had they remained open moreover as was his custom he slept with a lattice flung wide to the inpour of fresh cold air certainly to assume that any midnight visitor could have taken advantage of this so far as to enter by way of ladder or creeper and prowl about his chamber without immediately awakening him seemed a ridiculous supposition yet as a wise man it would perhaps be as well for the future to obviate by closing the shutters the necessity of suffering an apprehension so farfetched whimple said he as the man brought the bucket wearily back to the wellsidewhy when i first came did you so protest against my flinging open the shutters of my bedroom the servant hesitated then stammered ii thought it wisest sir thethe house is lonely and the neighbourhood harbours some rogues i fear such as him you are on speaking terms with well i have altered my mind for the future close themyou understand for the life of him he could not treat the man with even an assumption of confidence he would have thought the revocation of his order received with unmistakable relief had he not been so steeped in suspicion of all things he was bending to his work again when a voice hailing him from over the garden hedge made him start and turn round hi are you squire tuke at your service said he and went forward a little man seated on a great horse was there in the drivea pert cocksparrow knowinglyattired and bristling with pride of raiment he had a comical small face very pale and his hat was of the lastapproved shade of grey with a broad ribbon of black and a broader buckle about it he looked a mere handydandy snip though he had in fact at that time come of age some five years but his whimsical selfsufficiency not the fly on the bulls horn could have outdone he raised his hat in a very courtly manner as the other approached i have to apologize he said for this unceremonious greetin his voice was high and restive as if it were not yet quite broken in by no means said mr tuke you are sir david blythewood i presume the manling had by this time dismounted he reached a hand over the hedgea little gloved paw small as a girlsand offered it in grasp to the gentleman i ask the honour of your acquaintance said he my sister owes her life to you i hear twas an admirable rescue and more than her deserts he grinned all over his little face she was pryin mr tukeshe was pryin she didnt let that cat out of the bag ill warrant ever since your comin shed been eatin her heart out to get a glimpse of the lord of wastelands as they call you indeed i am happy to interest miss blythewood she suffers no hurt from her mishap i hope rest you rest you the hurts to her vanity by gad twas rich for her to make her bow wrong end up shes miss roystonmy halfsister and a devilish responsible legacy by the token she keeps house for me i say youll let us be acquainted dyou breed from your own gameeggs theres a pit at stockbridge kept by old pollack of the inn ive a duckwing cockerel march sittin would torment yehackles as gold as his mettle come yule ill back him fifty pounds a side against the bloodiest rooster you can show so he ran on his nave selfimportance halfnullified by the frankness of his boyish confidence was like a gush of sweet air through the enwrapping gloom of the others surroundings well see said mr tuke with a smilewell see at present as you may observe ive my work cut out here for months sir david craned his neck over the hedge its a wilderness good truth said he is that whimple hes a spinebroke artichoke he is with a worm at his root whats he doin there sure thats the hole that angel near sunk into you aint neverwhy you aint never dippin for that chain of hers we are though the youngling turned to him with a grin and a titter its a shame by cock said he i ought to have sent a message but clean forgot you may save yourself the trouble she had left it at home all the time mr tuke all considered received this belated information very handsomely then i have laboured like jacob said he but my second term is yet to serve sir david chuckled rachel was a prodigious coquette he said well mr tuke im forgettin my manners keepin you talkin here no no come to the house he was reluctant to part with the bright little dandy but the latter was already in the saddle cant he chirped ive an appointment at four and angel ll be faintin to hear tell of every word youve spoke i sayill draw the bow on that jacob you must come over to my place and lets be friends the lord of wastelands walked with him to the gate and bid him a cheery goodspeed as he cantered away he was dipping out of sight when a long man with a rod over his shoulder came past up the road and leered sourly as he went by at the baronet come thought the gentleman ive seen you once before what do you fish for in these dry beds my friend he waited until the man had vanished over the hill the latter had looked back once on his way and seeing himself observed had gone forward with no further token of inquisitiveness mr tuke returned to his house in a pleasantly preoccupied frame of mind he was both cheered and amused over the meeting with his lively neighbour and promised himself a substantial dividend of fun out of that investment in the others friendship he called to whimple as he passed that he should need him no longer and so went by to his front door and on the threshold met darda at once some impulse of the moment drove him to look full in her face and to say what is the lake of wine the girl backed from him and stared a breathless instant with round eyes of wonder then she gave a small soft laugh and twining her fingers together set her lips chilly like frosted rosebuds shrunk from opening to a northeaster darda he said will you not tell me i think you dont know what is the lake of wine or where it is i knowi know she cried suddenlybut what have you done that i should tell youand with a changeling screech she sprang past him and vanished up the drive chapter xi a man to see you sir his name tis richard breeds sir of the dog and duck breeds the landlord sir what does he want for answer dennis wriggled his shoulders with a scared look you dont know of course tell him to wait me in the hall a few minutes later mr tuke descended the stairs and happening to be in slippered feet walked without sound in search of his visitor whom curiously he came upon comprehensively examining the fastenings of the oaken shutters his bullethead bent low at a cough the man started erect and gasping with embarrassment ducked an awkward bow to the master of the house they are of good tough wroughtiron said the latter grimly so i see sir i was takin a hint for my own little place with all respect im lonely situated too he lied of course with scarcely professional ease he was a short fleshy man with an unwholesome damp skin like veal and rumbuds over his face in patches as if he were stricken with a plaguewhich indeed he was of a bibulous order his manner was very nervous and selfdepreciatory and the only accent of character that marked his tumid physiognomy was in the expression of his ratty and restless little eyes mr tuke took his measure during a moment of silence that was obviously disconcerting to him now sir said the first at length what is your business i called your honour to axe if i could supply your honour with liquor milk eggs and garden produce i keep the dog and duck on the stockbridge road and maybe i thought twould be handier to your honour and more reasonablelike to deal at a halfway house that depends i leave these matters to my servant who does his catering i believe in the village i know your house of call and have marked one or two of the visitors you entertain maybe sir maybe its not my business now is it to put every gentleman as demands a measure of ale through his catechism that seems an odd answer did i make any reflections scarcely i think the law takes means to deal with rogues without consulting the prejudices of landlords the visitor looked very ill at ease clearly the conversation had taken a turn entirely unexpected by him your honours perfectly right he said pressing his damp hands together yet the law gives us no licence to refuse a customer for the reason we dont like his looks eliciting no responseim a peaceable man he went on with some anguish of protest give me bowl and pipe and a snug inglecorner and fortin may set her cap at me and die a old maid despite but aint it hard sirnow aint it hard that im to be coloured with the reputation of them as takes shelter under my roof and find my character in question for the mere contact you enlarge greatly upon a hint said mr tuke i understand then that you have unwelcome guests to entertain mr breeds winced almost imperceptibly but his eyes took a glint of cunning i dont say that said he i speak on general premises as they calls em and on behalf o the fraternity mr branderhim you may a seenis to my knowledge a scholard and an angler which is not by your honours favour indictable offencesno not either of em assuredly and that other gentleman with the beetroot face and venerable white hair the landlord sucked his lips together in an absurd affectation of perplexity oh him he cried suddenly and jovially thats mr fern that isa traveller from abroad come on a tower through the old country then in the same breath he went on deprecatingly with a ludicrous decline of spirit its all force the favour and take the blame with us sir im a peaceable soul that loves a pot and circumstances conspire to upset me mr tuke looked at the man keenly somehow the latter seemed in travail with that he could not or would not give expression to his hands shook and beads of leaden perspiration stood on his forehead by and by he glanced stealthily at the other and went flaccid to see himself under scrutiny mr tukeyour honour said he in a hoarse vibrative voice i werent never fitted to be a landlordthats the solemn truth a man as keeps a inn stands balanced between his custom and his conscience and then comes an extry pot and bowls him off of his legs give me your word to compensate me agen the loss and ill shut up the dog and duck tomorrow and set the place afire he said it in a tentative apologetic way and was quite ready to join in the others cackle of merriment over the suggestion no no my friend said mr tuke ive plenty on my conscience without the guardianship of a scrupulous innkeeper then he added sternly youve said much or little but enough dree your pothouse weird my friend and take the consequences if you knowingly harbour lawbreakers weve talked round the subject and now you can hardly expect me upon my soul to fall in with your offer of a halfway market very well sir said the landlord chapfallen and bear in mind mr breeds said the other that to be caught examining a householders shutters is scarcely a recommendation to his favour he saw the fellow off the premisesmarked his going till he was well out of sight then returned to the hall and pondered the interview this seemed to him as regarded the visitors share in it a confirmation of his suspicions that there was a certain mystery toward which he was the indefinite subject and centre moreit convinced him that if mischief of any sort was somewhere in process of incubation the tavern of which mr breeds was landlord was the place most likely to contain the egg now as a man who had once already taken his own life in hand he was not greatly sensitive to alarms that might have unnerved persons of a more precise conduct indeed in the tasteless monotony of his present days he would have welcomed perhaps the necessity of some vigorous action justly undertaken on his own behalf but it was this blind search for a clue to the intangiblethis turning round and round in a vain effort to grasp a chimera that at first worried and depressed him if he could only have received certain confirmation of his surmises that some rascal intrigue was afoot if in all his little world there had been a single soul he could trust and depend upon his course would have been easier as it was how did the case stand a very desert loneliness had begotten in him already a distrust of his neighbours of whom undoubtedly were a few of shady visage and equipment but here surely every alehouse had its personnel of loafers and idle rogues and it seemed monstrous to assume that in broad day within call as it were of a considerable village a plotof which a private gentleman making out life meagrely in a near empty house was the objectcould be hatching at his very door that was so yet his reckoning must include those two enigmatical visitors the professed end of each of which was far from being he felt positive its real one and must include mr joseph corbys pregnant allusionsto the crazed girlto some unknown quantity with a fanciful title considering all this from each and every aspect he did so work himself up to a state of savage irritation over the intolerable strain it entailed upon a mind prone to preoccupation in less morbid matters that he must have in the unfortunate whimple and ease upon him his burden of annoyance tell me said he do you know anything of this man breeds by reputation i knowyes sir i have heard of him oh for heavens sake man give a straightforward answer for once i ask you what is his reputation indeed sir it is none of the best though i have heard nought immediately to his discredit again and again isnt it a mere slander to impute evil and back from specifying it what is he charged with nothing but that his house is the resort of topers and padding gentry and is it on that account you make a sealed coffin of delsrop o nights and would have me suffocate in my bedroom the servant showed a distressed hesitation is it i say persisted his master yes sirindeedthat isoh sir tis an old habit with me the house is isolateddark it lies in the shadowmy god in what a shadow mr tuke stared in positive amazement was the fellow crazed like his sister a pretty thing if he should discover himself the keeper of a private lunatic asylum control your emotions he said coolly whimples lips were trembling the man had permitted himself an outburst of which for hours he would feel the effects i would ask you said mr tuke with an irrepressible little sneerif the question is unexcitingwhen did the present owner of the dog and duck come into possession twas last martinmas sir the tavern then had been long to let twas last martinmas and whence did he come do you know no sir i dont know now mr whimple i want to ask you another question have you any reason to understand what is implied by the lake of wine if he had accused the man of murder the latter could not have gone a more ghastly white or have more by his expression associated himself with that he disowned he even staggered a little where he stood and it was painful to witness his sick effort at selfcontrol none whatever echoed mr tuke closely scrutinizing the servants face and interpreting the tortured answer from the motion of his lips your reply he went on biting as acid is convincing of course why should you know i dont myself and i am as much interested in the matter as you maybe i only asked because i seek the clue to a mystery that vents itself in strange visits and secret interviews and unaccountable sounds at night then too there is a footprint on the flowerbed under the hallwindow this morning but what of that when i have a caretaker so zealous and so scrupulous only i take some amusement out of puzzles but i am impatient and very apt at the last to cut a knot that bothers me with a bullet you can go he had to repeat his permission before the servant seemed to understand and to gather the nerve to retreat but the moment he was vanished the baronet clapped his hand on the table with an oath the fellow is in the league against me whatever it is he cried in inward fierceness and his soul rejoiced that at last it had some tangible justification for its innate antipathy to the man it was patent that this lake of wine was the clue to the riddle and the password of the conspirators but with the last how deeply was the caretaker involved and to what extent was he to be depended on in the performance of his nightly services probably his officiousness in that respect was employed as a blind not probably was his habitual nervousness assumed in greatest likelihood he was in weak process of corruptionone hand held to his duty the other to his interest and if this were so no doubt was as to which way his constitutional depravity would eventually decide him to incline then would it be wise to here and now give him short shrift of notice and so rid the house of an incubus and an embarrassment scarcely for so should herobert tukenot only advertise himself in apprehension of his surroundings whereby his enemies might be tempted to a bolder policy but he should drive from his camp an informer whose uses so long as he assumed himself undetected must all be for his intended victim no the fellow must stay for the present and be treated with a show of consideration too else would mistrust awakened in him greatly complicate the situation it was a maddening hotchpotch of confusion the more so as all this fabric of suspicion being builded on conjecture might at any moment resolve itself into thin air chapter xii mr tuke was arrayed resplendent cappie his personal baggage had reached him from london and he felt human in the sense of the beast of civilization once more if his household was as yet unenlarged and his halls filled with little but echoes he had at least a retiring chamber worthy of the most exquisite refinements of a georgian toilet it was four oclock of a sunny afternoon as he descended the stairs pulling on his gloves for he was for a little party at chatters to meet a neighbour or so and whimple held his horse at the door taking him altogether he was a handsome and amiablelooking gentleman and manly withal nor did his subscription to the dandyism of the day exhibit exaggeration or tastelessness it is true his hair now surmounted by the highcrowned beaver hat of the period was craped as the fashionbooks would say over his forehead and liberally anointed with some lustrous oil but cleanliness in this respect would have then been considered the merest affectation of eccentricity for the rest his long ridingcoat of many capes concealed a toilet of cloth and silk and plaited lawn that in its mode and finish bespoke the highest traditions of metropolitan elegance so at any rate thought betty pollack who was standing in the porch waiting to have a word with his honour betty had driven over with her grandfather in an old taxedcart which was now drawn up at the broad end of the drive she curtsied like a daffodil to the sun and mr tuke nodded brightly to her as he buttoned the last ray of his glories into his coat on what errand my girl said he with a humble message from grandfather your honour she answeredthat theres a battleroyal in his cockpit saturday forenoon and will your honour condescend to take a seat i dont know what would you have me do betty sure your honours the best judge cocks will be cocks i suppose but tis a cruel business to set natural enemies to the scratch think i and id rather have them in broth with their necks wrung when alls said and done then i wont come oh but save us thats only a womans view it flies with all the force of beauty behind it my dear the girl shrunk back a little then i was to ask you she said in a more strained voice if you would favor us with your custom in the matter of poultry and butter and garden stuff the gentleman laughed why ive turned away one with the same offer already cried he then seeing her fall back timid as if at a rebuff could you undertake to supply em very fresh he said with mock gravity oh rest your honour she said eagerly we could drive over every day if needs were say twice a week betty and if you lack garden stuff why come none the less and ill take a fruitful pleasure of your visits he caught his stirrup and mounted and was gone with a smiling nod to the girl at the entrance to the drive the old man saluted him respectfully he pulled up and was about to exchange a word with the gaffer when he remembered his deafness and made as if to proceed on his way but grandfather pollack leaned out of his cart and beckoned him thats a fullblooded girl he said in a hoarse whisper a sweet neat filly i calls her mr tuke feeling the uselessness of speech nodded after a reserved manner that girl said the old man with a small experimental leer of confidence would serve a gentleman well for her beauty and her lovingness he tapped the sleeve of the others ridingcoat im poor sir im poor and failin what a chance if i had a piece o goods that costly as to be worth a little annuity to me he received a grunt and scowl of indignation for answer but it was doubtful if he read their significance mr tuke shook off the old clawing touch and rode on he did not however put a short period to the evil by forbidding the ancient rascal then and there his presence which of us has the courage to strike at the snake of temptation on the first protrusion of his head from the ground we want to circumvent him with that truly human habit of temporizing that so often ends by our getting entangled in the toils now he was righteously incensed yet as he rode away under the yellowing trees his thoughts ran warm on the ardent beauty of melancholy that characterized the face of all things about him and gradually his mood fell from indignation to a tenderness that was almost a passion miss angela royston received her preserver very prettily and thanked him with an exaggerated effusiveness which was the more embarrassing inasmuch as the company to whom the ultimate revelation of what he had done seemed to present itself as a rather tame anticlimax had already treated his advent but this was by way of provincial gaucherie as if it were an intrusion the party was of the nature of a kettledrum it appeared with supper to follow and genteel games the young baronet was not yet in evidence being ridden to some kennels across country and late in returning but there were two or three squireens who obviously desired the moral support of his presence and lacking it had so strenuously beaten about in the waste lands of their brains for ideas as to have grown as apoplectic and nearly as expressionless as tomatoes a notable member of the company was the honourable mrs tatty whose turban was so immense as to give her the perpetual appearance of tilting up her nose to keep it from falling off and whose observations invariably drew rein on the brink or pitedge of profundity where when one expected much they sat down abruptly and refused as it were to yield their further confidences to strangers this lady was accompanied by a quizzical little person a cousin from london who was of the order of those who curry favour with their present by laughing at their late company and a saturnine gentleman addressed as captain luvainewho said little and said that as if he grudged itcompleted the party to all was mr tuke presentedgenerally as a neighbour of a romantic cast and it needed much of his acquired urbanity and deftness in society to carry off the situation without a show of selfconsciousness we call you the lord of wastelands said miss royston with a little smiling blush as if she offered him the fruit of her invention certainly she looked a very dainty body and she bore her daintiness as if it were a burden she loved her fair hair combed over her forehead and falling in ringlets on her neck was banded with a fillet of gold like a sunbeam her robe was of pure white satin clasped at one shoulder with a diamond button and in her hand she flirted a little sparkling fan no bigger than a pheasants wing and much its colour naturally in the presence of this radiant bird of his feather mr tuke lost mental sight and consideration of homely betty waste lands they may be said he gaily but consecrated to beauty since you visited them it was a laying on of lands not hands she cried merrily in response i brought away a rare impression of their picturesquenessbut twas on my gown and then the fine creature must give the company the history of her introduction to the squire of romance whom she looked at very tenderly as she eulogized him a remarkable situation said mrs tatty scenting the neighbourhood of the pit with uplifted nostrils mr richardson himself never imagined a more pronounced sure there is an affinity in circumstanceand therein lies the explanation it was like poor julias experience said the little cousin from london only that julia was trop embarrasse de sa personne to extricate herself with grace oh cried angela i blush to hear you talk of grace twas after meat my dear said mrs tatty with a splendid benevolence of humour and immediately sat down morally on the brink mr tuke laboriously strained at a camel of wit before before he criedfor twas the grace that introduced food for reflection am i that cried miss royston then i must be anglique glace but my poor brviaire that i cried to have lost had i had that charm with me no accident would have befallen but fifty others failed to save you said the baronet with a low bow and it must be admitted considerable gallantry for his back was yet stiff with dipping for the abominable trinket and at this point sir david entered the room his sister ran at him and scolded him with twenty little tricks of endearment sure sir she cried this is pretty behaviour to your guestsand she came forward on his arm mutely daring slander to deny perfection to so beautiful a couple the little gentleman was charmed to meet his new neighbour and said so with amazing condescension he was very daintily attired and prodigal of selfimportant courtesy to all i passed your fellow he said hobnobbin with a gipsy hag i know the witch by sight he caught me up later and we fell atalkin weve been neighbours you know ever since i can remember theres no beastleech like him in all the county indeed said mr tuke dryly youd not think it eh its truth sir why said the baronet i dont spose the fellows ever fired a fowlingpiece in his life but he knows more of the habits of animals ground and winged than any dozen sportsmen in the parish aint that so charlie thats so by gad davy said the squireen addressed greatly stimulated and emboldened by the presence of his host he cured my bitch daisy of a capped hock said another and then looked as if he wished he hadnt spoken they are all jackpuddings to showman davy whispered miss angela looking up at her cavalier with a waggish twinkle come cried the master of chatters whos for a game lets have pinch without laughin the squireens boisterously assented but miss royston and the cousin from london cried no no feeling their little powdered noses in jeopardy so they played hot cockles and jacks alive and shadow buff and enjoyed themselves after the lighthearted manner of the period the problems of which were indeed mostly exercised in merriment when they settled down at last flushed and dishevelled mr tuke looked in the face of a certain lady with whom he sat in a corner and was aware of his pulses drumming a little thickly i think i have lived an empty life for long he said and now i have learned to know myself she twinkled up at him archly does the knowledge repay the study said she cruel he answered ah if you only guessed my tutor but i cannot think madam what eloquent teachers are your eyes indeed they have pupils sir oh the heavenly pedagogues their irises paint one the colour of hope it is blue i vow like the rose that lives in mans imagination oh fie mr tuke here is an ardent philosopher of the desert tell me does the house of shadows yield many mysteries i am dying to hear all about it then i will save you as you have once already it yieldsyes i think i can say it yields one at least oh oh what is it about a lake of wine both talkers turned round with a start captain luvaine had it appeared been seated solitary near them and had dropped upon the ground a heavy book in which he had been reading really captain luvaine said miss royston peevishly i protest you near frightened me to death the melancholy soldier was apologizing with much humility and confusion when up came sir david and insisted upon carrying off the gentlemen for a pipe and a glass chapter xiii when is it yere leavin is it the oceans heavin that sets your stummick grievin to see what lies before what ails that nowt ll start ee we wait ye right and hearty oh mounseer buonaparte upon sthampton shore chorus genmen chorus we wait ye ri and hearty oh mouseer buonaparte upo sthampton shore he thumped the table did that crapulous squireen and all the others joined in as by honour expectedlike schoolboys beating the bounds of time truth to tell the hour was late the whiskypunch was low in the bowl and the three little mooncalves were very drunk one of them moreover was in process of insulting captain luvaine youre no good company sir he had said after staring at that baneful person for some solemn moments i thick you no goo company and ihicta leaverertellesoand he nodded profoundly with the air of one who has solved a longvexing problem well sir said the captain youre welcome to your opinion for me he had sat out the orgy but with something a gloomy and preoccupied air and with a frequent manner of impatience to have it ended whas you say said the offender cocking his head magisterially whas you say sir then he sang jake gave moll a push derryderrydown moll fell into a bush derrydownderry is that to your taste captn or dye prefer somethig i the psalmody fashion sir david and mr tuke interfered they had been moderate in their cups and the latter at least was seasoned oh charlie said the baronet get off to bed with you youre drunk man hes got a face as sour as rennet davy its curcurdled the milk o human kideness in me this was good for the manling mr tuke patted him on the back there he said go and sleep it off the captain gives you goodnight and a ring for the hogs snout tomorrow thundered the soldier fie sirfie whispered the other tis but a tipsy boyand with great ado he and the baronet made a patch of the peace and got the squireens outside and on their horses and saw them ride off swaying the wind drove with gusts of sleet at them as they turned tail and fled into the house once more for the night had bellied up slurred and stormy and there was a melancholy sound in every keyhole of the hall they found the soldier standing up grave and lowering but his eyes took an eager look upon their reentrance and he stepped up to his host with an air of impatient apology i was an ass to take offence at that pigwash said hethe more so as i have been poor company i confess and you sir he turned suddenly upon tuke have been the cause of it i exclaimed the visitor in a voice vibrating all the harmonics of surprise you sir blythewood said the soldier turning upon the baronet i make no apology for harping upon an old string in your presence you know my monomania and the wrack it hath made of my peace i have waited but for those jackpuddings to begone to speak mr tuke could only stare in amazement and fire away old cock quoth the master of the house then he added youll take beds here the two of you or we shall come to words both gentlemen protested but the other would not listen and he ended by carrying his point and now said blythewood charge your piecewhatever it isand let fly at our friend and so to tother glass captain luvaines eyes had a light of strange trouble in them and he gnawed his knuckles nervously i startled you just now mr tuke he said twas some words you let fall disturbed me so that i dropped the book believe me sir i was innocent of designs on your composure i know i knowthat is of coursehow could it be otherwise how indeed but i am all at sea they could not have been accidental no twas impossible and yetyou uttered the words sirthe lake of winethere was no mistake i heard you and what then captain luvaine do i deny it no no onlyoh sir the lady says what mystery and you answer the lake of wine could that be an inventiona mere playful fancy tis out of reason at the first reference to this strange title sir david had given a low whistle and he now came forward and took the soldier by the sleeve harkee luvaine he said heres the yeast to work ye up like a pan of bread did he say that then its a strange thing by god but steady man and what dye sayshall i before mores spoke give mr tuke the history of your trouble the others mouth was twitching in an agitated manner well he said after a moments thought im like to lose command of myself whenever that nightmare gets up speak davy and ill sit mum while i can the baronet turned to his astonished neighbour tis passing strange upon my soul that the words should be on your lips said he for twas the name of a great ruby that was stole from luvaines father the lake of wine the lake of wine sir ronald luvaine was a dependent of hastings in john companys pay and received the stone in reward of some particular nice service a crimson token and an apt was it plucked from the withered bosom of some starved begum thats no concern of ours said sir david dryly the point is that the gem was stole from ronald luvaine that was my fathers friend and that he went crazy of it and died in a year or so the soldier jumped to his feet with an insane look and his son he cried that should have been a rich man succeeded to an empty legacy and a search of hate that shall be unending he tossed one arm aloft with a grandiose gesture mr tuke stared at him his brain full of bewilderment and wonder steady luvaine said sir david once more then proceeded to discuss the other with admirable ingenuousness it hath made a wreck of his life as he saysthis sense of wrong and loss we have been acquainted from boysat least since i was oneand the grievance hath enlarged upon him with the years not to this day has he lighted upon any clue to the stones whereabouts though the cursed red stain of it has bitten into his life it hath corroded me cried the soldier unabashed he seemed to think his conduct justified by the magnitude of his loss i have wrought for a pittance when i should have ruffled it with the highest but how was it lost asked the listener with some secret scorn for such a bitterness of avarice as he could not conceive would demoralize other than a contemptible nature proposals were made by a syndicate for its purchase put in sir david hastily the whole thing was a monstrous swindle planned with every elaboration ronald luvaine was illadvised enough to let the stone out of his hands and there was the last of it cried the captain madlyand the plunge for me into a hell of disappointment and misery his jaw was shaking like a rabid dogs not for a day since my dying father swore me to the curse of vengeance he cried has the stone been out of my mind judge then of my agitation when i hear you a stranger casually refer to it by name as having some bearing on a mystery connected with your house but not with me said mr tuke coldly there was something nameless in the mans frenzyan uncleanly savour of passion that was devoid of all nobility i can have no objection he went on to acquaint you of the circumstances that inspired me to so unfortunate a reference if you please sir said the soldier in a tone that was almost a menace sir david saw the blood leap to his new neighbours face humour him humour him he whispered in the lords name well sir said mr tuke if you will give me your attention i will endeavour to recall the matter for your behoofand he then and there recounted those experiences of his at delsrop that had awakened his suspicions ending up with the history of the interview between mr joseph corby and the crazed girl to this description sir david listened with some openmouthed astonishment and captain luvaine with a black concentration of his every faculty upon the minutest details as the speaker ended he the latter blew out all his restraint in a labouring sigh and stared before him with eyebrows pulled together like the strings of a purse tis passing strange he muttered there can be but one lake of wine whence does the fellow come and wherefore that sir i know no more than you blythewood said the soldier turning suddenly on the baronet has no tenant been in delsrop since the time of the gallowsbird none luvaine till our friend here the other addressed mr tuke with icy civility perhaps i discuss what is yours with undue freedom sir my excuse must be that delsrop is a tradition for desolation and to us of the neighbourhood it hath long been a thickset of mysteries here is another it seems that i little thought to connect with the place is it asking you too great a favour to acquaint me of developments should they occur by no means i will undertake that you are informed of the progress of any events that seem to touch upon a certain subject the soldier bowed low and walked to the door why manyou are never going cried sir david you must hold me excusedyes this strange recountal has vastly disturbed me i would seek counsel of my pillow the door closed behind him mr tuke turned mutely to his host zounds whispered the latter to his silent inquiry the beggar is half off his head with lifelong brooding over his grievance the loss occurred in when i was a childa brat of two or so he was a young man when his father died and i had the story fifty times from ned here before i was out of my teens his long face is one of my first remembrances the families were connected and he played off the privileges of cousinship upon me to the hilt by gad he spoke of me as a neighbour and that he is in a way he settled when he retired from the service in winchester where his regiment used to lie and there he eats out his heart like sir thingumbob in the tower planning what he would have done if the old stone had rounded off his jointure it was valued at if you can believe him a melancholy story how the wind risesand who was the gallowsbird he referred to chapter xiv sir david ladled out into fresh glasses from the dregs of the jorum a toast said he the leaping candlelight making a shifting grotesque of his wholesome young face heres to the memory of the last tenant o delsrop and the health of the new one with all my heart how was the beggar called he hath entailed me a legacy of weeds was he the gallowsbird the visitor spoke in jest and was surprised to have aye that he was for answer great heavens he exclaimed the baronet flung himself back in his chair with a chuckle you little expected that said he but theres a reservation ill own to they strung him up after he was dead he went into a fit of laughter over the others astonished expression i see you are unacquainted with the tale he said tis a tattered old boggart of the past that the neighbourhood has yearslong ceased to throw stones at but youll pardon me tuke what the devil induced you to invest in those ragged acres yonder i didnt i succeeded to them direct certainly he had hesitated in answering the little man gazed at him inquisitively you areyou are not in mourning he said for my father scarcely he died in a widow even may be excused for doffing black in twenty years i see you are an absentee landlord fie sir we hold you responsible thereby for many a pretty ghost tale he answered jocosely but he was looking at the other with a certain ruminative wonder twenty years he murmured why then your father must have stepped straight into old turks shoes the former tenant was that his name turkyes he was still engulfed in retrospect his eyes were fixed unwinking like a dolls well he said at lastsucking at the stem of his churchwarden as if he were a baby ravenous for its comforterit fair upsets me it does what does how you can a let a fruitful estate like that go to wrack and ruin for twenty years mr tuke was silent had he spoken and the truth he could only have echoed the others wonder as it was his mouth was tied to an adequate explanation blythewood blew away the problem with a cloud of smoke weve got you at last anyhow he said and thats nine points of the law ill wager you dont know sir whence your house gets its name i cant take you youre right tis the short for devilsropethats what it is the cursed bindweed that will honeycomb a county from an inch of root if you give it rein the story goes that when they dug the foundations it lay thick in the soil as macaroni in a dish thats odd enough and an ominous name for the last tenant by your showing what was his history that you make a secret of tut tis no secret did you hear thatthe wind ll blow the casement in tis no secret but i was only a lad of five when they found him hanging on the downs and so can give you little but the fruits of hearsay and what are they as dry as applejohns by this date fill your glass the fellows name was turk i say and he looked his namezounds tis like his ghost ravenin with fury to get the grip of ushe must a been an ugly beggar for i can remember him plain as plain for all i was only five years old when he was found swingin what was he like like like a gurgoyle on a churcha face to sweat o nights with thinking on a murderouslooking caitiff sir with red stubble under his jasey and a bloody long tuck at his side yet i can mind me of a look in his eyesor in one of em for tother was fixed in his head and chalky like a boiled codsthat wasnt all of the rest twas fear or sufferinor compound of both and it lessened the fright i stood in of meetin him was he always thereat delsrop i mean in your early memory of it save us no the place belonged to the woodruffs up to when it came into the market the new owner wasnt in possessionno not a year he turned up suddenwas there on a day with his blackbodin face and nobody knew where hed come from or what was his business in life they didnt find out then or afterwards he kept himself to himself received no visitors and wanted none lived his days solitary shut up like a miser and didnt so much as weed the gravel of his drive and so disappeared disappeared not he he was a landmark to every traveller for months to come i mind the mornin wellah even through this lapse of timethat young peterson our landreeve rode over to chatters with a face like whey and said as how mr turk had been found murdered and hangin in the chains on stockbridge downs hanging aye there theyd strung him up that did the deed for hed been stabbed firstnigh a dozen angry wounds that had sucked at the steel like mouthsand then set to dangle for a jest to the daws and when they ran the rogues to earth they never did sirthey never did to this day the mans fate is locked up in the mystery of his life but at the inquest none was held twas an odd thing youll say and a cursed odd thing it was but none was held for all that mens minds were disorganized at that time tis said there was the french and spanish coalition and dark trouble about a possible descent on the coastlike as there is now who was to think of one murdered landloper that nobody knew or claimed when all eyes were turned to the sea anyhow there he swung and rotted to the huge scandal of the neighbourhood till he and his head parted company and came to the ground but there must have been legateesexecutorslawyers interested at the very least they never put in a claim then the fellow was here and gone and narry a sign twas a queer business well heaven rest his bones at the last ill give you amen to that you are its deputy for one of them by all account eh what dye say tis a tale hereabouts that whimples mad sister has the creatures skull in keepinthat for months she hovered like a crow under the gallows and picked it up at last when it fell good god she hasor had ive seen it ah a pretty plaything for a maid well thats mr turks story as i know it the listener sat for some moments in a profound and bewildered silence vaguely through his brain like faint harmonics ran the words of the lawyer creel and his own question to which they had been an answer when did it come to him that i may answer you it was in the year so his father had himself slipped into possession of this mysterious estate at the very time that ghastly scarecrow was tossing in the wind how then was it that he had not caused inquiry to be made as to the fate of his predecessorhad not set bloodhounds on the track of the assassinshad not even allotted the poor remains some decent burial for the first time a little mist of darkness gathered in his hearta suspicion born of the unaccountable secrecy that was the main condition of his inheritance presently he looked up with a troubled face then whimple and his sister he said were early put in charge of the deserted placebut they were of course the fellow told me so himself aye aye said sir david he was only a lad of eighteen when he first camea great weedy gawk with scared eyes twenty years havent improved upon that my god what an existence well sir it may suit a being or not we aint all built for coalporters the measure of a mans work is his willingness to it and dennis is no jackalent for all his diffidence he knows a spavin from a thrush and ill tell ye somethin morehe can put rhymes together equal to milton or mr pye umph said the other chapter xv miss angela came out on the steps to wave farewell to her brothers guest of the night this was in itself a particular favour for she made it rather less than a rule to submit her charms to the broad searchlight of the early morning butto speak figurativelyto withhold a curtesy after yielding a kiss is to value the shadow at more than the substance for so it was she had already vouchsafed her gallant her company while yet the grey of dawn was melting on the blinds it came about in this mannerthat into mr tukes waking dreams stole a strain of music very sweet and melancholy the rogue slept lightly and unvexedly as sinners do and moved by the mystic cadence he rose dressed with great dispatch and descended the stairs in obedience to the alluring summons now it was soon evident that this proceeded from a little panelled parlour or boudoir at the open door of which he paused atiptoe drinking in the vision of a pale morning cecilia seated at a pianoforte communing with her soul in the softest of harmonies and an angelic gown thank you said he presently in a pause i have risen with the lark st cecilia started and turned about with a very pretty confusion mr tuke she cried and presented him with a blush through her ringlets like a mossrose ah madam said he i dropped upon you like a spider in your bower your voice thrilled my web and i must needs fall but i thought you thought me gone alas if i have imperilled my welcome by craving your brothers hospitality till the morning but so it seemed to me your beauty would owe me a recompense for a sleepless night and i dared to stay to claim it oh sir you are pleased to make a sport of me but indeed you are very welcome though i protest nothing would have induced me to sing had i known you in the house and so would you have denied one soul a full measure of happiness poor soul she looked round at him with a little smile mocking and bewitching at once she had seated herself at the instrument again and was running her fingers lightly over the keys are they not beautiful she said he had stolen up behind her they are he murmured like white butterflies fluttering over the chiming flowers of fairyland mr tuke she saidwhat are your fingers of course oh fie sir i spoke of these melodious pianofortes is not mine a darling tis by clementi and a present from my brother how can i take this praise on trust you need not if you have already been eavesdroppingdropping like a spider i should say sing to me oh i could not sing to me please she laughed and protested it was earlyher voice was ropy as a hensshe only warbled for her own entertainment and professed no knowledge of or subtilty in the artindeed she had never submitted herself to discipline therein and did not mr tuke think that no acquired skill could compensate for the loss of native simplicityeven should native simplicity though she did not add this ring a little false now and again mr tuke thought just as she did he would rather listen to pretty maudlin any day than to the artfullest pasta that ever shrieked herself into fame at last miss royston gave way dove sono i bei momenti she sang in a fine cultivated little voice that was not unpleasant as exemplifying the art that can surmount natural disabilities and when she had finished her one listener applauded fatuously i would cry brava said he were it not for bringing the atmosphere of the footlights into these enchanted gardens that is right said miss royston though a little warmth would comfort them just now she was resolute not to sing again despite his protestations she had a nice eye for proportion in all matters affecting her own appearance moral or physical she led him across the room to a glazed door in a recess the icy blast of the night had fallen dead on the grass where it lay stiff amongst the ruin of the leaves it had scattered he saw a wide stretch of frosty lawn on which the fingers of the rising sun were busy assorting a millions of iridescent jewels it is like the angels of the israelites snowing manna against breakfasttime said mr tuke he was in a mood of most dreamy romanticism all this cultured and human beauty of orderliness seemed to him very gracious after his experience of desolation the lady glanced secretly at her cavalier with an approving tenderness he fulfilled her expectations of himstood appropriately in the foreground of the picture of mysterious melancholy her fancy had painted to receive him i could not breakfast on manna she said with a full little laugh what sugarbabies the israelites must have been but i have often gone without breakfast at all when sketching so completely has the pleasure absorbed me you are an artist too she owned that she was and indeed she had quite a skill in making pretty little copies of landscapes after turner bright stothard and others which she signed with her own name less often she ventured upon art at first hand she had penetration enough to mentally appraise that subtle distinction shown by friends in the degrees of admiration accorded respectively her imitative and her original work now however in the assurance of appreciative comment she was moved to reach for the manna she would have herself believe she despised that is one of my poor originals she said inviting him by a gesture to an escritoire on which lay an open sketchbook he took it up as a priest lifts the gospels though notin further illustrationto kiss it here his reverence halted on the brink of perplexity do you know what it is she murmured slyly but a little anxiously you ought to of course he saidalmost in a perspiration already it isit is a gate is it not she was disappointed at the outset how did you know she said with a note of irrepressible irony in her voice it is clever of you to have lighted on the truth at once and i tried so hard to conceal it yes it is a gatethe gate of your own wilderness he looked at her helplessly is not this sort of thingthisthis washpainting in its infancy asas it were oh yes mine you would say tries to run before it can walk no no no he murmured it was a shock to her to discover his inability to read the soul behind thepossible immatureperformance turn over she said perhaps you will like the others better he obeyed with a vague air of wonderment the remainder pages were filled with copies very elegant and painstaking ah he said with a real relief and an air of embarrassed conciliation these are beautiful you paint in two styles it seems how clever you are i like this the better i know nothing about such things of course and can only judge when i understand a picture and when i dont and they are all your own work you are a genius upon my soul she did not gainsay him perhaps she would not in any case but now she was indifferent to his praise or silence her hero she thoughta little crossly it must be confessedwas not all transcendental what man was the most amorous appealing eyes in their moments of apparent inspiration were usually if the truth should be confessed an index of thoughts dreamily loitering through visions of flintlocks steeplechases and even vulgar tankards of smallbeer nowadays whatever savour of romance clung about the creatures was from their persistent contact through every phase of evolution with the finer feminine clay yet could a soul completely gross and commonplace find its expression in a personality so melancholy and so noble she glanced at her companion with a reviving tenderness of earth he might be but she thrilled to remember the strength of his arms as he bore her from the sinking wellmouth after all apollo was a sportsman before he was a poet or it never would have occurred to him to skin critics who derided his lays there she said you have seen them all i keep you here and you are famishing for food of a very different order she led the way to the breakfastroom he followed with a lamblike submissiveness there was a vague feeling at his heart of distress or something of the nature of it he opined that he had been churlish though quite in what respect he could not understand but he was conscious of having unwittingly given offence where none should have been taken and so being human he felt an atom aggrieved captain luvaine it appeared still kept his bed sir david however flung abroad an atmosphere of boisterous goodhumour he rallied his guest and his sister upon their risingsun worship gad he cried i heard you tunin up my dear before i could see to tother end of my bed dont do it angel or youll be gettin chilblains on your little ten toes twas all for you tuke ill tell you sir she aint in the habit of frosting her little nose o common days why said the otheryoure wrong miss royston had no knowledge i slept here eh said the baronet his eyes a double note of exclamation and davy be quiet implored his sister the manling fell into a fit of laughter dont you believe it he crowed hoarsely she understood you was goin to stop an miss royston was crushing the little villain in her arms dont listen to him mr tuke she cried hes a bad bad boy she made a very pretty picture as she turned with radiant face and tumbling hair to their guest her girlish grace commanded the situation i didnt knowi didnt i didnt she cried and fibs tuke was the response in a smothered voice now the visitor was a salted gallant but he found something very sweet in this delicateskinned coquettish maid of many arts and graces she was like an exotic whiff from the glasshouse of his former lifegood god how vague and far away that seemed now this gave him a full feeling about the heart a feeling as though he a yearslong exile had chanced across a compatriot in the land of his desolation and the consequences was that he who would not while he might was now wavering to a parlous state in the afternoon of his fortunes the vision of her standing on the steps to bid him godspeed abode with him during the length of his homeward journey and would often rise up before him at intervals during the day sir david had stretched up to him as he sat mounted for his departure hat in hand tuke the little man whispered that is a cursed queer business you told us about and it jumps oddly with luvaines you will hold me at your service if you need assistance i am a justice of the peace sir he smacked his chest dropped back on his heels and cried a votre service with extreme elegance chapter xvi something singular in the appearance of his house engaged mr tukes attention the moment he drew rein before the door desolate and haunted it always looked but now there was a deathly air about the place that was an additional burden on its eeriness the reason of this he found was not far to seek behind the latticed glazing of every window the strong shutters were closed and bolted though it was now eleven oclock of a sunny brisk morning he dismounted and tried the front door it was fastened also on the echo of his angry summons fell the sound of a light step within who are you cried dardas voice shrilly through the keyhole open girl what is the meaning of this she drew the bolts reluctantlydeliberately in his impatience to enter he almost threw her down what is the meaning of this he repeated she had backed into a shadowy angle of the hall and thence looked at him with a sullen defiance he had to again put his question and harshly oh she said nodding at him with an angry look what trouble hasnt your coming brought on us now he said peremptorily explain yourself we lived at peace with the shadows and the spirits before she answered since you came they take to worrying us and they have made his face like death whose face you jade hismy brothers they were about the house all last nightcreeping creeping as soft as snow on withered leaves he feared that they would get in and he dared not rest or sleep till daylight came and now he is on his bed tuke strode to the end of the hall whimple he thundered come and take my horse he felt dardas breath at his ear and turned to find she had come swiftly after him with her white face you devil she hissed you bring the evil and then torture my dennis from his sleep he put her sternly aside and twisting about for another violent summons subsided into an umph of petulance the man was standing silent before him the same scared look in his eyes that he had learned to loathe why is the house locked and sealed like this he demanded i dared not open it sir till you came the servant spoke in a faint tired voice dared not and why said his master whimple looked about him helplessly as if he sought a loophole of escape from the question come said the other why did you not dare i was frightened terrified there were noises and footsteps the wind or any other natural cause these bugbears dont stalk in the daytime a pretty caretaker upon my word he looked at the fellow gloomily hesitated and bidding him roughly see to his horse turned into the dininghall closed the door unbolted and threw open the shutters and sat himself down before a dull fire what is it all what is it all he thought desperately am i in good truth being stalked and shadowed and for what reason and is that fellow in the league against me blythewood knows him well and has a high opinion of him what then what favourable view can i possibly take of his reticence and evasiveness for all i know blythewood himself may be the chief of a colony of pads and cutthroats i am a lamb amongst wolvesknowing nought of the neighbourhood moving in the dark i am drowned and overwhelmed in a sea of mysteriesin a cursed lake of wine and there there there luvaines fabulous stone he sprang to his feet and set to pacing the room by god he cried aloud i will stand it no more i will be master of my own and subscribe no longer to the infernal bullying of circumstances in the midst of his excitement the vision of angela rose before him sparkling spirituellea true child of the thoughtless effervescent life of his everyday custom oh i am a fool he murmured she and her brother carry their patents of respectability on their sleeves but from now he was determined to throw off all gloom and trepidation to go his way and improve his estate without idle speculations as to antagonistic forces at work and to strike and strike hard if he was interfered with all that day he sang and whistled over his labour of investigation perhaps in the background of his fancy rose and broadened a dawn of new hopes and possibilities perhaps he pictured there a delsrop restored cultivated and flourishing and contiguous to other fruitful acres wherein his interest was figured in a certain dainty lady destined to be the mother of one who should recover his own waived surname and title for so he could not forbear reflecting had the titular restriction been imposed upon himself alone he was coming across his lawn on the afternoon of the following day when he noticed a cart issue from the drive and stop and saw betty pollack jump down with a basket on her arm he strolled conscious of a sudden spring of pleasure in his veins towards the girl who dropped a pretty curtsey to him as he neared her come round the kitchengardens betty said he and see if you can supply anything we dont already possess he glanced with a certain defiance as he spoke at the old gaffer seated in the gig mumchance and blinking like a withered owl and led the way to a crazy door that opened into a walled garden betty followed him timidly and looked shyly about her as he introduced her to the prospect there said he is not that eden it is very neglected and unkempt said the girl gravely there is work for two men here for many days and then the soil would want well manuring to make it fruitful he laughed his careless eye roved over her charms luxuriously suddenly child of his newfound tenderness a great pity awoke in his heart for this poor lamb so treacherously shepherded betty he said gently have you no mother she smiled with a little falling sadness oh your honour she died before i can remember or father betty looked sheepish father was shot by the preventive in she murmured hm and he therehas he brought you up and cared for you ever since yes and hes good to you her rosy face took an expression of surprise grandfather oh yes we are the only two left i shall bei shall be quite alone when he is gone could thisthe desire to secure protection for his own on whatever condition be the explanation of the old mans attitude a wryed morality if it were but at least forethoughtful and unselfish but no the suggestion had been an evil and selfinterested one do you serve the tap all day betty said he mostly your honour but jim will take a turn when we go ajaunting who is jim hes the stableboy well what have you got for me there she groped in her basket heres turnips and little carrots and a right early stick of celery ill pay you double for each and throw a kiss in for interest betty she backed a step or two will you please not to talk like that i will please i will please deeds are better than words she made as if to run from him but pulled herself up and stood still with eyes full of trouble his blood raced in his veins she looked a very andromedawarm and winning and pathetic he went a hurried pace slid his arm about her and kissed her lips softly the moment he had done it he was sorry she never moved panting where she stood i hope you will be ashamed she said with a little breaking sob he answered humbly i am bettythere i am and gave her a glance of remorse then he added go to your grandfather my dear maybe after all the old scamp is safer than the young yes she said striving to steady her voice i mustnt come hither again she turned and moved away a step or two her pretty head hanging suddenly she faced about and came at our gentleman with a little spit of passion i trusted you and it was unfair and i came to give your honour warning and now i wont the words were hardly out of her lips when her eyes were drowned in tears yes yesi will i will she cried and buried her face in her hands tuke smiled and put his arm again about the girl she showed no sign of resentmenteven allowed herself to be pulled a trifle closer to him betty my little wenchwhat is it all what is the todo oh she looked up at him through blinking lashesthere are evil men about why so i know my dear and what then she clasped her fingers convulsively over the baskethandle i fear for your honour there is something dark afoot and you live lone and the times is troublous but all this is for any understanding have you nothing more i have my eyes and my ears i see folks and i hear a many words that isnt meant for me theres a man breeds your honourah you know him a feckless creature but dangerous in his cups hes not to be trusted he consorts wi rogues and hath a hanging reputation i would your honour could lay him by the heels for harbouring cutthroats i have my eye on him betty he could get nothing more definite from the girl she was full of alarm and uneasiness on his account but on what founded she had a difficulty in explaining she knew only that of late certain strangers of a somewhat villainous cast were housed within the walls of the old wayside tavern that occasionally a couple of them would drop into the tap of the first inn and secretly terrify her secretly listening with muttered innuendoes and hoarse whisperings on the subject of some projected scheme of roguery then stockbridge was little more than a rustic villagea boorish community of clodpolls that nightly slept away the memory of its daily toil in a beery stupor of indifference and what practical influence could thence be brought to bear on blackguards predetermined to some deed of darkness the moral was all of womans intuition and therefore to be accorded respect mr tuke acknowledged this but he laughed away bettys fears while she good girl forgetful of her right of offence did entreat him with many pretty words and troubled looks and a clasping of her handsolive as young ripening filbertsto be on his guard he saw her drive away and disappear then with set lips and a dour contraction of his eyebrows he made for the house to order his horse to be saddled he was a man whose constitutional goodnature underlay whole stories of determination the topmost of these was to temporize with no discomfort moral or physical but to strike at the root of the trouble before analyzing it he would never have a tooth that pained him stopt but must suffer the moments wrench to save days of dull aching now it was that he saw the centre of the unaccountable to be that same beetledbrowed tavern to the dog and duck he would ride forthwith and so seek counsel of the very heart of the mystery chapter xvii oppressive dusk was drooping as mr tuke came in sight of the lonely tavern on the downs the inconsistent moodiness of autumn had fallen into another humour as the day declined the steely thrust of wind at nighta morning cold and fair and pure such as ever seems an earnest of weeks of serene tranquillityand then as noon ticked into evening a dull fall in the barometer and gathering battalions of clouds rolling to the front with a noise of rumbling in them like the labouring wheels of guncarriagessuch was the record of twentyfour hours glancing with frowning eyes at the little forlorn building livid above him against a wall of menacing purple the horseman pricked his nag to the slight ascent and clattering up to the inn door flung himself out of the saddle and looped his reins to a ring set in the lintelpost straightway he crossed the threshold and turning sharply to the left found himself in the room of the baywindow and the tap of the dog and duck not a soul was in itno sign of life but somewhere a distant murmuring of voices it was a paltry little shop with a pewtered counter and under it on the customerside a ditch or groove set in the floor and filled with sawdust for obvious purposes a few beerbarrels a squat flask or two of schiedam on a shelf some common earthenware mugs white with a blue band and bearing the excise stamp on a tin bottomthese were the important features of the bar above the latter from a blackened beam hung a great ships lantern eloquent of rancid oil and to the back was a glazed door leading into a room no larger than a cabin in which a little fire blinked a red eye like a drowsy watchdog mr tukefingering in the pocket of his ridingcoat the butt of a duelling pistol loaded and primedrapped on the counter with his ridingwhip listening he was conscious of a sudden cessation of the murmuring soundsof an appreciable pause and then a door opened gently and somebody came into the barparlour this newcomer whoever he wasfor he took stock in the dusk without showing himselfseemed to go out softly again after a moments scrutiny and following his exit the other was dimly aware of the sounds again but more subdued and broken with an intermittent cough that was like suppressed laughter he rapped again and immediately the door was opened a second time but now with an air of business a heavy step shuffled across the cabin and the landlord appeared at the glazed door mr breeds was not the mr breeds of a former experience he was in his shirtsleeves and was here the master of everything but himself in illustration of this his puffed and heated face bore an expression of boldness that was entirely the painting of strong waters tipsy he was a cumbrous changeling with just a sufficiency of humour to be insolent he drew the red tip of his churchwarden so far out of the corner of his mouth as to allow passage to a question fired awry in a spit of smoke what dye call for mr tuke put his clinched left hand on the counter and stared sternly in the bloated face i want nothing but a word with you its this do you know who i am sure said mr breeds with a chuckle thats well now listen theres winton a city fifteen miles off and a fast gaol in it men lie by the heels there for lesser crimes than housebreaking and hang too for all his liquid cargo the landlord went white i dare say siri dare say quoth he in a jerking voice and how do that concern me you know best maybe you have taken me for one of your pugmill squireens with blinkers to his head youd better cleanse your brain on that point i see and i hear mr breeds and im dangerous to meddle with you understand meyes you do so help me god sir i know nought of any attempt on your house you see did i say there had been one you rogue ive a mind to put a bullet in you now the landlord dropped his pipe on the floor and cried abjectly sirmr tuke in the lords name what dye accuse me of of nothing of course i warn youthats enough but sir mr breeds mr breedshe shook a threatening finger at himlet me advise you to take a fair hint and meditate on it you consort with blackguards sir you harbour ruffians shall i connect this or not with signs and sounds and visits that have disturbed me of late i am an innkeeper sir said the other sullenly im not to pick or choose where custom offers let the law look after its own i stand upon my rights aye aye thats boors english for treading on other peoples corns he turned to go daring a retort with the tail of his eye on the threshold he paused a sinister little laugh had reached him from the bowels of the house in a moment he strode back fierce and lowering you have company in the inn now where do they sit the landlord did not answer but in the gathering darkness of the tap there was a sound as if his teeth chattered without another word tuke stepped into the passage and stood listening all was silent but somewhere to the rear of the building a thread of light broke the run of the panelling almost from ceiling to floor for this thread he made and coming plump against a door burst it open and half fell into a long dimlylighted room with a trestletable set in the middle of it recovering himself he stood at instant guard the light of a couple of oillamps on the wall swam in his eyes and blinded him for a moment then his vision cleared and he saw his companytwo men seated at the table and one who stood by a halfclosed door to his left the room was full of tobaccosmoke and a reeking smell of warm hollands hung in the air like a sickly dew charge your rummers gentlemen said some one in a thin nasal voice it was such a queerly weak and ineffective voice that despite a certain awkwardness in his situation the intruder could not forbear fixing his eyes on the speaker with a start of wonder then he recognized him at once it was the squab whitehaired man with a face like a hip whom he had seen at lounge on the windowsill him he had expected to find nor much less the gentleman like a decayed schoolmaster whom he had happened on afishing and who sat next to the other mr joseph corby should be the third thought he and sure enough it was joe who stood by the door now not the least embarrassing part of the business was that his entrance with a face set to any contingency was to all appearance accepted by the company as in the natural order of custom no one fell awkward over it or assumed an air as of resenting his presence he hesitated a moment then sat himself down in a chair opposite the two men a dull evening gentlemen said he with promise of a dirty night mr fernby token of his scarlet facewas the one to answer in a high manner of politeness the more fortunate we sir for being under cover he said one would have taken the persistent strain of speech to account for his apoplectic hue if he were a rogue he had none of the melodramatic hallmarks his face possibly from its consuming colour was as expressionless as a brick and his eyes under their ragged brows gleamed like cold and passionless agates fortunate as you say said mr tuke the more as it is like to stay midnight skulkers from disturbing the rest of peaceable folk quite so quite so though i dont trace the connectioneh brander the sardonic fisherman his arms folded had been watching the newcomer from under covert brows he gave a little contemptuous laugh perhaps the gentleman is a sufferer from nerves said he no said tuke coolly i dont think i am i have full confidence in myself and in my defences it is my way to strike at an annoyance before i examine it as i would at any unaccustomed beast that ran across my path an excellent principle sir impulse is a muchmaligned factor in our system second thoughts are secondbest thoughts too often landlord is our supper served tis on the table mr fern came the answer somewhere from the darkness of the bar both men rose and mr tuke with them he felt desperately the utter ineffectiveness of the situation how could he on a shadow of circumstantial evidence throw their presumed roguery in the teeth of a couple of strangers merely because they had put up at a wayside tavern a sort of dull fury worked in his heart what had his impulsive visit gained him but present isolation in the midst of a dangerous company without the storm had broken the slam of thunder shook the lonely house the lightning fought for mastery in the room with the smoking oillamps and prevailed painting all faces with a violet glaze that man said he pointing at the genial joseph and wild to bring an edge to circumstancedoes he sup with you surely sir said mr fern pausing with an expression of extreme surprise ah i recognize him as the fellow who applied to me for the post of gardener you are wellsuited for company gentlemen he waits on us sirhe waits on us joseph is this true that i hearthat unknown to me you seek another service yes said the man with a grin if i could better myself i would ah said mr fern with mild severity this must not occur again joseph i sanction no such underhand proceedings if you are dissatisfied with your position tell me so plainly and you are welcome to go seek a less indulgent master oh im all right mr fern the other turned benevolently to the perplexed baronet throughout the man brander had stood silent his hands thrust into his pockets his hat pulled over his eyes a slight grin creasing his parchment jaws i must call your interest in me and my affairs unaccountable sir said the former gravely but it is no doubt to be attributed to purely friendly motives he bowed cumbrously signified to joseph to go before and passed out with his other companion into the passage closing the door gently to behind him left to himself mr tuke stood for a moment dumfounded and quite at a loss as to what to do next then with a quick impatient exclamation he flung himself into a chair before the hearth why did he wait on at all he told himself that it was for a lull in the storm that crashed and bellowed overhead all the same he knew that he delayed going for the reason that makes men linger out a fruitless suitbecause he impotently hoped for some anticlimax to justify his action presently rising from a fog of perplexity he pulled with violence a bellrope that hung near him the landlord himself answered the summons and immediately bring me a bottle of port said the visitor and added suggestively uncorked mr breeds accepted the order with some unintelligible response vanished brought back the wine and a glass and offered the bottle to the others inspection good open it and go he sat and sipped and pondered the situation there was no fire in the grate before him but a bundle of the towy stuff known as crinoline and this as the wind moaned down the chimney heaved and pulsed like a thing that breathed very silently after a time this stealthy lifelike action wrought a certain uneasiness in him he filled another glass drained it and glanced with a growing sickness of alarm at the palpitating mass good god it was swelling writhing in monstrous and unnatural motion he tried to shriek out his voice had left him he could hear it very faint and agonized fifty miles away he struggled to rise to his feet the thing was out of the fireplace nowclimbing his kneeslapping him in overwhelming him from foot to throat with a liquid grunt that rang in his own congested brain like his dying yell he sank down in a heap and into immediate unconsciousness chapter xviii a dream a memory of a wire factory he had once been shown overthis to reconnect him with a world he had sunk fathomdeep from a buzzing and whistling in his brain from which the brassy filament was being whirled to spin round a great reel at which some shadowy horror toiled a snapping of the attenuated strandand mr tuke came to consciousness with a shock even then at first he could not disassociate himself from the business of his quickening stupor but saw the crisscross of wires on all his drowsy eyes looked at somewhere in his forehead was the hole the screaming thread had issued from he put up his hand vaguely to feel the acrid wound he knew must be there for his whole skull yet throbbed and ached from the jarring process he groped for the fancied mark curiously and then with a sense of grievance if it had closed already the torture would go on in his brain and find no outlet suddenly the instinct of motion came to him and he staggered to his feet yet his eyes were halfblind to the reality of his surroundings bit by bit however these shook out into distinctness vibrating like a spun coin before they settled down and became the commonplace objects of the room he had fallen asleep in and then he saw that broad daylight was beating through a little high window halfchoked with creepers that pierced the wall at the far end a few moments later the furious jangling of a bell seized every echo in the dog and duck he who had awakened them finding no response follow flung out into the passage storming like a maniac an old shuffling woman was coming towards him she was so old and so bent that it seemed to stoop a little lower would complete her circuit of days a great mobcap was perched on her wrinkled poll and under it her eyes ran moist with the humours of longdecayed passions where is the landlord of this tavern thundered mr tuke the last trump would have done no more than tickle her auriculum eh she said chafing her miserable old hands where is breeds he roared to be sure she whined he went off arly to stockbridge and left you in chargeyou unconscionable old beldame he added under his breath aye aye she answered in charge to wake the genleman as had fell asleep over his cups and where are the othersthe three who are stopping in the house i know nowt about en there be nubbody here but you i come fro gorepit yon to do the tending when breeds goes ajaunting he said nowt about anybody but you and that your nag were in the stable fuming driven beyond himself his head one racked and aching bone the baronet pushed past the withered hag and started on an exploration of the house he flung up the stairs and passed into more than one meagre little bedchamber each was tenantless as was every room upon the floor below i have been drugged by god he thought to himself and went out to the rear where the stables were here he found his horse comfortably stalled and with all his housings yet on him he climbed into the saddle he might have had a full sack upon his shoulders from the trouble it cost him as he rode away he could have thought his head rocking like a toytumbler he had to hold on with a frantic grip or he would have rolled off into the road and probably snapped his spine like a stick of celery the flinty track seemed to slide under him as if it were a long ribbon reeling off a drum and all the time the pain in his head was horrible presently he was sicklily aware of a womans figure crossing from a fieldpath in front of him even in his anguish something that was familiar in its pose struck him betty he murmured thickly and pulling up his horse with uncalculated abruptness actually toppled out of the saddle and fell in a heap to the ground she ran to him uttering a faint cry the horse had swerved on the moment and one of its riders feet was wedged in a stirrup she caught the bridle backed the frightened animal and so saved its master a deadly mangling then looping the reins over her arm she bent above the prostrate man with shining eyes full of rebuke and pity oh she saidhow could your honour be so foolish he smiled up at her with a lost look of pain how betty he whispered you should a slept it off she said before you took the road you think me tipsy she answered with a little sigh betty my dearthe mere effort of speech wrung a moan from himim not tipsy upon my honour i was fool enough to trust mr breeds thats all and he repaid me by drugging my wine you come fro the dog and duck ive spent the night there in a chair oh mr tuke what made you go why i wanted to see for myself she went quite pale and suddenly there was a bright tear running down her cheek oh me she whispered twas i drove you to it you might ha been murdered and twas i drove you to it nonsense betty twas coming to a head before you spoke i should have had it out with mr breeds in any case sooner or later and he poisoned your wine oh oh now my dearthat was only a move in the game forewarned is forearmed you know but my head seems like to burst will you put your cool hand on it betty she acquiesced timidly as he lay against the hedgeside but soon emboldened by the yearning pity that in her sex so passionlessly yields itself to any passionate appeal for help or comfort she wrought with instinctive sympathy upon the throbbing temples and pressed the hard pain from them it is like a little snowwind from the mountains blowing over flowers murmured the patient drowsily what are you doing at delsrop again betty at delsrop sure your honours dreaming she cooed you lie amost within hailing distance of the first inn mr tuke uttered an exclamation and struggled into a sitting posture eh he cried in a startled voice and looked bewildered about him true enough the roofs of stockbridge showed over the trees a quarter of a mile below him oh betty he groanedwhither have my sodden wits led meand i made sure i was lying near the gates of the drive i must mount and prick homewards he rose to his feet with difficulty his face was ghastly with nausea you are in no state said the girlyour honour is in no state to go alone come and rest awhile at the inn and wend back in an hour or so i believe you are right he muttered stupidly give me your arm betty and lead me on im blind and weak as a newborn kitten but mr breeds must be called to a reckoning by and by yes yes she criedbut not now she walked by his side helping him so far as she could it took them long short distance as it was to reach the inn once there she led him up to a freshsmelling guestroom with a great fourposter in it and wishing him sleep and a quick recovery shut him in and went about to see to his horse all the morning and into the afternoon her heart sang in her breast like a robin she was busy in the bar by herself when her gentleman walked in refreshed in his right mind and very fairly recovered of his unintended debauch he put out his hand and took one of hers into its grasp firmly and caressingly while she looked down and was busy over something with the point of her sandal betty said mr tuke it has come to me that you pulled my heel out of the stirrup this morning i was too befuddled at the time to realize it she gazed up at him her breath coming quickly a scared entreating look on her flushed face no he answered gravely to the mute appeal im not going to offer you money ive been a sinner betty but im a gentleman only i shall remember my deari shall remember he bent and kissed the warm hand courteously it trembled against his lips before he released it then he turned and walked out of the bar without another word and as a few moments later the ring of his horses hoofs echoed away down the road the girl ran hurriedly into the little backparlour threw herself into a chair and broke into a passion of crying chapter xix mr tuke rode homewards in a very grave and preoccupied frame of mind perhaps he was conscious of a peril more nearly threatening his peace than any scheme of truculent knavery of the latter he could take every advantage that circumstance permitted him without risk of selfaccusation the other was a more delicate question to facea question of such moment that pondering it he must temporarily relegate to the background of his thoughts the issues involved in his adventure of the night plainly it amounted to thiswas it to be control or abuse of the indefinite quantity known as a mans honour he was not a coxcomb or conceited but he was an experienced worldling and as such he could not pretend to misdeem in any pretty maid those premonitory symptoms of a disease of the heart that may be called aptly an affection nowexcept when the stubborn devil in him was baited into crueltyhe was a goodnatured and humane enough fellow with a natural scorn of inflicting upon any other the pain he would himself shrink from enduring moreover he had sworn himself to a life of cleanliness and redemption of the past thirdly and most important did he or did he not seriously contemplate the possibility of a connection with a lady of gentle degree to whomif he offered his heart at allhe must make his presentation with washed hands and an unstained conscience what problems may not be involved in a demand for straight yes or no where the heart is called upon to answer but then what an inextricable problem is the heart itself its sympathies are so manifold that would it be consistent it must seal its every artery of distribution and so in serene isolation beat selfcontained and selfsufficient and here where the brain with its power of selection picks out the indubitable course comes in the heart to reinstate a tender little image that reason has ousted from its niche oh betty betty groans our gentleman i would i had never happened across you you jade desperate over his inability to navigate an uncharted sea he put his thoughts about on a course that promised plainer sailing the drugging of last nightwhat of that this of thatthat tooeager knavery had reacted upon itself in the sense of by some impolitic stroke confirming the suspicions of the very antagonist it had sought secretly to circumvent plainly the rogues had drugged him to secure his noninterference during another determined attempt upon his housewith what success remained to be seen and now at least he was definitely acquainted with his enemies if not with their object though this he could not but conclude was to acquire possession of luvaines legendary stone which for some unaccountable reason they supposed was hidden away on his premises here his way was clear his justification for pronounced action obvious and inspiriting he could feel a legitimate joy in striking at villainy that had recklessly ventured to throw off its disguise thinking these thoughts he came in sight of his gates and was surprised to see them flung wide and the rutted tracks of wheels going up the moss he rode in his horse padding it softly on the thick carpetrode in and drew rein abruptly with a muttered oath there a little way off amongst the trees was his henchman in earnest talk with the same gaunt hag he had seen him exchange speech with once before now he had little opportunity to note them for almost as he paused the two separated the man going off hurriedly towards the house and the woman advancing in his own direction with a secret manner of haste as she plunged into the drive she saw him and drew up with a startled jerkthen came slowly on her eyes full of fear and defiance he set his horse across her path and awaited her what do you here woman he demanded sternly as she stopped over against him she drew her thin shawl about her shoulders hethe man she muttered with a sort of fierceness breaking through instinctive deprecation does me many a little kindness i came to see him and tempt him to dishonest traffic in his masters goods that is a doubledealing charity she clinched her hands and her teeth he saw you lie on her lips though the words were not uttered but he hardly resented the implication he knew in his heart he slandered his servantthat he could never bring himself to do the man justice for a moment he scanned the seamed face set daringly opposite him there were traces of a wild lost beauty furrows of sorrow and want and despair in it to an unprejudiced mind but that in this instance his was not harkee mistress he said i was watching you two once before when you thought yourselves unobserved something then passed from him to youhere in this drive do you deny it no she said then take warning and carry your dealing to an open market i want no secret pilferers about he pulled his rein nodded at her with set lips and rode on his way issuing from the drive a scene of animation unwonted to that dead prospect met his gaze a couple of vans were pulled up before the porch the horses that had drawn them standing apart and nosing in their bags men a halfdozen of them were busy going to and fro lugging huge objects swathed in packing sheets into the house and returning hotly slouching and emptyhanded further under a tree stood darda holding a saddlehorse by the bridle and on the lawn walking hither and thither in earnest converse strolled whimple and the little baronet of chatters now this latter sight for all his reasoned conclusions mr tuke took in with something a scowling displeasure no doubt the two were long acquainted relatively as to their different conditions and had so met and exchanged speech for years before he happened upon the district none the less their intimacy at the present juncture annoyed and a little distressed him he could not be morally confirmed in his mistrust of the servant without questioning the bona fides of any one to whom the latter appeared to give his confidence it was a foolishindeed it seemed an outrageous suspicion in face of the comically ingenuous personality of the poor little sir david but why the devil couldnt the man let whimple alone his new friend caught sight of him as he stood drawn up at the outlet of the drive saluted and came towards him with an air of the utmost importance and solemnity tuke he said putting up his hand on the others saddlebow and looking earnestly in his facewhere the deuce have you been yes yes he went on conscious of a certain atmosphere its all rightits no business of mine of course only youve been wanted my friend ohby whom by whimple there the mans halfwild with fright the other answered with a little contemptuous laugh oh said sir david flushing slightly we cant all command courage you know you and me may be different but well well blythewood whats it all about ill tell you i rode over early to ask if youd put up for the wilton hunt and found your furniture here unpackin and dennis lookin on like a wamblecropped sentryman hullo my friend says i hath boneless been astalkin in your bedchamber that you show the colour of a new sack and by gad tuke you aint in rosy condition yourself never mind me well he was scared and what dye suppose he told methat hed feared an attempt on the house last night on the part of three bodeful ruffians that visited your grounds after dark yeswell you take it coolly upon my soul wellthis he was lookin out of one of the upper windows and saw them slinkin amongst the treesthree as bloody rogues as ever yes yes i know what did they do what did he do umph why he did nothin but he kept watch and so did they waitin no doubt for the lights to be extinguished and presently there came a noise of wheels and up rolled your vans here from winton at that they retreatedcursing for he could hear thembut not far it seems for all the time the first cargo was unloadin he could catch the white of their faces now and again amongst the shrubs so on some pretext or another he stabled the horses and put up the porters against your comin thinkinas was rightthat our gentlemen would shy at so brave a company and then from room to room he walked all night and he saw the rogues come out on the gravel and dance wi rage in the moonlight why didnt he take a posse of his bodyguard and ask the scoundrels their business oh come tuke you ask too much of the manupon my word you do he aint exactly a free agent here i gather but dont this follow queerly on what you told us the other night and dennis acquaints me there are signs of their having tried to force an entrance already does he he appears to give you confidences that he withholds from me well answered sir david dryly and a little haughtily maybe i invite them more than you do that is possible of course would it be an abuse of them to specify the nature of this presumed attempt the little baronet took his hand from the saddle and looked at the other with a puzzled and rather angry expression tis round by the north wing i understand said he coldlya grating that gives light to some secret hole below the basementand with a brief goodday to you he turned and walked away mr tuke made no attempt to follow and conciliate him he was in fact worried out of all present geniality by the constant strain upon his faculties engendered of wearying suspicion while he moved so blind and helpless a friendship that was curious merely confounded him therefore instead of succumbing to a natural instinct of goodfellowship he merely pricked his horse on and rode round by the further wing of the house hitherto he had taken no concern to examine the nature of the opening that admitted light and air to the priests hole now he had little difficulty in identifying the actual spot for in addition to its being below a barred aperture in the houseside which he felt convinced was that that belonged to the gloomy chamber within its neighbourhood presented unmistakable signs of some recent trespass a massive grating of wroughtiron sunk deep in the masonry of the wall which it pierced at a basement depth of five or six feet looked upon a sunless little areaa mere narrow box of cemented stones and this without doubt was the object he sought the excavation had been so matted in and overgrown with a generation of bramble and dogwood and wayfaring tree that no one might have guessed the pit sunk within the mass had not a torn opening in the latter bristling with white splints of branches led him to investigation as it led the horseman in the present instance he dismounted and forcing his body through the aperture came upon the dank twilight well and looked down then as his eyes adapted their vision to the gloom he saw that ineffectual hands had been busy at the gratingfiling at itchipping at the stones in which it was embeddedvainly in that cabined space endeavouring to force it from its iron grip hm muttered he as he rent his way to the daylight once more luck and mr turk are my guardian angels hitherto i must face this business in sober earnest walking round to the front again he saw that sir david had ridden away and that whimple was standing at the porch watching the operations of the men waiting until they were alone together for a momentwhy did you never tell me of that attempt on the priests hole said he quietly nothing of course in reply but that same cursed look of distress and muttering of near inaudible evasions here he said in the same tone take my horse he walked through the house till he came to a certain dreary stone chamber and to a ring set in the boards here he wrenched up the flap and leapt into the dusky hole beneath there was no sign there of the least success having attended the efforts of the baffled rogues the grating was immovable in its socket stones and stanchions wedded endurably a narrow ledge for a seat projected from one side of the pit using this as a steppingstone he scrambled out and hurried off to superintend the placing of his furniture leaving the flap open chapter xx it was on the second day after the arrival of the furniture that the surcharged storm that had so long been lowering over the caretakers head burst in an explosion of thunder that was near attended with tragic consequences in the interval mr tuke had been too greatly occupied with other business to give consideration to or take action in that little matter of the worthy mr breeds and his fartooheady wine glancing askance indeed at the subject with his minds eye now and again he felt a degree of perplexity as to the course it would be anything less than futile for him to pursue inasmuch as nothing definite in the way of roguery had succeeded his drugging and it was quite open to the landlord to affirm that a dogtired guest had fallen sound asleep over his bottle but for the present adequate debate of the subject must be adjourned sine die and in the meantime the gentlemen of the dog and duck were leaving him to all appearance peaceably alone now on that particular morning he took stock of his newlyequipped and carpeted rooms with a feeling of satisfaction such as a rescinded sentence of exile might have afforded him a few days more would see the advent of such servants as he had thought himself justified in engaging through his agent and then his house would be ordered for all immediate purposes and he himself served and tended somewhat as befitted his condition delsrop furnished was a very different livingplace to the gusty and melancholy habitation of his hitherto experience and for the first time since his arrival he was feeling a certain sense of homelinessshadowy indeed but with a faint warmth in it that was a little earnest of comfort to come much of course remained to doso much in fact that in moments of depression he would liken his present accomplishment to putting new wine into old bottles the grounds were still a wilderness the outbuildings tottering to their fall the canker of decay was eaten into the very plasterepidermis of the house itself still the husk remained splendidly durablea stubborn fortress from which to direct operations and in this at least was matter for most sincere selfcongratulation in the prospect of an established household he was considerably exercised in his mind as to what course to pursue with whimple and his overburdening sister did he consult his own commonsense he would get rid of them both without any further humouring of indecision but to this outright action he could not bring himself and that from an aggravating sentiment no less than a motive of policy as to the latter he must needs hesitate before returning to the enemy their possible confederate whose weakness lay in his unconsciousness of surveillance as to the former inexplicable and irritating as it was he could not deny even to himself that for some unaccountable reason he took a secret interest in the poor creatures personalitywas aware of a perverse desire in his own heart that the man would by some means succeed in disabusing him of the prejudice he had formed against him and end by becoming his devoted and confidential servant against this last wish or emotion unformulated as it was he would bitterly rebel but the germ of it quickened in him nevertheless now having dined and smoked a pipe of good tobacco he wandered off into his grounds easy and ruminative and gave thought pleasantly to the brighter side of things pushing presently into the dense shrubbery that skirted the stockbridge road he came suddenly upon a little clearing amongst the bushes in the middle of which was a bricked dome or segment of masonry something after the shape of an esquimaux hut which protruded from the ground and was accessible by way of a low door or trap of rotted wood against this last he kicked driving it open and was aware of a pit within deepish but halfchoked with weedy rubbisha disused icehouse by every token of shape and situation mouth of hades on the dead plains of enna he murmured with a little selfpreening smile over his remembered classics and he fell adreaming as he strolled away in that trance of paganism that enwraps many who give licence to their imaginations in silent woods but who shall be my persephone he breathed and thought of one or other of two most meet for abduction he felt his arms aboutwhom no matter the broken cellar served his fancy for a spell and unguessed by him was to serve his experience by and by with tougher matter than daydreams suddenly issuing from a dank dumb little track amongst the bushes he found himself looking over the ruined garden to the rear of the lodge he jerked to a halt amongst the compact weediness of depraved vegetable stuff thridding the cumbered paths and alleys of straggled fruit trees moved the girl darda she sang to herself in that odd wild voice of hers the stinging disharmonies of which seemed to flicker up in the flame of her hair then in a moment she had drifted into the gloom of the porch and vanished at that the watcher came out into the open and stepping softly followed in silent pursuit he could not have explained what impelled him to it only it seemed to him a natural countermove in that game of secrecy and suspicion he had set his wits to master stealthily he stole down the littered passagestealthily put foot in the dusk room where the museum was he might pad it like an ojibbeway but she heard him she heard him and turned her eyes opening chatoyant she was standing near the loaded shelves fingering somethinga round yellow flintstone by the look of itthat she had lifted from its place amongst the collection what have you there said he curious and masterful at once she did not answer but she snatched the object to her bosom and glinted at him with adumbrated pupils let me see it he said advancing a step at that she gave out a thin little tale of screams like the cry of a shot rat and retreating into a black corner hugged her treasure with a frantic closeness its not for you she cried its hisdenniss it was thrown through the window to him that night you went awooing to chatters thrown by whom you jade how should i know the shadows were thick about the house they cried to get back to their dark hole under the floor against daylight but he wouldnt let them and they stormed and wept i would have opened the door and given them passage but he is wise my wise brother and he forbade me they must bid higher first said he it was as if a dark veil fell over the listeners face go on he muttered they cried to him but he withdrew and would give no answer and they entreated long till my heart sobbed for them let them in dennis i prayed but he said they must bid higher then they threw this thing and it cracked through the lattice and he crept softly and took it up and read and cast it down again make no sound he whispered to me and they will think we are gone but i went secretly and picked up the stone and all night long the shadows moaned about the house she screamed again with a note of fury startled out of terror for her master had pounced upon her and wrung the treasure from her grasp she fought with him clawing and spitting like a cat but he beat her off as he would have any wild animal and rushed out to the light here in a moments gain of time he looked and read what was roughly scrawled in pencil upon the smooth surface of the stone half the profits were the wordsif you lead us to the lake of wine he had space to no more than decipher this when the wild creature was upon him again stand off he cried furiously backing from her with a white face stand off i must have a word with your brother he heard her swift step behind him as he raced up the drive he might have been conscious of a certain lack of dignity in the situation had his passion allowed his reason a moment to itself it did not it leapta white consuming blaze that seemed to roar the louder with the wind of his going for here at last he held in his very hand a damning proof of the guilt he had so long suspected in the fierce triumph of its possession he forgot caution policyeverything but the lust to crush under a savage heel the reptile he had warmed and cherished at his hearth no doubt that little rebellious emotion we wot of was reacting upon itself with a double hate of its own weakness he writhed to think that he had ever admitted it to his counsels but his revenge should be proportionate an evil chance drove him upon his victim on the very threshold of the hall and he had him by the throat before the poor wretch could so much as guess his purpose here here he yelled holding up the stone i have the proof at length you dogyou currish hypocrite to be in the league against me the mans face had gone of a mortal whiteness he struggled feebly master he gasped the others fury came to a bestial head he threw down the stone and struck the poor creature on the mouth silence he shrieked i know it allive heard all the truth i tell you you shall swing for it by god you shall mad to give expression to his ungovernable rage he flung himself upon the shivering form and seized and tore it along the passage while it pleaded to him in hoarse terror and clutched vainly at whatever projections came in its way suddenly conscious of his purpose it gave up a shrill scream and writhed frantically in his hands no no cried the man not therenot there give me time to speak oh my god i shall go mad of the horror of that place they had struggled to within a few feet of the priests hole the flap yet remained open as mr tuke had left it you will go in panted the latter beating under his victim by mere furious force of muscle you will go in and lie and rot till i can carry you to winton gaol down with you in his stumbling wrestle with the halffainting creature he twisted about saw something and let go his prey for a moment whimple fell back as if he were dying and on the instant the other struck up and caught darda by the wrist a thin flash of steel went above their heads and there was the sound of a knife ringing on the boards there was no bloodletting but the moral was as if there had been the fever of passion in the man was subdued to a worser coldness of cruelty not yet he said in a low voice his eyes holding her like evil magnets not yet you pretty animal in a moment he leapt at her lifted her light form in his arms and clapping his hand over her shrill voluble mouth bore her to the front of the house and rolling her without closed and bolted the door upon her then he returned with smiling lips to the other he lay as he had left himcowering exhausted halfstupid with terror already it seemed tuke leaned and took the impassive form under the arms with his foot he shuffled the limp trailing legs over into the pit and so lowered the body with a single heave it went down unresistingly save for a broken moan or two and sank into a huddled heap at the bottom he raised the flap and stood an instant looking down there was little motion below him or sign of life but a weak fitful whimpering feeling as one who stubbornly signs his own soul to the devil he closed the pitmouth secured it and walked away with his heart thumping and there rose up to and pursued him a long dreary whine like that of a dog baying the moon chapter xxi it would seem something a matter for a wonder that a lady of miss roystons refinement and varied capacity for ideals should be content to lead so long an annual series of her days to a pastoral retirement a month in london about the chill opening of the year and another later at epsom tunbridge wells or perhaps newmarket would comprise the wonted period of her absence from chatters this may have been so according to choice or necessity but it was probably dictated by the first in greatest degree it is true her brothers smug goodhumoured little face misexpressed a character very fairly endowed with determination he was and desired to be a country squire and though he subscribed with infinite complacency to the extremest fashions of the town it was only that he might thereby hold his neighbours to the right quantity of respect in alluding to his position amongst them he would figure in their eyes no will levett with a cudgel for assembly rooms and still less a london fribble sporting with squirearchy but a courteous lord of acres who should exemplify the best characteristics of both and the exaggerations of neither but his heart was with the country and therefore it might be supposed that miss angela in her rustic retirement made a cloisteral virtue of necessity it might be and wrongfully i believe for this young ladys tastes held much in common with those of her brother enjoying different interests but adapted to similar conditions perhaps she found a world of trees and flowers most fitting to her many excursions in romance perhaps she preferred conducting her own chorus of praise at chatters to playing upon heartstrings in the crowded orchestras of fashion certainly she never had a mind to fiddle second and possibly shrunk on that account from the necessity of ever assuming herself outrivalled in that claim for leadership so passionately advanced by successive strings of town lgantes however that may be her capacity for situations was extreme her sensitiveness to any least appeal of the emotions a perpetual excuse for what in a less gifted creature would have passed for a most engaging inconstancy indeed to thwart her in some pursuit of an ideal was to feel the full force of the passion that impelled her to the chase so for some nine months of the year she held at her brothers house her little feudatory court and found in the faithful homage of her squireens a spring of content so untinged by jealousy or the necessity of it as that it seemed the very rejuvenating water of life there did she tire of poetry she smiled upon music in a way to make it almost in tune with itself did she fall out of touch with handel she sickened as it were of art and painted her name with an elegant flourish on the bright margin of the sky did she weary of tom she handed him over for decent burial in a homelier heart and coquetted with dick during the whole of a st martins summer and for all she did there was the appropriate background of woods and freshets and frisking lambs that seemed to justify her most erratic courses for the trees changed month by month and the freshets swelled to torrents and the lambs frisked into mutton with fat wool and were shorn now about the period of mr tukes invasion of her fields of romance she was in her state aurelian and bursting its shell her butterfly fancy lighted on him never before had she happened upon so dear a flower for the engagement of her sensibilities she tested him with her delicate antenn and found him full of a rough honey that charmed her palate exceedingly he had thorns but with her little nippers she could pinch the tips off these and make them harmless she fell into a really parlous state and seemed to learn her womanlinessthough she was rising twentysevenin a single sweet hour his image had dwelt with her ever since it was with her now as she stepped over the threshold of chatters in her ridinghabit for she was for a canter with her brother and secretly she hoped to come across him in the course of it sir david was already in the saddle and a groom held her horse at the very moment she came forth she heard her brother utter an exclamation and saw a light bounding figure fling itself towards him and catching at his saddlebow make some appeal to him with a frenzy of gesture it was the girl darda as she sawhoodless flushed and dishevelled and the lady looked on a little amazed and with a fine attitude of scorn towards a creature who could so forego the ethics of her sex under the stimulus of excitement what is it davy she said descending the steps and coldly ignoring the wildeyed young woman who as indifferently returned her contempt with utter disregard of her presence sir david looked perplexed and troubled hush he said to the girl who still pleaded with him in a low clamour of words darda fell silent but she looked round on miss royston with lowered brows and her white teeth set doggedly rabbit it cried the little baronet in perturbation im foundered angel what shall i do we are going for a ride are we not yes but lookee here the girl says tuke accuses her brother of some villainy and hath shut him up in the priests hole he can do as he likes with his own i presume darda broke into a mad outcry shame on you she screamedthat can lock your womans breast from pity with a key of gold hes poor and friendless or such as you would never dare to speak so silence girl said sir david sternly but his sister had flushed up a very stormy red the fellow hath no more than his deserts ill warrant she said loudly it must be ill managing a craven and an idiot sir david vaulted from his saddle miss angels fingers were nervous with her little ridingwhip and her pale eyes glinted like broken flints have reason angel he said quickly what if i have small ground to interfere dennis is my old friend and by cock i cant believe him guilty of aught but weakness at the worst there must be some mistake at least i can do no harm by seein the master darda caught his hand and kissed it passionately you will let him free she cried come come come every minute maddens him that he lies among the shadows you dont know what that is put my fine lady there and cure her of the vapours her fingers crooked with desire to mangle the fair face near her come she shrieked againor that devil will have his own i tried to stab him but he saw and struck the knife out of my hand sir david started back oh he cried with a fallen face whats that i must ride over in good truth follow you darda and keep those wicked fingers out of the fire miss royston stepped forward haughtily the groom a passive but greatly interested spectator of this pretty scene touched his cap and held down his hand for stirrup if you really intend it said the lady making on a sudden thought a virtue of inclination i will come with you there may be bad blood fired where one interferes unwarrantably with the actions of another i think not said sir david quietly if mr tuke is the man i take him to be but come angel you may serve as an argument where none of mine would carry she gave a light laugh as she was lifted into her saddle you flatter me brother she said i will persuade in the language of flowers and you by clublaw we will see which hath the better wit she flicked up her horse and whether by accident or design drove it brushing against darda as she stood near the girl sprang back almost with an oath on her lips some day perhaps she muttered in her teethsome day perhaps you shall set your wit against bright steel mistress and see which is the sharper she caught sight of sir david turning in his saddle and beckoning her to follow and waved to him and cried wildly i am coming to a view hulloa said the attentive groom with a grin run un to earth gal in the priests hoal oh my he cried jeeringly as she struck at him aimlessly in passing and sped on her way chapter xxii mr tuke sat in his dininghall swollen and glowering as a ruffled tomcat he had not struck in haste to repent at leisure but it is true that he was woefully exercised in his mind as to what to do next the logical sequence of his action he felt should be incarceration for his prisoner in winton gaol on the strength of an informationhis ownlaid against him certainly and how should the information be worded it was at this point he always fell to gnawing his lips and drumming on the table with his fingers and glaring at a robin on the windowsill as if he knew it could furnish the solution if it would only leave off hopping and twittering now he had done rightly and as he had engaged himself to act he had bided his time and struck on the first evidence of guilt still now he came to think it overwith what impartiality he could commandhe could not but acknowledge that the proofs might show extremely negative to an unbiased intelligence for what did they amount to crime no but the invitation to it what would be the value of his solitary pice de conviction in the eye of the law a moral inference was too short a rope to hang a man with he could say only his servant was tempted but what was to show that it was to his undoing moreover he had not even taken the precaution to retain possession of the condemning stone on this last thought he sprang up and went hastily out into the hall to and fro he searched but without result the flint with its scrawled hieroglyphics was gone he unbolted and threw open the front door halfexpecting to find darda huddled accusatory under the porch whither he had pushed her near an hour ago she was not there nor anywhere about was the stone and he returned to his lonely hall and his complex selfcommunings he was deep in them when he heard the sound of hoofs on the gravel outside and a moment later the voice of his friend of chatters pronouncing his name here he cried and grasped sir david warmly by the hand as the latter pushed open the room door and entered he was unfeignedly glad to see him the more so perhaps from a certain uneasy memory of his somewhat churlish attitude towards the little man when last they had met what brings you over he cried gladly but you are welcome for any reason darda fetched me said sir david with a little tremor in his voice the devil she did he was scanning the others face attentively and inquiringly well he said that saves me an explanation she has told you i am cursed in the fellow blythewood i find him in league with those ruffians and what to do with him the lord knows where is he i have him under bolt and board for the present in the priests hole ah she hath informed you it serves as a lockhouse pro tempore and until i can hale the rogue before the leet of winton and procure his committal how did you force him in thereinto that hole i mean and he smitten with terror no doubt smitten as you say he was halfdead with it he went in like a log harkee tuke you must have him out again the other stared i mean it said the baronet firmly saints forbid tis any concern of mine to interfere do you elect to hold him fast but dup the poor wretch in decent quarters tuke and not in a hole twere a shame to fling a dog into i have my own methods and places said the lord of delsrop mighty haughtily is that what you came to say a flush of resentment crimsoned sir davids face yes said he and some more to a harder purpose on the word he reigned in his anger shortly and a smile broke from his lips there he cried frankly i come set on discretion and this is the result tis no business of mine i allow but i have an old tenderness for the man tuke and it wrings me to think of him maddening down there i regret the necessity is it one waiving the question of the priests holeare you so convinced of his guilt else would my treatment of him lack a warrant sir david blythewood ah you are offended with me i cant help it irabbit it tuke twill out twill out i resent your treatment of the man you come amongst us a stranger and god knows i would be friendly with ye but ye start on a cross scent here where an older member of the pack would hunt true and you would have us all follow your lead dye think i dont know more about dennis in twenty year than you have found out in a month or two or three i stake my faith youre misled somewhere and that the mans innocent of evil intent whatever the appearances mr tuke smiled very politely and acidly tis always a pleasure to hear a gentlemans opinions said he but a fact will knock the most stubborn of them on the head you meanthe girl quoted some folly o writin on a stone just so it happens to be a piece of incriminating evidence may i see it really sir david you must take my word i know of only one course if you must insist upon questioning it i understand i shall not be lacking if need comes believe me i tell you to your face you are arrogatin the rights of the executive and more in casting one into that foul pit on a whisper of suspicion there are constables sir and a justice of the peace within a couple of miles of your door and your proper course was to lay an information with him and see my bird fly meanwhile you could detain him but not there i see my mistake then twas the best bedroom should have been put at his service and the window closed from draughts sir david turned to go with considerable dignity mr tuke he said over his shoulder i stake my reputation on the mans honesty and i say you are treating him vilely and inhumanly i shall have the honour of sendin a friend to you the other bowed grimly and was advancing to show his visitor out when both gentlemen were aware of an apparition in the doorway standing white and rebukeful with clasped hands fie angel cried the baronet youve been listening whether to cover her confusion at the charge or to top the situation appropriately miss angela at this flung herself down into the room and on to her brothers breast davy davy she cried in an anguished voice youre not going to fight and he answered fretfully get up youre squashin my shirtfrill mr tuke came forward gallantly the girl had stepped back with an air of frightened indecision with one hand she adjusted a tumbled curl the other she held out as if for an examination by love the doctor her knight assumed the rle and bending kissed the little active pulse you have been daydreaming he said your brother and i are great friends she looked up at him chidingly mr tuke she implored then said she if you are great friends take one anothers hands the two glanced each at each comically but neither moved there she cried is it for you to deceive a woman you were going to fight and what about not you my dear said sir david fie she said blushing tis never gentlewomen that set gallants by the ears i would take it no honour brother to call yours in question the two had nothing to say i demand to know she cried imperiously stamping her foot madam stuttered mr tukeitit merely turns on a difference of opinion she courtesied to him very prettily the lion and the bear she said were een glad to lie down and take breath when by comes a fox and seizes the prey they were too exhausted to dispute him the possession of doth the difference of opinion turn on one imprisoned hard by here enters the fox good gentlemen and offers herself an arbitrator she stepped up to the master of the house and held out her palm it is like a little cradle for a cupid he said nonsense sir i want the key of your dungeon have i not earned it he laughed there is none he said but a bolt in the floor may i shoot it back twould bruise your little fingers wofully but i have a heel sirthat can kick against the pricks i must add or my gentle brother will say it for me mr tuke spoke more seriously well said he i leave the issue in your hands i am loth to release the fellow he hath conspired against me i think and believe and hath no more than his deserts but after all it is a little thing if it please you and i will not even hold you responsible for his safe custody hold me cried sir david eagerly and he bent and whispered in his sisters ear thanks angel you were rightyou have the better wit the girl was turning radiantly to her cavalier when there came the sound of quick breathing at the door and there stood darda her hand to her panting side her face set in an expression of bitter resentment her she gasped pointing at miss roystonher to plead for him and take the credit to feed her beastly vanity withal she shantill tear her wi my nails first tuke stood at watch release the man if you will miss royston he said your brother will conduct and assist you i must stay and look after this pretty member of my household as he spoke the mad creature sprung forwards but he was quick and caught her in his arms where she writhed screaming make haste he saidand is it not an enviable rle to be a keeper of wild beasts sir david hurried his sister from the room she threw her knight a very grateful rose of gratitude over her shoulder as she went as they passed out tuke tightened his grip almost cruelly on the struggling girl suddenly she fell passive in his hands he looked down and she up at him her face running with tears dont hurt me she said with a catching sob i will be quiet will you give me your word not to stir from here till i bid you yes she answered faint and pathetic and not to touch the lady when she returns yes all in a moment she sank down at his feet crying as if her heart were broken he will see an angel in her she moaned and will love her for releasing him chapter xxiii at breakfast the next morning darda waited upon her master with swollen eyes and a very sullen manner of attention he was in a strange mood himself compound of perplexity and exaltation in the girls piteous acknowledgment of his mastery over her he had warmed to a toleration of her foibles that was almost a regard for her as something a possession of his own he could secretly applaud that loyalty to her brother whenafter venting itself in rebellion against his own mandatesit sunk from arrogance to a heartbroken appeal to his mercy having subdued he could be gentle with her moreover reason resuming a certain sway over his passions he felt he had acted hastily in that little question of the priests hole but there was a third and very engaging side to his meditationsa thought that by stooping his stiff neck to the thread of a little glossy sandal he had tacitly pronounced himself in humble subjection to the owner thereof in fact that by submitting miss royston as his proxy of grace he had indirectly suggested in thin outline a declaration to her his perplexity was for the brother with whom matters stood as on the first entrance of miss angel and with regard to whose threatened affaire dhonneur no hint of apology had issued from either side assuredly he could not stand up to the manling and seek to let blood that was of a common source with that of his demigoddess as surely for all his tender respect for that same heavenly ichor he was not going to lend himself to a solitary peppering from motives of delicacy but who was to make the first advances he preferred putting this on one side that he might obtain the better mental view of a picture that stuck very agreeably in his memory this was of angela all flushed and softened bending down to him from her horse as she sat mounted for her departure he is very ill and overcomethe poor servant she had said be gentle with him for my sake and he had kissed her gloved hand and taken rash oath that her whim should be his law and beyond this i will swear he never reflected that she had made nothing of the presumed villainy of the man as it affected his masters safety or that she had asked him robert tuke to take care of himself for her sake he came out of luminous retrospection to find his maids eyes fixed upon him with intently mournful regard come here darda said he the girl obeyed at once and stood mutely at his side your brother remains in bed you say yes is he ill or merely shamming he is broken downbroken down and very ill she spoke in a low troubled voiceso low that her master could barely distinguish the words he shifted his position so as to meet her full face her eyes answered the inquiry of his with some sad crippled defiance darda he said you tried to kill me you know that was stupid and wicked for only great trouble could have come to you both had you succeeded but i forgive you for you struck in passion and out of your love for that other now tell meyou saw the stone and was i not justified in putting him there on the strength of it it would have killed himthe shadows would have killed him in a little time ah we men are made of tougher clay not heno not he he conspired against me it is a lie he never did but the stone says so then it lies ask him he will tell you the truth i have it in my mind to do so i will go now he rose as he spoke and went towards the door halfway he turned and came back to the girl again i have no wish to be harsh with either of you he said gently could i convince myself you were faithful to my interests i could prove i think a generous master he took her by the chin looked in her eyes earnestly a moment and went from the room she stood a full minute upright and rigid as he had left her then suddenly the tears were rolling down her passive face she murmured some inaudible words bent and with a passionate forlorn gesture kissed the back of the chair on which he had been seated and so flung herself down against it and twisting her arms about her head remained quite still in the meantime mr tuke was ascending the stairs to a little room in the north wing he moved preoccupied with a certain pulse of embarrassment fluttering in his breast and tapped on the door he sought when he reached it halfapologetically there might have been an answer from withinthe mere shadow of a broken murmur without more ado he turned the handle and entered a figure startled up on the trucklebed and gazed at him with terrified eyes it was ghastly with the pallor of tortured nerves and of a sudden it turned staring over its shoulder and clutched frantically at the headboard oh god it whispered not again i cant bear it the implied deadly reproach the conviction driven home that he a humane man by nature had in one gust of passion caused this mortal wreck and disaster pierced the intruders heart with a keen blade of remorse he stood where he had stopped whimple he said gently you need fear no more violence if i meditated you such i could not be guilty of the inhumanity in your present state something in his tone or his expression reassured the poor terrified creature gradually he loosened his hold of the bedhead and turning sat up on his pillow what do you want he whispered i want to know one thing i want to have a direct answer to a simple question are you conspiring against me before god no there was a moments silence then said mr tuke representations have been made to me i own i acted with unconsidered haste if i have wronged you i am sorry swear to me that your part in the business of that stone was an unwitting onethat you are blameless and i will believe you and ask your pardon suddenly the eyes of the weak fellow on the bed filled with tears sir sir he cried in a full voice oh if you will only be good to meyou willi can see iti can the other saw him about to fling himself out of bed and forestalled the act by stepping hastily up to him whimple seized his hand in a fervid clasp and looked up in his face i swear it he said halfchoking from first to last however the villains tempted me i gave them no answer i never knew the girl had got the stone or that you would think to read my baseness in it i have desired so earnestly to serve you faithfully from your first comingto win into your favour and your confidence but i saw you would never let methat the curse of my inheritance was on me for ever and ever what inheritance my poor fellow the servant had bowed his head but he looked up eagerly upon hearing the gentle tones may i tell youno not that but if you will let mei have much to say that i have never dared to say yet i am a coward and i dare so little perhaps living in the shadow of this haunted place has wrought upon and unnerved me but now if you will let mei have so longed to ask your leaveto lean humbly upon your boldness and your strength and learn if i could to be a man at last tuke held up a warning finger ah no said the other i am not exciting myself into a fever master if you only knew how i have sickened with the desire to unburden myself to you but i dared not and i saw the suspicion and distrust grow in your eyes and then i dared less and less tell me now what it is you have wished to say will you let me will you be content to take a humble servants word for the truth of what he states when at the same time he implores you not to force him answer where he fain would be silent a thundering preface go on my friend i believe that what you do elect to tell me will be gods truth oh yes yes yes sir i would ask youdo you knowdid you ever hear who was the last tenant of delsrop i have heard twas one turk some dull saturnine fellow that met an unchancy fate god help him by such a name was he known he took me into his employment here scarce a month before he was murdered the deuce he did oh sir twas the first of my misdirected attitude towards you that i dreaded you would cast me forth did you learn my last service had been with a highwayman a highwayman he was indeed were the truth confessed as wicked and notorious an outlaw as ever hoodwinked the justices and his name cutwater cutwater good heavens surely a past generation was familiar with it well i fear this was the mancome hither to live on the fruits of his illgotten gains and so to his dreadful fate mr tuke he diedgod pity himaccording to his deserts but he left a terrible heritage of evil the listener sat halfbewildered by the revelation the little cloud that had once before gathered about his fathers memory broadened and grew darker from a thief of the road then had he passed on this pregnant estate to his son haunted in truthperhaps as the price of blood and the earnest of deeds too foul for mention go on he muttered once continued the servant in a low fearful voice men came to the house while i was there he forced me to be present and there followed a dreadful scene the worst of thembloody jack fernwas spokesman him you have seen sir have i aye aye i note the rascals white hair yes it is he it seemed my master the highwayman held a great stone of value that they all claimed a share in twas called as you will know the lake of wine the plot opens out he denied them with oaths of fury they had been paid their price like any other clerks of office they swore the stone was hid somewhere in the house and they would have it out he barred the door and they made at him it was numbers only that emboldened them for he was bitter feared of all and a devil in strength and resource he caught the first of themoh my god i fall sick to think of it nowhe was a blythe young fellowand broke his neck across his knee for years the snap and the cough sounded in my dreams well well it was horrible as you say at that they all drew back cowed as whipped dogs i was halffainting and can remember little more i was only a lad of eighteen at the time and nerveless even then but i know that they went carrying away their dead and that they buried somewhere in the grounds i have never dared to think where sir it was only a day or two after that my master disappeared and in the meantime i thought myself like to die and fled upon his mere approach but on the night of his murder they all came backwhile he was swinging on the downsand they forced entrance to the house by heavens mercy i escaped and hid myself in the woods there i lay in hunger and wretchedness for days till desperate with starvation i stole back for food then i saw the place ransacked and overturnedmuch as twas when you first cameand mr creel taking inventory of the ruin so twas evident a mad search had been conducted but fruitless as afterwards appeared a moment my friend i must needs marvel here a little why did you not quit mr cutwaters service when you were informed of mr turks real character whimple slunk back against the bedhead and put his hands before his face and why did the gentleman take you of all people into his confidence there was no reply well said tuke i perceive this is a point you are sensitive of leave it unanswered then the man looked up gratefully if you will only rest content sir with thisthat he desired to wean me from honest courses which failing he pursued me with all the hatred of his heart a piece of unconscionable villainy and had he taken you from other honest employ for the purpose it was so sir i was drudge hitherto in a lads school in old melcombe regis by the sea ahwell you happened on mr creel and heaven favour the good gentleman how he had the news i know not but so it seemed he represented the succeeding owner of delsrop sir i crept back for food though the place was my horror and my despair i had no stomach feckless creature that i was to force a living elsewhere i crept back and something drove me to tell mr creel my whole unhappy tale and he believed and pitied me and put me in charge of the house that had been my bane and my prison and here have i dwelt ever since at first in great terror that the men would return but gradually learning a sad serenity as the years passed and nought occurred to discomfort me and how would you account for your immunity from further trouble ahtwas een that they durst not return to the scene of their crime while yet the hue was up and so maybe with such villains one came to be hanged and another transported till all were goneall but him they called bloody jack fern who hath reappeared after twenty peaceful years to renew the search but the othershis present confederates they are new to me he must have fellowrogues be sure to whom he will confidenot like that other whom they murdered who was of those few giants of crime that can be a tower of strength to themselves why my good soul i could swear to a note of enthusiasm in your voice oh sir tis nothing but the natural homage of the weak to the strong such as i would fain pay to my new master would he let me no flattery and so mr fern turned up again it was the very day before your arrival that i first saw him the thatch of his white hairs might not deceive me and i thought i should ha died after all those years and the place gone to ruin in that long space and only i its keeper for this the fearful man had found out but not of your coming that should upset his planselse had i been likely stiff by this time and rotting underground in some secret hole and he sought to bribe you he hath wrought upon me with menaces and promise of reward either to reveal the stones hidingplacewhich he misdoubts i wot not ofor to give him secret searchwarrant during your absences yet i must wonder how he ventured to assume your infidelity nor dreaded you would acquaint me of all ah sir had he not known me in the pay of that other his master the which he used to threaten me never doubting my old complicity and all this you have resisted good fellow with your heart choking in your mouth i have so desiredindeed i have so desired sir to be thought clean and honest and when your dislike fell upon me i despaired of convincing you how i was no partner to any roguery and the hopelessness of explaining wrought upon me till i half seemed to myself the very distrustful knave of your suspicions it is changedit is all changed we will circumvent the rascals and net them in the toils of their own weaving the servant bent forward his fevered eyes sparkling such dear confidence as i have sickened for he cried to look upon your face and see the bold light break from it and know i am trusted and believed in that shall be so dennis now one thing i mind me you have made no mention ofyour sister she was brought to me sir the first year of my carekeeping and here by mr creels permission she remained brought to you whence and by whom the answer was near inaudible by a woman that juggled in a travelling show they had thought to use the mite to a like trade but her wits ran crooked with their wants and they were glad to be quit of an encumbrance she was a natural from the firsta queer wild midget that was for ever wandering by down and fell and storing like a magpie her pitiful wreck of treasures she was but a snip of five or so when she brought that homethat homeoh sir the horrible gallowstree that i never dared within eyeshot of but would walk a mile to avoid once more a pause fell and so you have told me all said mr tuke by and by whimples colour heightened but he was silent all that is material i mean twill serve twill serve and the rest go hang now i have wronged you dennis and we shall een be friends according to our positions the man fell into thanks with a broken voice nay said the other for all my strength you flatter i can ill afford to walk my difficult path without support and tell meyou have no least knowledge or surmise of where this mighty gem lies hid i know no more by my honour sir than bloody jack himselfor whether indeed the fact of its existence be not a bug of evil mens fancy that i can answer for i have heard from whom the jewel was stole in the first instance and now mr dennis whimple i must ask if you relate all this for my private ear for i must inform you the interests of another are gravely compromised in the matter ah sir do you not offer me your noble protection before i stood in bitter desperate loneliness i place the issue joyfully in your hands to act as you anyhow will upon my statement you shall not misprofit thereby take rest good fellow and we will come to further discussion hereafter i am welli am restored you have made a man of me chapter xxiv blythewood said mr tuke twould be a rare thing could we light on this boglegemsucceed where a whole troop of cutthroats had failedand bribe luvaine to sanity thereby but i confess it strikes me hard that i am to serve meanwhile as whippingboy to his rueful worship to know him warm in his blankets while the vermin overrun my estate o cold nights for a treasure he hath lost tis the fortune of battle tuke and like cryin god bless his majesty for the favour of a bayonetthrust under kings button yes but i seek no glory but you seek a jewel that could serve you with an army of it and consider the wound will go on sloughin while the bullet is in we must get to work tomorrow by your leave portion delsrop into squares like a chessboard and hunt it over foot by foot tis the only way the two were riding in company whereby it will be seen that not only was the breach between them healed but that the older man had taken the younger into his further confidence this was all as it should be the quarrel had been a paltry one and once convinced of his wrongheadedness the lord of wastelands like the gracious gentleman he was had not hesitated to offer a handsome apology that was as courteously received a few words a jolly laugh or so over a bottle of oporto and the two were faster friends than they had been as yet now as fruit of close discussion they were on their way to an interview with mr breeds and dennis rode in their company at a distance behind like a feat squire of knighterrantry it was comical and pathetic this good fellows earnest conduct of the post he had long coveted his eye was bright and alert for surprises his air a perpetual rehearsal of keenness that should not be caught napping an atmosphere of mild braggadocio went with himan assumption of swagger that was like a property cuirass on the breast of an inoffensive super and yet having regard to his upbringing he was fine and faithful and even courageous in a certain degree of proportion the two gentlemen rode up to the dog and duck and dismounting committed their horses to the servant and walked straightway into the tap as they entered a scuffling sound like the dive of a ponderous rat behind the wainscot preceded them and standing still they were aware of some apoplectic breathing stifling in the little barparlour mr tuke stepped up to the counter landlord said he loudly a bottle of port if you please the breathing subsided with a rolling noise as if a heap of nuts were settling down on the floor and suddenly the great blotched face of mr breeds appeared in the doorway port your honour said he in a tremulous voice i take your honours order he disappeared and returning in a moment with a bottle hugged in his fat hands moved officiously to the counter where he tweaked a greasy forelock to his worshipful customers hold it up manhold it up the cork to your eye and the good black body to your own so shall i see to tap it the landlord uttered a thick scream mr tuke oh gods pity sir you aint agoin to shoot me he had lifted the bottle as bidden and lo there was the muzzle of a wicked horsepistol pointed straight at his breast the two gentlemen laughed why said the elder i want to make sure this time the stuff isnt tampered with hold steady while i knock the neck off nerveless with terror the man let fall the bottle simply because he couldnt hold it and dropping on his pads of knees howled for mercy god save me siri never did the wine wasnt hocussed sir your honour saw the cork drawn at thisharkee fellow called sir david striking in dye think i a justice of the peace will endure this gallows game in our midst mr tuke laughed afresh oh fie mr breeds said he so you must own to a bin of readydrugged the landlord ducked behind the counter and cried abjectly from that beery covert dont shoot sirdont shoot if the stuff was headstrong twas none of my contriving there have been lither knaves compelling me of late the two men exchanged a glance well said mr tuke you can show your head above and een draw the cork after your own fashion the cumbrous creature scrambled to his feet puffing and sweltering and so manipulated the bottle with shaking hands and whither are your guests flown said one of the gentlemen meanin mr fern and his offscourings sir to botany bay whence they came is my desperate hope as cozening scoundrels your noble honours as ever practised on a decent innkeeper you were no party to their roguery then party the man was fussing and feinting with his corkscrew mr tuke sir i was terrified of my life while the reskels remained the shadow of em lay like as a blight on my custom and you have the assurance to tell me that they coerced you so help me sir they did with what object the man stuttered and went clammy answer fellow cried sir david i protest gentlemen i was unacquent of their intentions what you were compelled and you are ignorant whereto to shut my eyes sirto shut my eyes noble gentlemen thats the sum of my knowledge mr breeds said tuke quietly have you ever heard tell of the lake of wine he watched the man narrowly he could not have sworn to any particular intelligence in those viscous eyes not to my cost said the landlord with a sickly attempt at jocosity or i should fill my vats at it well said sir david impatiently you say your company is departed and whither to the gallows for all it concerns me sir and thither tis presumptive you may follow now i give you a note of warningtake thought of whom you house for the future he looked at the man sternly the latter had not a word to say but much abasement to express on the road home do you think he is in the plot said sir david yes by heavens i do a very doorkeeper to roguery he hath the wit to denounce guilt but not to look innocence then may i ask why the devil you named the stone to him to take him off his guard but the rascal was cunning yet the pack shall know now we are not ignorant of what they hunt perhaps by the time they reappearif everthe quarry will have been run down by us and luvaine the centre of attraction chapter xxv so said sir david we sum up our conclusions twas the notorious mr cutwater alias turk that represented the syndicate that robbed luvaines father of the stone one said miss angela using her tender knuckles after the fashion of an auctioneers hammer twas somewhere hereon this estate bought out of the proceeds of his robberiesthat he secreted the treasure two said miss angela and here his confederates sought him out murdered him yonder and made fruitless search for what he had sacrificed his life to hold three said miss angela and right worshipfully concluded peace you bantam tis but the introduction to the argument oh i crave your honours indulgenceand she looked round merrily at dennis who stood respectfully to the back of her chair now we gather said sir david with importance that of the ancient gang only mr fern hath cheated the gallows to return at this eleventh hour to the search but that he hath confided his plot to two or more lacking the greatness of the first rank of criminals put in whimple impulsivelyand so reddened to a fine afterglow of shame immediately he had spoken they all laughed and quoth miss angel how i love your inconsequence mr dennis i think that sympathy with giant wickedness a very admirable foil to your humanity she had taken a great interest in the servant since her mediation had procured him justice what if he had been a figure familiar to her experience for years past only recent circumstance had presented him in the light that could appeal to her effectivelythe melancholy twilight in fact of romance now she was bethinking herself how this mystic hermit of the thickets had lived out his twenty years or so of haunted solitude that he might at the end serve her sensibilities with a little passing thrill of excitement and she felt grateful to him and very considerate of his hectic cheeks their roses might have withered in the frost of death but for me she would ponder tenderly and then her heart would take some resentment over the confident tyranny of his lord that he had dared to sit in judgment on his intellectual superior for that the poor man is she thought and the other must learn that with us women brute strength unadorned is not the highest appeal to our favour here she dealt a little arbitrarily with justice for the master was perhaps less a fool than the servant was an athlete but the sentiment served her mood and showed her the way to many small condescensions towards the poor fellow who had suffered such misjudgment mr tuke could not but be conscious of this saucy subordination of his claims as a man of position it entertained or aggravated him according to his humour to watch this variable maid playing off his servant against himself in the innocuous subtilties of coquetry he could not be expected to take the effrontery seriously and he was not so deeply in love but that he could see the humour of the girls capricious attitude towards him but i am called upon to be aware of it he thought and i must effect to puzzle my brain over the question of what i can have done to imperil myself in her favour so he looked distressedwhen he remembered toand all the time thought none the less of miss royston for so representing the charming whimsies of the fascinating of her sex this rascally crew said sir david we make it our business to anticipate if a thorough ransackin of the whole house will serve our purpose miss angela jumped to her feet oh davy she cried have you reached it at last and our wits running ahead of yours from the first what a solemn conclusion little man only we came to it before you opened your mouth to speak and here sits mr tuke like a lord justice patiently waiting the verdict he hath directed you are a very knowin magpie said her brother with a wag of his round head but you aint as clever as youd take the credit for ive given you the steps to a conclusion thats all and now ill warrant youll go flingin off the last into space brava cried the lady clapping her hands all that is obvious goes for nothin as the philosopher would say for like all philosophers he is a little shaky in his finalities and now for the profound deduction you impident baggage exclaimed the lord of chatters he had been quite in his element taking judicial charge of the affair drawing inferences and suggesting methods and this irrepressible sister of his would do her worst to make him appear ridiculous tuke he said turning to that silent and amused gentleman when you marry marry a fool that knows herself to be one indeed said the other that is easy for any one that took me must needs answer to that description never hold me conceited after that miss royston now heaven knows what angela here chose to read between the lines but she responded most icily i doubt i shall take much interest in the matter sir though speaking generally there seems to me no conceit like exaggerated humility she sat herself down again her lips set forbiddingly sir david grinned mentally scoring a little spiteful victory and mr tuke looked very much bewildered and abashed indeed this sprightly lady suffered from a very common infirmity of poor humanityan incapacity for graciously accepting such knocks as she dealt to others one might unconsciously check her flow of spirits with the veriest straw of chaff and only discover the enormity haphazard sometimes her sensitive nature would build up a grievance from a single word so carelessly spoken and soon forgotten of the offender that when he would come to view the complicated fabric of resentment that had sprung therefrom he could only marvel at the astounding pregnancy of his speech my sister having pronounced said sir davidwith a point of his little rude tongue in the direction of that incensed ladyi come to the upshot of the apostleatesor whatever they are called and that is murmured mr tuke quite shyly why that it aint no good looking for the stone where its been looked for before tuke stole a glance at miss royston humbly and dumbly inviting her to endorse or quash this opinion she was rigidly silent well he asked not in the least knowing what he was inquiring about why ive said it exclaimed the other we neednt grub under the floors when by your own account the boards have been had up already by whimples account said tuke but youre right the rogues would have searched thoroughly where they did search then where to look i propose we each take two or three rooms to a share investigate as we will and meet and compare notes at dinnertime capital what dye say angel oh you can leave me out of the question what you aint goin to take part in the fun i have contributed my mite to it by serving as butt to the witticisms of two ingenious gentlemen miss royston exclaimed tuke aghast oh sir responded the lady frigidly twould argue a certain community of interests that hardly exists did i permit myself the familiarity of an informal intrusion upon your privacy but i can be quite happy here if you will vouchsafe me the society of mr whimple who will take no advantage i am sure of my condescension and who will not judge frankness to be an invitation to impertinence she capped this with quite an enigmatical little smile or if you desire his services for yourself she said i can order out my horse and return to chatters sir david was softly chuckling preliminary to a sad explosion of laughter tuke saw it and hastily put in a word i beg you will not disappoint me of your promised company to dinner you are very welcome to what you ask and your brother and i will hunt in company he bowed drew the little man from the room and to the far end of the passage without there the latter suddenly detained him his swollen face falling to an expression of great gravity lookee here he said i am in the darki am in the dark tuke will you take it friendly if i ask you to enlighten me are ye vexed wi the wenchs whimsies i am distressed to have offended her that wont serve i dont want to force your hand and angel hath the wit to play her own game but dyou seek my countenance theres the rub the other broke into a smile well said he i wont pretend to misconstrue you im most sincere in desiring miss roystons condescension then said sir david heres a lovers quarrel toward and a swan cant hatch without a crack of thunder is an old saw his countenance contracted portentous not that i may not have a word to say by and by quoth he for i am her guardian despite her independent jointure and by the token am determined to prudence but at the moment to inquire would be premature and unjustified well i shall hope to satisfy you said mr tuke with a twinkleand so to our goosehunt by grace of your permission chapter xxvi so far as two men could explore minutely the interior of a house so eccentrically designedon a plan that seemed indeed to affect an absence of all designas delsrop mr tuke and his guest did explore during the whole of that winter morning they measured walls and doors they tapped for vaults secret panels or intermural recesses they went down into the priests hole and convinced themselves that no hidingplace had been contrived anywhere in that well of dank and solid masonry they looked up chimneys stamped on flags in hope of answering reverberations prodded at ceilings hither and thither with a view to the discovery of some cunningly concealed hollow wherein it was possible the thing they sought might lie with all its crimson lustre quenched in dusk and darkness and it was only a complication of the puzzle that delsrops antecessor had left its roomswith one exceptiondesolate and unfurnished inasmuch as any chair or table or bureau would have offered itself a likelier depository for a treasure so selfcontained what could be done with bare walls and floors and ceilings but punch and measure them this the searchers did with all the thoroughness they could contrive and with a proportionate absence of result they even extended their investigations to the ruined outhouses and to the external case of the main building itselfobviously a desperate resource for here long ages growth of matted creepers bespoke a confidence of increase that for generations had never known restraint dense ivyinterwoven with leafless tendons of honeysucklethat showed lacework of muscular adolescence through every gap in its foliage fibrous vines that had never been schooled to culture and that hung out annual clusters of unfulfilled berriesa very tradition of rustic gaucherie with the gentlemen starlings winter jasmine that when the world is wrapped in chilling reserve protrudes a host of little red tongues in mockery of such selfimportancethese and others contributed to such a thickset of arborescence as it were idle to attempt to penetrate the roomthat one furnished chamberthey left to the last it was their moral refugetheir forlorn hope there at least was visible evidence of the material side of the longdead highwayman therein had he donned his guilty finery or doffed it and confided the secrets of his cancerous conscience to the fine lawn of his pillow and thereinunless a nice acumen should have led him to avoid that spot for his treasures hiding most patently inviting to common intelligenceswas it presumable the stone was concealed at length the two bent their steps to this inner temple of their expectations they were weary and a little depressed and they sat themselves down in a fan of weak sunlight that spread through the broad window sir david looked about him with some listless curiosityat the great posted bed at the massive carved wardrobe of sombre oak at the quaint old brassframed mirror on the dressingtable was this all as it stands when you came he said his inquisitiveness getting the better of his languor precisely as it stands then it belonged to cutwater i presume so by cock said the other dreamily introspective tis cursed strange to think that here the man prinked and made his toilet and slept his sleep like any decent citizen he was known by his blue coat and filigree lace ive heard tell and what bloody secrets may he not have locked into that wardrobe and what dumb witnesses to his villainy for he would take life by all accounts and was a terror in his day and was there nothin tukeno trace not a rag in all the room if any had been it had been cleared out before i came well he had his vanities for all that his reputation as i knew it was rascal miserly and he shows a pretty taste in bed and wardrobe but there aint one consistent miser in all the history of niggards i seem to have heard of one or two who sir tell me well for a fewplum turner vulture hopkins elwes jones betty bolaine oh i cry you mercy as the books say these were the best of their kind yet not one of em but would give in charity occasionally and each would have its vanity if you came to look mrs bolaine boasted her coach and even jones must have a new brim to his hat no sir two orders of misers there beyour joneses and dancers for one and of the other every third man in the tale of humanity tuttut oh i mean itthe host of those who give a halfheart to gathering but a whole one against dissipating now did you ever hear of a miser who killed himself to save expense no i didnt nor i yet that should be the right moral of parsimony no no my friend possession is the disease then how better to minister to it than by realizing ones property hoisting the metal into a sack tying oneself thereto and tilting all into the deep sea there would be the hire of the boat but never mind you give thought to things i see did you ever suppose i didnt i give it now to yonder wardrobe tis there ill wager the jewel is well lookwell look though ive used it for months unwitting he rose with a laugh and a stretch as he spoke a cloud had blurred the sun and the room had fallen to melancholy shadow perhaps it was on this account that as he flung open one of the heavy doors of the cupboard something withinan apparitiona momentary trick of the fancybrought a startled oath from his lips a hanging wardrobe was revealed with an empty shelf set above it and back in the gloom of this shelf a foul and withered face seemed to grin upon him from the darkness he thought it was dardas hideous relic and for an instant his heart jumped before the shocking revelation then the illusion passed and he saw that what had discomfited him was nothing more terrifying than a cuff or bracelet of mouldered fur whats the matter said sir david rising tuke passed his hand across his forehead and was surprised to find a little dampness thereon nothing he said with a rather uncertain laugh what a thing blythewood if the highwaymans ghost should be whipping us on to the chase ah if only hell put us on the right scent then the little man had come up behind his friend and was looking down his eyes intent upon something lord he said suddenly ive found a hidinplace the other stared the devil you have said he youve touched nothing tis like sit down when you see the rabbits tail he glanced nervously once or twice as he spoke into the recess above his head well ill lay odds said sir david that ill show you somethin in that cupboard you never guessed at before the wardrobeor the half of it exposedwas filled with coats smallclothes and other articles of a gentlemans attire but these hung high and a space intervened between the skirts of them and the floor of the interior into this space the visitor plunged his head and dropping on his knees ran his fingers in a hurried nervous way along the ornamental jambs and the beading of the doorsill satisfied apparently he nipped this last and gave it a vigorous jerk and pull there was a clicka snap and the floor of the halfcupboard shot up an inch open like the lid of a box sir david fell back on his knees trembling all over with excitement what did i tell you he cried id seen another like it and guessed the secret tis your business to look within zounds tuke make haste his flurry would brook no delay though the other was bending above him quite white with agitation so it happened they both put down their hands together and tore open the flap the little man uttered almost a shriek as he pounced upon a shagreen case lying upon the top of a folded coat that was deposited within the falsebottom revealed he staggered to his feetthrust his treasure into tukes hands take it he cried absolutely dancing its found by god with the exclamation his face fell the other had snapped open the boxa jewellers case by every signandit was empty there was the depression in the green velvet for stone trinket whatnot but no stone was there or anything but vacancy they turned tapped felt the casket all over finally they looked at one another dismayed the stable groaned tuke but the steed is gone he dashed down the useless shell and with one impulse they both fell on their knees before the exposed recess look whispered sir david in an awestruck tonehis coatcutwatersthe same he robbed and murdered in it would seem to be as he said the historical garmentneatly folded and laid awaywas of blue silk cut in a bygone fashion and its edges were richly crusted with filigree of tarnished silver lace tuke seized it out and dangled it up to view twould be a treasure in itself to some he said i wonder will the spirit of the bloody cutpurse resent having its own pockets picked he was conscious of the least little thrill and tendency to an upward glance at the shelf as he plunged his hand into the bagging of the full skirts nothing was in them but a torn laced handkerchiefa mere little limp cobweb thing such as ladies use the two men looked at one another with lowered compassionate eyes he was spawn of the devil muttered sir david throw him his masters livery again the coat was returned to the recess the latter was empty of aught else as was its double which they found similarly sunk in the other half of the wardrobe their jubilance was changed to depression the search they felt had yielded all it was like to that the case had once held the famous gem they felt convinced and equally of course the cunning scoundrel would never have committed its contents to so simply contrived a hidingplace they were no nearer discovery than they had been any time that morning as a matter of form they would closely examine every other article of furniture in the room but they knew the result would be nilas indeed it proved to be they came down to dinner tired and famished and a little morose angela received them with a charming smile we meet you with empty hands said her host i hope you are not devoured with ennui oh she cried sprightlilyif i am devoured it is not with ennui i am meat for its master and who is that can you ask sir why love to be sure i am fallen in love with mr dennis he hath entertained me since your going and purely believe me never was a figure more melancholy and romantic i rejoice you have found amusement our morning has been fruitless whatthe stone that does not concern me i have discovered a rarer gem chapter xxvii it is a keen experience of wayfarers that a northeasterly unlike a southeasterly wind seldom drops at evenfall and therefore should it be a leading principle in the ethics of all wise innkeepers to leave a blind or two up when the rasping demon is abroad at sundown for what an acute accent on numbness is that flash from a ruddy window what an invitation in it and a suggestion of the purple bead on a glass of mulled wine a moment before life had blown chill and astringenta hateful brassy and unprofitable affair whose every vile sensation seemed concentrated in the tips of the ears now its interests have gleefully enlarged there grows and blooms an image of a richlybought experience of a sanded taproom of schools of sleek glasses on shelves their glossy depths in the red stillness of the fireglow slumberous with ruby as if a memory of the good warm stuff they had known yet coloured all their dreams of sturdy kegs each with an amber drop tremulous on the nozzle of its tap and its sides pregnant with jollity of bowls of sugar of pimpled lemons of the comfortable purr of a kettle on the hob of the essence of all of these rising in a fragrant steam that shall moisten the very drought of the heart and send it singing on its way betty pollack the daughter and granddaughter of innkeepers had the right comfortable instinct in this respect and when the cry of the wind came under the doorsill like a wolfs howl she knew the demon flew from the northeast and would order her plans accordingly then at fall of dark from the unblinded tapwindow of the first inn the zealous lampglow would flood the road and wash the trunks of the trees on the opposite side till any one passing into that lighthouse radiancewherein the whipped leaves were whirled like flakes of umber foamwould be as morally certain to gravitate towards the taverndoor as if he were come within the charmed circle about a witchs lair and a very alluring witch was bettywholesome as white bread and tempered with fragrance like the warm stroking bouquet of delectable claret in winter she was still like the garden scabious which of all flowers smells most of honey and whose blossoms are little beds of love for troubadour bees it was ten oclock of a wintry night and betty sang in her bar she lifted up her sweet voice because she was alone for the icy wind wailed without and hodge had filled up betimes and stumped off to his trundlebed and custom was scant grandfather was snoring in his blankets this halfhour jim hard by nodded against his lanthorn in the kitchen and betty thought of shutting up and seeking slumber of her own warm pillow she moved to and fro putting little sprigs of christmas in glasses bottles and up in odd places of the bar for yule was but a week to come and betty was staunch to tradition she sang as she moved adapting them to an air of her own contriving some words by a mr wordsworth who was then nothing popular in mens mouths but a travelling tinker perhaps peter bell had left the book with her as a tribute to her prettiness and betty knowing nothing of schools appreciated the gift sometimes hell hide in the cave of a rock then whistle as shrill as the buzzard cock she warbled of the wind and a blade of it flashed in cuttingly on the note for just then somebody pushed open the tapdoor and entered her song died in her throat it went up like the requiem of the phnix in a flame of fire that reddened her cheeks and then left them white as the ashes of rose leaves mr tuke she whispered he came in with a dark look on his face that seemed stiff moreover with the onset of furious blasts but the teeth showed in a smile as he walked up to the counter and held out his hand to the girl are you alone betty yes she murmured almost inaudibly he clasped the soft palm in his and would not let it go and you are decorating he said how snug and warm it looks and i am chilled to the bone her face was gathering its pinks again wont your honour come and toast at the parlourfire she said timidly tis raw and cold where you stand i know it my dear the wind was a file in my teeth as i walked from delsrop walked your honour has walked and why not betty that is a rare febrifugea nighttramp in a northeaster she looked up at him strangely as she undid the hasp of the halfdoor of the bar and held the panel open he paused on the threshold you are alone you say all but for jim who nods in the kitchen i was moving to lock up when your honour came do so now and send the lad to bed i want you to myself betty he did not wait for an answer but walked past the girl and into the little warm room beyond her and here he stood looking down upon the red glow of the fire he was conscious of a considerable pause and then of an uncertain step moving away from the counter a fierce and reckless devil was riding him and all his senses were acute to answer to the bit presently he heard a shutter going gently into place and then the step again and a soft voicealmost with an entreating anguish in it as if it would fain have its order discarded jim you can go to bed there followed a dragging sound and a heavy shuffling tread that receded and died out he waited once moreinterminably it seemed at length he made up his mind and strode out into the tap the girl was leaning silently against the counter her breath coming fast her cheeks the colour of ladysmocks without a word he led her into the little room and swung to the door he put her before him and taking her face between his hands looked into her frightened eyes do i terrify you you little brown starling i am overcome myself halfsilly with anger and contempt and most of all i think with injured vanity she gazed up at him from the depths of entreating eyes and he saw the slow tears gathering in them betty betty he murmured you are a gentleman and i am alone was all she answered he was silent a minute he held her still softly caressing the hair on her forehead why i should be angered if any one called me otherwise he said and that maybe would end in a bullet and so to prove my claim to the title before the court of final appeal up there and what could i saythat betty trusted me and that i abused her trust you will notno never but i am in a very cruel and selfish mood sweetheart and i know that you love mei know it betty she forced his hands apart and stepped back yes she said bravely i do i cant help it i would follow you across the world if you called me but you will not not across the world but this room come she went up to him at once allowed herself to be taken into his armsto have her lips passionately kissed then she drew back once more with bowed head now she said low i am yours and i love you purely and i am sweet and good yes i am for how else could i school the love in my heart and it near breaking and you love me because i am but what should i be afterwardsoh what what betty i am unhappy she threw herself into grandfathers old elbowchair and buried her face in her hands no no she cried piteously you wont be so cruel he went and seated himself by her on the arm of the chair shall i tell you what hath driven me to you betty you have quarrelled with her came the answer in a muffled voice out of womans intuition no my dear i am not justified in assuming the right to quarrel she hath given me none but she maddens me with her whimsies till the man in me rises up and refuses to be any longer the slave of her caprices what is she doing she trifles with my suit twas an honourable one that would seek to found a union on esteem and confidence what can she know of these when she plays off my own servant against me in the regard of both she will make none the worse wife for standing off and on a little before that is not like you betty is it not but i wear my shameful heart on my sleeve and what of the servant a decent lowborn fellow i hold him nothing to blame he walks like a cat on the ice till tis comical to see him he laughed slightly the little warmth of merriment awoke new tenderness in him he put his arm about the girls shoulders as she lay huddled close by i take you into my confidence dear and you will not abuse me that i speak slightingly out of my soreness of a rival yet she is little that she is a beautiful and refined lady of whom i desired a favour that twere presumption for such as i to ask so i withdraw my plan to wed delicately and live highly and bow my admiration and retire and then my heart gives a free leap and i fly for love to the nest of my pretty brown bird the girl sat up and put the hair from her wet eyes the bird would die on the morrow she said oh you must go back and try once more what you would bid me to anothers arms i would bid you do the part of the brave and honourable gentleman my silly fancy went out to and if i succeeded i should know what was mine i could be happy and blithe and contented looking forward and would you die a maid for my sake she clasped her hands and put them up so against his breast the tears were running down her cheeks yes she murmured halfchoking i will promise thatmy lovemy love that is so far above and beyond me he jumped to his feet get you gone he cried almost roughly go while my heart is running over with pity i will sit out the night by the fire here and fight down my devil alone not another word or kiss or look andand betty turn the key as you go and lock me in chapter xxviii reason is fatal to romance and miss royston was coming to it she had indeed a very practical side to her character which side was all of the world and eminently fancyfree kissinthering in a fairy circle is a delightful pastime for the heyday of youth but the time must come when the gravity of the problem as to to whom one shall throw the final handkerchief must intrude itself through the merriest helterskelter of the game then as a matter of necessity must follow the inevitable formul of the pretty coldshoulder to ineligible partis of little sisterly regrets on behalf of swains who take their dismissal rebelliously of wee sops to passionate cerberuses in the shape of christmas cards depicting hands clasped above the motto for auld lang syne of the citing of jobcomforter maxims felt by the recipient to be totally inapt to the tragedy of the situation and so the jade plumes herself on her acquirement of the reasonable view and makes an easy virtue of spoiling faithwhich is but a synonym for romancefor the sake of five hundred a year no doubt this is as it should be for that very faith or romance would be a sorry sole equipment for the nether side of youth but it is also a matter for regret that reason when come to should so commonly refuse credit to any evidence but that of its senses and should contemn in others that same spirit of ideality which coloured all the early processes of its own evolution now miss angela would not condescend to this abrupt change of front for for one thing she was a zealous student of moral sensation and for another she was conscious of maturing past her first bloom she desired to keep her rosecoloured spectacles only the rims must be of gold in short she was feeling that were the picturesqueness of life her object she must seek to change her outlook while her charms remained sufficiently inviting to procure her a new prosperous coign of vantage she had played with romance now for the time being it must be subordinated to questions of business foremost in this connection presented itself the figure of her inscrutable neighbour of delsrop he for a period had slept without a rival in the pupils of her pale eyes he had satisfied her most delicate sensibilitiesfor a period gradually however was effected that change in her point of view she came to question in herself not the personality of the interesting stranger so much as his eligibility and here she had to acknowledge herself at sea and to own that melancholy and mystery were best applied to matrimony when justified by substantial dividends moreover there was the matter of position the case of her almostnamesake mrs kauffmann was not so ancient to mens memories as that she could afford to discount its significance as legendary indeed she had a mental picture of herself as a little primset maid of five or so walking her hand in her fathers through a suite of magnificent rooms the walls of which all gorgeously upholstered were hung with canvases in such quantity as to spoil she thought the pretty effect of the hangings and she remembered how her fathera lord of plympton manor in devonshire where was once a schoolmaster with a famous sonhad stopped and presented his hand to a little dapper gentlemanwho wore a plumcoloured coat and who had a scar on his lip and very squeezedup eyesand a courteous bow to a pale and melancholy lady who stood by the little gentlemans side and the lady had smiled upon the babygirl and had asked her name and when told it the smile had vanished and she had said in a queer unenglish voice gott bewahre rechristen the mdchen if you wish her happiness and at that the two men had looked flushed and awkward as men are wont to look over some suppressed meaning that invites impossible sympathy well miss angelaor angelica as you willwas to learn afterwards that she had had the youthful honour to be present at the inaugural exhibition of the royal academy whose then acquirement of its fine new rooms in somerset house was an earnest of his majesty the kings paternal support and munificence and she was to learn that the little spruce gentleman had been no other than that notable president of an august body whose chief claim to her interest lay in the fact that he was plymptonborn but who came to be known to her later experience as an artist who was said to ask as much as forty pounds for a head and a hundred guineas for a fulllength portraitas if the more valuable virtues of a man were exhibited in his legs and the lady she was informed had been mrs kauffmann since become signora zucchi whom some people thought a greater artist even than the president for she gave no preference to either head or legs but painted both in such a way that any one or other of them might have done duty for either sexwhich was a very noble and impartial view to take of the unities of art now it was not this poor angelicas management of pigments that was the present subject of miss roystons thoughts it was that melancholy story of how sir joshuas protge had at the outset of her hopeful career been drawn into matrimony with a picturesque rogue of a valet who had it in him to play the part of uther to a noble lady assuredly the mistress of chatters had no desire to repeat history in such a respect for all the veneer of romance that overlay it or to risk without astute inquiry a union with one whose personality was wrapt in so impenetrable a fog of mystery what was it not possible the man might be or what limits were to put on the ingenuity of resourceful vagabonds count horns fellow had hoodwinked society no less than the trustful girl it had made a pet of and whence had mr tuke issued and what was his claim to that haunted estate that had come to be considered in the neighbourhood a sort of nomansland on these points he had never condescended to throw light still if his rightownership of delsrop must be taken on trust no such condition applied to the question of his origin here conjecture must needs incline to suspicion seeing that his immediate predecessor had been by his own showing a common thief and coachrobber therefore was she resolved to temper fascination with prudence to whip her captive to the end of his tether and pending discoveries to no more than lightly hold him in hand in furtherance of this policy it was that she drove her unproclaimed suitor to the nether side of reason and by some overaccent of coquetry almost lost herself the indulgence of a very pretty pastime she was pondering one morning with some rueful apprehensiveness this possibility of her having gone too far when her heart was reassured by the sound of a footstep that was familiar to her coming up the gravel outside then she smiled to herself with a little composed preening of neckribbons for after all the incense of courtship was grateful to her nostrilsand her brother was not at home hethat same suitorcame in like a man set on a serious purpose and secretly her heart moved with admiration of but no submission to his masterfulness he walked straight up to her to where she had risen from her seat by the fire and answered her graceful greeting with little more than a bow madam he said i must crave your permission to speak though i may imperil my prospects through precipitancy she smiled her pulses drumming thickly a formidable overture she saidand for the life of her could get no further i do not wish it to be said the gentleman if any misconception of my position makes me appear to assume a manner of truculency i do myself an injustice believe me her lips moved but no word came from them i am aware he went on that the apparent invidiousness of my position amongst you here may stand and rightly as an insuperable barrier to any addresses i may presume to submit to your consideration her lips opened again but she only inclined her head it is so then he answered to the gesture and it only remains for me to express my most earnest regret at having failed hitherto to realize the true conditions of a suit which i now need not hesitate to affirm i once dared to hope a prosperous termination to and to gratefully thank you for permitting me to justify my dismissal in your eyes without putting you to the awkwardness of an explanation madam i am your humble obedient servant he bowed low positively the man seemed on the point of withdrawingand with a doubtful air of relief too miss royston found her voice suddenly stay mr tukeoh sir your hurried assumption seems to put me in the worst light of churlishness surely surely said he reluctantly i never suggested such a thing indirectly indeed you do you hastily cancel anan invitation while i am yet making up my mind as to the form of answer ah madam i see you would claim the privilege of rejection that is unkind no no you are entitled to it i was wrong to overlook the fact that the point of view of the world must be considered she flushed up angrily i thank you sir you mean of course that i wish to secure myself from the imputation that i angled for what was cunning to elude me i stand high in your opinion indeed but you force me to the avowal that i am under no necessity to deprecate the criticisms of my neighbours you could choose of the noblest in the land and bring to any more honour than you received if you have elected to misconstrue me of late and to indirectly enlighten me as to your sense of my presumption it was quite within your province as a lady of high position to do so ah i feel the sting behind your words of honey mr tukeher voice fell caressing as that of a remonstrant sisteri will not pretend to misinterpret your attitude towards me may i be simply frank with you there is a proverb about flogging a willing horse i own i have done that of latethat i have certified myself a consistent member of my sex is not that candour itself well would you know what hath inspired me twas recalling the fate of that unhappy mrs kauffmann he laughed slightly it understand the inference my tongue is tied but i can assure you i have never engaged in any service but my own she did not answer but her expression had gathered some coldness of reserve his was enigmatical as he continued am i justified in assuming that satisfied on this point you would at least offer no obstacle to my most respectful suit that is taking me at a disadvantage she said with a winning smile no woman lends herself to a bargain where she hath to give credit he bowed again he could not but be conscious that this atmosphere of rigid politeness seemed ludicrously out of place in an avowal of so particular a kind and that his declaration and its reception sounded rather in the nature of a passage of arms he knew he had come of set purpose to seek in legitimate attachment a foil to passion he was not so sure his heart joined in the quest or that he had not privately courted the dismissal he professed to deprecate perhaps miss royston entertained a like doubt though it would not have affected her attitude she would have preferred and had indeed looked to more ardent means to a similar end for what otherwise had she practised those late arts of coquetry she had pictured her suitor according to her judgment of him storming the bastions of her pride warm palpitating entreatinga demigod revealing himself in a cloud of passion and here he was addressing her with no more emotion than he might have shown in asking her interest to get an old woman into a hospital she was disappointed in him and immediately inclined to suspicions had sheperish the humiliating thoughta rival and then supposing after she had successfully weaned his regard for her he should turn out to be a lord of burleigh well she must fight to be consistentthough her breast was hot with indignation but she could have boxed his ears as he said in the tone of a man condemned by his doctor to arrowroot and barleywateri must live on hope chapter xxix mr tuke as a result of his grudging sop to respectability had brought about nothing more definite than some unprofitable temporizing no doubt this served him well right and was a lesson to him to be more particular for the future in his dealings with his own conscience for that same usurer will think nothing of charging a hundred per cent on the least little matter of accommodation to choose the lesser of two advantages is thought a virtue by some but then to be held kicking ones heels between them both becomes a grievous injustice this hardship our friend thought himself to suffer and was very morose and discontented in consequence does any one think meanly of this gentleman that he could fly for comfort of a legitimate suit gone awry to a humbler breast than it was his temptation to use and bruise i can only offer the defence that purehearted betty thought none the less of him for doing so and that to no sweeter mentor could any foundering soul submit its ethological perplexities for the question of tastelet him decide who is the best authority on the right cut of a coat but passion i believe is not grounded on any conventional knowledge of what is fitting now for some weeks the master of delsrop led a very solitary and rather crabbed life debarred by the simplest honour from going whither his heart would have conducted him he yet resented the necessity of a selfdenial that would probably in the end prove itself futile miss royston might he had some ground for believing favour his suit eventually could he submit to her his sufficient credentials yet though he had committed himself to a rather negative declaration though he perceived his most honest and most reasonable course would be to set himself right in that ladys eyes though he felt no umbrage at her caution which was certainly under the circumstances justifiable he could not altogether whip himself away from the temptation to solve the problem of an explanation bydoing nothing at all he succeeded in at least scotching that snake but he dared not let his thoughts run on betty or on the sweetness and innocence that to the beast in man are such lures to brutality it is only when the blood runs aged that we can look on any extreme beauty of nature without wishing to obscure it so unbearable to our diseased perceptions is the flawless at length he made up his mind to the right course christmas was over and done witha somewhat dismal hermittime to himand early in the new year blythewood and his sister were to journey to london he would ride with them would spend a few days in town and while there would endeavour to induce the lawyer creel to some explanation of that enigma of his inheritance surely with such an object in view as a union with a lady of a certain rank and position he would not be refused those credentials he desired he was further urged to this decision by the fact that his house was now properly served and that since that night of his furnitures arrival there had been no evidence but that mr breedss unhonoured guests had withdrawn finally from the neighbourhood dennis he would leave in general charge with strict orders as to the protection of the premises during his absence so matters were ordered and about the second week in january the party set forth the baronet and his sister posted but their neighbour to whom a saddle was the most sans souci of conveyances rode his own horse the weather was bitterly cold with a perpetual menacing look in all the stony vault of the sky and the journey till near its termination quite uneventful they did not start by way of stockbridge but to mr tukes relief took crosstracks for a number of miles and struck the london road at basinstoke where they dined he rode at their wheel or not as circumstance permitted and angela was gracious or peevish with him according to her mood perhaps his own varied after dinner his heart would sing jocundly she unites sense with beauty and hath a hundred charms of wit and winsomeness i am a fool to doubt then he would murmur am i frighted by the shadow of my own past i will carry her in the teeth of it all none but the brave deserve the fair and so presently to the reactionthe fall of enthusiasms temperature in the chill of some icy response when digestion needed a stimulus none but the brave deserve immunity from the fair thought he these old saws want mending and maybe he was right for even an axiom will not endure for ever but will wear out like a bookblock and come to leave a faint impression they slept at the white hart at hookwhither an outrider had preceded them to bespeak bedsand were to make an end of their journey by the evening of the morrow on that following day all went awry the little baronet had been free with his bottle overnight and was for him in a very sour and crossgrained condition the water they had found frozen in the ewers the soap curdledas it will in very cold weatherin the dishes the chimney had and the venison had been smoked the waiters received vails proportionate with the mood of the party and showed some consequent surliness in bidding it on its way for half the morning mr tuke jogged in the rear of the chaise cursing the icebound road and the ringing cold angela sat amongst her furs pinkeyed like a ferret looking out of straw and sir david nursed his sick head and exclaimed spasmodically over the infernal jolting for the sludgy tracksome eighteen inches deep in mud during the most of the winterthat was the exeter road was now petrified into furrows like those in a bed of larva often a horse would slip and fall flinging its stiffened postillion and then there would be bitter delay and the unbuckling of straps with blue ineffectual hands and much breathing of oaths and stamping of deadened feet while low in the desolate welkin the sun looked on with dim unconcerned eye as if it were some senile monarch conscious only of private cosiness while gazing through a frosted window on a little township of suffering and so on again presently crashing and pounding the boys towelling their cattle for mere exercise of their own numbed fingers the catice splintering in the ruts the chaise dancing wildly in its straps fortunately there was no snow though the sky bore evidence in its appearance of such garnered stores of it as could at a nod sow the world with winter it was an hour past noon when our party drew up in no very sweet temper at the door of the catherine wheel at egham where they were to stop for dinner they thawed a little during the meal and were even amiable one with the other after a guarded fashion sir david was the victim of nothing more than some physical discomfort but his two companions suffered yet under a species of misunderstanding that circumstance only could put an end to and in the meanwhile it was inevitable that their mutual relations should be marked by some coldness and embarrassment the regulator coach from exeter to london clattered up in the frost and stopped to change horses while they were at table they heard the halfdead outsides stumping about in the bar and calling for mulled port and nantes brandy to warm them on to the next stage and had a glimpse through the lattice of the vehicle itselfchocolate in hue and traced all over with gilt lettering like a christmas calendar of a happyfaced young woman who sat hugging a little boy in her lap on the gammonboard of the roof and of a kitkat presentment of an arrogantvisaged young gentleman with a brown silk handkerchief tied about his head who leaned out of the drag window to the huge discomfort of the other insides and amused himself by endeavouring to scrape with a toothpick the paint off the bulls head on the panel of the door this latter sight sent mr tuke back in his chair with an involuntary startwhich miss royston noticed do you know the gentleman she said jumping to a conclusion i yesi recognize him i think oh indeed and who is he may i ask tis dunlonelord dunlone i have met him we were in the way of being friends in fact he thought to himself the fellow goes townwards from his cornish place tis in sort with his cursed parsimony to stage it like a provident cit i will excuse you if you wish to go speak with him said miss angela not in the least i should poorly requite myself for the loss of your society she laughed with a faint insolence of inflection only one reason it seemed to her could be for his refusing to act upon the acquaintanceship he claimedthat he feared to put it to the test was it possible he was the noblemans valet she mused recalling that other case he sat on unwitting of her meditations but he felt a degree of relief nevertheless when the guard of the regulatora confident redfaced young fellow in a bottlegreen coat and with a sprig of mistletoe in his hatsounded his horn disposed his reluctant passengers swung himself up over the hindboot chucked the rosy young woman to the gazers high approval under the chin and gave the signal to start and it was without regret that he saw that straining vehicle draw away with a rumbling of wheels and the unwelcome vision pass from his ken for he had no mind to recall a certain phase of his life from which he could have sworn years of reformation bridged him by two oclock they were on their way again and as the dusk gathered so did their gloom and reserve seem to deepen indeed the horseman felt it a positive relief when dark shut in upon them still urging onwards for so the perils of the road were his sufficient excuse for keeping himself apart and without the influence of that depressing atmosphere driving on desperately in a struggling flurry to escape being benighted on some impassable waste they struck the track by and by across hounslow heath and put on what additional speed they durst over that open and historic ground a crimson spot of light that upon their first issuing on to the flats had seemed the lowdown radiance of some far cottagewindow grew in lustre as they advanced until it flared before them a leaping flame thereupon they slackened speed somewhat moving with caution and the horseman dropped a hand towards his holster a hundred yards further and the flame became a fire dancing redly by the roadside and there were shadows flitting about it and close by a looming mass that threw back little spars and runlets of reflection to the spouting blaze clipping indecision with a jerk of his rowels mr tuke uttered a shout and rode down upon the group there was an answering cry and he saw a figure or two throw up its hands dramatically entreating him to a halt something he noticed in time to respond and pulled up his horse with so great a suddenness upon the icy road that the brute sank upon its haunches and halftumbled him out of the saddle he was on the ground in a moment and whipping the frightened animal to its feet moved towards the fire and was made way for by those about it he looked down the body of a man lay uncouthly flung beside the glowthat had been built up hastily of brushwood and dead sticks in a hopeless effort to rekindle a lateextinguished spark of life the flame painted the waxen face and fallen jaw with a hectic mockery of vitality and glinted on a dribbling splash in the forehead where something had crushed in through the very ring of a cherished lovelock a woman was down upon the grass by the figuremoaning to it caressing it with some piteous shame of the awful publicity of her conduct for she would not believe in the impotence of her agony to rouse that silent shape to any responsive gesture and in the background of her thoughts was some insane speculation as to how when all was right again she should hold her terror an apology for her emotion close behind her stood a little crying boy his fingers in his eyes and it was moving to see how in the younglings cap and in the breast of the kneeling woman were merry knots of christmasearnests of a thoughtless time the guard murmured the newcomer he grasped the situation with only too sure an intuition the glooming mass in the road was nothing less than that same lusty vehicle they had seen but an hour or two before rumble away from the inndoor its jovial horn answering to the lips of that formless thing by the fire aye grunted the coachman from the covert of his preposterous neckcloth he had come up on the moment from the task of slowly manipulating his cut traces thats the last of charlie he said with some thickness of fury in his tone no no moaned up the woman not the lastmy god no dont take on my dear he said charlie done his dooty like a man and theres not a coach vheel ll go over that there patch on the road but ll roll up a bloody account agen his murderers she only sighed miserably in answer the deep apathy of grief was in her veins like a drug how many said tuke six if there was vun sir six cursed ruffians to dance agen the sky and serve the crows for black pudden so be theres any vally in the fellowship of the road he shook his pillow of an arm aloftfinely for all the heavy oddity of his appearance aye he murmured in response to a gesturethe mans wife and his youngster at the word a womanone from the huddled group of robbed and terrified passengerscame out into the glow and snatching up the child forced it whimpering into its mothers arms the act was well conceived the desolate creature caught at the hope and held it convulsively against her breast and in a moment her burdened heart found relief mr tuke backed silently no the coachman had growled to himhe wanted no help he could get on well enough now there was nothing for it but to complete his crippled stage and as quickly as possible set the law in motion the chaise with its occupants was drawn up at a little distance from the tragic scene as the horseman made for it eager to reassure his friends that any cause for present alarm was passed he was aware of a figure standing by the door and addressing those within in exceedingly tremulous tones ive had enough of it curse me it was saying twould be a sick thing to travel with that dead rascal banging on the roof and the cursed coachman refuses to go without him ive been robbed of fifty pound by god and ill take it exceeding civil of you to give me a lift over the last stages indeed said miss angelas clear voicewe shall be very happy lord dunlone who the deuce told you my namewho now he could hardly stand still in his fear and excitement but kept pulling at the handle of the door in a nervous effort to turn it who told you he said curse it cant some one help me go steady at it came sir davids voice were not tryin to overreach you sir twas a friendcommon to both of us i understandmr tuke who saw you in the coach at egham tuketuke i dont know any one of the name heregive me a hand will you he plunged into the vehicle and the door snapped on him the listener retreated softly into the rearward shadows he had forgotten that this undesirable acquaintance was amongst the passengers and it was some amelioration of the tragedy to hear that he had been stripped clean he waited silent while the chaise kept its placewhich it did only a few minutes before the noblemans peevish voice sounded cursing the postillions to a move then he went to the help of the coachdriver and later cantered out the rest of his journey in the tail of that gingerbread conveyance that was become a mere hearse of death and sorrow ah he thoughthow in all her afterdays will she love the memory of that chinchuck poor soul chapter xxx i have no knowledge said creeli have no knowledge whatever mr tuke of this lake of wine very probably it was as you suggest i was acquainted with the mans character by report of course and judge it infinitely likely that he would have been the principal in a fraud so masterly ingenious but that goes for nothing very well sir then by your permission we will come to the matter which is of a greater private importance to me surely you cannot justify to yourself the fact of withholding evidence of my fathers integrity from my fathers son and surely you are hasty did i express such an intention on the contrary i am ready at this date to inform you of all the details i am in possession of as to sir roberts bequest and why not earlier may i not ask it because my ardent young sir the time was not ripe because having regard to the circumstances under which we first became intimate i apprehended a distinct refusal on your part to accept of an advantage so strangely come by there is nothing shameful in the story fie sir fie is this your tender concern for my old and honoured friend and patron be there shame tis none of his possibly of mine you would say mr creel i have grown very humble of late months save us save usyet i would not quench but only control that fervid spirit go to you shall have the history word for word as your father wrote it and as such left it to my full discretion to acquaint you of or not no doubt you have suffered and learnt since we last met and are now in a state to appreciate the moral no less than the material value of your inheritance he rose as he spoke sparse and bentbacked and bowellesslike the figure symbolic of the nine points of the law the other watched him with some amusement and a good deal of impatience as he shuffled to a now familiar deedbox unlocked it and took thence a bundle of papers these he brought to the table sat himself down again and selected two from the heap as dryly deliberate as a monkey turning over a biscuit presently he looked up document in hand this he said the full and true account of the late sir roberts presentation to the property of delsrop in the county of hants was writ down by him in this my office and read over to me and by me attested for its truth inasmuch as i was nominated to act for both parties in the disposition of the estate albeit mr tuke you must understand the testator was known to me hitherto but by report the which would hardly have induced me to do his service but for the direction of his bequestand that without doubt was his object in applying to me with favour sir said mr creels client and with all deference to the discriminatory acumen of the professionmight not this preface serve better as an epilogue the attorney winced in his breath looked over his spectacles which he had been slowly adjusting and broke suddenly into a leathery smile sir said he the law stands so much in dead mens shoes that perhaps itself hath lost the sensation to be quick but heres for you without more ado and so he began his reading re the estate of delsrop and in the matter of sir robert linne bart in the winter of when i was home in england on furlough being sick of a disordered spleen i was crossing bagshot heath one night when i was stopped by a oneeyed gentleman of the road who was set to coerce me with the usual menaces and braggadocio but looking in his face without fearfor it was a brilliant moonlit night and his features clear as printi noticed them drawn and anguished in a manner beyond words so that he seemed rather a ghost or boggle of my distemper which gave me some concern but quickly recovering myself my honest gentleman says i meseems you are more in need of stand for yourself than me which hearing he gave out a great groan and so straightway dropped the muzzle of his pistol can you read it so plain says he then i tell you i am in hell and it were a merciful thing to slay me here and nowand with that he rends his vest and shoot says he and end it now i got talking to my man and to make a short story of it found him to be a noted heathcock one cutwateraye sirthere you have himas he was called who had drawn a free living from the road but was now smitten of a morbid disease of the kidneys and like to die however in a clean retirement had he lived for a yearor perhaps two or moretill his disorder came like to madden him when with the hope to borrow surcease of agony from the distraction of his ancient calling he made post to bagshot and rode out on the heath well i took him back to my inn and made him up a drug of my knowledge and kept him by me for a day or two thinking to mend the poor sinner before i set upon the lords work with him and he made a surprising recovery and was ready to kiss my very feet out of his gratitude but so it happened a summons coming to me from his majestys court at windsor i was to leave him perforce and presentlymy own complaint mendingforth i passed to the war again and from all thought of master cutwater and now as worthy mr creel will attestwhich has conducted the business and is my friend and an attorney and this our same fellow of the road had discovered it seemsnot three weeks ago i being again in london this summer of the year was waited upon by him and to my astonishment handed over the title deeds of an estate which i had never so much as heard named being delsrop house in the county of hants for thus it appeared my highwayman had died after allyet not of his complaint but in some ruffian mlehaving first however in gratitude at my service to him willed me this property which i cannot but regard with perplexity as the wages of sin inasmuch as it appeareth the reward designed in totidem verbis for prolonging of a rascals life but so am i resolved that by no means and on no condition will i soil my hands with its possession for whether come by honestly or in fraud it is and must be a mansion of the wicked i take no concern for it nor have i troubled to visit it nor yet considered by what manner of agreement i am to dispose of the incubus only this i set down here and now in the presence of mr creel who will attest it that should occasion of dispute arise it may be accepted a true and honourable statement of the matter and that whether or no it passeth the understanding of the incredulous and moreover i do solemnly asseverate that whether the man cutwater held the estate in feesimple justly and of his own right or whether he held it the fruits of his illdoing or again whether indeed it represent the entire or but a portion of his property i know not nor seek to know for he was a rogue undoubted of whose politic methods no christian gentleman could deign to consider on equal terms now said the lawyer when he had come to an end of the narrative you are in possession of the facts as related and witnessed for you must know the testator discovered your fathers friendship to me and visited me here and begged me to act for him in the matter and this under the circumstances i agreed to do having regard to my reputation in the respect that the transaction should be yes yes exclaimed tuke a little irritably his face had fallen grave and full of trouble i understandi understand completely and is that all no sirit is not all he was secretly attentive of his client there is a later document from which it appears that sir robert abated for any reasons of his own the rigour of his resolve respecting this strange inheritance for by deed executed he had taken up and was referring to and partly reading from another paper the eleventh of october he makes over the estate of delsrop to one barnabas creelin trust that is and under certain conditionssaid barnabas creel to have and enjoy said property without dispute and until his benefactors son shall attain his majority the which event is to happen if he live in the year and thereafter for all time provided sir robert the junior comes not to bankruptcy of his affairs and threatened indigence but in the latter event if it happen any time between said sons majority and his fortieth yearby which period of his life a man should be established whether for good or evilthe estate is to devolve upon said son that he may take his profit of a cutpurses legacy which is yet good enough for a gambler or rakehell to reform his ways and live cleanly thenceforth but on the sole condition that he foreswear his titlethe which hath ever stood foremost in honourand take the name of tuke for this name was borne by an honest woman that shall shame her son to do it no discredit under his new conditions of fortune as he here ended the lawyer precisely refolded the papers tied all together put the packet aside and crossing his hands over his crossed knees waited for the other to speak a silence of some minutes succeeded then said the distitled legatee rousing himself with a sigh i thank you mr creel for your kindly discernment in hitherto withholding from me this intelligence i confess it comes bitter to me i rejoice in that reassurance of my fathers integritywhich my heart in truth little misdoubtedbut i confess the nature of this revelation a little overcomes me tis a bone to a dog in all sovereign contempt nay sir robert sir robert tis the anxious medicine to a soul wounded of its own rashness well sir well pride may follow a fall i find yet if i may question the methods of a virtuous man i could discover a flaw in my fathers particular morality for the crown by all custom is entitled to the reversion of an outlaws estates no doubt answered creel with a little dry snigger that is strictly so the mans possessions were forfeit of right to the crown it being his good fortune only that he passed unhung of the law that he had defied buthis guilt being conjectural and not as it were brought home to himyour father in one of those canterburygallops of conscience wherewith honest souls sometimes override our fears for their guilelessness would consider it no duty of his to forego the estate quixotically and for a supposition of which the law had failed to take cognizance but said he i will not throw the first stone at him whose immunity is my profit and as to the estate i can apply itsaving the grace of his majesty whose means are not restrictedto some worthy purpose which was doubtless forecast by the providence that hath conducted the matter so far and in this he was firmnot to outlaw the dead man though he took no personal advantage of his bequest for he declared he meant well by me when all is said and done mr tuke rose and the attorney with him i suppose said the former rather sadly that no man may profit by repentance so far as to lay the ghost of his past tis the privilege of the virtuous to hunt down reformed sinners with the spectrehounds of their own dead passions i have sought honestly to redeem my name and to do my best with the new life offered me yet should i have accepted the trust had i known in what spirit its reversion to me was conceived i hope so said the other for love under all the show of rigour prompted the bequest he spoke with some deprecation perhaps in his heart was a little protesting sympathy with his young friends point of view well sir answered the latter i will een take your word for itfor that it is the word of as generous and selfsacrificing a soul as ever stood between a saint and a scamp and with that they shook hands warmly and parted mr tuke going back to his lodgings in the adelphi where he had put up to be near his friends who lay at the golden cross hard by chapter xxxi thus at length was sir robert the younger informed of the history of his inheritance thus also was it an aggravation of that wounding recital that to all appearance he might have earlier induced mr creel to itat a period when he himself was less bound to the conduct of a responsibility which he now knew he had undertaken upon terms that seemed to him unnecessarily humiliating and which he could not but think he would surely otherwise have declined for if any love had dictated the giftthe new chance to a repentant prodigalit was harder than roman in its expression so he thought smarting under the lash of his fathers prejudgment and it was only by and by in one of those elastic rebounds that were characteristic of the man and constitutional that he came to consider that it was a prejudgment and that had his father lived to see it verified he might have modified at least the asperity of his language this was little comfort but it was some at first he had had a wild temptation to reject at the eleventh hour a gift which only his ignorance had accepted it passed however in the reflection that whatever the prehistory of delsrop with which he had no concern the property was indubitably his at the present moment to do with as he chose that he had already incurred in his management of it responsibilities that he could not with honour repudiate and that the manliness to assert himself in the world should be altogether independent of adventitious moral support still he was something depressed and unhappy and was become perhaps an essentially graver man than he had been before his interview with the lawyer this interview had taken place on the day after his arrival in london on his way to it he had left a message at the golden cross conveying his respects and his hopes that the travellers had rested well but the travellers themselves he had no intention to intrude himself on until convinced if possible that the nature of his inheritance offered no bar to his suit with miss royston satisfied on this point he had desired and obtained mr creels consent to his using his new knowledge if necessary for the furtherance of his addressesbut to how great a degree must be left to his own discretion this matter he pondered on his way home and pondering it he must acknowledge to himself that his position with the lady was scarcely improved on for whatever its extenuation the fact of the case remained that he was a distitled beneficiary whose tenure of his property must be held to rather justify the contempt that secured it to him so circumstanced it was a relief to him upon calling at the golden cross in the dusk of the afternoon to find that his fellowtravellers were gone visiting but sir david had left a message that they were to be at the haymarket theatre in the evening to witness a performance of a new musical piecein which the celebrated mr fawcett was to appear in a popular part together with the beautiful miss de camp and mrs mountain of vauxhall gardens fameand that he hoped mr tuke would make it his pleasure to join their party mr tuke would make it his pleasureor his duty he felt that possibly the somewhat dramatic character of the explanation he was bidden to would find its appropriate background more in wings and flats than in the walls of a drabby innparlour that hautboys and fiddlesif he could seized an opportunity to speak out under cover of their harmonious gossipmight play a fitter accompaniment to the tale of his raptures than would the clank of dishes and bawling of ubiquitous waiters as to that risk he must run of recognition by old associateswhy he momently invited such a contretemps and he could really not bother his head with idle speculations as to what he should do in so likely an eventuality truly the main condition under which he held his estate made no provision for such accidents and his sole concern was not to escape identification but to save himself the worry of being questioned as to the why and wherefore moreover it must be confessed he would claim a little malicious pleasure in denying miss angela that knowledge of his real position which would serve as a better argument to her favour he shrewdly suspected than any personal merit of his could advance and he was resolved if possible to be takenif taken he should befor himself alone therefore with the determination to that very evening put his fortunes to the proof he addressed himself to his careful toilet dined daintily and deliberately at the bedford coffeehouse in covent garden off a little lobster an apricotpuff or so and some burnt champagne and in due time summoned a coach and was driven to the theatre in the vestibule he was treated to a brief scene of temper that was like a lever de rideau to usher in the serious business of the evening an arrogantlooking lady of a very vain and truculent expression of countenance accompanied by a youth some eleven or twelve years of age had entered the theatre at the same time as himself this boy a plumpfaced kimboeyed youngster with welloiled chestnut curls and a pugnacious mouth limped slightly as he walked a little in advance of his companion tread over geordie said the latter peevishly and in a pretty loud voice the boy took no notice but he flushed up for there was other company present thereupon the lady called louder as if to advertise her authority over him ill bid ye listen ye vicious brat tread ye over as mr lavender directs now the boy turned round with a scarlet face and cried heand we must not hold him excused dn mr lavender for a havrel quack at that the lady came after him in a fury and immediately he flung up his hand with a lorgnette in it and says he if ye touch me ill hwhang this on to the floor fie young gentleman said mr tuke who was standing near is that your challenge to a lady he got no profit of his question however for while the boy only stared at him with an angry scowl the dame spoke up with a fine contempt of his interference were beholden to ye sir said she but the lord byron will have his schooling in manners from better than a poutherd fribbleand catching at the boys arm the two passed on together making common cause against the enemy that person laughed shrugged his shoulders and went in search of his friends there were many empty boxes round the middle tier and some with liveried fellows sitting back in them to keep the seats against their masters coming once and again a man of them his attention caught by some new arrival would incautiously project his head with the result that a storm of nuts and orangepeel flying from the gallery would send it jerking in again to the huge merriment of the house amongst these retainers was one who wore the dunlone livery of blue and silver mr tuke recognized it from where he stood and a sudden thought halfcomical twitched at his risibilities what he mused if dunlone is baiting a little trap he will hardly want me to walk into it the fiddles had squeaked and the curtain gone up while he waited and at this moment he saw the very party he was in search of enter my lords box in company with that gentleman miss royston came to the front sparkling and radiant as a postprandial hebe she glanced round the house it was a tribute to her attractiveness that the selfimportant boylord who sat opposite forgot the play a minute while he plied her with his lorgnette caught sight of mr tuke and treating that gentleman to a little cold bow turned and addressed her witchery to the nobleman behind her who was taking his seat with an insolence of clatter and chatter that greatly disturbed the audience not in the least desiring under the circumstances to obtrude himself on her further noticeand that for many reasonstuke retired into the background and gave his most suave attention to the play of this he was afterwards conscious of having a very hazy recollection and only its title what a blunder seemed to stick in his memory from a certain impression it had conveyed of appropriateness with his own condition of mind the scene had lain in valenciahe remembered that as also the presence thereon of a dashing english officer whose complete mufti of white satin tights trunk hose slashed with purple spencer of violet velvet diamond shoebuckles and a grey brigands hat with three enormous ostrich plumes in it had presented such a coup de thtre as ought to have fully compensated him for the wasteful hour he might have been otherwise inclined to think he had spent in the house somewhat in a dream he heard the glorious miss de camp expound her melodious grievances to a baneful chorus of banditti and withdraw into a cavern the hostage of their most bassoprofundo cupidity he was indeed forming his plans the while and when the curtain fell on the first act he made his way determinedly to a certain boxthe prominent occupants of which had had for the last halfhour his particular attentionfully resolved to end one way or the other his period of suspense he tapped on the baize door and was bidden gruffly by the nobleman to enterwhich he did my lord and sir david were risen at the momentthe former to fetch a bag of oranges out of his laced surtoutand the baronet came at his friend with a genial greeting and his finest london manner where have you been quoth he my lord dunlone would insist to honour us with his invitation or i would have acquainted you of our number tuke tuke exclaimed the viscount he stood staring with his hand in the pocket at your service sir said the other gravely miss angela was turned her face observant and a little flushed my name said mr tuke quickly seeing the cubs perplexity can be a matter of little importance in your lordships recollection but we have been known to one another in the past as you will doubtless remember oh very well sir tis no concern of mine as you observe said the lord and it is not every title that is worth the preserving we came to a settlement at our last meeting i believe and i owe you small thanks for the terms of it but im cursed if i knew the sale of your good name was included in the bargain nor was it said mr tuke he took no offence at the others insolence but was quite urbane and goodhumoured in the teeth of it he even gave the nobleman an ironical bow as withdrawing his hand empty from the pocket that fine creature seized sir davids arm and walked the astounded little man out of the box no sooner were they vanished than the intruder addressed himself to miss royston with the most perfect calmness and respect i return said he to delsrop tomorrow she vouchsafed him a lifted eyebrow of surprise so soon said she then your business is concludedor postponed it is concluded to your satisfaction i trust assuredly i am satisfied i came on a fools errand indeed she trifled with her fan suddenly she leaned back in the shadow of the curtains and looked up at him mr tuke she saidwere you ever my lords tailor he could only stare his astonishment or his tool or his creature in any way she said gathering vehemence with speech oh sir why should you wonder and whither were his innuendoes directed and what the reason that he disavowed your claim of friendship surely he did not notnot and you pass under an assumed name will you deny it no madam she gave a great sigh and turned her attention to the orchestra that was beginning to tune up for the second act you will have a cold journey she said goodbye he echoed her adieu with a composed gallantry and stepped from the box a man of ice humming horribly out of tune it must be said a fragment of some lateheard melody he lounged through his tier of the auditorium and even paused before leaving the house at a point whence he could obtain a comprehensive view of the assembly here glancing down into the pit his gaze was instantly riveted upon the figure of a man that sat lolling in an ungainly manner against the wooden partition that enclosed the orchestra now by heaven muttered the observer if you are not my old friend of the fishingrod there is no virtue in the name of brander as he thus spoke under his breath the man below moved by that telepathic force that is called sympathy looked up and catching the others eye started violently and immediately shifted his position so as to present nothing but a back of rusty broadcloth to the inquisition of the boxes and so my suspicion is confirmed thought tuke and made his way to the vestibule walking on the stilts so as to speak of a sort of incensed exaltation he issued from the theatre to find a wet sleet falling the loaded flakes hissed in the torches of the link boys the whole pavement resounded with the clink of pattens and here is the appropriate wet blanket muttered our friend to the bed of my own making i will een back to broiled bones and a noggin of punch by the fire chapter xxxii there is a curious anomaly about the way in which a selfconfidence impervious to the stabs of illfortune may be paralyzed in a moment by the little prick of a snub irresponsible now i would not go so far as to say that the sangfroid shown by mr tuke over his virtual dismissal by miss royston represented the real state of his feelings or that he did not find his appetite for a certain fruit stimulated by his disappointment of it but without doubt the sting that most rankled for the moment in his vanity was that tart little rebuke administered to him by the aristocratic carline in the theatrelobby it was absurd it was inexplicablebut so it was his sense of injury in the greater matter was quite overcrowded by his feeling of humiliation in the lesser that was a little snake but it swallowed all the restso elastic is a proud stomach perhaps it was all very beneficial to him no doubt it was too much his way to affect a goodhumoured tolerance of destiny to repudiate responsibility in speech or act on the strength of a certain genial creed of fatality that assumed itself independent of the laws of obligation to have that much of the vagabond in one that one moves serenely indifferent to conventional restrictions is excellent but to insist upon ones vagabondage is to be a didactic vagabond and that is intolerable for it is to assume that orthodox folk must accept vagabondage as the superior condition which being orthodox they cannot therefore it was that upon the morning following his visit to the theatre our gentleman startedas he had obstinately resolved he would doupon his homeward journey quite truculent with a sense of grievance there was little in the prospect about him that served to otherwise than confirm his depression winter it was evident was asserting itself with a despotic and merciless rigour that was deaf to all considerations of humanity the sleet of the previous night had frozen into and made long icy crevasses of the roadruts the throat of the wind was hoarse with cold the grey of utter lifelessness stretched from earth to skya grey that no fury of the stiff blast could rend or discompose each hour linked itself to the next with a bolt of iron as his teeth set to the driving chill he urged his long way forward the road clanked under him the scarlet nostrils of his straining horse palpitated like blown coals against a background of ashes he did not much care to think of anything but his own miserable discomfort and in that he took some hard satisfaction as if by enduring it he were shaming the callous soul who had bidden him away from his cosy fireside in the adelphi it was at this climax of his meditations that humour and hunger ventured upon a little roguish assault on his epigastrium had the attack failed he had been other than the man of this history it did not by any means he sighed drew himself up twinkled over the collapse of his pondered heroics broke into a laugh halfvexed halfjocund and fairly plunged into that illuminating thought of the sthetic value of appetite to a free man for i am free he cried to the windsand responsible in all the world to nobody but myself at the very next wayside inn he dismounted and called boisterously for food munching this with a confident digestion by a jolly fire and delighting in every purple bead of clos vougeot that swam to his glass rim he would give his fancies as the freeborn children of a bohemian rein to run as they listed and would even humour them to the top bent of his inclination well their orderor absence of itmight be this position and respectability a park a carriageroad trim servants nicemannered children a stake in the county and a sober reputation to prop it an admirable cold wife in whom an innate artificiality should be tuned to the musical pitch of sentiment on every side a thickset hedge of formality and restriction wherethrough one decent passage alone should be piercedthe stoneflagged way to the tremendously enduring family vaultand at the last the precise misrepresentation of a ruled epitaph good and now from the olive to the wine lifethe life that he understood and could rejoice inaway from the flint road and spurring on to the downs the life of heath and water and wood of the blown blue sky and the whirled pollen of flowers of light and gloom risk and effort and reward of the great breath of change and freedom andah yes of the sympathizing soft heart to be always waiting him at the blossoming corner the spirit to often share with him the wanderings and the marvels and to pull him down into the sweetsmelling brake at shut of eve and so for both to make a common cause of dreams which was the happier picture and yet a very fragrant perfume would cling about the presentment of that white gentleborn angela and sometimes even now it would appear a profanation to him to hold her cheaply in his thoughts he would not if a certain shamefaced exultation over his latest emancipation would stir oddly in him from time to time he would not so far abuse the trust his own heart had placed in a recent sentiment as to set up a new idol in the niche of a fallen image angela might be deposed butfor the present at leastno other should usurp her throne momentarily firm in this respect and secure in his own geniality from the carping criticisms of conscience he turned from all tender retrospections and lazily as he sat reviewed a little company of late incidents from yesterday with its snubs and its petty hurts to the melancholy and monotonous flight of this morningeven that now had its accents to be indulgently recalled his thoughts went back along the wintry road he had traversed and dwelt comically upon the figure of an old oddity he had seen peering down upon him from a leafruined gazeboan oddity the personification of much inquisitiveness that was muffled in many capes and that held a great blue umbrella between its old head and the blast he remembered how a halfdozen snowbuntings had fled over a hedgerow as he went by how down a certain swoop of meadowland a flock of screaming gulls had dived how where in a roadside churchyard a sexton was toiling at a grave the titlarks had bobbed and curtsied on the newlyturned mould desperate in their freezing hungerand from all this he augured that such a winter was threatening as would make the country no desirable place to live in for some months to come still he was not sorry he was returning to it in his new lust for freedom a veritable loathing for the gilded fetters of townlife was a first condition and he would have no knowledge of passions that could only take breath in a vitiated atmosphere if he must sin he would sin in the woods and of his wavering human soul let the forest judge it had been a desolate road he came byblack and gloomy with frost and enlivened by but few passing vehicles one of thesea postchaisethere had been going on monotonously before him at a distance ahead its steady progression he could not tell why annoyed and worried him it was always there a yellow blot in the perspective of highway whipping down and up the hollows swinging rhythmically in its straps endlessly speeding on and holding him as it were in its wake once or twice he had been moved to cut past and outrun it but the bitter push of wind in his front and an apathy bred of cold would dissuade him from the effort and in the end he would always find himself jogging sombrely along in its rear it was a satisfaction to him as he came within sight of the inn at which he was to dismount to see this persistent vehicle its occupants and cattle refreshed moving off on its further journey for so he comforted himself he should resume his own way by and by unvexed of that aggravating accompaniment this was all childish of course but so it was that it was always his habit to be impatient of anything that embarrassed his free forward outlook and to be kept walking behind a pedestrian in the street he would regard as almost a personal affront however for the rest of his days journey he had the road virtually to himself and by sundown he had completed his fortyfifth mile and was clanking into the high street of basingstoke at the white horse in this town he woke on the following morning with a sense of constriction at his heart to find the water in his ewer a sheet of ice and that smell of cold soot that seems the prevailing atmosphere of hard winters to proceed from everything about him his room looked upon the stableyard and glancing thereinto while in process of dressing he broke into an oath at sight of a yellow chaise that stood below with horses attached over one of which a rednosed postboy sprawled expectant awaiting his fare now by the lord he mutteredif my nemesis has not lain with me at mine own inn he was scowlingly speculating as to the possibility of his having to tail a second day in the wake of this rumbling jaundice when he uttered a startled exclamation and drawing into the covert of the window curtains stood peering down into the yard for the hirer of the chaiseto whom early rising would appear to be a right condition of postingwas at that moment issued from the inn and was mounting without any affectation of leisure the step of the vehicle mr tuke thinking of that presentation to his view two nights before of a lank long back in the pit of the theatre came hurriedly from his hidingplace and at that instant the traveller turned and flashed an upward glance at the window with the very movement he gave a hoarse order to the postboy wrenched open the door of the carriage plunged in and before peeping tom could gather his perceptions the chaise was rolling and clattering out of the yard soho there was business afoot where hitherto was all avoidance and reluctance now must be haste and scurry and pursuit the squalid rogue brander posting it like a lord surely there must be some momentous reason for the outlay the gentleman at this point wild with eagerness and impatience stood below presently on the yardsteps to bolt a mouthful of meat and bread while his horse was saddling ten minutes later he was off and set to the chase pounding it along at what rate he durst on the icy roads if they are pointed for andover well and good he murmured do they take crosstracks for the dog and duck i shall know what to apprehend with the thought he swerved from the mainroad into the first of the homeward byways cantered down a mile of closeset lanes turned a corner leading to a stretch of open downs andthere going one before him small in the distance was the vehicle he pursued to overtake and constitute himself its rearguardsuch must be his object an easily attained one it would appear but his horse was scarcely fresh and a slip on those glassy ruts might ruin all he settled himself doggedly to the chase such veritably it became for soon it was evident that the quarry knew itself to be pursued and tactically wished to allure him on to a destructive speed but little by little the horseman gained on the other he got near enough to mark branders head thrust intermittently from the windowby and by to hear faintly the rascals voice cursing on his leaping postillion suddenly the leading party took an unexpected way brought out on the highroad leading from winchester to stockbridge and went careering for the latter place at a gallop ha cried tuke to himself that double wont draw me from the scent my friend it was all giveandtake country they raced bydesolate downland that dropped and rose like a flying sparrow over it the pace became terrific the postboy lashed his horses till they foamed the rider galled the sides of his poor straining beast something it was obvious must happen shortlyto whom was the single question the pursuer was to triumph at the crest of that very slope that led up to the high gallowstree the ridden posthorse shied at a dangling chain threw his mount brought his fellow to his kneesand in a moment carriage and cattle were a plunging tangle of confusion with a shout of jubilation tuke spurred up the hill and rode upon his enemy chapter xxxiii before the other could reach him the ready mr brander had extricated himself from his perilous position and leaving the bruised postboy to manage his own strode back a pace or two his hands groping rigidly in the skirtpockets of his mangy surtout mr tuke apt at an emergency came up pistol in hand which seeing the long rogue halted with a stony face of which only the lurid eyes belied the expressionlessness for some seconds the two men faced one another without a word at length said the pursued no doubt sir you are come to explain yourself i have nothing to explain said the other stiff as the trigger of his own weapon and as deadly to what then am i to attribute this pursuit and maltreatment of a harmless traveller using without offence the kings highway mr brander i am not convinced my legitimate answer should not be a bullet through your brain i may give it yet if you do not take your fingers from that pistol butt the rogue flung his hands in front of him and clasped them there this you will admit he said quietly is a gross outrage i have done nothing to deserve it i take post on my own concerns and am wantonly driven to this pass with any possibility of consequences for which you have yourself to thank there must be two to a hunt had you not fled i had not driven surely sir it is excusable to fly a danger and for an innocent traveller to read evil in one who spurs after him along a lonely road mr tuke permitted himself a spirt of merriment ingeniously argued said he so i am the highwayman well i call upon you to stand and deliver indeed sir i have nothing worth your consideration pardon me your sudden flight thitherwards at the moment you imagined me established and occupied in london is a matter very well worth my consideration you are mistaken how could i know of your presence in london you will observe i make no pretence of ignorance as to your identity that is modest of you he gave no further answer but he set to and whistled an air from the opera what a blunder now mr brander he said you have taken time by the forelock but i have taken him by the nose so you may een go back the way you came and inform your graceful associates that the master of delsrop is returned to his own he spoke with a very engaging sangfroid but he was prepared for contingencies to his surprise the other after eying him for some moments in a manner of puzzled speculation shrugged up his shoulders and broke into a gobble of laughter come said the thief i will be honest with you for all the marchand forain i am a scholar said tuke then you have two weapons to my one we must stand on even terms before i consent bah exclaimed the respectable merchant and turning his back he fetched a pistol out of either sidepocket and fired each in turn at the dangling chains of the gallows both bullets struck home with a clank the horses twenty yards away started and reared and the rogue repouching the smoking barrels slewed himself about once more does that satisfy you he said now my only weapon is my tongue it shall carry further than a bullet with me though i wont swear it shall speed as true you have a very pretty aim mr brander i learnt to hit a mark when i was a schoolmaster said the other dryly a settled fly is a fair test of skill well sir may i crave a confident word with you the postboy is out of earshot i think i thank you and i premise that this little expedition is of my sole conception and at my own cost and that the associates of whom you spoke know nothing of it i see you would have stolen a march on them precisely and if possible secure for myself alone the booty that all desire to share you are candour itself i read in it my better policy believe me necessity is my fostermother and her vile children are my comrades once i was blameless though a schoolmaster the birchrod was my business the fishingrod my recreation a passion for elzivirs my ruin i stole to allay ita crime as white as the theft of bread to a starving man the law took cognizance grudging me all but my dry bones of syntax i have suffered but i am no more vicious now than then i desire no gauds or vanities but means only to the satisfying of this scholarly craving for books to gorge on which you would pilfer a stone worth you see i play out my hand squarely making no pretence of misreading your motives the tall rascal smiled as to that he said i must do honour to your profound penetration yes sir the lake of wine is what i am after and for the rest a passion is none that halts on the hither side of satiety you could understand spending a thousand or fifty thousand pounds on horses but horses die sir or breedin and degenerate whereas written words beget great thoughts that in their turn intermarry and beget greater well mr branderand do you propose that i give you this stone to buy books with i propose to come to terms with you on the subject terms you must really forgive my outspokenness from a cutpurse and a cutthroatterms from one who has no shadow of a title to the gem or even if he had has attempted to enforce it by means ridiculously illegal upon my word sir for a schoolmaster brander waved a tolerant but extremely dirty hand i will question you mr tuke he said why am i a cutthroat ah had i been a scholar of yours i might answer maybe a mere veil of satire to conceal a paucity of proof why sir why i ask you are insistent shall we suggestapart from reasonable surmise as to your general careerthat you had a hand say twenty years ago in the murder of a colleague under these very gallows twenty years ago i was acting usher at a school oh we wont be particular to a day or two mr brander straddled his legs knuckled one fist upon his hip under his coatskirt and with his other hand rasped his chin meditatively well said he give a dog a bad name tis all of second importance only being so tis scarce worth an untruth sir i regard lies as strong watersthe more regularly indulged in the weaker is their effect when needed this is no particular occasion for one i had no hand in the man cutwaters death i had not then any shadowy knowledge even of the great stone or the concealment of it that brought about his fate nor of the admirable mr fern nor of jack fern who alone i believe of the original gang survives you interest me vastly then i protest it is a fatuous policy of that gentleman to make him new confidants in the secret when had he worked alone he might have aimed at securing all for himselfas you are doing but you really flatter my credulity let it pass then and pray why did mr fern never return to the assault i had the story in rough from him in newgate where we were confined together in that he was put in for an old affair before the other scandal had blown by and that there he had remained ever since his band dispersed or tied upand the year after he went to botany bay along with governor phillip and his fleet of offscourings and here he is back againat the end of twenty yearsan escaped convict i presume with an expedagogue for lieutenant and a tradition to trade upon surely he is forfeit to the law at the outset and upon my word mr brander your confidences are embarrassing make him over to the hangman sir i give you my honour ill help you maybe i could prove his title to a fast place in execution dock i see you are really a very admirable rascal but youll want your price oh without doubt and that isno no mr brander not half the value of the stone its a damned risky business mr tuke i play my life against a competence but listen my friend what claim has any one of you to a share in the ruby if it comes to that what claim have you none whatever see here sir the man was one of us the stone was fair spoil for divisionnot the perquisite of a single masterrogue it was no appendage conditional on your acquisition of the propertynow was it you know all about it i see well mr brander your boy theres getting impatient the long mans jaw hung slack while he rubbed it and a very evil look came into his eyes is that tantamount to saying you decline to treat he said your boy mr brander i yield you precedence of the road sir ive given you my confidence by god youll know what that means i never asked for it youll observe the devil looked out of mr tukes eyes and he set his teeth you dog he cried low what makes you dare presume thus upon my tolerance his fingers were nervous with his pistolstock he took a quick step forward at that branders fury came with a clap presume he hissed and cried it again with a scream a cursed broken gamester that darent show his face in public a posted defaulter a despicable and despised spendthrift with a wilderness for his reversion oh i understand you siri understand you youre a woundy character by god and youll make disposition of the stone and think to patch your reputation with banknotes but beware sir theres no law of heaven or earth that gives you a title to the gem to withhold it from the just processes of barter is to put yourself without the pale of consideration why who are youwho are you i he choked with his very rage and stood impotently quivering his clenched fists mr brander said the other absolutely suave and unheated i give you two minutes to mount and be off the click of his flintlock cut in like the snap of teeth for a moment it looked as if a tragedy were near enacting the gallows chains swung by the wind creaked with rusty laughter high overhead a crow lazily drifting down the valley checked its course a speculative instant and resumed it with a peevish and contemptuous caw brander had turned abruptly and was stalking towards his chaise once only he looked back over his shoulder and then there was no expression on his face but a smile but that mr tuke would have given a dozen rubies to obliterate with a bullet chapter xxxiv for all the starkness of frost that now befell it was not till the early days of february that the packed heavens began to discharge themselves of the congested stores of snow they had been long garnering by then the ground was iron a foot deep the last green thing was withered upon itself dead birds hung in the hedgerows and rabbits were stuck stiff in their burrows familiar presentments of trees and buildings offered strange new aspects as seen from the middle of frozen ponds and the very least sap of nature was so withdrawn as that it seemed a marvel the principle of life could endure to hug itself with any promise of spring but to our gentleman waking one morning there was earnest of the first white fall outside in the wan light struck rigidly from the ceiling he rose and went to the window and saw the cold sheet spread pure and beautiful and hiding all his world and at that he knew himself committed to such a prolonged hobnobbing with his lares as he had never before experienced he was hardly discomfited this prospective imprisonment carried with it a picture of home occupations very peaceful and unvexed sheltered from the wind he would study to make of himself a shepherd beloved of his flock a vision of a sombre library full of serious warmth and winking bookbacks with himself a quiet dreaming student in the dusk afternoons set in the midst appealed pleasantly to his minds eye it should be a period of pregnant repose while thought and virtue should grow large within him and induce him to a nobler attitude towards life in the modest enthusiasm engendered of this prospect he even wished it would snow ever more and more until he and his were shut in beyond a last chance of present rescue and if the desire proved him less foreseeing from the domestic point of view than he would have imagined it did at least most fully avouch his honesty of purpose since his return he had rather courted seclusion nor had he gone much abroad norbe it markedventured within the radiated influence of the first inn he had in consequence no personal knowledge of those movements of mr brander that were subsequent to his interview with him but he kept dennis to whom he had given his confidence in the matter on the alert and that good servingman reported that no information was in the neighbourhood of any recrudescence of blackguardism on the part of the dog and duck therefore he was fain to hope that the baffled exschoolmaster had for the time being succumbed to circumstance and withdrawn himself as he came now on that afternoon of the first snow mr tuke was busying himself in the room he had made his private and personal study and darda was helping him to the arrangement of his none too numerous volumes when her brother came in to crave a word with his master sir said he i believe you would like to know that sir david and miss royston are returned to chatters tuke looked up in some surprise already he said are you sure indeed yes sir i had it from betty pollack betty she drove over today sir with her father for orders hearing that you had come back and she stated that young gamble had happened upon sir david and party posting over the high downs at six oclock yesterday evening oh very well dennis the man withdrew and the master resumed his labours preoccupied presently he slapped a book down upon the table andyou must go on by yourself darda said he and left the room for some minutes after his exit the girl remained motionless where she stood her ear turned to the last echo of his retreating footstep her face like a deepcut cameo stained with blue shadows the glory of her hair flaming against a background of snow from her whiteness and her quiet she might have been the very ghost of some burning thought awake for the first time to the winter of its desolation presently she uttered a little heartrending sigh and went on forlornly with her occupation her master in the meanwhile was gone about his business and that was no less than a visit to the returned travellers his resolve to undertake this was not the fruit of any desperate hope he had no natural inclination to hold himself cheaply in questions of moral treatment and he was sensitive in a manly way to the insolences of feminine rebuke but he had schooled himself into an attitude towards miss royston which only some real act of violence to his feelings should convince him was entirely unjustified and he would not consent to yield his office at that ladys little court unless he were to suffer an outspoken decree of banishment he had made up his mind in fact like a little naughty but repentant boy to be good and good he would be if properly encouraged now he was to see if angela would resume her former self with her accustomed life and desiring test of this he would plunge once more into the fire and here i regret to say all his eremitic visions dissolved into thin air and he was decided that for him the running brooks must suffice for library he walked through the deep snow to chatters and was removing his coat in the hall thereof after being admitted when a lofty and languid figure came upon him and paused in some fatigued surprise on its way to a roomdoor he uttered an exclamation and advancing upon this person accosted him decidedly cavalierly you here dunlone he said this is entirely unexpected the viscount in his disdain looked particularly like a camel but he gave no answer well said tuke being here i should like to ask you a question have you acquainted our friends of my real title oh curse it no said the lord what the devils it got to do with me thats right i have my reasons for the change of course and ill ask you to respect them i give myself no cursed concern about it i dont know that it makes much difference cried my lord irritably you seem to think ive no affairs but yours to consider youll not be offensive i know said tuke its not your way the other sniffed and preceded the visitor into the drawingroom he the latter pondered profoundly on his short journey thither and steeled himself against probabilities but here he was agreeably and quite surprisingly flattered miss royston received him with a charming navet of welcome and seemed to encourage him to assume the rle of a familiar neighbour are you not astonished to see us back so soon she said you know how eagerly i grasp at any excuse for a return to the country through all the clash and sparkle of town i hear the birds singing and see the lambs frisking in the meadows theyre not so much as dropped in january said dunlone seriously miss angela blushed mr tuke will understand me she said with a plaintive glance at that gentleman he coughed and bowed and was altogether wholly perplexed as to the nature of her present attitude towards him and what was the excuse you grasped at said he she made a little moue with her lipsshe was amazingly confidentialand shrugged her pretty shoulders at the oblivious viscount he was returning to cornwall she whispered and almost drove us home that he might make a halfway house of chatters i vow we were forced to come she was delightfully secretive there was no mention of my lords tailor almost tuke misdoubted that dunlone had kept his aristocratic faith with him well said he were all beholden to him anyhow whatever was his motive she lifted her shoulders again at that her expression said plainly his motive you know as well as i do sir what is the lure to any male creature in this house he is not a first example of savoir vivre she whispered but if he is a cub he is a tigercub does that recommend him in your eyes what hypocrisy to pretend it does not in any he may feed like a wolf but he hath the royal coat and his stripes shall cover a multitude of sins or rib a whole vessel of emptiness no doubt she said with a light laugh he sat silent some moments was she sincere he pondered or could it be possible she merely sought to play him into check with this insolent pawn now for the first time it occurred to him that his own hitherto tactics might have lacked fairness miss royston was very prettily instinct with the prudence of her class and it could be nothing less than wrongheadedness that should hold her to blame for subordinating passion to a sense of refinement indeed what better security against weakness or levity could she present him than this very reluctance of hers to submit herself to the suit of an uncertified admirer if in the unacknowledged bitterness of his own degradation he had taken some savage pleasure in presenting his least admirable side to the world was this uninterested lady to be called upon to discriminate in the question of his grievances or not rather to be the more commended for tentatively holding his approaches in check with such a prize to win it had surely been his more honourable course not to read in her reserve a force antagonistic to his own but to inventory his every possession and place all with the truth at her feet why in short should she whose heart he could not flatter himself he had taken at once and by storm be content to consign her long traditions of refinement to one who could give no assurance of his right position to maintain and honour the gift then he thought i have creels consent and it only needs another kind word from her and the truth shall come i will tell her what are my real name and title and so learn for once and for all if satisfied on these points she will be willing to forego both for the third item on the listthe man himself and at this pass in pops sir david with his round face like a fullstop and puts the period for the time being to a very promising situation the baronet it must be said showed some embarrassment over the contretemps i aint responsible for this dunlone business you know his pained eyebrows pleaded to tuke i dont profess to understand angel and shes as wilful as the deuce she is he would nevertheless have had his friend stay to dinner but this tuke would not consent to pleading his ridingdress and boots for excuse and protesting that he must go after he had drunk the dish of tea miss royston had promised him all the time he was there the lady made much of her visitor while my lord sat by on a sofa with his mouth like a slurmark in music sulkily employing himself in ripping the gold thread from a swordknot for this exquisite had brought his drizzling box with hima beautiful tortoiseshell casket with the dunlone stork in silver on the lid and within a neat array of hiltbands shoulderstraps and galloons of tarnished laceand would sit by the hour together silent as a trappist while he unravelled his yarn and wound it upon wooden reels out of the sale of these he would tell you he made quite a little monthly income for there was no outlay the material being cajoled from easy friends or accepted from parasites and without doubt the occupation and its moral fitted him like a glove he did not even look up when the other came to bid him goodevening but tuke thought he heard him murmur oh curse it under his breath and was fain to accept this benediction as a negative testimony to the value put upon him as a rival and to the capriciousness of the soft sex in general the short winter afternoon was closing in as our gentleman profoundly cogitating on the policy it should be best to pursue with a ravissante who would thus humble or exalt him according to the whimsies of her mood came down to his own gate in the hollow where the ruined lodge was situated here much had been redressed and improved so thatthough the building itself remained an enbowered wreckthe entrance and the drive presented an ordered appearance and indeed to any lover of the picturesque an aspect quite alluring in its sweet and lofty loneliness he had entered and clankedto the gate behind him when something glimmering to the back of a treetrunk brought him to a pause and immediately he advanced upon it and skirting the bole jerked to a stop and cried betty she stood before him her head hanging and her face gone a little white and she knitted her fingers together and had not it seemed a word to say why what are you doing here in the dusk and the snow he said in something of a stern voice i understood you had gone back with your grandfather her forehead under its hood took a line of pain and her lips trembled he thought he foresaw the coming shower and his reluctance to encourage it made him assume a little harshness where is your grandfather he said coldly and brusquely at that she glanced up at him like a frightened child dontdont be angry with me her looks said plainly betty he asked reproachfully grandfather went on first she whispered and i was to follow why why didnt you go with him at that her tears came thick and fast she shook before him trying to repress them you cant go that long way by yourself he said more gently why did you remain behind he had to bend his head to catch the hurried sobbing answer i wanted to see youonly to see you and not be seen you have been awayhave kept away so long have i vexed you it was what i thought was right but im weak to hold by all i resolved i only wanted to see you and now ill go she moved a quick step towards the gate he let her retreat a pace or two for the first time i think he realized what he had been doing he struggled fiercely with himself but no he could not part with her like this betty he cried again softly you must come back to me she hesitated turned and came he put her in front of him and took her face between his hands oh my dear he said what have i done she looked up piteously into his eyes no no she whispered in a drowned voice youre not to blame you keep your wordyou would have me keep mine like the gentleman you are itsits what betty only let me see you now and thensee you and not be spoken to or noticed how can i prevent you if you will but would it be wise she drew herself away from him gently but forcibly no it would not she said in a low voice but love is never that yes lovewhy should i hide it and i have found out what i wanted to know i shall soon hear the bells ringing for your wedding andandoh why did you ever kiss me and at that she ran from him he called to her hurried after her but she was heedless he saw her speed up the road and he durst not follow he knew that countrybred girl as she was she would make little of the miles to stockbridge even were her grandfather not awaiting her at a distance which he thought improbable then retracing his steps with a groan he went on to his house he walked sternly he was not only despicable in his own eyes but cruel in a manner he had not thought was possible to his nature as he entered his hall dennis came upon him with startled eyes sir he said eagerly may i have a word with you chapter xxxv i have found out where was hid the lake of wine tuke withdrawn into his dininghall was sprung to his feet and faced his servingman with wide eyes he the latter was all hurried and highstrung his lips looked as if his teeth were chattering god forgive me sir he said and grant me no break in your favour i would in his holy name the bugbear had not risen again to vex us but so it is and i must do my duty by acquainting you of the particulars why man whats all the todo you are not about to convict yourself only of carelessness or stupidity sir before heaven i might have guessed had i the wit of a mouse but her cranks and her whimsies poor soul have been little inviting to my soberer tastes and whose cranks my sister dardas has she revealed the hidingplace she has known it all along from near the time when she first brought the deadly thing into her collection now dennis will you craze me by assuming so much of intuition on my part out with it all man to what are you alluding to it sirthat gallows relic the skull do you mean yes yes was the low answer and what of it it is hid therein a pregnant pause fell between the two now said the master presently give me the whole history as plain as you can speak the man looked up appealingly some strange knowledge or emotion was impeding his every effort at an explanation but at last he forced himself to speech i have noticed her very strange of lateever sincei have noticed her very strange sir her soul seemed caught in a deeper thrall than she had known before somehow there has appeared more of the woman in her eyes and less of madness today in the dusk afternoon she came upon me out of your library sir where she was at work dennis she said all in a moment isnt there a love that can be bribed with gifts of jewels i answered the poor wench laughingoh yes no doubt there was tell him she saidtell him your master that i know where the great ruby is hid i said so once to him before but then it was for hate and he should know nothing now he shall learn the truth if he will i remember something of it go on tell him i said to you she went on that the chalky dead eye of the skull is the jewel itself and that the eyesocket is its hidingplace tuke drew himself back uttered a great sigh and stood staring oh sir continued the man i was as wildly incredulous of it as you much more she said and that i am fain not to injustice the poor wench by repeating but on the main point she was firm that the very dead eye of the horror was the lake of wine itself yes andoh sir when at last i came to think of the living highwayman as i knew him of his resourceful cunning and ingenuity of how in my memory of him this fixed and protruding eye painted into the semblance of a real one stood out horribly under the nerveless lid i was forced to the conclusion that she spoke right and had been all these years the solitary warder of the secret why did she hold nor ever reveal it how could she guess it was there and why being there did it not escape when the head fell sir sir think she is mad she would penetrate and maintain such a secret with every artifice as to the stones breaking away the skin was all contracted and toughened about it like leather dennisthis is an insane idea and yetwhy great god the skulls gone he stared blankly at his man oh he murmured in a moment if by any chance there is truth in thisif the wild story is no bogle of the girls distemperhow my own peevishness and cruelty react upon myself he took the other by the shoulder dennis he said you have your revenge at last no no no then where is the skull what have you done with it the man hesitated did you burn it destroy it cried tuke speak out man i am the only one to blame i did not destroy it sir i yes yes oh out with it in the devils name i gave it to the woman and she took it away the woman what ah you mean the gipsy i saw you in talk with it all recurred to him in a momentthe stolen interview the bundle passed from one to the other where is she he said faintly do you know where she is iyes sir i could lead you to the wild place she inhabits you must do so said tuke eagerly i have done an unwitting wrong to a great sufferer dennis you will lead me to her wont you and help me to the recovery of this accursed stone sir it is accursed i think but i will lead you to her good fellowbut why did you make her its custodian what did she want with it and has she it still i will answer for her with her life in that he looked strange and his master as strangely on him what did she want with it repeated the latter sir sirhow can i say perhaps for memory of a great criminal god forgive him i implore you not to force me to an answer tuke scarcely seemed to heed him or his obvious distress his vision was lost in preoccupation wait he said as if talking to himself we must take luvaine into our confidence before we go further it is his right to know all and he must judge me fairly be quiet and secret my good fellow and dont touch upon this subject again without my invitation he dismissed his servant and sat for an hour in the red firelight deeply pondering the snow pricked and rustled on the casement as he dreamed by the still glowing hearth a stealthy noise of mice was behind the wainscot and through all the house the stealthy tread of unseen things wandering about the ghostly rooms overhead one of these seemed to reveal itselfhere at his feet it crept in very quietly its white bosom heaving its hair like a flame of autumn mist and put warm lips to his hand as it hung slackly and seized and held it a moment against its soft neckand so went silently the way it had come by and by he roused himself and looked up with a smile halfcomic and halfpitiful for a country squire of particular morals he murmured i am quite unduly st anthonied by these visions did ever man so pay the penalty of his weakness chapter xxxvi sir david blythewood had a particularly infectious laugh and like all men who make a plaything of their own dignity he was wont to find his risibilities tickled consumedly before the solemnity of anothers selfimportance sooner or later the humorous side of any situation would find him and then perhaps it was only those at whom his mischief of merriment was directed who failed to appreciate his sense of the comical now the history of the lake of wine as he knew it had been almost a lifelong tradition with him and a very seriously romantic one too but this latest phase of it was destined to quite suddenly make its appeal to himafter some weighty and respectful considerationfrom a quarter that it appeared his gravity had left unguarded that it did so is mentioned in this connection for the reason that a certain explosion of mirth on his part was fruitful of consequences he and tuke had ridden over to winchester to acquaint luvaine of the progress of events perhaps they had not thought to do more than discuss the matter according to promise with this melancholy monomaniac he however had relieved them of any hospitable embarrassment they might have felt by at once without any attempt at apology inviting himself to return with them with the intimation that it would go nearer to satisfy him if they could thresh out the question on the spot in order to this therefore tukestifling a certain natural antipathy he felt to the manhad prevailed upon him to become for awhile his guest at delsrop and now the three slowly trotting by way of a harshly white and ironbound country were making chill and rather silent for that lonely dwellingplace riding down into stockbridge with little concern for anything but the dangerous road tuke had the tail of his eye nevertheless for the first inn and for betty standing at the door thereof serving a mug of ale to a solitary traveller the girl dropped a curtsey as in duty bound to the gentlemen two of whom saluted her in replyblythewood smilingly tuke gravely but the wenchs fair soft figure standing there in bravery of the bitter cold and her sad mouth and lowered eyelids dwelt with him by many an after mile and his heart throbbed out to the forlorn passion he was so hopeless to comfort by and by sir david turned to his friend a face that struggled with some tickling convulsion what the deuce is the matter with you said the latter eh oh nothinnothin whatever tuke i say did you note the gentleman in the jumper gentleman where him that was drinkin the ale no i dont think i did didnt you well you mark my word weve some more of these misbegotten rooks flown into the neighbourhood and itll behoove us to keep the salt ready for their tails oh did he look that sort that he did and it made you laugh eh for answer all the little mans features swelled to a ripe colour and he seemed on the verge of an explosion tuke shook his head with a grin repudiating responsibility in the matter and they rode on a mile further without a word exchanged amongst them then suddenly blythewood was rolling in his saddle shrieking with laughter and they all drew rein beside a little copse what inspires this said luvaine amazed and haughty his baneful expression set the young man off again i cant help it he gasped im sorry luvainebut but well sir if youll condescend to speak perhaps we shall be quick to share in your merriment it was so extremely unlikely as far as he was concerned that the mere suggestion brought a fresh paroxysm from the delinquent oh he cried at lastto think of all these years of a grievance like yoursof the solemn counsels and the wise heads wagginand then to learn that the gashly eye of the creature that we turned from lookin at should ha been the very stone itself tuke caught himself grinning again but luvaine furiously red in a moment drew up stiff in his saddle and you find this food for laughter he said in a high voice a grievance quothaonly a grievance that hath wrought the ruin of two souls and for me in the prime of life a childless and haunted old age oh luvaine said sir david struggling for gravity i didnt mean to cheapen you man or to withhold my sympathy from the problematic mrs l whowho very imprudently married the barberhe added with a shout of merriment tuke saw fit to put in a hasty word he has earned a laugh let it be at you or me captain luvaine for though i take no loss of the robbery i swear the knowledge of it has ridden me like a nightmare the soldier waved his hand bah he saidthe crackling of thorns he dismounted to tighten his saddlegirth david he said over the straps has had his phases of idiotcy from my first knowledge of him at this the culprit went into a fresh fit no but he said when he could recover his voiceon your honour dyou believe the girls statement tuke why not if im credulous im happy and theres the true philosophy of life in a nutshell he was struggling with his own imp of merriment the other had set it squiggling so that he was fain to look upon all this portentous business from a new irreverent point of view and that cutwater kept the jewel in his eyehole persisted sir david for all the world to see and did he sacrifice the sound article to accommodate it that i cannot account for he was blind on one side before ever you saw him youve got him to the life i perceive and he wore a dummy optic no doubt and substituted tother all ingeniously painted for it when he conceived the resplendent idea i confess i never thought it out but youve done it masterly aint i what a genius i amalmost as good a one as cutwater eh luvaine that was strung up on the downs and a fortune in his head for any crow to peck at youd have given an eye for an eye to know that wouldnt you but it needed a crazed girl to see into the creatures methods and bag the prize when it fell while all the rest of us were hunting counter are you taunting me sir let me tell you your jesting is illtimed i would have known better at least than to have ordered away the skull without first examining it on my honour sir said tuke much amused i am not a coroner nor even a j p oh well muttered the soldieri am ready gentlemen as he was preparing to mount tuke said sir david now i think ontwasnt it that girl at the inn first gave you warning of mr breeds and his gang betty pollack yes he answered brusquely and touched his horse with his heel the women it seems give us the lead in this business betty said tuke with a little fierce glow of emotion is gold to the inside of her heart now gentlemenand keep your eyes alert by your favour as we pass the dog and duck a creaking and pounding of the frozen snow and the three were on their way once more the long white stretches of road behind them returned to the sombreness of quiet that their human voices had interrupted the very dun sky that seemed to have withdrawn in high offence at their careless chatter drooped down again frowning and austere to resume its ward of the imprisoned forces of life no movement was in the stiff spurs of grass or in the petrified hedgerows no least cry of bird or insect in all the wastes of air yet something there was that gave out a stealthy sound by and bysomething that all the time they talked had held its panic breath in the copse and sweated with terror lest the little snap of some twig under its feet should reveal its hidingplacesomething with a puffed leaden face and coward eyesthe unlovely mr breeds in fact he would not come out into the road even after the last echo of the horsemens retreat had died away but he crept to his little windy house on the hill by the way he had comeand mr breedss way was always a backstairs one once only he paused and his weak evil features gathered all the definite expression of scoundrelism they could master betty pollack he muttered so it was you my girl that set your dirty little torch to the beacon now aint it dangerous to play with fire betty and what should you say if it came to burn your own fingers he mused a moment then brought his hand softly down on his thigh but the skull comes first he murmured whatll they give me for that piece of news i wonder chapter xxxvii the night fell dead and blank and with it came the snow crisp largeflaked dropping silently as autumn leaves in a windless garden these were but the pickets of a gathering armywhose cloudy regiments moved up unwieldily from the northwest where for weeks they had been forming and manuvringand the world looked indifferently on them little thinking how presently it should be overwhelmed in the rush of forces of which they were the pioneers sometimes a little galloping wind like one of a distracted staff would scatter a company of them right and left and then to folks withindoors would sound a rubbing noise on windowpanes as if stealthy fingers were feeling for the hasp if i had not lived all my life amongst ghosts said luvaine i should fear this house of yours mr tuke he rose as he spoke the three gentlemen were sitting over their wine in the great dininghall of delsrop and walking to the casement plucked aside a corner of the wide crimson curtain that hung thereover and stood looking out into the night the dark is full of white faces he muttered they writhe with laughter and flash down and are gone there did you hear that blythewood glanced with a shrug of his shoulders at his host oh luvaine he crieddamn your shuddering fancies come to the table man and take your glass like an honest soldier the captain dropped the curtain and walked slowly back to his place that i am he said and that i have been through all the buffets of fate but its trouble david that teaches a man to look inward and there does he concentrate his gaze he acquires the gift of second sight and what does it advantage him to ride with a spectre on his pillion ive a shorter and pleasanter way to see double he lifted his glass with a jolly chuckle heres to the memory of mr cutwater the greatest broker of his age yet who got broke himself in the end he cried luvaine declined to drink oh said tuke laughing give him the nailtoast sir he hath kept the gem in trust for you all these years you are pleased to be facetious gentlemen it is all little of a jesting matter to me i will not drink a murdering thief why said blythewood he might retaliate by disputing your title since he had the stone in his eye from the first moment of his hearing of it he chuckled joyously over his own pleasantry but the other would condescend to no answer but a wave of the hand to dismiss the subject do you drink the night out he said mr tuke he turned sombrely to his host i would be loth to presume upon your hospitality but sirsir i must venture to hint i am here for a purpose that is not yet satisfied something like a muttered oath escaped from tukes lips he however forced his goodhumour to the front why captain luvaine he said i assumed that a travelled guest would prefer to postpone business to the morning i cannot look upon this as business sir in the ordinary senseno more than the signing of a reprieve every moment in the delay of which is torture to him most concerned well wellif you regard it in that light blythewood protested against this unseemly wetblanketing of a convivial meeting but he was graciously overborne by his host who rose and rang the bell send mr whimple to me he told the servant who answered the summons the man came flushed and nervous tuke saw that the door was carefully closed gathered with his friends about the hearth and bade dennis to stand by them now he said in a low voice this is captain luvaine whimple from whose father was stolen the lake of wine tell us plainly and in a few words the story of its discovery by your sister the man bowed and moistened his lips once or twice he glanced in a frightened way about him as if he sought some loophole of escape from the situation gentlemen twas in the winter of that the body his body fell from the chains and that the skull was brought hither by my sisterthen a child of five and a poor natural as she has ever beento add to a strange collection of oddsandends it has been her delight to form and there it had remained to a certain day after the coming of my master who took an objection to it and bade me rid the house of the thing he paused and passed a hand across his wet brow go on said tuke i will take the blame of its disappearance and i confess i acted harshly to the girl luvaine from lowered eyelids shot a malignant glance at the speaker there was a woman continued dennis faintly that used to come upon me from time to time for the little help i could afford hera strange wild wanderer whose hand was against every man as she imagined every mans was against her i gave the skull to her she asked for it she would keep and cherish it she said inin memory of a great criminal i gave it to her and she took it away where began luvaine but tuke motioned him to silence let the man tell his story in his own way he said it has been gone long months said whimple when suddenly this day or two ago my sister ah gentlemen he interpolated with great emotionshe hath not the wit to distinguish between right and wrong amazes me with the confession that from early in her possession of the skull she has known a great crimson stonewhich later she learned to identify by its fanciful titleto be fixed and buried in one of its eyesockets and that this stone had been at one time cemented smoothly over its outer surface and something resembling the picture of an eye enamelled thereon gentlemen all confounded as i was i rushed to my master and told him what i had heard luvaine was jerking in his chair and gnawing his knuckles like a madman whither has it been taken he cried in a strangled voice that is the one moral of this accursed concatenation of accident and brutality what has she done with itwhere does she live this woman she must be come atmy god she must be held responsible and whipped into disgorging whimple had shrunk back but for all his instinctive action his face had taken a dark flush she must be assured from violence whatever has happened he said in a pretty strong voice or i will not move a finger to help you to her tuke put in a decided word this first sign of courage in his manservant surprised and pleased him i guarantee her gentle treatment dennis he said the man turned gratefully to his master i know you would sir its to you i reveal the truth and god grant that she wont curse me for betraying her were i to go alone and endeavour to recover the relic luvaine sprang to his feet interrupting him no he cried savagely ill permit no such risk i want no broker to deal for me lead me to the placethats all i ask tuke turned to his servant where is it he said in a note of contempt that he could not control hardening his voice whimple was about to answer when a sound in the room disturbed them all luvaine broke out into a great oath how did she come in what does she want fling her out at the door sir david cried damme sir you forget yourself captain luvaine said that gentlemans entertainer a very ugly expression tightening his mouthmaking every allowance for your condition of mind i must ask you to leave the propriety of my servants behaviour to be judged by me even at that the rabid creature could do little but pretend to control his passion i will apologize he said sullenly take any form of words you like from me only do me the kindness to dismiss this person surely sir you can see how maddening is this interruption to me at the critical moment i can see indeed and regret it he walked towards the door and put his hand kindly on dardas shoulder for darda it was that had come softly and unbidden into the room and who stood silently awaiting the upshot of the explosion her entrance had evoked her slim white figure her immobile face and glowing hair made of her against the firelit wall such a presentment of the spiritual as one sees in old cathedral frescoes but at her masters touch a rose grew to her cheek announcing her all one at heart with pitiful humanity what is it darda she looked up in his face with solemn eyes the shadows she whisperedthey are abroad again far off at presentbut they are stretching towards the house and by and by they will reach it he scanned her face earnestly suddenly it recurred to him how once before this fancy of hers had been significant of a certain peril come he said hurriedlycome and show me he cried to his companions that he would be back in a moment hesitated and called to dennis to follow him luvaine uttered a wild exclamation but he took no heed of it out in the hall the girl sped swiftly to the stairway the two men following her a startled housemaid made room for them to pass and afterwards announced in the kitchen that she had seen crazy playing followmyleader with master and her brother up to the very top floor of the house further by way of a flight of steps to a trapdoor and so to the leads where the frost sparkled like emery paper darda climbed and the men pursued her and there in the high freezing night she stood erect and pointed with her hand tuke gave out a note of surprise far away where stockbridge townlet lay under the horizon hills a broad blot of crimson was soaked into the sagging of the cloudcanopy above this red stain palpitated like a very heart of fear so that to gaze on it was to be insensibly influenced by a sympathetic emotion and in the beating of its pulse rays and spars of shadows shot forth and were withdrawn and appeared again in other quarters as if truly something were there struggling in its death throes denniswhereabouts is it by the position sir well east of the village about mr pollacks inn i should reckon his master started violently pollacks inn he muttered and cried good god it must be blazing to the roof a momentary amazed expression was on his facesomething some sense of omen or catastrophe knocked at his heartthen he addressed his man with immediate decisiveness order my horse to be saddled dennisquickly and silently say nothing of it to those within there but when i am gone make sir david my apologies and ask him if he will to await my return the servant responded and disappeared for some minutes tuke stood his gaze concentrated on the wavering splotch of light his brain banded it seemed with a filament of steel if any figure was imaged tenderly and pitifully in his soul it was not that that breathed close by him in the icy shadow of the roof that watched his every look and motion like a dog indeed so little was she that had brought him there in his mind that when in another minute he turned to descend he almost brushed her in his passage without being recalled thereby to thought of her presence going softly down he found dennis already mounted in the yard with the bridle of his masters horse held in his hand whimple he exclaimed i go with you sir said the man boldly who knows what you may be riding to but my good fellowsir david and the captain sir you come first i have passed on your message how could he gainsay him it gave him a thrill of exquisite pleasure thus to experience a devotion that could so overcrow a constitutional timidity silently together they padded it down the snowy drive and in another minute were galloping along the road to stockbridge high on the roof a figure watched their departure the girl had scarcely moved since her master left her alone but now her slender feet went crisp on the frost as she paced to and fro in the angle of the gables once suddenly she paused at the limit of her path where the gutterledge kneehigh formed the topmost courses of the housefront and here she leapt upon the parapet and stretched out her arms in a perilous manner into the dizzy whiteness of space i know she said nodding downwards fantastically but would you catch me if i jumped it would hurt him to the heart to find me when he comes back lying there all crushed and broken she seemed to listen her face falling into shadow to the heart she repeated with a catch in her voice it wouldit would for all your secret laughing chapter xxxviii pushing onward at what fury of speed the dangerous state of the road permitted tuke like a good captain would not subordinate his prudence to his eagerness true he had nothing but a vague sense that some evil was abroad to justify his mood of suspicion yet forasmuch as this mood was unaccountable it behoved him to move circumspectly through the first stages of reconnoitre therefore it was that coming to the top of the long dip on the crest of whose further slope stood mr breedss little illomened tavern he called to dennis and pulling on his left rein cantered his horse on to the easterly downs with the idea of making a dtour that should bring him into the winchester road a halfmile above stockbridge this was judicious enough but it was some aggravation of his impatience to find now with what infinite caution it was necessary to proceed over the frozen wastes of grass and crumbling chalk patches a rushed camp of molehillsa film of catice roofing some unsuspected hollow trodden uponand all his fine purposes of help might end in a broken neck fortunately there was a young wintry moon whose radiance struck back from the snow made such a spectral twilight as it was possible to steer through he groaned to himself as yard by yard they crept upon their way and still the red glow seemed as far off as ever once indeed looking as in a dream he fancied they must have wandered widely afield away from instead of towards the fire for then the latter seemed to have sunk in a little glimmer amongst distant hills as if many miles separated it from them but the next moment there came a great bellying upward of smoke distinctly evident to their eyes and immediately the pall was attacked and devoured by a dozen shooting tongues of flame that slobbered myriads of sparks like blood as the monster of fire rent its prey the roof has gone in sir aye aye dennis we must be near the road by now i think not so near as he hoped and desired it was a full hour and a half from the start when they broke at last into the winchester highway and went down cautiously into the village for many minutes before there had been no doubt in tukes mind but that his worst apprehensions would be realized the first inn it was that was alightthe old house endeared to him in a sense by more than one tender memory how did it happen he asked of himself and thought halfcomicallyi must assure the poor girl it was like enough to have been spontaneous combustion from the long warmth of hospitality it carried in its heart then he rebuked his levity betty betty he thought are you safe my dearand at the fear the word evoked his breath caught in something like a sob the fury of the fire was over when they came upon the scene and stopped before the ravaged and gutted carcass of the once picturesque inn but still the blackened walls blossomed with little spits and fronds of flame and scarlet lines drawn upon the heavy curtains of smoke showed where smouldering beams clung tenacious of their hold the road was full of a drifting and pungent fog and therein the whole village was alive scurrying hither and thither in excitement like a colony of ants whose nest had been overturned on the outskirts of this press the two men dismounted were standing holding their horses when a country youth his red face all blubbered with tears and dust came hurriedly up to them and seized tuke by the sleeve mastermaster took he exclaimed in a broken voice jimgood god man how did this come about by foul play your honour and may the living hell be their portion that done it steady man ill ha justice o themill ha justice o them by the lord look at it look here missy pollacks homeher that never done a hard thing by a soul and treated poor jim like a man drove a pauper at a blow and her grandfather all burnt and choked and she cluckin to him like a hen thats laid where is she take me to her the poor fellow pulled him forward immediately shouting to those who interposed to make way for the gentleman that was come to see justice done on scoundrels and murderers some stared and some grinned but one and all were too loutishly absorbed in the extempore show that yet crackled for their benefit to thrust an undesirable company upon him so they let him pass undisturbed and continued to ply the ashes from their useless buckets with what water they could find while buffoonery and the animal jest at anothers misfortune kept them in a fine glow of goodhumour to a barn in an adjacent yard jim conducted his captive by way of a sidegate that had been closed against intruders within gathered about the open door of the shed was a little knot of men whose dress showed them for the most part to be of the respectable class of village gentry these tuke saluted as he advanced i trust gentlemen he said that this i hear of the innkeeper is an exaggerated report one of the company who was muffled up in a great surtout and swung a horn lantern in his hand detached himself from the group and came towards him the man is dead sir he said dead he has succumbed to shock induced by a period of inhalation of irrespirable gases and aggravated by some superficial burns i am dr harmsworth sir at your service mr tuke bowed and can you inform me dr harmsworth he said of the history of this catastrophe in faith sir i cannot but it looks an ugly business the wench it appears was gone to visit a neighbour and the stableman to squire her when they returnthere is smoke leaking through the roof of the tap they burst in and are met by a vaporous volley of flame the old man is down on the floor insensible in the midst of it they drag him out and the young man hath the wit to observe that the fire has its three distinct sources or centres of eruption that to my mind suspicions of some foulness but him that could have best acquainted us of the truth has his mouth sealed to the day of judgment he is dead he is dead sir and his granddaughter she is in there with the body her grief is very poignant for the moment i must see her by your leave sir i must see her dr harmsworth you neednt say me nay sir i know and would act the part of friend by her the doctor would have further protested but jim put him roughly to one side and made a way for his gentleman in here sir he said it was a little sombre pathetic scene that tuke faced as he entered a flaring candle stuck in a cleftstick split up the windy darkness of the interior into spokes of light and shadow from the roof great misty mats of cobwebs drooping swayed in the draught like grotesque banners hung appropriately to the lyinginstate of the dusty thing on the floor thereover a hardgrained female was stooped engaged in covering the dead face with a napkin and leaned upright against a partition her head dropped listlessly upon her arm was the poor living victim of all this tragic gallimaufry betty a start and a shiver went through her but she did not raise her face i saw the glare he whispered behind her into her upturned ear and my heart misgave me and i rode over to your help yes it is too late for him betty but for yourself my dear it is no time to speak of it all now but if there has been villainy here i will spend my fortune at need to procure its punishment betty she only buried her face deeper in her arm he put his hand on her shoulder with a caressing touch then removed it and crossed to the kneeling woman tell me he said stooping and speaking lowhas she any one relation in the village no sir them two was alone in the world friendsacquaintances any single soul who would show her kindness in this great affliction the woman scrambled to her feet betty was none disliked she said but lord ha mercy sir is it righteous to talk to the poor in sick a winter as this o the grace o charity will your honour look at the gal and tell me if them busts and shoulders was like to ha been nourished on pitaty parings she is ruined the woman stared saving your honour i wont believe it the gal is no road for the men but as good a wench as ever served a pot ruined i mean in the sense of fortune she hath lost her all in this burning ah i misdoubt shes worth no more than the clothes she stands in if i give you money will you honestly do the last duties by the dead here aye that will i so that if i procure the maid an asylum she may feel happy that her grandfather will be laid decently to earth aye aye she held out an eager hand let those who have starved in a bitter winter call it a covetous one she fingered each of the gold pieces as if it were a fairy flower of her imagination tuke returned softly to the girl who had never changed her position he put his arm gently about her waist bettyi tell you to come with me no no her voice shivered up all drowned and bewildered you must come dear this is no longer a place for you i will arrange all matters necessary aboutabout him there and i will take you into my service she only lowered her head deeper and gave out a miserable sigh you are forlorn and alone in the world betty you would have to exchange your independence for a wretched drudgery at that she looked up at last and put her hair from her wild eyes and wet cheeks i should be honest she whispered they could not be cruel to blame me even if i starved why should i help you to a lie and myself to misery to a lie betty she flashed round on him quite suddenly what is the sort of service you offer me she cried he did not answer irresistibly impassioned he seized her fiercely in his arms the woman had gone out and for the moment they were alone betty you shall come i will try to be fair with you if you have fought against this so have i hush hush she cried pitifully oh think of him there he offered you to me for a price i curse myself for telling you this now but i must have you by fair means or foul she fell against him weeping heavily while he held her oh for shame she gasped that i should be put up to be bid for in my innocence what brutes are men i wont gainsay you but betty am i to live on in my warm house and know her cold and hungry that all my soul longs to dontoh dont talk to me like that give me your lips wench come i will have them by this and this betty through every fibre of your sweetness i love and claim you oh what am i to do as i bid you girl he had out his handkerchief and wiped her eyes and he smoothed her roughened hair and kissed her again into servility then he led her unresisting towards the door and there was jim mounting guard jim he saidmissy pollack is coming home with me go and find my man and bid him lead the horses thitherwards to some place where we can mount in quiet the fellow sped away and tuke leaving the girl by the barndoor walked across to the doctor who was withdrawn with his friends to a little distance dr harmsworth the pleasure of a word with you sir the other detached himself from the group and joined him this unfortunate young woman is known to me i take her into my service with her consent and approval and make myself responsible for her safe custody you will greatly oblige me by undertaking the business of the proper interment of these poor remains and you will apply to me for all professional and sundry charges i am mr tuke of delsrop where i am to be seen and held to account for claims both moral and practical the doctor gave a stiff bow i am acquainted with you by report sir and will be happy to honour your instructions as for the wench she is of an age to negotiate her own business and i trust to exhibit prudence in the conduct of it he looked hard at the other who saluted very rigidly in response you can do her only justice i am sure said he and bowed once more and turned on his heel he found the girl prostrate on her knees beside the dead bodysobbingappealing to itmurmuring broken words of penitence and love she had moved the napkin from the face and tuke saw the cunning still engraved finely about the sightless eyes and the little close leer of covetousness at the corners of the mouth which showed a grotesque clownish distortion of shape in the sooty border that suffocation had painted round it knowing what he did he could not bear to see her thus wasting her heart of affection on the dead unworthy thing he stooped and put his arm about her and drew the cloth once more over the face come he said and helping her to her feet pulled off his own greatcoat and wrapped it about her shoulders at that no no she whispered you will perish of the cold i am going to take you pillion betty and you must clasp your warm hands over my heart and keep it beating for you that is your charge he hurriedly withdrew her and urged her up the road a little distance off they came upon the two men with the horses tuke sprang to his saddle gave the girl a hand and pulled her to a seat behind him god bless your honour cried poor jim what of you my good fellow what but the union master get up behind my servant you shall serve your mistress yet betty gasped did you kiss my shoulder betty no answer with a light laugh tuke touched up his horse and the deadly cold of the night met them fullface as they sped homewards chapter xxxix by all the chill miles homewards whatever and what varying emotions prevailed in the breasts of the little party found no expression in words indeed there could be no passion of feeling in that bitter night so hot as to resist the numbing influence of a frost that seemed to glaze the roof of ones mouth if opened to speak with ice tuke felt little but the instinct to prick his snorting beast onwards with bloodless heels yet through all he was conscious of a spark that glowed and wavered in him like a pulsea little fierce flame of triumph and of ecstasya suffusion of audacity or repudiation of the formal conduct to which he had vainly struggled to subscribe he had no deliberate plan of evil in his soul neither had he the courage or the inclination to face the situation of his own contriving he had snapped under a strain so it seemed to him and that was all for the moment it was exquisite pleasure to feel all his moral fibres relaxed as he drove intoxicated before the force he had for a time withstood your fingers are a loveknot about my heart betty he once said over his shoulder it should be a toasting fire for their comfort he gently unslackened the clasp of the brown hands and bent and put one to his lips they are cold as snow sweetling said he the little bones of them are stiff as flowerstalks and they are as pretty betty and by and by the buds shall break on them if you please would you like these poor cold little stalks to blossom into pearls and rubies she tried to pull her hand away but he would not let her no she said in a weeping voice oh how can you put me to the shame is it shame that must be a stale superstition it were shame in my eyes to pluck my flower and leave it to wither shame to the flower that must be a bold flaunting weed to invite such notice betty that is sorry logic what weed ever won mans heart i had best slip off and go back to my dead down with you girl and we will lie and die in the snow together oh me what can i say will your honour not ride on and forget i am here to be sure bettyas i forget myself you had best not remind me of it by addressing me so i am your honours servant lipservice wench no it will not do before others as you like but alone with methere dont cry the frost will catch your tears and your lashes will be hung with diamonds no gift of mine we must think this all out betty by a glowing fire it is too cold here that little touch on my heart is the only feeling i am conscious of and you gave me your coat oh take ittake it that i shall not i am warmindeed i am lie in your burrow little rabbit and hide your eyes from the dogs we go up to mr breedss tavern here and i dont know what may be abroad he had decided to risk the main road for their return the augmentation of his party the necessity of direct progress in that killing cold were his sufficient reasons they rode past the house and awakened nothing but echoes from its stony walls on the blind of the lighted tap fell the shadows from within of a group of men no notice however was taken of the little cavalcade as it went silently by outside in the snow betty can you spell oh yes spell this then lover what you cant i must put you to school see love and r for the little thumb that points at me that is your lesson and now heres a prize for the quick scholar in the palm of her hand close it and keep it you wont then you shall return it to me in the dark by and by he hardly knew what nonsense he talked a core of fire flickered in the numbness of his brain he gave a whoop like an excited boy presently as a herd of fallow deersome twenty or thirty of thembroke from a covert and went beating down the road in front of them these must be some of friend davids he cried the poor beasts were smitten with the frostfrightthe desolation of despair that induces the last appeal of the lower to the higher animal if he who by his cunning can stultify all our traditional methods of selfprotection they must argue be as full of resource as of foresight and as full of noble clemency withal it were well to submit ourselves to his mercy and so in strange times mans littleness is forced upon himself because all his vaunted superiority cannot make food in a wilderness or flesh on starved bones and he cries aloud and his voice returns to him as an empty echo then i must kill he says that there may be fewer mouths to feed and he kills and fancies that he has mastered the problem of life the deer cantered before the horsemen grunting and shaking their heads they had no action of escape but seemed rather to have deliberately entrusted themselves for safe passage to a greener land of hope to this human convoy they went down a dusky bob of backs into the hollow where was the entrance to delsrop and here led by some attraction of the mightier race they turned into the drivefor the gate had been left openand trotted along it as far as the lawn against the sheltering shrubberies of which they took refuge and upon the morrow the most of them were discovered patiently waiting and snuffling about the stabledoors and an empty coachhouse was thrown open and scattered with hay for their benefit and there for a time at least the trusting creatures found the help and protection they sought reaching the door of his house at last tuke swung a leg over his beasts withers and leaping to the ground pulled betty into his arms and landed her by his side the other two close upon him had dismounted at the same moment he called dennis to himthe formal and authoritative master you will speak to your sister and see that this young woman whom i am taking into my service is fitly lodged and provided for tomorrow i shall assign her her duties in the meantime she is to meet with every sympathy and consideration the man also you must accommodate with suitable quarters you know my interest in the girl and the circumstances of her misfortune i leave her proper reception to your charge not another word he said but when they had been admitted by an amazed wench he nodded gravely to the little group and turned into his own dininghall here as if his opening of the door had released a spring luvaine came at him like a jackoftheclockhouse this is well he cried in a high manner of sarcasmthis is well and hospitable to quit affairs of state for the entertainment of a poor guest or so the wine was still on the table and it was evident the soldier had had free recourse to it for the smothering of his intolerable suspense his thin hair was rumpled his eyes bloodshot a slumberous demon of fury seemed to struggle in him for wakefulness flung into an elbowchair by the hearth sir david discordantly acknowledged the potency of his own cups no doubt he had drunk himself to sleep to escape the others company you have some title to offence sir said the returned host you have been acquainted with the cause of my absence i believe but i think no words of mine will persuade you to exonerate me from blame still i make you my apologies for what was virtually inevitable well sir well and you are prepared i presume to take up the thread where you dropped it oh i cry you mercy captain luvaine what would you have sir the night is far advanced i have had an exhausting experience of travel on my honour i must recuperate for the next move mr tuke do you mean to tell me with all deliberateness that you purpose resting upon my sicknessupon my agony of suspense sir counting the question of my reason as nothing compared with your little bodily discomfort if you will put it crudely sir why so must i i refuse to act further until i have rested and you will do well to school your reason into a little consideration for others you must take note that this is a matter affecting my very last interests as the necessity for sleep affects mine restored i shall be of infinitely more service to you in that respect than i could possibly be now the soldier bowed so much of the discipline of his profession remained to him but it seemed almost a murderous demon that dictated the courtesy he walked towards the door and turned glowering i must not gainsay you he said butbutmay god never curse you with the torment to which you are wantonly condemning me he could not altogether so control his feelings as to refrain from slamming the door to behind him as he went out the clap shook the hall and brought sir david to his feet with a stare and a cry hallo he exclaimed his headpiece fuddled out of all comprehension wherewhere ha you been you inhospitalable scamp never mind i apologize but you wouldnt understand understadunderstad you conceited peddler lookee ere tuke les go and hunt for that skull aint you readyaint you you oh go to bed blythewood well hunt on the morrow ive arranged it all well get some sleep first man for im just dropping droppin youre drunk as davids sow you clever man there go away youre a sight to make the angels weep ill have you before me tomorrer on a warrat by the lord i will he stopped and struck his brow rather aimlessly angel and dunlone he cried i forgot all about the highstepper heres a pretty host for you i shall have to commit myself before you cock the scarecrowll drizzle the jade into an asylum tuke dye hear if i stop and join in this chase i must sed the girl a note well tomorrow will do for that curse me what a wiggin ill get from her you must help me out of this scrape let me bid em both to lunch at your place to hear the result of our expedition thatll be a sop to the creature the other hesitated he still laboured under the excitement of his recent undertakingstill tingled with the afterglow of the late riot in his heart he had formulated had conceived indeed no line of conduct for himself or betty that should meet the occasion he would not have her a serving drudge in his house and beyond that one resolve all was indefinite but he had burnt his boats behind him and to temporize with circumstance was no longer possible as he had made his dash for freedom so must he continue the race recklessly by all means he said with a rather wild laugh we will dissolve the ruby in a glass of wine and miss royston shall drink to the health of the drizzler in it chapter xl the wind was so bitter the roads so glassy with peril and so scourged with swept drifts of snow that when at last on the following morning the little party of three gentlemen with dennis for guide assembled in the hall of delsrop preparatory to issuing on their quest it was resolved to make no attempt to cover any part of the distance on horseback but to trust to their legs and their endurance for the entire course what this was each of the three had but an indefinite idea for the servant showed a strange reluctance to discuss the subject even with his master and would only place their goal approximately at some seven or eight miles seeing the pain it gave him to be pressed for closer particulars tuke goodhumouredly insisted that there should be no further flogging of their willing horse and presently there was not a man of them all but was so engrossed in his own discomfort as to be oblivious of any consideration but that his numbed extremities called for blythewood who had relieved his mind of responsibility by early dispatching his note to his sister was then free to give the most of his concern to his little aching tipplebefumed topknot tuke whose soul was hot with vexing selfproblems worried to get this distracting and depressing business of the stone done with luvaine stalked a very nightmare embodiment of grievance altogether it was something a dismal party that followed in the wake of the dismal servingmanits members mere moving pillars of duffel and muffler hands in pockets rigid as pantomime chimneypots with their heads bent to the blast like cowls the wind was dreadful it came screaming down the road like flights of arrows it swept the long wastes as if the very scythe of death were threshing there for some least little blade of life it seemed of a sharpness to blaze the treetrunks and cut the copses into shreds not a living thing but themselves appeared to be on foot or wing in all the dreary landscape only a grey sky frothed with snowflakes and the inexorable endless downs received and encompassed them and wrought upon their souls with horror of the soulless early in the tramp dennis had led from the stockbridge highway eastwards over the slopes what whined sir david you give it us full in the face mr whimple we shall be torn like bunting there is no other way sir said the man cant we get between hedges at least no sir no road leads to where she inhabits luvaine turned with a stare and blythewood shrugged his shoulders this is captain phipps and the north pole he said i protest luvaine twill be nothing to my mind to exchange your cursed stone for halfadozen of my toes the soldier the wind whizzing in his set teeth muttered a word or two about the selfishness of uninterested parties and that at last started the little baronet laughingthe first note of gaiety the expedition had produced oh he chirped what a noble sacrifice you would make of your friendsand he kicked up his little hoofs and scampered like a colt tuke who was tailing in the rear called to dennis and fell somewhat behind with him is this necessary he said indeed yes sir she lives remote on these wild downs for nigh a year sir now with none to neighbour or assist her none deep in these wastes she bides secret and alone and not a soul within miles did she need succour it is her whimher craze sir if you will she hath led a strange solitary lifefor years apart from her fellowsfor years hating the world so that she would deign to draw but the meagrest sustenance from it meagre indeed in these solitudes she must browse like the sheep she traps the birds and little game of the open those are for feast days in general she can make much of a few dried berries together with what you give her the man hung his head in silence are you the only one that knows of her eyrie the only one master she hath suffered some great wrong a great great wrong tuke looked keenly at his servant i am neither curious nor insolent he said but if it would ever relieve your mind to acquaint me of the truth i am your friend to counsel and help dennis whimple flushed round the tears sprung to his eyes oh he cried do you think i dont know it do you think i havent suffered to tell you all you would have learnt long ago but that the confidence is not mine to give while she lives well well said his master go to the front again my good fellow and lead the wind whipped the slopes planing the fallen snow from them in ringlets like woodshavings now and again a lashed clump of trees would seem to swerve at them through the blinding flakes or the thud of tumbling chalk sprung by the frost in some neighbouring quarry would sound startlingly in their ears these were the only scattered phrases on an else blank page and the desolation made them expressive as words of comfort by and by tuke moved forward to his companions the snow thickens he cried i shall be easier when our faces are turned westwards he shouted to dennis you are not wandering afield you are sure of your way and quite the man answered we are nigh upon the place now sir it seemed full time if any prospect remained to them of getting back to lunch and to the invited guests blythewood groaned at the very thought of being late i have sinned enough already said he angel will be ready to bite me they had fought and struggled by long miles of swale and hillock and were become mere remote atoms in the midst of a blinding wilderness when they broke upon a little gaunt oasisa dismal copse of good intentstretching withered arms of welcome to them from out the whirl this forlorn touch of nature was set at the foot of a shallow mound or tumulus that now caked with white looked like a huge inverted puddingbasin and amongst the spare trunks dennis stopped and turned a grey face to his gentlemen this is the place he said the place echoed blythewood looking about him bewildered hurry whimple cried his master there was a great tang of blackthorn and bramblea little lonely thicket of itheaped against the lower slope of the mound from this thicket all tossed with snow two or three crippled beechsaplings escaped throwing wild arms aloft as if their lower limbs were pinned in the jaws of some hidden monster in the brushwood thither the man made his way and the others followed they are but suckers he said of an old giant trunk the decayed butt of which lies there in the bush it may have fallen and been removed a hundred years ago but while it was alive its great roots were busy undermining this hillock and boring a passage into the heart of it he turned to his master for all i know sir she was the first to discover the way and the first to penetrate to the chamber within the chamber aye gentlemen this is an ancient barrow of the dead and the goal of our hopes luvaine pushed rudely past him the inner character of the man seemed to reveal itself in the neighbourhood of success our hopes he drawled insolently here of course is the tentative placeseeker on the very threshold of my inheritance now muttered tuke to himself this cur snarls over his bone before the sheep is killed the way in manthe way in cried luvaine beating his hands together why do you keep me outside you can play cicerone to your damned barrow when the stone is in my pocket tuke caught his servants eye entreating and came peremptorily to the front of course he said to himyou must enter first and prepare the woman for our coming whatever her status she has the right of priority here a rat in a drain cried the soldier jeeringly i dont stand on ceremony with such pardon me sir you owe this consideration to my servant without whose selfsacrificing assistance you were like to go jewelless for all time he made a sign to dennis the man turned and went round about to where close by a scarce noticeable passage had been forced through the bramble the thicket received and swallowed him to the shoulders a dozen yards in he faced about waved to his master stooped and vanished luvaine stamping in a fury of restlessness would not yet venture upon pursuit but as he padded it to and fro he cast quick hateful glances at the man who had baulked him perhaps for a minute they awaited the desired summons hammering their feet on the frozen turf hugging themselves with their pocketed hands for a little warmth it seemed impossible that that smooth white desolation could contain any sunken chamber of refuge quite suddenly a cry came to their earsan attenuated scream forced from the bowels of the earth to men in their impatient and overstrung condition it wavered up weird and deathly with one impulse they dashed for the path into the thicket stumbling and pushing and striving for the lead it fell to tuke reaching the spot where he calculated his man had disappeared he flung about like a nosing hound saw where a loose path of undergrowth was swung before a jagged fissure in the tangle elbowed it aside and slipped into a narrow broken tunnel that seemed to undermine the hill a moment he paused the smell of lifeless earth was about hima dull sense of pressure seemed to set his eardrums tattooing then his pupils relieved of the sheeted glare without dilated and he saw the profound gloom of the passage to be broken into by a little glimmer of light at its far end hearing his companions behind him he crept on so low was the boring that in some places he had to stoop almost double to pass but he went forward steadily and all at once regained a thought of space and stopped in amazement and concern he was in a little circular chamber whose walls and floor were built of blocks of unhewn and uncemented stone other blocks roughly squared and shaped stood on the level here and there and against one of these was piled a heterogeneous heap of human bones mixed with fragments of stone implements and arrowheads and some beads of dull amber over all a flaring dipwedged into a cleftstick stuck in a crevice of the wallcast a wavering glow it made manifest the simple austerity of this antique chamber of the dead and it did moreit revealed dennis on his knees beside a pallet of dried turves whereon something long and gaunt and quiet was extended whimple exclaimed his master softly he felt luvaines breath at his ear and extended his arms that the other might not pass the servant turned his head a lost wild expression was in his eyes dead he muttered in a dreadful voice tuke went forward and looked down she had noble sepulture this tameless wanderer what a fiercely handsome face it wasstone in the midst of stone but all the age of sixty years of loneliness was gathered in it now the informing will was withdrawn in her long discipline of hatred she had yielded so little to her fellows that not even the right of her burial should be theirs in her own earth after all the long vain baying of the human pack she had lain herself down to die of the froststroke and here she was as much a part of the ancient cairn as the elfarrows that were strewn about her dennis said his master againand the man looked up in his face and said simply she was my mother tuke put his hand gently on his shoulder i have thought as much you would not have her removed no no let her lie at peace i think you are right such a tomb as this is for the hunted a discordant cry echoed through the chamber the skull my god let me passand luvaine dashing aside the restraining arm bounded to the furthermost of the stone blocks and snatched something into his hands he had no respect no sympathy no decency even in the covetous lust of his soul perhaps if he had had the fates had vouchsafed a kindlier turn to his fortunes tuke and blythewood would not echo his jubilancewould hardly give him their notice indeed to them a solemner tragedy appealeda mystery far profounder than that of humanitys morbid attraction to coloured pebbles it was only when a second horrible cry broke from him that they looked round startled he was standing with the skull held out before him in one hand his face was ghastly and contorted his eyes in the marionette play of light and shadow were dancing devils of fury it is gone he shriekedthe stone is gone tukes very gorge rose the nerves of his jaw seemed to click rigid dennis he said with a sternness that was only for that otherforbear your grief a little my good fellow for the sake of common decency let us resolve this matter now and at once he crossed to luvaine well sir he saidyou say the stone is gone for answer the other held him out the skull he was so lost in the terror of loss that he would have scarcely resented a blow tuke took the ugly relic in his hand and offered it to his mans inspection is this he said the same you gave to your mother can you identify it it is the same there is the bulged eyelid and the chalkmarks yet about it the stone may have dropped out we can show you no better consideration dennis than to begin and end the search here and now luvaine was on his knees already diving into and scattering the little heap of bones and implements he found nothing there nor could any of them after the most exhaustive search discover a trace of the missing gem the candle on the wall guttered and flared down while they were at work and dennis replaced it with another from a little bundle he had brought with him he had made it one of his duties it seemed to supply these to the lonely woman suddenly luvaine rose to his feet with an evil expression of face this is trouble thrown away he said there is one and one only likely place to overhaul dennis cried no no with an agonized look whimple said his master gentlythese are great stakes at issue and to curtail the search would be to place me at least in a very false position let it be done with all reverence by your hands the servant knelt beside the body with a stifled groan as he did so a common impulse led tuke and his friend to hastily block the soldiers path the maniac did not interfere but he glanced over their shoulders gnawing his knuckles and jerking his every limb in a fury of impatience there is nothing on this poor body said dennis after a pause looking up almost as little without as within poor soul nothing in or about the pallet i have made a complete search sir there is not a trace of the stone luvaine broke out with a shriek he has but looked like a sluggard wench there are fifty places yet let me at herlet me at her i say you shall not by god said tuke the wretched creature wrung his hands you would dash the cup from my very lips he yelled you would drive me mad among ye i will not be denied he struggled to pass them they drove him back and took their stand by the prostrate body the search here has been thorough said tuke i watched and i marked anywhere else in the chamber you like sir but these poor remains rest sacred from further abuse he felt whimples lips upon his hand as he spoke hunt sir hunt while we wait a little longer yet i fear the stone may have dropped anywhere on her passage hither and may lie now sunk for ever in the grass of the downs hurry man if you would look further and would not have us snowed up to perish beside her that lies here the rabid creature chattering and foaming went off on twenty different scents while they waited every stone and crevice of the little room he examinedthe broken tunnel explored candle in handeven reissued into the thicket and beat wildly about with hand and foot at length it became evident even to him that his search must prove vain he desisted with a deadwhite face set to his companions and come he said in a hollow voice and conduct me back to the hell i had a little escaped from could it be possible that a passion so uncleanly could rise to the least nobility of despair for a moment tukes heart swerved in a rush of pity for anything so forlorn we may find it yet he said when it is safe to return we will look here again no said the other it is lost to me for ever i know now and feel it he went out first with a dull and dogged step dennis lingered to whisper a last word of love to the stark thing on the pallet suddenly he stooped lifted the skull from the stone whereon his master had replaced it and laid it softly down at the feet of the dead woman perhaps he kneels there now and is forgiven he murmured then he blew out the candle and followed the others into the open air as he came forth of the thicket a charge of laden wind near took him off his feet staggering and halfblinded it was some moments before he could collect his sight and his senses then he saw his companions huddled about the trunk of a little beech tree and ran to them foretasting the peril one and all they were now menaced by a loss more final than that of any stone however costly while they were within the wind had called up its reserves and the undulating plain was all one sheeted spectre of driving white we must make the attempt said tuke to stay here is to perish he took blythewoods arm and drove into the whirl as he spoke the other two followed apart the snow was up to their ankles it hurtled into their faces and stung their blinking eyelids every minute they felt the labour of progress more acute my god cried sir davidseven miles of this oh courage man there is no hope but to keep going for long they marked their bearings pretty well then looking over his shoulder tuke uttered an exclamation and stopped dennis he yelled for the man had disappeared he ran back in their fastvanishing tracksstumbled over the fallen body up he shriekeddont give in like this the poor fellow begged to be allowed to sleepjust forty winks he said forty winking devils shouted his master he had him up and on in a momentplaced him between himself and sir david thenceforward the three held together swaying and struggling the wiry soldier could take and keep his own measure of endurance but now confused by the temporary delay they fell doubtful in their landmarks wavered and woke to the knowledge that they were lost dennis who alone of them knew something of the road was fallen into a state of semistupefaction and could scarce speak coherently indeed it was all one for that for the prospect was quite blotted out in the mist of twinkling flakes and to keep the wind at their backs was become their only guide it was a long agonized advance against the forces of death they dared not stop for an instant to breathe or think they must plod their frantic way whose every step was a lifted labour and hardly could they cheer on any fainting spirit amongst them who threatened to lag to his destruction the snow deepened and often now they floundered into drifts and must struggle forth and on with their hearts sobbing in their breasts at length when dusk was a little threatening to foreclose they came down upon trees and a mass of choked underwood this like desperate men blind and unreasoning they fought throughcrossed a downward slope of whiteplunged into a second great tangle of growth tore their way through it and brought up sharp before a little low door that seemed to pierce the base of an inverted bowl of snow set in a small clearing it was no time to wonder or inquire tuke kicked at the woodwork and it reeled open on screaming hinges they saw an aperture leading to some darkness of refugestooped and one by one scrambled in and sank exhausted upon the rubbish that lay beneath chapter xli perhaps a halfhour elapsed before any one of the exhausted men was able to do more than sigh and shift his aching limbs on the bed of rubbish where he lay they had taken the precaution to pull the door to behind them and though they were thereby condemned to a profound darkness the close sunken quarters warmed with the natural heat of their bodies wrought a life in them by degrees and a gradual curiosity as to the character of their refuge luvaine was the first to drag himself upright standing with his shoulders on a level with the doorsill he cautiously made a little opening and looked forth long and critically then he reclosed the aperture and sat himself down again david he said from that time he as far as possible ignored his host are you recovered convalescent sirhe was heard to sit up in the darkness im at the brandy and beeftea stage thats a pity for neither will you taste again this side the grave oh luvaine what do you mean man where are we that i cant tell youunless its a toolhouse sunk in some spinney but for our prospectslook for yourself david is it so bad as that said tuke sitting up in his turn look for yourself david repeated the soldier and tell me if you see one hope of escape both hearers scrambled to their feet and one of them flung open the door the mouth of their refuge looked westwards so that by good fortune it was little encumbered of the driving snow but that had drifted and piled itself over the easterly slope of the mound in such a manner as to throw an irregular outwork varying from one yard to many in depth all about them and upon this fresh deposits from the bewildered sky were ceaselessly accumulating it had fallen deep dusk through all the high thicket that encompassed their clearing but it was yet light enough to see how the white stormdisciplining its fury as the wind dropped with nightwas settled to a direct purpose of crushing under the whole resistance of life now the flakes fell in dense sluggish lines upon the open ground as if the vast weight already cast down were drawing out the very entrails of the heavens blythewood levered himself up and sprang outside the fall made of him in a moment a man of snow what are we to do he shouted good lord think of the house and of them two fuming for us to return shant we make a dash through the wood and try at least to get our bearins tuke had heard a sound and had bent over dennis he came to the opening the poor fellow is halfdelirious i think said he and in no state to go on make the effort you and ill stay here with him david said luvaine im for you give me a hand no said the baronetnot for all the little devils of angels in the world he jumped down again well stick together he cried what ails the man he was lying on his heap flushed and with his eyes closed now and again his lips would mutter meaningless fragments of speech this is a girl in breeches said luvaine we should have set him on a jackass it wouldnt have been courteous to throw all the burden on you sir said tuke politely blythewood burst out laughing david said the soldier in a high voice there have been those who have learnt before now the danger of riding me roughshod and a fresh explosion greeted him and he stopped frowning heavily captain luvaine said tuke looking round i would remind you that this man knowing himself of a poor constitution has cheerfully submitted it to considerable hardship for your benefit well sir i make no denial of his cheerfulness or of his sense of duty to his superiors and that for some time now a large burden of responsibility wholly unconnected with any interest of mine has lain upon my shoulders you refer to the stone surely sir you dont hold me to blame for it or in a matter of such importance to me grudge the sacrifice of a little personal comfort i leave you to judge of thatas of the propriety of some little courteous acknowledgment you have it in full said the soldier sullenly if i fail to express it you must understand me to be a man of few words blythewood had his tongue in his cheek were all babes in the wood he cried with a fair chance of sufferin their fate lets get under the leaves and tell stories and not risk goin to heaven squabblin hasnt a man of us a flask about him they were not vouchsafed even that comfort the long night drew upon them huddled down there in their burrow the cold was at first piercing and they soon fell silent each as wrapped in dismal reflection as inadequately in his greatcoat they could not sleep but only shiver and suffer and the servant moaned and whispered intermittently through the endless hours his master did what he could for him in the pitchy darkness building him a pillow of dead leaves and drawing the skirts of his own surtout about the icy feet towards dawn however a little comfort of warmth triumphed in the cabined hole this was because the snow had then completely enwrapped their place of refuge one by one weak and exhausted they dropped into a shallow abyss of sleep tuke was the first to come to himself again he started up with a jerk and felt the rat of hunger gnawing at his ribs now he thoughtwhen he could at last recall his senseswhither does this tend we have not eaten or drunk for nigh twentyfour hours if i may judge and a definite movement of some sort becomes necessary surely four strong men should be able to master any situation then he thought of whimple and bent his head to listen the man was breathing regularly and profoundly looking up again with an exclamation of pleasure he was aware of a little weak finger of light pointing into the gloom day had broken he got to his cramped feet jubilant in a moment and feeling for the door above essayed to open it something resisted he put all his nerve into a mighty push felt the hinges yieldthen the obstruction and in an instant a great buttress of snow fell away from the outside and light leaped into the pit light gorgeous and bountiful the snow had ceased a hard wintry sun revealed a little surrounding world of heaped and drifted desolation wherein the very trees seemed but accidents of the storm or frostflowers enamelled upon the wide windows of the mist the noise of his onset and the gush of radiant air awakened two other of the sleepers out he cried softly for fear of disturbing dennisup and out and reconnoitre he scrambled himself to the open and was joined by his companions where in the name of mystery are we he murmured in the heart of a little wood apparentlyin a clearing ringed about with trees and so choked in the course of those fifteen or so pregnant hours with the white fall as to seem to offer an insurmountable barrier to their escape towards the middle of the circle the snow lay shallowest but all around against the treetrunks it sloped upwards to a considerable height suggesting a bowl of whipped cream that had stiffened to the shape of the vessel it lay in gentlemen said tuke it behoves us to make the struggle the sky is resolute steel to remain here is to perish what do you say blythewood gave out a rather tortured little laugh he as they all did wore an unshorn and haggard look but his lips were set grimly im with the fox that bit off his foot rather than remain in the trap he said and i now will you two try to push into and through the trees somewhere that we may at least get our bearings i will remain with whimple while you are gone and will make the attempt on my own account if you return unsuccessful it will be as well to keep a reserve of strength oh certainly said luvaine and if we are fortunate sir you can set your care for a fellowcreature against our trouble and endurance sir david pulled the speaker hastily away au revoir he cried over his shoulder i hope we shall bring you tidings tuke watched them wade their first comparatively easy paces then he dived into the cabin once more dennis he cried the man was sitting up an expression of the most profound astonishment on his face but all token of fever vanished my good fellowyou are in your senses again am i sir then they are queerly lodged wait he passed his hand over his forehead in a bewildered manner i remember he muttered the walk and my dead mother and then we fought our way back dennis lost and beaten we stumbled upon this unspeakable refuge and here we have lain all night thisthis whimples eyes were wandering over roof and floor of the little chamber surely sir you know where we are not i indeed in your own grounds sirthe old icehouse in the thicket tuke stared a moment then with a shout scrambled up through the opening and gave out a yell of recall there was no response his two companions to whatever fortune were vanished and out of earshot convinced of this he turned and slipped again into his burrow you are sure dennis quite sure sir and we have fancied ourselves buried in some isolated spinney and looked to nothing but a lingering death where none could come nigh us through the drifts is it so bad as that we may find it hard to win to the house even yet then tush you faint rogue my heart sings like a cricket sir david and captain luvaine are gone to explore we will have the laugh of them when they return are they away sir something of the familiar look of nervousness and hesitation came to his face what is it whimple the man burst out all at once let me take the opportunity now and for ever to ease my heart of the last of its burdento tell my dear master all that i have so long withheld from him you wish to i have always wished to but while she livedsir she was my mother and it were bitter that a son should record his mothers shame he turned away his head so that his face fell into shadow the wrong she suffered was at the hands of my father that was murdered and strung up on the downs yes yes said tuke that is not all unexpected it was a fearful wrong sir committed on a helpless girl for she had flouted and dared him and i it was that was born to be the shameful witness of my fathers violence and the victim now of my mothers hate and loathing now of her furious caresses she carried me with her into the hiding her profession secured her for she was a bold horsewoman and popular in travelling shows but when i was turned nine she left me under care in a seaport town and thereafter i saw her but at long intervals and then to mark little but the hardening of her nature and the steady elimination from it of all kindly and social sentiments still i was to learn from her own lips what i think a man can never find it in his sympathy to interpretthe inconsistency of a womans soul no doubt that is like the figure called a parallax oh dennisconfound your parallax to my mind it is more like a parachutean empty thing that any draught shall influence you dont mean that sir dont iwell talk in english you rascal your learning hips a simple country squire it is no learning indeed but a little love for books she told me of my origin sir judge of what the revelation was to me who was ignorant as yet of any word of the wicked story she told me all and she told mesir she said to me in a burst of wild defiance that she was about to place herself under the protection of the very man who years before had wrought her that great evil am i surprised dennis i think not i have gone to school in the world woman is the archetype of rebellion she it was pulled down the angels she must revolt against any restriction not imposed by herself and she has always a fiercer joy in defying the social laws than she has pleasure in subscribing to them she knows the world was her original birthright i suppose and has a secret admiration for the sort of crime that lost her her heritage cutwater scorned the conventions that ostracized her and he had blackened his soul for her sake queer reasoning maybe from our point of view butyes i can understand her returning to him she did sir and for years i saw her no more she returned to him and as i afterwards learned soon wearied my father of her presence and left him taking with her the babydaughter that she had borne to him you know the resthow but a little before his death my father remembering the fact of my existence summoned me to him and sought to practise on my simplicity it was what i had dreaded ever since i had been acquainted of the cruel truth it finished what my long anguish of suspense had begun constitutionally without fibre i became the nerveless haunted creature of your first knowledge and it was after his death that your mother brought the girl to burden you with its charge no burden sir i joyed to have the little thing but she was uncanny from near the first she showed herself instinctively attracted to the dreadful thing on the downs and when the head fell and she could secure it she came home with a posy face of delight it was chance hearing of the story of his murder that brought my mother to me with the child and at first she would give a little to its keep but as the years went on and she herself become poorer and wilder it was she also that must become in a measure my charge though she would never set foot in his house or take from me aught but the barest of necessaries well dennisand this was the story you confided to mr creel the story sir as you know it all nowand god bless you and him and do you think the poor woman there had knowledge of the treasure she bore away in the skull i cannot think so he was not the man to put his confidence in any of her sex and you must remember sir that he had always carried a makebelieve in his eyesocket that was a mark of the familiar terror of his glance and that twas his cunning only substituted the stone for the glass that the thing dropped out anywhere on its passage to and from is the most likely solution no doubt and we cant hunt over seven square miles or so of grassy down as we huntedthat reminds me you never heard of our discovery in the wardrobe when a joyous whoop sounded in their ears and as tuke got to his feet the aperture was darkened by the figures of the returned explorers now said sir david looking down into the pit with his arms akimboaint we heroes and where would you guess weve been to the trouble to pitch our camp not in mine own grounds said tuke no no who the deuce has been tellin you praps you think that spells the end of our difficulties are you julius csar siror whoever the cove was that went over mount blank i tell you theres a range of drifts between this and the house as big as snowdon then now comes my turn stay you here and leave the rest to me as he spoke distant but sharp through the frosty air came the report of a gun chapter xlii tuke scrambled up and out into the open sport in this weather he muttered staring at his friend sounds queer dont it and yet what else can it be the other did not answer but his eyes retained a sort of startled musing well he said at last i must try my fortunes we had best all go together no indeed my friend think of the tax it would be upon captain luvaines critical perceptives you are so very witty said the soldier dryly you put the words in my mouth i have had to swallow some of yours sir tis just an exchange of courtesies oh cried blythewoodthe deuce of this sparring i refuse to hold the stakes any longer who asked you to you rogue youre getting conceited where are you going to i have a plan to push out by the tumbled lodge if i can win there and see if the drive is passable it should be wellwhy shouldnt we all go if you move so do i not then see if you can find the way by yourself no nostay where you are in halfanhour i will be back as full of information as a verger he waved his hand and ran off as he could across the snow he was stiff and numb with cold his lips were cracked with ithis fingers felt and looked like ingots of blue steel there was such a piercing rigour in the air as converted his very breath into frost upon his face he thought he remembered the little alley by way of which he had once emerged from the clearing but to reach it it was necessary to struggle through a drift nine or ten feet high he did not hesitate however he went into it as if he were diving under a breaker seeking to bore a hole by the mere force of his onset and in this process he came near to smothering himself at a swoop for the arch of snow formed above him broke down as he kicked his way on and dragging tributary avalanches with it completely overwhelmed and halfsuffocated him now he had to gnaw his way as it were through the thick base of the drift and this he felt he should never have breath or vigour for for the first was already coming in tight gasps and the second was futile to express itself in anything but a series of aimless and spasmodic jerks suddenly it occurred to him that he would stand up he put all the weight of his back into a mighty heavefelt the superincumbent mass break and part and his face like a purple bulb sprouted from the surface and he could breathe again still buried to the neck in the drift he drew in air and cogitated the collapse of his tunnel had sunk a shallow groove of uncompact snow to his front and presently flapping and floundering he was able by slow degrees to force a cutting through the heap and to come out on the other side amongst the trees horribly draggled and exhausted but triumphant here where he now found himself the thick interlacing of the branches overhead had made a roof to the underearth so that the fall had penetrated only occasionally in any considerable quantity and he was able to continue his way without much difficulty but all about him a chill inhuman twilight reigned for the roof itself was a loaded canopy and many of its high girders were already snapped beneath the pressure going cautiously he came all at once into the little track he sought and speeding along it emerged upon light and heaped snow once more and the rear of the tangled garden this now was a mere shapeless confusion of wadded white and the ruin itself the onlooker started where he stood and gave a low whistle what strange company was lodged in this deserted spot that smoke should be rising from two of its broken chimneys the next moment he thoughtcould it be possible that darda was trapped and imprisoned by the fall in her gruesome museum he uttered an exclamation waded from his covert and with some difficulty gained the back entrance to the building here through a chinkfor the door stood ajara fine smell of stewing meat that was mightily grateful to his nostrils was wafted to him he paused an instant in indecision then conscious of a little squirm of fear he rated himself for a coward kicked off the snow that clogged his heels pushed at the panels and entering came to a stop in the passage beyond all was quiet as the gravenothing but the pleasant humming sound of a fire burning in its grate hard by not condescending to so much as step softly he strode down the familiar passage and came to where the doors of the two sittingrooms met him on either hand whos here he cried striving to read the gloom for from whatever cause the place was dark as a well with the words on his lips he was aware of a soundsuppressed laughtera little scuffle not knowing whither to turn he struck out blindly anywhere on the instantrecoiled and in a moment his arms were caught in vicious hands and there came a great noise of feet and voices all about him feeling the utter futility of effort for the time being he submitted to his unseen captors light cried a little thin voice the front door was unbolted and flung open and a weak radiance of sunshine broke into the passage then all around him tuke saw a nightmare of jeering faces one even looked through a great gap in the ceiling above his head and a babble of hoarse laughter rattled the very ribs of the crazy tenement chapter xliii this gentlemen said mr tuke is a quite overpowering welcome he saw surrounding him a very choice variety of villainous facesperhaps a dozen types in all but if his blood ran cold he had a lofty fancy to attribute it to the weather and why am i detained in this forcible manner he said when i come to visit my own lodge a second little griding of laughter was his response here be a mouching toff croaked one of the rascals that held him give us the griffin lutenant quoth another hoarsely stow your cursed babble yawped a voice that the captive recognized and tie his hands behind him he had not been able to suppress a start at the tones though he cursed himself for his weakness but now he looked forward cool and steady as the speaker faced him oh mr brander he saidso you captain this amiable company i see i see why sir said the pedagogue sourly you may have stumbled through the fifth proposition and yet lack penetration i have not the honour to lead in this business will you answer me a question not one are his hands tied you as fast as your tongue sir i can assure you mr corby here whom i recognize by his bashfulness has spliced me as conscientiously as he would bud a rose how is gardening doing joe get along said that person you want bedding out you do why joe im with you i never felt myself in closer quarters another squiggle of laughter greeted the sally you might graft a new pair of ears to this gentleman said tuke hes been lopped it seems for canker and thats a disease peculiar to roses and curs joe branders face went furious you stinking aristocrat he screamed ill pipe a tune for you by and by and you shall dance by god he stamped his foot and waved with his gaunt arms kick him into the parlour he shoutedand let his wits fatten on the frogskins hell want them in good condition presently the prisoner made no resistance and was haled rather than driven through the doorway of the room to his rightthrust and locked in the shutters it seemed were closed and the placeexcept for the little glow diffused by a fire smouldering on the hearthwas in darkness not knowing if a trap of some sort was set for him and being indeed considerably amazed and dumbfounded for all his fine show of sangfroid he would not venture to do more than cross cautiously to the neighbourhood of the chimney corner where he set his back against the wall and awaited events with what philosophy he could muster little sound of voice or movement came to him from without the rogues their ruse accomplished assumed all the secrecy of their profession and to the noise of boisterous mirth succeeded some fitful suggestions of stealthy toing and froing that it was far more difficult to hear with equanimity fortunately his trial of suspense was a short one he had not been in the room many minutes when he became conscious that he was not alone somebody had come in but so softly and with so sidling an action that he was hardly aware of the fact until he heard gentle fingers manipulating the bolts of the shutters the next moment the flaps were pushed quietly open and white daylight broke into the room he was in dardas museumthat he had guessedand advancing towards him was a figure very placid very venerablemr fern whom it seemed a profanation to dub jack the newcomer stooped a little courteous bow as he came forward we are badly accommodated for seats he said in his mild high voice but here is a chairor the remains of one and a little steadiness of posture may make it even comfortable to you pray avail yourself of it the gentleman laughed if you will untie my hands he said i see no difficulty mr tuke you will of course give me your parole not to attempt to escape am i to be a prisoner in my own lodge i greatly fear so sir this quite unexpected development largely facilitates what might have been otherwise a prolonged and tiresome business and we cant afford to let you go i will be frankness itself mr tuke and we really cant afford it sir and i will imitate your candour and ask what the devil you a common thief mean by asking a gentleman for his parole rash blood sirhot rash blood i was older than you before i learnt to pick my words but without that little one of yours i much fear that i shall be unable to relieve you of this temporary inconvenience why zounds mr fern you are here in force it seemsa dozen or more blazing cutthroats to keep the cage honest fellows and well to be trusted sir at the same time you are noted for being a gentleman of daring and resource i must really make you that acknowledgment and far be it from me to risk the least of those scenes of violence that my soul abhors botany bay has made you squeamish it appears have you buried the hatchet with which you killed cutwater mr fern shrugged up his hands deprecatingly it pains me he said gently to hear a repetition of that old slander at this date what you didnt murder the miserable rogue and help to string him up afterwards such an old slander sir and is the age of reason never to be forgiven its youthful peccadilloes oh i cry you mercy mr fern if this was a peccadillo i can understand your abhorring violence harkee mr tuke i dont say i would have withheld my men from their just resentment but that i took no active part in it is the truth what sucking infants to be sure are you and your schoolmaster i shall believe just thisthat cutwater stabbed himself in twenty places and then jumped his neck into the chains butto be candid again mr fernwhat an unperspicacious rascal you must have been to kill your goose with the golden eggs sir there is one crime that to my mind cries to heaven above all others for vengeance and that is treachery on the part of a confederate what was i to hesitate if i was chosen the minister of a divine retribution and now by your leave we will come to business what can there possibly be of that between us a little sira little the question of ransom for instance ransomransom in the matter of a few hundreds of yards of drive what is that to the point one may lie in newgate and only three feet of wall separate him from free pavement very pertinently put and you have all the advantage of knowing but do you seriously propose as a sane man mr fern to place at this end of the eighteenth century a gentlemans private house under siege i am bound to confess i do well you have your plans i presume that you are not likely to acquaint me of indeed sir you are free to know all it is my simple intention to force entrance and deal summarily with any that shall oppose me in my perfectly legitimate search for a placable man mr ferns eyes assumed a rather lurid complexion i may tell you he said a little loudly for him that i have here a disciplined and rather unscrupulous force under my command and that this show of resistance on your part is neither convincing nor judicious indeed your somewhat fatuous selfconfidence in thus venturing beyond your own lines proves you quite illfitted to cope with so pregnant a situation at least you will acknowledge the house is welldefended pooh a mere question of gunpowder you have cutwaters iron shutterswhich you have closed of courseand a quite inadequate company to hold them and of this one already as you know is but now placed hors de combat by a shot from an overeager young member of my band true true murmured tukethe man a man sir undoubtedly and a fool to thus expose himself what could you do with such material mr tuke even had you remained there to captain it oh thank you mr fern you have comforted my heart amazingly that whimple is a sterling soul and his precautions that i have laughed at justify themselves but who thought to put them into practice the other that was so like a quaker in his appearance gasped and stared truly sir he said i fail to comprehend you it is simple my fatuous and over selfconfident friend you have greatly enlightened me i do not come from the house i was benighted yestereve in the snow and this morning seeking to escape from my predicament stumbled haphazard upon your camp you do not come from the house on the contrary from quite another direction and you are alone surely that is a superfluous question for the moment mr fern seemed to blaze up into a rather fearful travesty of himself the contrast between his white hair and brickred face became an exceedingly baneful one in the flashing of the fire however he was his placid self again this he said his precise lips seemed educated like stops to the exact harmonies of speech all redounds to our advantage wherever you come from you have fallen a very opportune hostage ah my friend but it shows others than the master of the house to be on the alert i am not informed of the details of your attack but no doubt you thought to rush the place at your first assault you are absolutely right we failed in that but i may tell you sir that any prolonged resistance there besides necessarily proving futile will greatly incense my men but why necessarily futile pooh mr tuke we have gone over our ground long and carefully again i will be entirely open with you why should i not if ever right justified might it does in this business do you fancy i am ignorant of the nature and capacity of your household true true now i am curious to know mr fern how long you have been gathered here in this force shall we put it at seventeen hours when the snow increased we saw that providence was set to favour the cause of justice and we moved up here by twos and threes and were allthirteen of us sirassembled in the lodge by four oclock of yesterday afternoon so twas the snow decided you sir i will own to you that we had thought originally to make a simpler finish of the matter but your unexpected return from london disturbed our plans however all has worked for the best for here we stand in our relations of besieged and besieging as isolated as though we were vulture and deserted camel in the midst of sahara you see your position mr tuke there is no hope of succour from any quarter we have food and ammunition in abundance and if we choose we can batter your house about the ears of its two or three defenders already my strong fellows have been at work cutting a path up the drive and beyond it and they have accounted for one of your trumpery force if you are wise you will consent to treat if you are humane you will forbear to sacrifice to your vanity the lives of the unthinking few who serve you and you have women there mr tukewomen sir women they have a fashion of thinking death not the worst evil they can suffer the captive his heart blazing saw the soul of this unspeakable ruffian revealed he would have risked all and choked him with his hands had these been free as it was he sought to play a sounder part by hiding his repulsion now sir said the whitehaired man very softly i put my proposal quite definitelyquite plainly that there may be no mistaking it and no temporizing with it i will exchange the person of mr tuke for the stone that goes by the name of the lake of wine and upon receipt of the latter will withdraw my men and leave this neighbourhood for ever at peace the other did not answer you need not say went on mr fern in the same quiet tone that you have not the jewel or any knowledge of its whereabouts that were superfluous i possess convincing evidence of its being concealed somewhere in your house pray do not trouble yourself or me with a denial he paused for an answer an acute observer might have noticed that his fingers twitched a little as though they longed to tear out by the roots the confession he so suavely invited and if i refuse your terms said tuke looking steadily at his man then i much regret it will be necessary to adopt coercive measures the baronet drew himself up the fury he had so long suppressed glinting in his eyes you brazen scoundrel he cried to dare to assume that any threat could bring me to condone your villainy do your worst you dog and clinch your account with the devil he was starting forward when the other went swiftly to the door opened it looked back with a horrible smile and vanished and here endeth the first lesson said mr tuke chapter xliv upon the unfortunate gentleman now committed to an irksome and most apprehensive solitude fell a score of little demons of melancholy and alarm to men of his fibre there is no chastening so bitter as confinement and though with the masterrogue he had borne himself like the spirited knight of destiny he was no sooner was he left alone than he found his indignation subordinated to reflections that were distracting to the last degree what would his companions think had become of him and failing his return would they follow in his tracks and fall into that selfsame snare was miss royston with her lordling cavalier even now established a prisoner in his house or had she failed to respond to her brothers invitation who was it that had shut delsrop against the besieging rascals and would his household deprived of its legitimate head and in ignorance as to his fate exhibit the nerve to conduct and sustain an effective resistance what member of his personnel had been shot that morning a man it appeared then if not dunlone he ran over in his mind the names of those in his servicetwo grooms one of them a mere boy and the imported jim these with betty darda possibly angela and three maids were the sum total of the defenders halfadozen girls two men and a boy and one of the latter already accounted for he groaned and set to tramping to and fro like a wild caged beast his impotence the impossibility of resolving any one of these problems that tortured him set his brain reeling his hands had been corded behind him so tightly that the flesh swelled and lapped over the knots yet it was not his personal discomfort that chiefly perturbed him or any apprehension of the force of coercion his captors would be brutal enough to employ that he was condemned in the midst of a stirring episode in his career to a pitiful inaction was what galled him like a rowel almost simultaneously with his interlocutors withdrawal from the room a sentry of a villainous cast had made his appearance outside the window where he took his stand flintlock on shoulder another by token of his hard breathing and the intermittent click of a hammer against his coatbuttons as he shifted his position from time to time was stationed outside the door from the room opposite came fitfully the sound of voices in low discussion the fire upon the hearth died upon itself and consigned the stark little room to a perfect apathy of chilliness frost gathered on the diamonds of the casement and turned the stolid sentry into a phantom of himself and still the dull hours sped onwards and not a soul came to lighten his depression he had long before drawn the marrow in his monotonous tramp hither and thither from every object of slightest interest that the small ruined chamber could boast here was the crazed girls museum arranged on wormeaten shelvesa medley of grotesque rubbish that superstition had thought fit to respect it was a gruesome litterskins stones and petrified vegetables and he had cursed his own high precipitancy over the thought of how a little forbearance on his part might have saved to the collection its most notable item and so rendered nugatory all the present evil that encompassed him once he had stooped to examine a certain object amongst the trasha round pebble that seemed familiar to him it was the scrawled stone that had been slung through a window for denniss behoof and he peered at it with an emotion commingled of curiosity and remorse so darda it was had secured the treasureto her no doubt a veritable message from the shadows and had the rascal that threw it recognized his handiwork amongst these other fetishes and chuckled to see it reserved for such high distinction it was probable enough for the room bore signs of late occupation by some very rough company gnawed crusts onionskins tobaccoashes lay scattered about the hearth in one corner was a litter of twigs and broken branches hastily collected it would appear for firewood and cast down beside them was an old canvasbag striped pink and drab that had been stuffed with dead leaves for fuel in another a greasy gridiron and a dinted tin pannikin or so were evidence of a certain commissariat foresight on the part of the besiegers while an empty rundlet thrown aside like a discharged cartridgecase was earnest of that species of baggage without which no knight of fortune can be brought to take the road each and all of these objects the prisoner dwelt upon and passed by and reviewed again and again till his brain learnt to loathe their inevitability at the turningpoints of his wearisome sentrygo and still the icy hours closed upon themselves and no soul came near him by and by as an acute accent to his long trial of cold and anxiety extreme hunger asserted itself the overpowering sensation he had not touched food then for more than thirty hours and his frame had been submitted during the whole of that time to severe and exhausting experiences when at last from thoughts otherwise preoccupying he woke to an amazed realization of the fact that he was being starved into submission he strode to the door and kicked at the panels in an excess of furious indignation to the very thundering noise of his onset a low voice across the passage returned like an echo rudland if the prisoner shows himself outside shoot him at once you hound he shouted at thatbring me food dye hear bring me food or ill burn the house down a little answer of laughter was clipt in the bud the threat was to be considered a moment later branders step crossed the passage and the man himself entered the room his eye sought the fireplace found its relief in the dead coldness there and came back with a twinkle of mockery to the prisoner you are hungry he said what would you suppose fellow that you are of course tis a pitiful sensation ive suffered it believe me dyou think to starve me into tameness whata highspirited gentleman like you i believeas i have advised elsewherethat far more caustic measures will be necessary to prevail with you still hunger is a very good groundbait to precede the angler and his hook and you think to subdue me by such means tis a protecting clause of humanity that scoundrels cut their cloth according to the measure of their own cowardice according to the features of their hostages by your leave sir im not going to ask you what you mean you shall have the explanation gratis youve twitted me vulgarly enough on the loss of these he signified with a fierce gesture his flapless earholes twitted said tuke where is the reason to twit a docked curt youll find they left me my teeth by godmy teeth and my nails he almost shoutedyou shall grow a lovelockyou shall grow a lovelock sir to hide the place that your lady maynt know when she whispers there what are you going to cut off my ears aye you may grin your fill youll grin to suffer that on an empty belly you shall feel the hook before we land you and grin like a sole there was something so horribly relishing in the mans tone that the listeners heart went sick mutilation said he beware what you say fellow tis what well do man well lop your fine heroics toe by toe till there remain nought but stumps to foot it on whydye suppose weve pushed the matter so far to shrink at a shadow i give you warning weve neither time nor mood for palaver tonight you shall have for reflectionthe devils of cold and hunger to counsel you and so be youre in a like frame of obstinacy after that test tomorrow you shall be pruned for token to your friends over there and again and yet again till you or they are convinced of the wisdom of an exchange ive learnt the right art of clipping in calabria sir and will shave you that twill be a pleasure to you to feel the razor he stopped with a dark and malignant look on his facebacked a step opened the door and disappeared for a minute after his exit tuke stood too astounded for speech or action that here on his own land in the heart of orderly england he should be held by blackguard outlaws for ransom and menaced with outrage like any victim of continental brigandage seemed too preposterous for belief coming to his senses in a paroxysm of rage he flung himself against the door and hurled curses on his invisible enemies till he was hoarse not a murmur in response was vouchsafed him spent and agitated though still boiling with anger he resumed his monotonous tramp to and fro till utterly worn out he let himself drop upon a heap of sticks and leaning his shoulder against the wallcorner fell into a sort of stupor of exhaustion night closed upon him lying thusa night of sleeplessness and torture his furious struggles to release his hands had only riveted their bonds the closer and his inflamed and swollen wrists gave him exquisite anguish the position of his arms was one long cramping torment the worm of hunger writhed in his vitals while fever glowed in the marrow of his bones and all the long dark through the bitter frost smote his limbs into numbness and seemed to hammer at his heart now and again to his deadened senses would come a little appeal like a memorythe smell of roasting meat the crackle of a fire the sound of reckless voices passing discordant toasts he only connected these with the processes of a conscious delirium and was concerned simply that they would not cease and leave him to his miserable loneliness sometimes in lucid intervals as it seemed and that before the rising tide of darkness had drowned the last glimmering streaks of light he would find himself on his feet insanely inspired for the twentieth time to break his prison by one swift and silent effort and there always a blurred phantom outside the window was the inexorable presentment of the guard no least balm of sleep could he woo to his aching eyelids only presently into his other sufferings was dropped that keystone of anguish a raging thirst racked body and mind burnt and frozen and twisted he fell at last into a torpor of the senses that must do duty for rest and so triumphed over the hours and was aware all at once of daylight in the room the very sight was life a haggard ghost of himself he scrambled painfully to his feet and lurching to the window stood drinking in the weak wine of sunlight suddenly it came to him that the sentry was withdrawn a wild hope tingled in his veins only to as swiftly die away these dogs could take the right measure of cruelty yesterday bound as he was it would have needed all his vigour and resourcefulness to escape by way of that little aperture now weakened and nerveless he must find the task impossible and even while assuring himself on this point he heard the roomdoor opened and turning saw a stealthy face look in take stock of him and vanish presently finding a little of the spirit of strength and defiance returning to him he set to tramping the room again feebly at first but by and by with an increase of vigour for an hour he may have walked when without forespeech or warning the door was flung open and there quickly entered fern and brander who shut themselves in and stood by the threshold facing the prisoner both men were braced and accoutred as if for some immediate business of violence into belts drawn about their waists were stuck murderouslooking knives pistolbutts stood from their skirtpockets and each had a flintlock slung across his shoulders for the rest they were the suave and the brutal and a couple of as soulless ruffians as ever fouled the sunlight there was to be no more temporizing it seemed and the whitehaired leader spoke up at once we would ask your decision mr tuke he said the gentleman his eyes blazing contempt had paused opposite the two as if he questioned a very daring intrusion what do you want of me said he the answer is simple we demand our owna ruby that goes by the name of the lake of wine i have no such ruby in my possession tut sir tut the prevarication is unworthy of you let us say then the skull that contains it the skull mr tuke mr tuke this will not serve your purpose we have direct evidence of the truth sir and that from more than one source you have have you and i am free to advise you sir to refrain for the future from discussing with your friends such very private affairs on the public road to the unfortunate prisoner all in a moment came a clap of revelation we were overheard ahha you give yourself away there was more saidand twas that evening the first inn was fired some conscious sign passed between the rogues at his words tuke sprang at them actually gnashing his teeth i guessed it you foulblooded dogs and may god burn your hearts for that wanton ruin of a poor maid they had seized him and forced him back struggling and helpless the beast was awake in fern his eyes opened bloodshot his lip was lifted he snapped out his knife and held it like a butcher you jackadandy he screamed in a womans voicefor a word id rip you like a pig he stamped on the floor take your choice or go piecemeal to hell an ear and a nose and a lip for the stone and if they dont serve every member of your cursed carcass for token to the fat wench i gave you for mistress tuke wrenched himself free and butting with his shoulder flung himself at the scoundrel with all his force he felt himself spun rounda fiery tooth crossed his wrist and he stumbled and went his length on the floor looking up as he lay momentarily expecting to feel the deadlier plunge of the blade that had already slashed at him he saw to his surprise fern raving and struggling in the grasp of his more powerful fellowrogue let go he was shriekingyou fool dyou think to baulk me in my bloodlust yes cried brander fiercely you kill the gooseyou kill the goose you madman come outby god you shall ive another test to propose his own face was white with fury as he held back the dribbling and snarling animal and had his better strength failed to master it it is likely he would have driven his knife into the swollen throat under him but he prevailed in a moment and dragged the other in a patter of curses from the room as the key turned in the lock tuke collapsed upon himself in a halffaint chapter xlv to a sane and humane soul there is no revelation so shocking as that of the scorn in which its rectitude is held by the prevailing beasts of the world to the most of us at some time comes this bitter realization of the force that keeps humanity low high as our sense of justice and of decency may beserene as may figure the outlook from our lofty chambers of selfrespect we have only to descend into the plain to find manifest the brutal ruggedness of life that our hitherto aloofness has idealized the impotence of honesty to enforce itself in any question of might the impotence of morality to convince selfinterest of its basenessthese are the first lessons in the despair of being and when for climax actual bodily violence shakes us out of all the uses of dignity we are fain to wonder what creative incongruity seeks to leaven all these seething continents of devils with a fingerpinch of just men and how the end has justified the means of blazing sodom and the deluge to the fainting and battered prisoner in the lodge something in the nature of such reflections was conveyed through his sufferings he had been beaten and mastered it seemed by the force that was merely brutal such a situation for himself he had never remotely conceived his vagabondage was to have been of the picturesque sort that aims at nothing more definite than a scorn of conventions that which gives or receives a blowsings with the birds or plays with the prison rats with an equal philosophy or an equal bluntness of perception was outside his scope and certainly outside his knowledge if asked he would have said the condition was not possible to him inasmuch as all his experience led him to such a confidence in his innate capacity for finesse in his own masterfulness and sense of what was due to himself as would carry the most difficult situation that any no matter who should dare to treat him with the contempt of the strong for the weak he had not dreamed could be and waking to the realization that it was a bitter stubborn hatred of those who had taught him his lesson stung in his veins like poison it was a poison nevertheless that was a tonic it brought him to himself and to a determination to subordinate his passions to his intellect let him recover a little regain a moiety of his strength and instead of wasting his time in fruitless ravings he would study to set his wits against his captors and win or die in the attempt to vindicate their superiority he was lying on his back on the floor as he had fallen for how long a time he had been stretched there he could not guess but he was stiff and numb with cold and all his agony of being seemed concentrated in a single flaring thread this was underneath him he fancieda taut string of pain and at first he could not account for it or disassociate the sensation from some ridiculous travesties of delirium he had been given a redhot knife with which to carve his dinnera joint all ribs and emptiness he had thrust his hand into his pocket which had been lined with a grid of steel blades he had broken a great crystal goblet from which he was about to drink and a keen fragment had sliced his arm by and by the unfailing localization of these grotesque injuries led his recovering perceptions to the remembrance that his hands were tied behind him and that he was lying upon them then in a flash he recalled the final scenethe vicious swoop of the knife and the stinging pain that followed and he recognized all at once that he had been stabbed the nature of the woundwhat was it with an effort he turned upon his side for all the cramp and torment in his arms he could move his fingers a little the pressure on these maltreated limbs had wrought one benefitit had stopped the flow of blood but there was something elsesomething with the little weak cry he gave out he rolled on to his back once more for there had been a sound at the door and a man came into the room joe he said feeblyjoe corby the newcomer looking down upon him nodded hows you said he im very bad joe im hurt in body and more in mind that you should lend yourself to this business what makes you do it joe mr corbys answer was enigmatical and brief bulbs said he joe said the patient youre a man of such few words that i hardly like to ask you to squander any on an explanation still circumstances have dulled my faculties i spekilated in em said joe and i were sold i see sold up a man of courage would have turned and taken fortune by the neck would he it aint my way you may thumb me in like a march onion for to come up in june but if the ground dont soot me i jumps out gardening was my ban and i tuk to the road whats the odds here be the lake o wine ablossoming like a toolip at the end of it but is it joe aint it now i speaks free me and rudland being left alone on guard why where are the others the exgardener gave a ponderous wink two ll suffice he said to keep this ere maggot from eatin his way out of the apple a baby would suffice joe in my present state the man nodded again serenely i can ventur to ease you a trifle he said no leave me alone im best left quiet its odd what browsing lambs you all were till misfortune came like a wolf into the fold what do you expect for your share joe more or less than you are agoing to offer me to let you escape its no good capen the riches of the world wouldnt bribe me with fern atreadin on my tail with the words he went to the door looked back grinning and vanished tuke waited during an interval of suspense until he judged himself strong enough to make a noiseless effort to rise then very cautiously and by slow degrees he got to his kneesto his feet and stood swaying suddenly he wrenched his arms and they parted and swung down idly by his sides it was as he had felt and dared to hopethe slash of the murderous knife had severed his bonds at the wrist for some moments he stood wrapt in the mere ecstasy of physical relief then he tried to lift his arms found himself unable to and looked down at the poor dangling limbs they were a pitiful sightswollen paralyzed discoloured and streaked with clotted blood in alarm he endeavoured to woo them to a return of circulation by gently swinging and rubbing them against his coatskirts for a time no result was apparent but persisting in what panic flurry of motion he could contrive without noise he was rewarded by and by with an awakening of such twinges as he was convinced betokened a renewal of life in the maltreated members the twinges increased in quick recurrence and in force until his arms seemed mere engines of boiling and bursting pains he could hardly endure the agony and not cry out but he set his teeth and rubbed either limb furiously with a hand unconscious in his torment that the power of motion was thus restored to him at last the pain slackened and he was able to think he examined his wrist and found the wound to be a long and superficial one but enough to have caused him considerable loss of blood had chance not applied an effective tourniquet his hands were still little capable his whole frame was suffering and enfeebled but his triumph of release from bondage was a stimulant that wrought upon him like wine a weaponthat was his first necessity moving with extreme nicety he examined every corner and crevice in the room not so much as a broken penknife rewarded his search across the hallpassage mr corby lifted up his voice in sincere but unmelodious praise of the red red rose escape appeared impossible but by some bold and unexpected coup was he strong enough to venture itto issue from the room suddenly overwhelm the unsuspecting joe put him hors de combat with his own hanger and made a bolt for the wood by the gardenway the risk was fearful and what but a floundering death in the drift should follow with pursuit perhaps in his tracks on the other hand to delay meant probable outrage and mutilation and a certain steady decrease of physique hour by hour he was resolved to it he stood with his shoulder set to the doorjamb tense for one uttermost effortwhen the sound of voices close by in the drive brought him to a pause and the next moment he heard the front door flung open silently his heart fearfully drumming he stepped back to the very spot from which he had risen and slipping down upon the boards resumed as nearly as he could the position in which the ruffians had left him as he did so he heard the tramp of men in the passage a sound of jeering voices and the next moment the door of the room was thrown open and his visitors of the morning reentered they bore the appearance of men baffled but with some gloating evil in their hearts fern strode to the prisoner and picked at him roughly with his boottoe how now he shrilled dyou make your bed there tuke judged defiance the better policy curse you he cried in a broken voice do you see this patch on the floor twould have said little for your judgment to have left me to bleed to death a fine leader of rogues on my faith ha my friendwell cauterize the next wound for you with a redhot blade and so youve been seeking to bribe the sentry there was hoarse laughter from the door where a halfdozen scoundrel faces were gathered i take my cue from the foremost of you said the prisoner speaking up from the boards tis not so long since mr brander there made me an offer of halfshares if i would give him secret possession of the gem the devil stood atiptoe and looked out through the schoolmasters eyes mr ferns face was gone a raw beetroot colour hows that brander said he a ruse said the other coolly i have more tricks to my philosophy of persuasion than you have methods to your villainy my style suits my company best i think you acknowledge you tried to treat then and do you look to my condescension to deny or explain there had been murmurs at the door and upon this hes lying cried a voice mr brander was a man of few superfluitiesa born director of others this was because he never let an occasion overripen but plucked his fruit before it fell he had been quite prepared before the threatening utterance and with the echo of it he wheeled about and fired his pistol with unerring aim into the thick of the group on the clap of the shot broke a loud hiccoughas if the bullet had pierced a windbagand a fellow pitched forward on the threshold and bled silently on the floor thats my bird said the sportsman he strode to the door the company stumbling and retreating before him ive the other barrel he said does any one want it he stood waiting a moment in a black pause before he spoke again youre reflecting who it is plans the entrances while your cowheads are butting at the wall who is it prepares the way here and everywhere i say and supplies the brains without which youd never finger a crownpiece of your own getting a little patter of voices murmured up ebenezer brander ah he said thats proper scholars and spoken to the word he pocketed his discharged pistol when you feel you can do without mewhen you feel you can depend upon him there he turned fiercely and signified his captain who stood with an infernal smile on his face for all that suits you bestthenll be the time to question my methods and offer me my pass to hell he kicked out his foot slightly in the direction of the dead rogue we were a bakers dozen take away judas iscariot and change the luck perhaps the suggestion the appeal to superstition operated as powerfully with the company as the mans own sinister personality with exclamations of approval they dragged away the fallen body it left a torn wake of red behind it now mr fern said brander turning once more upon his chiefin your own interests youll thank me i know for this exhibition of authority it only remains to give this gentleman his last warning you bitter dogs cried up the captive horrorstricken and overcome at the swiftness of the tragedy i refuse any terms you may offer why what could such brutal cowards effect against a couple of honest determined men kill me if you like and certify yourselves for the gallows i back my good fellows to hold you at bay till the snow melts and there youll be caught in a trap and the crows shall banquet kill me and effect more than youve done in all these two days forgetful in his emotion of every prudence he raised himself on an arm brander uttered a hoarse chuckling cry god of thunder he exclaimed wheres joe corby the man was pushed into the room joe said the villainhe tempted but couldnt prevail eh isnt that so the puzzled fellow scratched his head work it out joe we cut you short in cutting his bonds didnt we he was fingering his second pistol tuke cried out in agony the mans innocent you hound twas that ruffians knife severed the strands when he slashed at me brander hesitated but joes profound amazement was convincing providence works for us in spite of foolseh jack fern said the former he called in two of the men splice him up again he said and firmly it was useless to resist they tied the wretched gentlemans hands behind him once more cruelly enough with a long cord and the slack of this they fastened to the firegrate now said branderhe seemed virtually the leader through all this scene the nominal one stood blazing sullennessweve a little surprise for you my buck and have effected more perhaps than you think bring in the girl there lost broken and dumfounded the captive raised his miserable head at the words what new triumph of devilry did they betoken darda before god his swimming heart was conscious of a shock and following it a little burst of shameful thankfulness bad was it in all conscience but he knew his cracked lips trying to mutter what has happened how did she fall into your handsbut only inarticulate sounds came from them the girl stood there on the threshold fierce defiant held by two men the next moment at a gesture from brander she was gone now sir said the schoolmaster beckoning his coconspirator and coming close up to his victimwe deal as you see in very severe realities we have two in our power at this outset of our little campaign a capture a day would serve but we are impatient for a quicker settlement tonight again for reflection tis a concession but we grant it you with dawn tomorrow it is for you to decide the fate of this maid and of your own very ornamental members tuke like a dying man saw him nod to him darklya grotesque phantasm as of a last delirium saw him turn and in company with his chief stalk from the room knew himself committed to such a further ordeal of torture as he feared his weakened body would be powerless to sustain and as the last echo of retreating footsteps came to his ears his head dropped upon his breast and he despaired chapter xlvi an apology is submitted for here retailing some commonplaces of a very evil duet of rascals that began with certain dropping shots of irony and it ended at pretty close range the kitchen of the tumbled lodge served for guardhouse and the two officers were quartered in the little parlour opposite mr tukes room of bondage between walked a sentry and another on this occasion mr joseph corby was stationed to the front of the house in the freezing moonlight burnt fallowdeer meat had been plentifully bolted after the exertions of the day and kegs of rumsupplied it must be confessed by mr breeds who was not otherwise represented in this climax of affairstopped very agreeably the simplicity of the repast mr fern and his lieutenant exchanged speech for the first time after the second glass then said the former suddenly brander whos the cock of this run oh dont you know jack fern was the answer the bantam by the token that crows himself red in the face there seemed some personality here then ill have you know by god that im not to be supplanted by any whiteshackled rooster that can outscreech me you assume too much authority sir on the strength of an acquaintance with primers mr brander very urbanely recited the fable of the cock and the jewel twas the lake of wine said he and there it was under your nose while you kicked up the dunghill primers have their uses maybe maybe not why mangive me cutwaters letter what for give me cutwaters letter i say the other hesitated then from a pocketbook that he drew from his coat selected a yellowed fragment of paper and flung it sulkily across the table to his companion now mr fern said brander taking up the letter deliberately and referring to itvouchsafe me your kind attention if you please this was dated i think some months before the lamented gentlemans death and was addressed to you oh curse you out of your pedantry ebenezer brander in it occur the following words once expressive of mere violence to youof enigma to me let me reread them ive got the stone bloody jack fern and the stone i mean to keep youll find it despite the devil and mister c will you find it you tut tut mr cutwater what a shocking unpoliteness pray to the blessed st anthony youd better for its hid well ill tell you its in my head but youll make a lame matter of the search he finished threw the paper back to the other and pulled at his pipe in my head he repeated softly knuckling the table who when you showed him the letter halfread the riddle in those words and egged you on to renew the search whose prognostications were verified in that which was overheard by our friend the innkeeper i grant you can see further into a haystack than the most of us you do do you then whats your complaint that you undermine me in the favour of my fellows by godthat you assume the leadership and work first and foremost to your own advancement have i misrepresented you in giving that gentlemanscamp his last warning no in concealing from him the truth of the girls throwing herself into our hands no you would have blundered in all this you have the hoofs and horns of a bullock and they are your one appeal and resource take the fighting to yourself and leave the diplomacy to your betters you dont rest content with your share i grant you one devil and you spawn out a dozen as theres hell smouldering for us all i believe there was truth in the fellows story of your doubledealing with him brander rose to his feet mr bloody jack fern he said ill wish you goodbye and a happy release from your difficulties i waive all claim to a share in the profits of this undertaking as conducted by you sit down man sit downby god sit down i believe youve the right honour and i apologize twas a test and the devil fly away with it i dont understand your methods to me were as little advanced as two days back and i begin to scent failure of course youve a crimson standard of measurement in such affairs a murder or two would set you clucking like a hen the thaw man the thaw should it come as that fribble hinted before and where should we be the better then for staining our hands i play for our necks jack fern from the first ive founded our claim on the unlawful detention of the stone but you want the leadershipyou want the leadership and that means the credit for all and you shall have it by thunder and set that fat head of yours with the brains drawn out ot against a miry problem you shall sink in for all your frogs croaking mr fern came slowly to his feet not empty enough he said in an indrawn voicenot empty enough ebenezer brander to misread the little game youre contriving oh i see through it my friend youll carry your brains to the enemys camp will you and he choked with his rage in a moment he had snapped out his knife and sprung round the table the other was prepared for him in the same instant they set at one another bentheaded like a couple of gamecocks seeking to strike here promised an end of the pretty conspiracy but the devil cares for his own on the tick of combat the door was thrown open and one of the gang stood gaping in the entrance curse the fool cried brander what does he want the man halfdrunk stood confused as if he had interrupted some sacred ceremony the gal he mumbled shes asingin psalms in the attic you shouted the schoolmaster cracked in his upper register and went into a skirl of laughter the tension of the cord was eased and both men fell back get to your bowl you hornbug screeched fern what the fiend shant she prepare herself for the sacrifice oh said the man i thought subbody might earthas all hear you rat whos to hear in the middle of sahara he waved his hand peremptorily the fellow stumbled out and drew the door to behind him with a clap fern slipped his knife into its sheath he looked at the other scoundrel stealthily and grinned cry off brander he said were hunting counter fill and call a toast man my heart warms to the ladies twere a pity to waste this heat of passion on a friends undoing when an enemy and a pretty one offers brander strode to the table and seized the flask a bottle to that he said grimly nothing under a quart reconciles me to a petticoat they sat for an hourfor two hours swilling fire and wickedness the night closed upon itself and the moon was halfacross the sky the frost without crackled in the very heart of the fearful sentry so that presently he could stand it no more and tapped on the casement its in my roots he said when brander came to him i must be let in or die i cant have you in his room joe hes far too cunning a gentleman to trust you with him then give me a drink a bucket of schnapps wouldnt drowse me here they handed him out a stiff jorum in a bottle and closing the window again resumed their orgy another hour passed suddenly one beast looked significantly at the other and both rose together they staggered to the door opened it and lurched out into the passage the sentry here came to himself with a start and stared at them like an owl they bade him have ears for his only business and went swaying on to where by the kitchen a little stairway led to the floor above the house was dimly lighted with candles that guttered here and there on brackets one of these fern seized in his evil hand and they ascended softly to a narrow landing the congested snore of many crapulous ruffians came to them from below a third sentry nodded at hand on the top step let him be whispered brander he shall be breeched for neglect tomorrow in a little attic with barred windows the girl had been confined gently they turned the key in the lock pushed open the door and entered the room was empty as a rifled grave stupidly staring they saw by the hearth a heap of rubbish an overturned flag and with bursting oaths they rushed for the place and swinging the light down were aware of a jagged rent torn through the rotted fabric that looked into the room below his room cried fern putting his hand to his forehead and staggering back the next moment they were out on the landing again the sitting sentry grunted and cocked a bleared eye at them with a foul curse and no condescension of question to him brander drove his heavy foot at the man with all his force the fellow started up with a shriek like a neigh doubled upon himself and toppling went down the whole flight with a noise of snapping and collapsed in a writhing and coughing heap at the bottom immediately there was a humming uproar of waking men in the midst of which the two bounded into the passage and scrambled for the door of the second prisonchamber they burst it open the window was flung widethe room was emptya fragment of rope trailed from the fireplace dolts dogs bullockheads cried brander pelting screaming with fury into the passage again where are they what have you been doing hearing overlooking in your damned folly let me pass you worse than curs and maniacs he was wrenching and tugging frantically at the handle of the entrancedoor in an instant he was out had staggered had sprawled with his hands to save himself and had gone with a sliding run into the snow he was up directly and shrieking to those within for a light some one brought it flurried and he seized and held it over some shapeless thing huddled against the porch drunk he muttered no by god and he stooped and gave a little pull to the inert mass a squelch of darkness ran out into the snow that received and held it like a blottingpaper mr corby had been stabbed to the heart chapter xlvii when upon the poor gentleman starved and refettered descended once more the sick loneliness of confinement he assured himself that only a little time now was needed to see the quenching of his last spark of reason he was so exhausted and unstrungso doubly weakened by this latest wanton cantrip of fortune as to feel that the spirit of venture fluttering within him on a broken wing was physically incapable at last of the least independence of action he looked upon himself as one who having half raised a fallen treasure from a nearinaccessible ledge has let it slip out of pure carelessness into the abyss and so regarding his folly he was miserably ready like the born gambler he was to cry kismet over his punishment the girl it was concerned him mostprominently for her own sake but also because he might not guess what her seizure betokened or what weak defences had made the fact of it possible about her condition or her safety in the midst of these lawless ruffians his brain was too worn to speculate but at least he could understand that the purpose for which she was held would not be allowed to perish upon itself of inaction he was only numbly conscious of the passing hours the semitorpor induced by cold and hunger deadened the pain of his scarified wrists and he sat or lay huddled against the hearth unmoved to the least further effort of selfrelease sometimes as evening crept on and darkened he was aware in a confused manner of jangling sounds about the house that he dimly associated with the definite business of lifethe rattle of pans and of crockery the purr of rough voices strangely attuned to the pitch eloquent of the domestic virtues later a harsher medley of discordsthe song the quarrel the crash of boisterous mirth and often enough the thud of blows or shuffle of drunken feet intermittently through all the penancewalk of the sentry in the passage went monotonously on now dragging sullenly now moved to some spasmodic briskness as the laugh bubbled high in the kitchen now accented with a curse like a dogs snap at a fly intermittently too came the hum of voices from the room opposite sinking and swooping and moaning as if a wind of evil thoughts were there gathering for any purpose of destruction and the night deepened and the cold and deep sank the expression of both into his tormented soul once he thought he heard a window opened and the sound of voices in parley and at that the least spark of hope flickered in him that negotiations of what nature he was too stupefied to so much as remotely conceive were in process on his behalf but the murmur ceased and the glass was rattled to and a profounder misery settled upon him that the little needle of light had showed itself to vanish he was abandoned to his fate and about that he felt no bitterness only he greatly desired that the climax of his personal affairs should suffer no long postponement it may have been an hour short of midnight when with his sad eyes fixed upon the moonlit square of window his lids closed involuntarily and he sank into a sort of unresting stupor of the faculties how long this travesty of sleep dwelt with him he might not know but in an instant he had leapt from it and made as if to scramble to his feet something that seemed to his disordered mind horribly suggestive of evil had come between him and the white patch of the casement he tried to cry out and found no power but for a sigh and suddenly the shape was beside him silently on its knees and an arm was round his neck and a soft hand upon his mouth betty betty betty whispered a tiny febrile voice in his earand instantly he knew and giving a little broken whinny dropped his tired head upon her shoulder she clasped him and she made no shame to kiss him with her lips like flowers and then very gently very pitifully she passed her fingers over his right ear over his left and gave a heaving sigh from the bosom that lifted against his cheek oh the cowards the cowards she whispered to fright me so and for a lie he found a little voice for her he would have i think from the grave are you come to save me betty yes my hands are tied behind they are so cut and bound i have lost all feeling in them and if i shouldnt be able to rise betty she held his head to her convulsively she cried silently as a woman can if she will we must not be a moment she whispered i hear them talking we must move like mice there is a horror outside but what of it if it let me pass to you she put her hand again on his mouth tacitly bidding him to the most tense silence with her heart torn with pity she bent and examined the knots they were cruelly drawn but love and good white teeth will work sufficient miracles she had cracked harder nuts in her time he felt her at work like a rat vicious and determined once he felt lips light like down on the bruised members and he thought though they were mortified and dead they should quicken at that all of a sudden his hands were free he would have endeavoured to rise but with a quick gesture she kept him down she came to the front and swiftly with her strong young arms pulled the boots from his numbed feet now she signified he was up in a moment broken as he was the stimulus given his spirit by the devotion of this true soul was divine supporting him with all her love she helped him step by step across the floor then for the first time he noticed that the girl was in her stockinged feet and that the casement stood wide to the freezing night come to the opening he stooped his face to hers with a very pathetic look not now she whispered not an instant for delay or explanationbut seeing what he would be at she put an arm to his neck and drew his lips hard against hers the sill was but a step to an active wench betty was outside scarcely having released his hands and then she turned and beckoned at her nod another appeared at the openingdennis by all the alphabet of wonder she bade him to keep perfect silence by a word the good fellow was white as ashes and as he came up he was fumbling a long blade into his pocket the moonlight revealed a wide horrified look in his eyes he was like a saint whom love has defrauded of heaven he took his master under the arms and with a convulsive effort haled him out into the snow inevitably a little noise resulted betty gave an indrawn gasp but by all good luck a burst of laughter from within covered the accident tuke stood like a drunken man swaying and staring vacantly about him against the porch he was aware of a misshapen bundle god forgive me sir said dennis twas for you i did it the woman was the roman he died at his post she whispered and i would have done it blithely myself for this and mr whimple he has stood guard at the door and left me only the sweets of service then she said are you strong now to come and seeing her poor gentleman all weak and bewildered she held him again pitifully and bade dennis to his other side and so they led him with what swiftness they could compass and creeping like frantic things out through the lodgegate and a little way up the foundered road until they came to that very snowy gap in the brushwood through which the party of wanderers had forced their way three days before and presentlyfor the moon made all distinctthey broke and stumbled into the clearing and stood before the icehouse betty then murmured her masteri must not question but why not push up the drive now the coast is clearand here we shall only die oh you are wise she cried with a little triumphant laugha pretty confection of love and relief and tears you are wise and bold but not a little stupid perhaps who shall say that another sentry is not posted between the lodge and the house and now you are to see she put her shapely foot against the door and pushed it open she jumped into the jaws of erebus and held up her arms to him and he let himself down into them trusting and was taken and rejoiced over now she said whatever comes we are safe to win clear and i will cry a little but i can cry walking and will you explain a little betty this is no icehouse or at least it is only the mouth of an underground passage that leads straight through into that you call the priests hole betty i have heard grandfather woe is methe poor old man talk ot many a time for he worked here when a lad in the service of sir thomas woodruff and i doubted not your honour knew though the end in truth was choked with rubbish but when you returned not and the rogues came in force and made their purpose clear we women watched wi sore hearts from the shelter of the roof and we saw sir david blythewood and the captain come out on to the snow by the fringe of the shaw no earlier than this morning and i cried at once they ha taken refuge in the icehouse and have lain there in ignorance to this moment go on betty are you sure of the way never mind my crowing girl i havent broken food or tasted drink for three days and my lungs are like glass paper oh me but i will not cry for a minute i took jim and we found our way to the hole and went down into it and there sure enough under the ledge was a stone in the wall that turned on a great pin and this we swung round and saw a black gully shoot before us well we took a candle and entered and not twenty feet in the light went out and we had to walk in darkness oh my child my little betty that said go back as plain as foul gas could speak did it it was close and stifling of course but we took hands and won through this very tunnel we are creeping along now and all of a sudden we came to rubbish and the murmur of voices at that jim shouted they were close at hand and heard us plain and in ten minutes we had made a hole through the heap big enough to pass through and foolish they must have looked to hear how they had sat down to die within reach of rescue maybe did they not betty how should i know i had no eyes for them you werent there he stopped in the black darkness and put his arms about her dennis he murmured back are you following dont run us down but listen to this i love betty pollack with all my heart and soul the girl burst into tears dont she whispered and clung to him convulsively he said softly over his shoulder take up the tale whimple she saved you she saved us sir we had dwelt there like fools we had waited anxiously for your return and at last when hope was failing us sir david set off in your tracks fought his way to the lodge and came within view of the truth he saw the villains all about the place and had much ado to keep himself secret but he managed to steal back unobserved and all that afternoon till dark one or other of us was posted in the wood watching for your return and so the night shut upon us again and we tried to comfort ourselves with the assurance that you had had warning had evaded the enemy and had made your way round to the house by a circuitous path sir when this good girl saved us and we came to know you had probably fallen into ferns hands i think there was none in the world more brokenhearted than dennis whimple good fellow but who gave you confirmation of the truth fern himself sirthe bloody villain himself he came before the house at noon today with a flag of trucethat sir david would respect though the captain desired to shoot him then and thereand told us that he had you a prisoner now sir david would not let him know that we three was returned hoping thereby to tempt him and his band to venture themselves to their destructionas they already deemed the little garrison to be innocent of fighting menand he sent one of the grooms to parley and fern promised this man one of his masters members for every refusal of the stone he should receive this captain luvaine regarded as an idle menace but later some one looking out of the window saw in a snowdrift against the driveend a pole posted and nailed to the top of this was a horrible fragment and underneath a paper with tukes right ear written bold thereon betty shuddered in the arms of her dear knight twas a beastly act he said sternly for which if i live that bitter scoundrel shall pay in full and you believed it sir david was for sallying forth at once by way of this passage but he was overridden and it was judged wiser to make the attempt at rescue by night then comes betty sir and claims the post of danger for her womans witand and mr whimple must squire me for love of his master and we prevailed and here is your honour andoh my lovemy only love and betty gave full vent to her tears at lastthough she cried very silently like a thoughtful girl now it must not be supposed that throughout this explanation mr tukes devoted members were in full vigour of speech and hearing he asked and listened and answered indeed in a manner of tender emotion but he must lean against the tunnel wall for support of his trembling limbs the while and his voice was so weak that sometimes it was barely audible suddenly however he pulled himself up with a jerk as if a shot had struck him and god in heaven he criedthe girldarda a surprised pause followed sir said dennis in a trembling voicewhat do you mean my god dont you know where she is i havent seen her since she greeted me on my return she gave me food and drink and wentto the housetop i thought you know her ways sir she is in ferns hands they brought her to me in evidence a second pause as of death befell the girl in his arms held her breath i must go back said dennis in a lost low voicei must go back tuke struggled to free himself come he saidwe will go together betty held him like a mad thing you shall not she cried are you crazed what could you do but weaken mr whimples hands and he would have two to his care instead of one the girl is right and wily shell have her plans i warrant still he struggled feebly in the encircling arms run mr whimple she cried i will hold him that he cannot follow the echo of the mans footsteps already came from a distance betty panted her master reproachfully oh what do you make of me one i hope thatll hold himself sound for all our sakes for shame have you not duties forward he must allow himself to succumb to this sweet sophist they stumbled on together once more through the dank and inky blackness their unshod and frozen feet suffered cruelly on the rough floor and many little exclamations of pain were forced from either who was it that was hit by the villains betty twas the lord creature good god then he and miss royston are there after all aye they be and is he killed not he though were he he couldnt make more noise about it tuke laughed feeblya little bleat that was music to the other have i said something foolish but we read of chance folks whose death makes a noise your honour my honour again but ill not gainsay you darling my honour and yours will you be my wife betty and stay here and rest awhile sweetheart and well choose the colour of the weddinggown chapter xlviii a white bed and sleep food and drink in judicious allowance salve for his hands and love for his heart not least the conviction that he might rest secure of the right conduct of his little garrisonand the returned sufferer committing himself to the processes of a radiant constitution found his trust justified in such a rapid convalescence as he had hardly ventured to expect he slept off a dozen hours of the clock like one and woke when it was nearing noon already more than half restored to himself at the first sound of his moving sir david came to his bedside and looked down upon him with a comical air of chagrin good and satisfactory said the baronet and now sir we need your counsels to rid some innocent people of a very blackguard incubus heaven bless them but one word firstdarda trust the jade she was brought in by her brother not ten minutes after you arrived thank god for that how why it seems she made a hole in the floor of the attic where she was held dropped down into the very room you had quitted and took advantage of the window you had left open that others a rare wench of yours tuke aye aye you turn their heads sir and damme if your virtues compare with mine why the mad girl it appears gave herself to the rogues on the chance of helping you and was right savage when she found she had been forestalled burn me if i can see so much in you she would ha been on your tracks sooner but that she must stop to collect a bagfull of her mummies and things and there she was makin for the tunnel as cool as a gipsy when whimple sighted her well what is toward this morning not a sign the rascals are well served believe me and cuttin one anothers throats by now two are accounted for alreadyone by their own devilry and one by denniss knife would you believe it tukethe mans as haunted as if stickin a mongrel were murder it is to him he hath saddled himself with a lifelong ghost for my sake folly sir folly he hath not the right trick of sport will you rise and come to counsel if only i could make to chatters for reinforcements and take the enemy in the rear ah if we only could must i dress by candlelight why twould be rash to open the shutters and invite a bullet halfanhour later refreshed and reinvigorated though still conscious of a swimming weakness the master of delsrop descended to his dininghall on his way he passed a little group of his maidsa bevy of frighted and tearstained faces that appealed to him humorously and pathetically he stopped a moment take heart my girls said he well soon be quit of trouble now im come to my own again god bless you sir we never thought to see sich doings when we took service here why no more did i and i swear my service is harder than yours that redfaced villain sir jane have seen smoke come out of his mouth tut what an unconscionable scoundrel we must put a snuffer on him he smiled and nodded and went on his way he suffered some small trepidation thereby over the thought of what he was about to face miss royston rose with a little stiff laugh as he entered the room she was trim and dainty for all her poverty of circumstance he went straight up to her and bowed low what can i offer you he said but my deep regrets indeed sir she answered loftily tis our friends trouble that hath worked your misfortune you are recovered i hope i am almost well the viscount dunlone who had been seated over the hearth and who was in truth the only other present rose here with a glowering face his left arm was swathed in linen bandages that being so he said i will ask you is it not intolerable i should be brought by your invitation to this monstrous pass sure sir i deplore the accident but i must insist twas sir david bid you here i have been wounded nigh to death sir oh my lord put in angela sharply the flesh was but cut madam permit me my own form of words i have suffered a cursed mauling sir under your roof and in an affair that no whit concerns me and i am sorry lord dunlone what more can i say but that the affair concerns me no more than that it affects my friends friend and that i wish us all well out of it that isnt enough for me curse it im to be flouted and shot at and treated with no more respect than a cursed commoner and then be given an account of regrets youve returned to your own sir and now ill look to you to put an end to this cursed business and to procure me a safe pass out of your accursed wilderness lord dunlone listen to me when this business is settled you can call me to what account you please in the meantime as i am master here you will dispose yourself according to my direction and as i think most profitable to our security and welfare he turned from the peer and walked to the fireplace you belittle my lord and his grievance said miss angela primly but no doubt you are within your right sir robert the indignant drizzler walked to the door puffed with fury on the threshold he twisted about oh very well he said in a high voice you take your course and i mine when this matter is ended he flung himself out and bangedto the oak behind him mr tuke looked gravely at his companion so he hath told you he said he revealed it when he was very wild with his wound you have not treated me well sir robert i have no claim to the title my repudiation of it was a condition of this inheritance and so your chickens came home to roost fie sir robert with what character would you pay your court to an innocent lady how hath he maligned it i will vindicate it against a dozen puppies of his kidney and to the glory of what dulcinea she looked at him searchingly with what intention who shall say am i to read confirmation of the story in this hunting of a gallant by his kitchen wenches why not slander is the hallmark on virtue twas one of these kitchen wenches as i have the tale was your salvation at the first oh i grant she knows a rogue by his scent she served the tap to such i believe and twas right noble of you to bring her to draw the ale to your honour madam is it not shameful to speak thus of one who preserved you all by her wit mercy on us i meant no offence i love her solicitude in sitting up for the wanderers all night and closing the shutters on her friends the thieves when she saw them breaking out of the drive but what was that to her taking the burden of your release on her shoulders and i trust she hath not found herself conducting a forlorn hope her conduct is and has been what any with nobility must applaud i thank you for including me amongst the elect my name madam should i choose to recover itas i maywill rank with the oldest and stateliest i regard it as the meanest bribe to the consideration of one that simple selfrespect adorns beyond the favours of kings ah me we poor worldlings it is well i see to go to school to misfortune and better to pull mugs of ale to country louts i can congratulate lady linne at least upon a very knowing taste in liquors mr tuke stared in amazement here he could have thought spoke the bitterness and scorn of jealousy what if at his last meeting with her she had thought fit to stultify her previous insolence by a show of condescension to him that for the moment conveyed its calculated charm he had looked upon this on reflection as a mere move in her game of coquetrya bait to the sulky lord who drizzled he had hardly dreamed that anything personal to himself could weigh in her balance against broad acres and a title and nothing she had then said had weaned him from his newlyindulged lust of liberty now all at once it came to him that mr tuke transmogrified might boast attractions to a semiromantic nature that no titled idiotcy could rival and at the thought a very rigour of fright seized all his limbs and he spoke out in quite a tremor of hurry i am my lords tailor as you know madam and though mrs pollack may not show the best of taste in condescending to me she hath still done me that honour the advantages where vanity is to receive a blow are all on the side of breeding an irrepressible start and glance of astonishmentand miss royston found herself in a moment indeed she said and now i protest my wit is at least equal to hers in foresight but i applaud your determination to settle down in life at whatever price she rippled out a spirited little bravura as she turned to some needlework that lay on the table the necessity of at the present crisis conducting all the comedies of life by candlelight threw a curiously theatrical glamour over the scene i hope for lady linnes sake said miss royston as she patted her work approvingly that a quick end may be put to this very unpleasant predicament you will be married of course the moment you are a free agent again perhaps they have a recreant parson amongst our friends at the lodge they will take to thieving sometimes i am told is not this a pretty stitch can mrs pollack thread a needle she will have had a sampler i warrant in the parlour with a full pot foaming white wool for remarque and i vow sir you have never yet asked how it was my lord dunlone came by his hurt i have not said the bewildered baronet you said it was but a flesh one and i confess i attached little importance to it it was received in your service sir or at least under your roof you must not think a fine independence releases you from the bonds of courtesy to those who stoop to favour you twas a ruffian fired at one of your grooms as the man went to close a shutter and the ball wounded my lord as he stood behind perhaps it was not much but blue blood is a vintage we hold a little higher than small beer she turned round with quite a radiant smile would you mind doing something she said we are really a trifle bored you know with this tame inactivity chapter xlix now before mr tuke was called upon to reap the full embarrassment arising from that impulsive confession of his to miss royston events came to so crowd themselves upon the little stage of his history as that he was spared what might have been otherwise a very complicated situation for indeed he had not thought in what matter betty pollack unchaperoned and living so to speak under his protection was to find her due of respect from his servants and of consideration from his guests in this latter question however when he came to face it he was to suffer relief of his apprehensions in a treatment that was nevertheless a little galling for whether from offended dignity or from any policy of indifference miss royston made no allusion to the subject before others and indeed to all appearance gave herself no least concern about it still bettys honour being his and his desire great that she should be placed by no private selfishness in a false position he was determined at the first convenient opportunity to proclaim her his betrothed with regard to the present predicament the morning of his restoration to his friends saw much barren counsel and a dearth of decision therefore dispensing with informal advice he went to examine his defences and his commissariat given his adequate garrison the former were impregnable to any assault the rogues could venture and locked in the coachhouse was such store of fallowdeer meat as would provision the company for months the difficulty of feeding these poor brutes was a matter that bothered him they may have been a score in number and should they once eat him out of hay and corn there would be nothing for it but to make a battue of them and salt or smoke as much of their flesh as circumstances would permit as for the human needs his larder was for the present well stocked for protective purposes he could now number in allnot counting dunlone and the womensix men and a boy a fighting strength sufficient to justify him in taking action on his own account did he care to risk the lives of honest people in so indifferent a business he did not of course what need was there to put a termination to conditions whose favour was all for the besieged and he was conscious moreover of that weakness of his party that lay in a lack of firearms three fowlingpieces and a brace of duelling pistolssuch was his artillery and a very limited supply of ammunition to the back of it but they could afford to lie and snugly in these their winter quarters till the snow should melt when he came to look at the great drifts piled all about the house when he had made himself acquainted with the excellence of master cutwaters defences when he compared his position with that of the ruffians in their broken sty and thought of the improvidence of the typical bravo and of how there in the lodge food and fire would be sure to fail in the course of a day or twohe could only marvel at the audacity of villainy that could ever have dreamed of prevailing in a contest of such unequal forcesof the desperate courage or the magnificence of a cupidity that could still wait on in the face of so stubbornly forlorn a hope yet surely were fern once acquainted of the extent of his opponents resources he would elect to withdraw his troop of cutthroats still he would not concede anything to a sense of security he had had his sufficient lesson and he took his little garrison in hand masterfully the guns he committed to sir david to jim and the elder groom while he and luvaine took a pistol apiece a guard was constantly posted upon the roof and another in the hall and every man was enjoined to be awake to surprises of whatever description satisfied on all these points he could condescend to some relapse into the social conditions and three oclock saw him ushering his company into the dininghall where a meal was served the master of the house was the last to enter the room and he led in by the hand no less a person than his pretty maid of the inn miss royston stared amazed at the sight but betty herselfa very hebe for all her homely gownlooked ready to burst into tears for any shamefaced agony she might suffer her dear lords word was become a thing to be answered to like a whistle to a dog and at his nod she sank into a chair at his right hand and drooped her sweet head while he stood erect the light shining on his face i wish to tell you all he said in a clear bold voice that this lady hath included herself in her gift to me of my life and that we are plighted maid and man angela fell back in her chair very white and smiling for what we are about to receive she whispered to the viscount who sat next to her why does the creature take us into his confidence we will accent the ladys character on trust though she dips her fingers into the dish hes always so cursed convinced were thinking about him said the lord but sir david blythewood was risen to his feet and faced his bohemian friend with a wrathful face the times excuse some jesting he began i am in dead earnest blythewood then so am i sir and ill beg the favour of a word with you by and by at your pleasure and now having called the grace well drink the soup at all this luvaine looked plentifully surprised he stared from one to the other of the company with his melancholy frown and of a sudden he was on his feet since none will congratulate you sir he said i will venture the statement that i never read mans happiness in a purer face i know nothing but this and i drink the ladys fair health with all my heart here in truth was an unexpected champion with a radiant smile tuke turned to one of the gaping servants fill your future mistresss glass he said and kiss the rim betty to your good friend the poor girl shot a timid grateful glance across the table her eyes swam with tears for her indeed the ordeal was the severest gifted with a natural grace of refinement she yet would hardly venture to eat or drink lest she should offend by some little solecism against taste she would not question her lords insistence that she should come and sit at his table and take her right rank that was to be the mistress of it but oh how she had longed to be spared the trial until he had loved her and coaxed her and disciplined her into a grave knowledge of the proprieties and for himself he was not long in recognizing how his impulsiveness had again thrown him at the jump for to satisfy his own scruples of highmindedness he had submitted his sweet maid to insult and his guests to embarrassment and there the situation stuck and a very awkward and unappetizing one it was the meal passed to a stiff accompaniment of formalities of both speech and behaviour angela assumed perhaps a superlative manner of deportment and she laughed extremely on a high note at some very stupid things dunlone said to her it would have been all dreadfully prosaic and worldly had not a touch of tragedy been introduced suddenly from a quite unexpected quarter the wine had been placed on the table and the servants were withdrawn when tuke was aware that the crazed girl had come into the room and was standing motionless behind his chair he turned sharply round darda her hands clasped at her back was gazing at him with an intense look what is it he said have you news oh yes she answered nodding her headbad newsvery very bad he thought he saw an expression in her eyes that was strange to him though he fancied himself familiar with most of her moods tell it me he said hastily risingto the good fortune of one of the company dont you know twas i tried to save you she asked him in a low voice but there was something falsethe shadow it was the shadows that were false are you going to throw me away for that how could i help it i did my best you were enchanted and i walked singing into the castle of the giants to save you and when i came you were flown who tempted you away go now darda he said gently i will talk to you by and by i must know first they said but my brain burst like glass and then i could not remember he took a step towards her but she backed from him and cried out in a sudden triumphant voice i can tell herthe white woman who would set her wit against steel see now if she can in a moment she had snapped her hands to the frontand a bright blade was in one of themand she was running to where miss angela was seated at the table tuke was upon the mad creatures heelshis hand clutched at her shoulder the lady unconscious that she was the destined victim was only turned about in her chair with a curious face it all passed in an instanta very dramatic episode the vicious arm lunged outthe pursuer struck upthere flashed an arc of light as the blade somersaulted in the shine of the candles and there broke a shrill scream and a jarring flurry of chairlegs as the company scrambled to its feet then were to be seen darda standing passively in the grasp of her captor and the victim fallen into a faint against the shoulder of her neighbour who looked down upon her with a face all quivering with fright and fury and curse me cried lord dunlone why doesnt somebody come and take her i never was in such a nest of cursed brigands in my life before chapter l the hapless master of delsrop paced his dininghall in a rare conflict of emotions the wine gleamed on the table but none was there to call a toast in it his hospitality was abused his company retired and he was audibly cursing that cantrip of fortune that had endowed him with a wilderness and a party of lunatics and cutthroats to people it and had made of it at the same time a perfect purgatory of misunderstanding now he groaned to himself if i am not in the mind to call in jack fern and his gang to resolve a problem that gets beyond me all had disappeared from the room and he was alone he had himself in a fury of passion borne away darda to the stableswhereto there was a covered passage leading from the north wing of the houseand had locked her in amongst the deer as safe and appropriate to her animal outburst angelamore frightened than hurt by the little punctured wound on her fair white shoulder which the knife had made in its fallhad been supported to an upper room by her brother and dunlone betty was fled he knew not whither and luvaine gone to take his turn of guard in the chamber of the priests hole which now in the light of late discovery was considered the nucleus of danger dusk was creeping on when in the midst of his irritable tramping he turned to find that dennis was come into the room by all the devils of crosspurposes he said stopping opposite the man i believe we are the only two in the house whimple that understand one another tell me thenwhat am i to do with the girl she must go sir her malady increases andsir let me speak plainly it is aggravated by some wild passion thatthat your neighbourhood provokessomeoh how can i face you and cry the mad presumption yesshe must go he spoke gloomily and thoughtfully if only this eternal business of the stone were done with and i could enter into peaceful possession of my own again and sometimes i think that that will never be that i hold a position onlya test of manliness and endurance and that delsrop is no more than a redoubt in the battle of life to fight from the shelter of and abandon when my next advance is called in truth sir i believe there is a melancholy curse upon the place we will hold it nevertheless dennis but our duty done by it my heart i think wouldnt die to see it fall twould be a sombre rookery for a young mother to rear her brood in he set to pacing the room once more while the other hung his head in some sorrowful emotion whimple he said as he walkedyou have associations heresinister enough but they are a bond of a kind i have none and yet your fathers shadow creeps in mine and influences it i am afraid to evil oh sir dont talk like that i have so formed my faith on all of that in you which i lackcourage and tut fellow dyou think im to be overcrowed by a ghost the sick dog must have his moan dennis and im scarce recovered yet of those rascals look at my hands you rabbit are these fingers or forked radishes to pull a trigger withal god restore you master as he willas he will he was still tramping but the stone he mutteredthe stone the stone suddenly he paused before the servant and placed a hand on his shoulder when you took the skull to your mother he said how did you carry it carry it sir carry it i say did you put the grinning atrocity under your armunder your coathow i put it in a bag sir what sort of bag man and what became of it oh how can i sayyes i know twas a canvas thing of my sisters that i stole and brought home again and she rated me that i had appropriated it for twas the one in which she conveyed her treasures to the lodgethe very bag indeed she found there and used to stuff her relics into before she escaped last night where is it indeed i have no notion sir what was its colour it had stripes of pale red i only remember find it if you can and bring it to me now sir now you think the stone may have escaped into it it hath been in their hands sir down there it is not possible go at least and look he resumed his monotonous walk a desperate impatience to somehow end all this overbearing insolence of circumstance raged in his veins but fate must still be nagging at him like a hot wife he heard the door opened and thought it was whimple returned it was sir david however who stepped primly down and came up with a stony face to the poor man miss royston is recovered said tuke the shock dwells with her the wound is superficial she is seated with lord dunlone for distraction of her thoughts ah women will dare bold remedies not less than men sir when they suffer a midsummer madness blythewood let us for heavens sake be quit of mysteries you want to quarrel as i understand and im in no mood to baulk you what is another sting in this general attack of hornets only give me the pretext manas to which i swear im in a wood of bewilderment ill speak plain enough for an adder to hear didnt you ask my favour to your suit with my sister certainly you put the question to me need i say more was this late insult a calculated one i know nothing of the claims of the lady or as to how far her services may warrant your condescension but you have gained your object not another word man unless you wish to fight over a handkerchief here and now the matter can be arranged when our responsibilities to these innocent folks are happily decided the little baronet bowed i regret you have forced me into this position oh my friendspare yourself i am bullied beyond any desire of explanation i can slash and shout in this mle of misunderstanding and i only dread to die because of the good sweet soul that has fastened her life to mine wait and for the sake of all give me your present services and i will meet you with cannon if you like when the pother is over of courseour interest here is one you have relieved my mind by cock have i then attack the bottle and be merry and ill try to make you company no i must go back to my sister you want blood yourself though youre peeked and haggard man and no doubt late affairs have overtried you he went out as the door closed upon him a savage but irresistible sputter of laughter came from the lips of the other was ever solicitude more impudent he murmured to press me to fatten on my own wine for the sacrifice once more he went to and fro while dark gathered about him not long elapsed before he leapt towards the door with a positive curse to hear it turn on its hinges again whos there he cried angrily and strode upon the offender he had no blame for it this time he pulled her down into his arms and pushed the door to and fondled and caressed this poor partner of his disgrace she was all frightened and trembling it seemed and she buried herself against him as a young rabbit snuggles into a corner where have you been this long hour my betty he said softly i wanted to attend the lady of chatters but she was angry with me and has been saying cruel things never mind them my bird people of her condition talk from the head and that so often aches from confinement in close rooms that it makes them disagreeable it

would rather know the nightingales in my wood than fifty birds of paradise in turbans round my table they started apart as a knock came to the door bidden to enter one of the grooms pale eager and excited stepped hurriedly down into the room his gun over his arm sir he said a man is come from the snow and is knocking at the door for admittance chapter li a man what man said tuke george sir looking from above cries that tis him with the white hair come with me and have your gun in readiness betty ran forward with clasped hands oh dont go dont go she whispered he smiled down upon her i will parley voo from the passage my dear and will shall point his barrel at the keyhole he strode out of the room and cried in a sharp voice whos there john fern by your leave sir the answer sang in muffled by the thick oak are you tired of life fellow i am a humble dependent on your bounty mr tuke i come with a flag of truce trusting to your honour i have none for vermin we may shoot such sitting be generous sir we are trapped frost and starvation have worked for you i am beholden to them they are good agents of retribution will you not be merciful we surrender at discretion you are too late in coming to it for the love of god sir take me in and hear me the gentleman hesitated and pondered were the man in truth alone he could not see what ruse might be designed his tale too was probable enough baulked in their outrageous plot at the very outset what likelihood was there that the improvident scoundrels would have calculated against such a contingency as the present one wait he called suddenly and i will consider he whispered his man to stand rigidly on guard and going softly ascended the stairs to an upper room that would command view of the porch at an angle here cautiously he unbarred and opened the shutters and looked forth the closing dusk played like smoke on the great snowheaps that stretched all about the house and to the opening of the drive to his right where a billowy rampart of whiteness marked the termination of the path cut by the besiegers thence to the frontdoor an irregular slur in the frozen carpet betokened the further passage to the house forced by his visitor below whose broad squat figure he could distinguish set squarely in the shadow of the porch elsewhere there was no sign of life or movement dead winter reigned in the fields of fallen snow in the stony sky in the stark and sapless branches of the trees the man was alone as he had stated and beyond the immediate reach of his comrades he descended swiftly to the hall once more the faithful william stood at cock as he had left him are you there he cried i am here sir i will let you in a twitch of treachery and you get a bullet in your brain mr tukeyou can trust me he inside unhitched the fasteningssnapped key and bolts cover him will he said and swung open the door mr fern walked in with a very humble obeisance a white down of many days growth bristled villainously on his chin he looked battered and unkempt but not illnourished for a starving man the door relocked and made secure go before into that room said tuke and remember that you tread on glass sir i make no protest mr tuke i assume your action guarantees me a safeconduct and that the fact that the muzzle of your servants piece actually touches my head argues no base intent on his part he is fairly efficient with his weapon sir i warn you he answers to the prick of discipline shoot this man at sight william if he attempts to move he had signed to the smooth ruffian to stand with his back against the table sir said fern will you not hear me speak before witnesses fellow believe me ive had enough of your sole company to serve me a lifetime he was turning to go when he was aware of the girl standing with frightened eyes in the shadow of the hearth before god sweetheart he cried i commit you to rare company this is the hound betty that wrought you a curs vengeance the visitor pursed his lips and shut his eyes and shook his head in some patient dissent you will not let me plead he murmured it is safe to slander the dumb give me your piece william and go summon sir david and whimple hither i will not let him out of my sight the groom obeyed and hurried off the moment he was vanished betty came like a tasselgentle to her masters call he is an old man she said he should have had pity for white hairs why were you so cruel to my grandfather sir young lady said fern sorrowfullywhoever it was worked you that wicked wrongand i confess i have my suspicionshath unwittingly it seems provided it a golden sequel like the beautiful phnix which you may have read of you renew yourself in the ashes of your own destruction and you shall wear fine feathers yet in a triumph over misfortune dont answer him betty said her master and go upstairs wench ill not have you breathe in the same room with him the girl went to the door looked back wistfully and obeyed at the moment that the groom followed by the two he had been dispatched for entered the dininghall sir davids face expressed sufficient astonishment who the thunders this said he stopping blank on the threshold this is the affable mr fern blythewood who comes to surrender himself into our hands the frost he says has demoralized his gang do you scent a trick have a care tuke sir david quoth the other mindful of his prisoners face how is our company disposed why manhere are we four captain luvaine and jim are on guard lord dunlone is above and the boy a sterling lad keeps watch at the window mr fern slurred an irrepressible start into a change of position did you speak said mr tuke politely the man muttered something in the nature of a negative oh said the gentlemani thought perhaps you fancied you had put your head into a hornets nest is that you whimple were you successful i cannot find it sir the girl must have concealed it the servant spoke in a strange preoccupied voice he stood in the shadow of the flungback door and from his covert he looked upon the old enemy of his peace with tranced motionless eyes and the expression of one who dreamed a nightmare and woke to find it truth even mr fern showed some embarrassment under the pitiless scrutiny may i speak at last he said uneasily shifting his head so that his glance fell upon the opening of the door i own us bested at every turn mr tukeandheres for you by god the room was lighted only by some candles burning in a sconce within his short reach on the table and by a sudden adroit movement he had thrown these down here he shrieked shrilly and leapt forward and sideways a fiery tooth tore itself through tukes shoulder while an explosion shook the room in one wild instant all was uproar and confusion in the midst of which the groom ran to the hearth and kicked the smouldering logs into a blaze light leapt up and revealed a struggling and swaying block of men down by the door and in the aperture above a dark figure standing irresolute where are the others gasped fern shoot you fool the hoary scoundrel had played his jack to an ace seeing the long shadow of his partner creeping forward in the light of the hall he had assumed him supported by their full force and had struck on the instant his blow was miscalculated brander it seemed was alone the latter stooped forward eagerly a pistol raised in his hand his difficulty was to hit the pigeon and not the crow the flash of indecision cost him dear tuke trailing on his knees fired full at him and the fellow doubled and collapsed on the step like a kinked sandbag fern was under whimple and sir david he struggled like a madman the taut strength of the old villain was amazing the groom was hurrying to help when the baronet spun aside as if he were a child crashed against him and both tumbled on the floor in a heap in the same moment the robber tore his remaining adversary beneath him scrambled up and squatted on the mans legs and his eyes streaked with passion clubbed his discharged pistol to brain him with a desperate effort dennis jerked up his knees and shot the fellow face downwards upon himself once more fern gave a cry like a lashed dog and rolled off and over on to his back the servant had simply held his knife upwards and hurled the other to his own immolation the victor quite maddened and overwrought rose to his knees and crying for my father that you murdered drove his blade over and over again into the quivering body then suddenly he cast the weapon from him and himself upon the boards where he buried his face in his hands and fell crying and sobbing now this was all a matter of a few seconds but the noise had roused the household and steps were heard hurrying down the stairsas sir david and the groom having come to their feet again were all remaking for the combatantswhen the climax of the tragedy broke in a clap of fury to which the prelude had been a whisper for in some quarter of the house a sudden shot rang out and immediately there was a roar like a peal of subterranean thunder and on its heels a hell of clanging and splintering sounds and the explosion of shattered glassand the very floor of the room seemed to yawn and belch forth flame and cloud as if a crater were formed beneath the foundations of the building halfblinded and halfstunned tuke staggered to his feet and stood reeling a monstrous silence succeeded the uproar accented onlyas a spout of black smoke rose to the ceiling and blossomed out there into a great fungus of deathwith falling and tinkling sounds as of glass and dropping plaster then close at hand he heard voices crying to him and he tottered towards them chapter lii captain luvainemisanthrope ascetic wiry as a ferret and disciplined on a drumheadhad fallen asleep at his post no doubt the exhaustion induced by cold hunger and the emotion to which he had lately been subjected was responsible for this lapse into a condition quite humanly natural it was unfortunate for all however and very particularly for the unfortunate gentleman himself that it should have occurred in the place and at the moment most fatal to the cause he had to serve for halfanhourhis pistol cuddled in his left arm as if it were a wakeful babyhe measured his monotonous tramp in the little circumscribed chamber where was situated the priests hole upon a bracket on the wall a single candle burned its flames shrugging peevishly in the cold draught that came through the high grating in the masonry the trap of the vault was thrown open the woodwork lying flat upon the floor but the stone below was swung to upon its pivot and at every recurring wheel in his march he glanced down to see that this stone held its place and that no stealthy pressure was applying to it from the tunnelside for an extreme probability that the rogues would follow in the tracks of their escaped victim no fresh snow having fallen to obliterate them as far as the icehouse in the clearing and would so learn of the existence of the underground passage had led all engaged in the defence of the house to accept this quarter of it as the one most open to attack and therefore to be more jealously watched than any other often the soldier would bend and listen acutely for any least murmur of voices or rustle of secret footstep whispering into the blank deadliness of the pit beneath him he heard nothing was conscious of no sound he could set apart from the distant noises of the house as suspicious and unaccountable yet the voices were there and the footsteps but muffled so completely by the thick stone as to be inaudible to the solitary man above presently he found something irresistibly attractive in the swaying flame of the candle on the wall it was an aspen leaf blown by the wind a certain fever in his blood seemed to temper the cutting draught to the caress of a summer zephyr he was on a breezy common he had known in childhood eagerly hunting over a familiar poplar tree for the moth he remembered all at once it went by the name of the sycamore that lay cunningly hid by day in the furrows of the bark from which in colour it might scarcely be distinguished he put out his hand with a smile staggered on the brink of the pit recovered himself and resumed his tramp with a curse at his own folly but by and by the flame fixed his attention once more tibbie who was she and why should he associate her with the jumping light he remembered all at once it was the queer name of a little scotch girl he had worshipped as a boy she had had hair golden as barley straw and he had begged a curl and had put it in his bible where it was always connected in his mind with the tongues of flame good god how long ago was that and would tibbie give him a curl now if she knew quite suddenly his eyes were thick with tears he pressed his hand to them fiercely and went up and down againup and down what strange caprice of memory was renewing for him these shining ghosts of his past the new emotion with a touch of ancient sorrow in it sang in his brain like restful music standing he leaned against the wall shut his eyesand immediately with a throb and swerve of ecstasy he was asleep mr fern had set his snare with fine tact in his desperation for he had indeed come to that condition he was resolved to win or lose all by a single coup de main his statement of his caseso far as it wentwas unexaggerated his rascal improvidence had provided against no contingencies his gang was mutinous from cold and hungermost of all from the failure of liquorsupply through the impossibility of communicating with mr breeds of the dog and duck baulked by the unexpected return of the master of delsrop baulked in his design to rush the house at the very outset of his daring swoop upon the estate outmanuvred in his attempt to make capital of the hostages that a fickle rogues providence had flung into his arms he must exercise all his diplomacy of scoundrelism to quiet the rebellion that had broken out in his own ranks the discovery of the escape of the prisoners was the critical moment of his authority and it was only when pursuit led to the revelation of the subterranean passage that he found a new argument to the favour of his fellows and to the postponement of the sacrifice of his life to their fury very noiselessly he had in person explored the tunnel and satisfied himself that a guard was stationed at its outlet the trap also so it happened at the time was closed and bolted and it was evident that this must be forced at the crucial moment by means instant and effectual now though he was ignorant of the real numerical strength of the garrison he could not doubt that so obviously weak a position would be strenuously cared for by the enemy a single man indeed properly posted and armed might account for his entire gang one by one as it issued into the pit through the narrow aperture the secret of whose revolving stone he had with superior craft easily unravelled and a mere struggle to force this point was therefore out of the question he would conceive a subtler plan he would himself venture into the stronghold and would engage its defenders in talk while brander and the rest made their silent way under the house to the vaultopening here a bag of powder was to be fastened under the trap and fired by a train run up a stick the sentry would be either killed or disabled by the explosionthe way burst clear for the uprush of his fellows and in the terror and confusion that should ensue he would take the enemy in the rear and complete its demoralization a very pretty plan and a boldbut alas we know what gang aft agley a very significant accident was to frustrate ita characteristic piece of recklessness to hoist him and his with their own petard for as to the latter it would not satisfy the rogues but that they must bring all their store of powder in a barrel along with them as they looked to quarter themselves snugly in fine linen for the night and their ammunition as a precaution must not be left behind and as to the former lo when brander cautiously shifted the stone and looked out there was light shining into the pit and the trap flung open here was a heavy todonothing to blow up and the guard above probably on the alert the rascal motioned his crew to intense silence and dared to creep a step forward into the vault the two that were carrying the powder slung between them softly lowered the barrel a little back from the entrance and all stood waiting brander cocked his flapless ears dead quiet reigned above and about him he dreaded he knew not what ambush and the suspense was intolerable desperately he took his courage in hand and climbed out of the pit in the dim and gusty light he thought the place deserted for luvaine leaned asleep in a dark angle of the wall and was not readily distinguishable to a rapid survey he was on the point of summoning his men to the surface when something in white that flitted by the doorway and paused and looked in caught his eye he gasped hesitated and followed in pursuit was it a snare there was a pregnant silence about the place that peopled every corner with watchful eyes he felt the sweat under his clothes and a fright of superstition in his heart as he came softly out of the chamber the phantomshape was speeding before him suddenly it turned nodded to him put a finger to its lips and again sped on his hand closed rigidly on his pistolbutt his teeth clipped an oath of fury he had recognized herthe mad girl that had evaded his clutches she had escaped from the stable it seemed and was mounting to her eyrie she went lightly up the stairs and for an instant a great longing seized him to follow and kill her then all in a moment the danger of his position rushed upon him in the act of turning to retreat however he became conscious of the sound of voices issuing from a room down the passage at the further end of which he was standingvoices and amongst them that of his leader immediately he was impelled to creep thither inform himself of the state of affairs and make his plans accordingly a pistolshot from an unexpected quarter through the brain of the master of the house and the situation might resolve itself without any larger appeal to violence he stole forward and went to his fate luvaine came to himself with a shock something had rung out and there was a distant flurry of shouting in his ears he started forward amazed at his own abuse of the trust committed to him with eyes yet clouded with the fumes of sleep he looked down into the vault one of the irresolute company a little bolder than his fellows to solve the reason of the inaction that had befallen and of the noise that suddenly swooped down upon them was crept out into the pit but seeing the face staring down he redived for his burrow like a rat it was his jump that sprung the mine the soldier his aim like a drunken mans snapped up his muzzle and fired at the retreating figure there followed a monstrous burst of flamea booming crashand he was blown against the wall like a leaf and his spine broken shrieking in his agony he fell tearing with his nails at the boards of the floor then a merciful oblivion came to him and the convulsion of his limbs relaxed in whatever position they had assumed and he lay sprawled and breathing out his life his ball had pierced the powderbarrel and the fate of the wretches crowded in the tunnel was a thing to recognize and forgetif one could chapter liii during a period of supreme trial sir david showed himself a man of courage and resource the appalling thunder of the explosion the vision of the fiery upheaval of the floor were still in his ears and eyes when he leapt to the immediate necessity of action and of his taking the situation by the throat tuke was disabledhis servant halfinsane with hysteria somebody must rally the household and quickly for though the dense pall of smoke that choked the room fitful fires were winking and blossoming and it was evident that the place was alight in more than one quarter it was no time to marvel or speculate over the nature of the wild catastrophe that had occurred his interest at the outset was to secure the escape of every inmate of the house and he plunged into the hall with a shrieking summons to man and maid to make for the passage into this heavy clouds of gaseous vapour were rolling from its further end their direction seeming to point to the locality of the explosion he ran to the frontdoor tore open the fastenings and flung a way into the freezing cold of the outer night then he rushed back and repeating his summons made for the stairfoot here he met them coming down pellmellchoking sobbing feeling their way in mad terrormen women and the one boy what was it what had happened his sister flung herself into his arms imploring to be saved dunlone quaking and white as a turnip shook out curses of impotent frenzy the maids cried and gabbled volubly and even the boy was moved to some shrill expression of inquiry as to the cause of so stupendous a bang the little baronet silenced and marshalled them all he led thempreceded by one loving soulshivering and shrieking down the passageinto the open air and there against a snowdrift he left them and fled back to his duty not an individual thank godsave those already accounted forwas injured he came upon the master faint and stumbling in the hall on one side the faithful groom supported him on the other a poor girl received his weight she this pathetic maid looked dumbly at the rescuer wistful as a shorn lamb what can you do to this her eyes said they might have yearned as those of her the mother of the cripple that was brought to jesus help him outside he said with compassion in his voice he did not know that here his quarrel with his friend was pitifully resolved through the now ruddy fog he went down into the room of death brander lying in his agony at the stepfoot cried to him to save him from a horrible fate the worthy first he said sternly and could have found it in his heart to pity the poor wretch for the despairing moan he vented but it was whimple he hunted for and shrieked to and whose prostrate form he at length stumbled upon what are you doing here he yelled do you want to be grilled like a herring let me burn and cleanse my hands the poor fool cried up no water will wash them you madman you struck for your life and revenged your master my god is he dead the man got to his feet in the terror of the thought is he dead he whispered awfully his ghastly face pressed forward nobut hes hurthes hurt and theres another to pull from the fireluvaine that my mind misgives me lies at the source of this trouble youll come man and help me with him if hes alive yes yeslife oh show me where i can do something to save it he stumbled blindly after the other and he gave out a heavy groan as he passed by the inanimate bundle on the floor bloody jack fern showed his right title to the adjective but it was obvious he was gone beyond considerations of rescue the draught drawn into the burning house had for the moment a little thinned the smoke in the passage they took advantage of the respite and plunged for the rearward chamber where they assumed the victim must lie the misty lightnings flashed from the blazing room were their only lamps of guidance for the crash had extinguished or overturned every taper in the lower part of the building and a reeling darkness added to the horror of the situation fortunately dennis was familiar with every stone of the old grange and he led sir david who clung to his coatskirt with an unerring instinct but at the very entrance of the vault they stumbled over some dbris and recovering themselves and moving forward again down they clumped upon a flap of shattered woodwork and near rolled into a black yawning mouth that breathed a sick vapour at them blythewood raised himself cautiously on his hands luvaine he yelled where are you man luvaine luvaine no sound of answer came back to them but listening intently they were in a moment aware of a little breathing moan against the wall in their neighbourhood hes there by the lord said sir david in a suppressed voice when come again with difficulty to their feet they followed the whispered clue to the poor broken creature and tried to shift him he pattered out such a delirium of torment that they must refrain from the effort to bear him out in their arms but they made a sling of whimples coat and getting him into this as best they could they took it between them and treading with infinite care accomplished their escape from that veritable trap of death returning to the passage they found this to be filled anew with driving volumes of vapour and a great increase of roaring and flaming sounds to proceed from the dininghall but they passed the danger at a scamper looking thereinto as they fled by at a rising sea of fire that leapt up the walls in pointing waves and fell and spread abroad and leapt again and from the threshold step over which in his terror he had managed to struggle his halfparalyzed arms brander screamed to them and prayed to their mercy with knotted hands and at the last they saved the scoundrel when the heat smote upon their faces like scourges of nettle and the smoke plugged their throats and they laid him down in the snow a little apart from the rest and paused at length and wiped their sooty brows and breathed in the frost as if it were perfumed sunlight now were all accounted for but the bitter night must take much that the fire had spared unless they could win to some cover they stood there under a fat drift piled against a tree on the lawnto the shelter of which men and women had forced and beaten a passagethey stood a poor homeless group with their wounded laid on coats amongst them and watched the processes of a new enemy they were powerless to control and as the fury of flame leapt from window to window crossed by luminous shadows as though fiends were ransacking the building for the little household treasures that are dear to sentiment cries and exclamations of pity rose involuntarily from the lips of all and some of the women wept and called upon the men for the love of god to return and rescuewhat they did not know but in truth it was the children of their imagination but suddenly a more real questioning terror was passing amongst them the girldardawhere was she in the stable murmured tuke from the ground his head was pillowed upon bettys shoulder but for very shame the girl would have stripped off her skirt to wrap it about his frozen feet they were risen above the petty conventions of behaviour these two in the shadow of pain of death they had failed of touch with the particular proprieties and they clung together like sworn lovers and defied the world and at least for the moment their attachment was respected of all for the most paltry natures find life in its tragedies a little unadaptive to their rules of social conduct now at the word of horror dennis started forward with a cry of agony his sisterhis poor mindless charge that he should have been so lapped in his own selfish misery as to forget her he had thought in his stunned mind that she had been amongst the women how could she be when he had himself witnessed her removal to the stables he struggled off across the snow followed by the tireless william angela placed and supported between her brother and dunlone shrieked faintly after him the girl must be held in durancesomewhere in a place of safety she should die were she brought again into her neighbourhood blythewood soothed her distress she should be well protected he swore the lord coming somewhat to himself and perhaps relieved to be escaped under whatever conditions from that abode of brigands cursed the lady under his breath for a little pretty whimperingand was half moved to slide his arm about her waist he withheld that condescension however for the present the two men were seen to reach the stablesto force after some strenuous effort the door of the coachhouse from the gap made by them the terrified deer broke forth and scattered in all directions some sprang into drifts and were lost some huddled against the wall afraid to venture further one or two came stumbling and leaping in the foottracks and ran up bleating very humanly for protection to those superior animals who could not find it for themselves and now ensued a period of intense anxiety and emotion for minutes passed and the rescuers did not reappear and with incredible speed rushing like a bloodwanton dog amongst a flock of sheep the fire seized room after room and worried it and raced on roaring until the whole building was involved and young shoots of flame sprouted from the roof and grew and flourished in a moment like burning aloes and the heat waxed intense from the first indeed no least hope of checking the conflagration had suggested itself the old dry interior of the building caught as if all its solidity were so much illusion of lath and canvas and the watersupply was frozen to a minimum quite suddenly the little group made one mouth of a low moan of horror upon the north parapet of the roof a figure had come outthat of the missing girl she stood beside a chimneystack whither the flames had not yet reached and in the shaking glare she was as visible to all as though it were sunlight she carried it seemed a bag of some sort in her hand and she made no gesture of fear but in an instant as a fountain of fire rose behind her scattering sprays of sparks she was dancing and kissing her hand to her own shadow on the chimneystack then they saw that the two men were come out of the stable and were standing beneath calling frantically up to the mad creature and she bent and looked down upon them while sobs and cries broke from the watching women and the men breathed hard her brother it was evident was beseeching her to throw herself as her one chance into a thick drift that lay beneath and she could be seen to nod to him and to point exultantly to the bag on her arm but in the act it slipped from her grasp and fell and at once she fled after it plunging from the parapet like a swimmer into the snow she went as if it were foam and flakes of the frozen crust of the drift span up and were flung against the wall and the pent burden of the spectators found its shrill vent once more and was lowered to sighs of pity as the two were seen coming across the snow with a limp shape looped between them she had dived and over the brink of cocytus she had gone to the shades that were ever her kinsfolk when they looked at her they saw a smile on her mouth but her hair hung slack as if the flame of her soul was withdrawn from it she was reasonable at last and to make her so just this had been neededto snap her slender neck like a lilystalk when by midnight the great fire was died down to a cinderous glow gasping and winking amongst walls of slag the sad onlookers were moved pathetically to see the purple vault above them all embroidered with stars the clerestory of the trees hung with them the white pavement ghostly in their radiance the candles of the vast cathedral whose tapering walls are the cone of the earths own shadow were lit and the voiceless anthems of peace rose in the dreaming sighs of half the world the flames checked by the stone passage and rising straight and clear in a windless night had spared the stables and thither at the last they all bent their footsteps bearing the dead and the wounded with them my lord my lady tom and dick and mollthere they were fain to camp amongst the muck and litter left by the fallowdeer and the frost pinched them sadly and hunger even and for the sick thirst and never did reluctant day so dawdle in the east chapter liv from a deadening of all his faculties of all his perceptives to stupor from stupor to a delirium of weariness in which so little as a ring on his finger was a conscious burden from weariness to fever and a recrudescence of those mental and bodily pains he strove so frenziedly to forget from this state at last to the yielding stage of exhaustion and tuke the man not so much hurt as overwrought fell into a profound slumber and got his restoration of it for long before this came he was aware only of a close darknessa darkness that seemed a cabined horror of himself were it not assured and comforted by a presence that in supreme moments of torture he grew to know he could depend upon for pitiful help and a silent passion of sympathy this presence swift and invisible was always at hand when he most needed itsoothing murmuring taking upon itself the responsibility of questions he could not answer brushing away with snowflakes the stinging wasps that settled on his shoulder it was so prompt so gentle so full of resource that he came to think that if he could only put to it the supreme problem that vexed him beyond endurance it would resolve it at once with a quiet laugh and so secure him everlasting peace but whenever he came to the point of explanation he found that the problem itself had eluded him and he could not remember what road it was that his tired brain had gone astray on at length ceasing to struggle he floated inanimate on the tide against which he had fought to make head and was borne by it into a haven of rest he woke to find himself lying on the ground in a queer little chilly chamber into which a weak light filtered through a cobwebbed window looking up in some pleasure of languor he was interested in certain straps and buckles that hung from wooden brackets and a couple of odd bonnetshaped things that stuck out from the wall lazily he amused himself by associating these with twenty different uses untilreason passing from the fields of romance into the highroadhe came in a moment to the knowledge that he was lying in his own harnessroom and to memory of all that had brought him there in the shock of revelation he struggled to a sitting posture and uttered a startled little pipe it was no great sound but it was enough to bring a certain bird to its wounded mate she came in shut the door behind her and hurrying to him knelt down and threw her arms round his neck and cried joyful tears her pretty plumes were ruffled her eyes clouded with the weariness of long watching but she was ten times woman for her blouzed appearance and he would not have had her one draggled wisp of hair the neater why betty i am welland what a fainting miss to succumb to a scratch indeed it is an angry wound and you were worn and sick we are houseless my girlnothing but the cold fields to nest in you have your arms about a man of snow and he melts in their warmth ah me you plucked me from the fire but to burn yourself you are a man of passion rather and you overbear your foolish maid and are you ruined dear i would be joyful to know it that i might work for you and die for you he laughed a little why said he the house is gone to be sure and all my trouble with it i hope and i have that of the vagabond in me that i think i feel the freer for the loss of so responsible a property but i have enough for us yet maybe to make out life withal and we will een look about us betty for mr rogerss cot by a willowy brook and will the gentleman let it to us that he will i swear for i have met him at whitelaws with his dry face sunk in a green tabinet kerchief of the nicest mode that meant more to him ill warrant than all the green pastorals he ever invented but have i slept the night through my wench and is our hearth cold that was to have leapt to my wifes homecoming it was piled too high betty and i have given you a roasting welcome and what are we to do now or how escape from these beggarly quarters why for shame are you fit to move but sir david blythewood is abroad already with the men to see if they cannot fashion a raft or sled is it called of planks to draw over the freezing snow and carry us all to his own great house he is an admirable creature theregive me your soft shoulder girl and i will talk with my eyes shut for my brain spins like a top where are the rest and pray god all are sound ah you dont rememberthe poor captain luvaine is he hurt he cannot livenot many hours more sir david and i have watched with him all night he has suffered but he is at peace now for he is dead poor soul below the waist twas in shooting at the wicked men that tracked us through the tunnel that he made the explosion for mr brander says they would bring powder along with them in a barrel and brander is the rogue spared then when an honest soldier falls he is sore wounded but he will recover perhaps an idle rally that shall earn him the gallows and so they came by the hole after all and were caught in their own springe he hath a soldiers death and tell me that is all betty ah nothe girl i rememberi remember that she sprang from the roof yes and she is dead a pitiful account for a dump of red crystal how much blood yet will it absorb before its lust is quenched my heart cries for the unhappy child but something comes to me betty that i think i have struggled for through a fever of hours you must go no no oh dont bid me away from you tush you simple tis but a yard or two and to ask of dennis the bag the poor natural threw down for i heard the women cry it i will ask him he is with the captain yonder why it loathes me but i have a shadowy idea and i must act the part of an honest man though it were to give the stone a new lease of devilry and dennis is there you say in the coachhouse where the sad captain lies and mr brander over against him by the further wall and where are the rest the maids and miss royston are in the loft she sleeps on the straw the pretty tired lady like a flower that has fallen with the cut corn and the lord for he would not have nay has a stall below to himself he is fitly housed and have you filled him the manger with dead thistles go betty gofor i shall never be at peace till this about the bag is resolved when he was alone once more he sank back and yielded himself to bewildering dreaming here it seemed the second phase of his life ended and the third was to begin what should be its nature he could not nor would he contemplate the possibility of a selfresurrection to conditions similar to those he had left behind indeed he had no doubt whatever that his circumstances were totally inadequate to a rebuilding of his ruined property and what would a houseless estate be worth to him or to any one else but apart from that question he felt himself quit of all desire to reaccommodate his innate wildness to the humdrum existence of a country squire rather a hundred times would he settle with his dear mate in some remote pasture by woods and waters and dig his own potatoes and bake his own loaves for the little mouths that should nibble at them by and by to reverse a familiar image he had been a butterfly he had been a grub and now he would fain be a caterpillar feeding on the green leaf and taking the sun and the rain as his animal prerogatives then he found himself with an ardent longing to repudiate for once and for all his fathers scornful bequest to heal him of his wound and shake the dust of delsrop from his feet and holding his loves hand to set his face to the wind and to the hills and walk on and away but how then could he rent his cot or how feather it for those prospective nestlings it all worried and confused his weakened brain he would put it to bettybetty upon whose sympathy he was learning to depend as something very sweet and personal to himself he opened his eyes to find her standing beside him that very pink and white bag that had caught his attention at the lodge swung in her hand he brought it in last night she said and here it is untouched he asked me very humbly when he might see you for he is lost and broken though he does his duty like a man with such a constitution to act as he hath acted is to outman us all good lord is the thing stuffed fit to burst with the poor creatures curiosities whatever her mishaps she must save those it seems empty them out betty on the floorhere pellmell beside me and i will test the value of my surmise bah frogs and sloughed skins and bones a loathsome collection and she was like a flaming dryad of the woods here is a rats skull and here he paused gave out a hard breath and suddenly struggled to get to his feet the girl flew to him what are you at she cried oh you will hurt yourself his face was pale and bore a startled look help me up he muttered nay wench i musti must tis here the villainous thing in my hand he held open his palm a chalky lump was in ita worthlesslooking fragment what is that but rubbish she said rubbish why so it is betty but tis the rubbish fools strangle one another to possess i must go to him the dying man i was right it has lain there thrown away while we were cutting throats he must see it and know it before he passes good god betty betty i must go to him i say he was so wild and impatient in his efforts to rise that she bent all trembling to help him as the wiser policy and will you be sick again she said and break my heart i should be sick to remain therei am up and steady give me your fine firm arm betty and lead me to his bed very slowly and shakily he made his way to the coachhouse but when he was come there he stood erect almost without support and took in the melancholy scene dennis white and haggard started up from a stool on which he was seated beside a rough pallet stretched on the ground but his master put a finger to his lips and motioned him to silence then he went and sat himself down on the vacant seat and looked upon the stricken man luvaine he said softly the dying soldier stirred and gave out a little moan his face was so scorched and disfigured with gunpowder as to be hardly recognizable and all the upper part of his body was swollen to grotesque proportions but the coat that had been drawn over his paralyzed lower limbs lay as flat as though nothing but its natural folds raised it from the floor luvaine said tuke again can you hear me as he spoke the door was opened and sir david entered he looked a fagged and worn little man but a light of bantam heroism glinted in his eyes tuke he exclaimed in astonishment i have slept blythewood and have found a little of myself again there is something more i have foundhush man the stone great god he closed the door and came forward gasping the stone he said in a hoarse whisper tuke nodded hush he murmured again he hears i think betty knelt pitifully beside the sufferer her breath was like balm on his poor battered face his eyes turned to her with a pathetic gratitude that was moving in the extreme they heard him murmuring to her thickly and brokenly she hath been an angel to his torments whispered sir david all the long night she hath never ceased to care for him and he follows her with his eyes till the tears of both make a veil between she can read his least desire as betty turned her head and looked up he is speaking he wants you to listen both men stooped to catch the muttered words it is found i knew before you spoke i knew its discovery at the last would find me herehere on the ground the curse of the predestined is unfulfilment let me look at the wicked talisman that is soaked in the blood of martyrs let me look i say tuke leaned over and placed the infernal pebble splotched and overlaid as he had recovered it in the groping hand the fingers closed convulsively on it the eyes of the dying were fixed questioning you would have me say how it came to light heall the watchers looked round with a start against the further wall a deathly shape was risen upon its elbowbrander gasping and shaking and holding his hand to his wounded chest he nodded frantically as if he would say go on it had fallen out to the bottom of the bag in which the skull was placed for removal this bag the girl darda had used it seems for transporting her relics to the lodge the rogues found it there and collected firewood in it darda when she escaped must have pulled out the sticks returned her treasures to the bag and brought all home with her still those possessions in her poor life that represented most to her she must carry them with her when she leapt from the parapet and to me this moment the bag was brought packed as she had left it through all this lust of violence and misery the stone hath remained unguessed at where it dropped from the socket of the skull and while the scoundrels yonder were gnashing and whetting their teeth there it lay in their midst within reach of all and not a man might buy himself with the knowledge an hours surcease of the hell to which he was condemned he turnedhe could not help itwith an air of irrepressible triumph to the wounded wretch away from him a fierce mockery of the creatures impotent malice was on his lips but nobility prevailed and he forbore to express it for a moment brander stared at him as if he would have bartered his last chance of life for a loaded pistol in his hand then with a rending groan he went flat upon his straw pillow and turned his face to the wall a silence of some minutes succeeded while the dying man twisted the shapeless lump feebly in his fingers then all at once he was speaking again and his voice gathered strength over the painful syllables kithless and alone predoomed to a curse and conquered by it at the last what chance has ever been minewhat hope to escape the ambush laid for me the love of woman he slewed his head about with its melancholy burning eyes and his gaze dwelt upon the girl beside him the love of woman he moaned faintly what might it have made of me i was debarred from that and all by a foul inheritance the sins of the fathersthe sins of the fathers again a silence fell but of a sudden with a convulsive effort he had forced himself up sitting and leaned upon one hand was devouring the stone with a great hunger of vision a life of torment for a minute of ecstasy he cried in a strong voice and who shall accept the heritage now to his undoing is there any fool in the world invites the curse luvaine said sir david gently let me take the vile thing and hurl it into the sea the dying man looked at him with a strange stare because it has been the sport of devils shall we discard its infinite possibilities of good it is the meansthe means if somewhere we can find the instrument betty with her loving womans instinct to pity and relieve had put her arm about the trembling shoulders to support them now luvaines head fell back upon that tender pillow and a rare smile flickered on his tortured mouth to line the cot for the little piping nestling to nurse it to rich comfort and train it to be noble and generous and true to convert this wickedness into a blessingtake it my child and with it the last gratitude of this poor foundered wreck the girl looked up frightened at the others no no no she whispered in a tearful voice i cannot childwoman would you deny me this ray of light into the black pit of my doom the scale is all weighted down on one side what shall i have to set against the fearful load they are pinioning me nowmy god i am called to the question sir david came forward swiftly took the gem from the nerveless hand and placed it in bettys a sigh quivered up from the soldiers lips he gathered all he could of breath for a last effort i call those present to witness he cried that i edward luvaine do here on my deathbed make free gift of the ruby called the lake of wine to betty pollack he sank back and spoke never again in a few minutes the deathagony was on him it was brief but so convulsive while it lasted that when he was fallen stiffly to rest they had to fasten his left arm down with a ligature to bring him to some composure of attitude then the girl seeing the others desired to talk begged them to leave her alone with the dead while they went outside for that her heart was full of tears and she would pray mercy on the poor sinner they went sombrely and stood without at a little distance in the snow it would scarce be decent to congratulate you said blythewood gravely indeed sir i am not sure it would or that it is at all a subject for congratulation at any rate compliments on such can hardly be exchanged by us you are bitter and you have very full cause i spoke once before without book and now it seems angel and dunlone have an understandin give me your hand man and frankly im sorry why i could ha wished it was you by my soul and what was my rudeness then but a lefthanded compliment my lady viscountess will grace any position she condescends to cried tuke enthusiastically and the two men shook hands then and there and now said blythewood we have been experimenting with a sledge of our own manufacture and i make no doubt we can transport the whole party to chatters before the day is out tuke a weary ghost of himself that bodily hurt and mental emotion still would not spare was returned from inspecting sir davids travelling contrivance as he pushed open the door of the stable he saw that that drove the blood upon his heart and paralyzed him voice and limbs so that he stood like a man of stone betty still knelt her face buried in her hands beside the dead soldier but crawled silently to within touch of herby what desperate disciplining of suffering who might tellwas the wounded brute that but a few minutes earlier was extended helpless apparently and near to dying against the further wall now as brander saw the door swung back he raised himself on one hand a short knife poised in the other and in his eyes was an expression of such devilish triumph as turned the soul of the wretched onlooker sick the blade whipped aloftthe arm of the dead man sprung up and struck the murderer a backhanded blow full in the face his knife rattled on the boardshe gave a screech of terror and rolled grovelling and as tuke the horrible spell broken bounded to his love and caught her fluttering to his arms sir david and the others rushed into the stable with pale faces and the how when and what of startled men now when all was explained and the halfconvulsed ruffian tied up with little regard to his comfort it was vain to try and convince betty that the illsecured ligature had snapped fortuitously releasing the hard arm like a spring and marvellously enough at the opportune moment and that her safety was due to an accident but said she the dead struck for his own and because he had dedicated that to good uses and now i will take the poor mans trust and try to acquit me of it so that he shall have peace in his grave for i owe him that at least for my life and with the words she put her arms around her mans neck before them all and that so that she might hide the tears she could not repress for she was much and for many reasons overcome and what said tuke with a smile have you done with the trust betty why said she i slipped it under my garter chapter lv well cried creel you have sown your wild oats and reaped a whirlwind and now at last is the calm and you shall sit under your figtree and grow fat never my old friend we shall come and go like the swallows and build under the eaves of the world aye aye and rear a brood at every visit no doubt well you have realized well on the famous stone and can indulge a whimsey or so and you can afford to waive title to the estate and encumber me with a property i neither covet nor care for but you are wise no doubt and maybe you have that of the gamblers instinct left you to know when the luck hath turned and if anything will convince me it has sir robert it is in the fact that that one rogue was spared for the gallows and to give evidence against himself in a near incredible story which he did with so fine a tact of villainy as to startle virtuous truth out of conceit with itself mr creel brander was not the first that missed his vocation of attorney a stale witticism sir robert that has its origin in the unreasoning petulance of unsuccessful litigants yet what man blames his broker that he takes his percentage equally in a good or bad speculation why i spoke the common cant thoughtlessly sir and only aimed at a laugh i would ennoble all lawyers for your sake well well and so the man whimple goes abroad with you i would not part with him for a fortune sir david blythewood offered to take him into his service but ah i hear that gentlemans halfsister is pledged to a coronet she will bring it lustre he rose and the attorney with him the old grey eyes of the latter looked kindlily over their glasses and what are your plans said he to travel for a year maybe while our garden is maturing the garden that is in the green hollow out of the world god make it fruitful for you and is lady linne pleased with her newfound title she is a woman of very women sir and all grace i offer her is but repayment of a loan of her own advancing well indeed you are very much in love by way of grace miss royston rose to meet her brother in the candlelight a really superb collect of diamonds sparkled on her white bosom are they not ravishing she said and is not dunlone a princely suitor why he cannot do credit to his own selection with niggardliness you are always grudging in your acknowledgment of his condescension brotheryes condescension sir for all your little flippant nose and simplicity in a smock may be a very engaging thing but i vow i prefer it in a coronet rank madam is but the guinea stamp then i would be the guineahen and you may go if you will to the barndoor for your partner angel the stones are very fine what a storm in a teacup dunlone knows where to lay out his property to the best advantage and i swear your white skin pays a pretty interest on his investment this might have been designed for a compliment the incensed lady was not to be appeased you may swear she said but not in my company this last year is responsible for more than one change to a coarseness of sentiment in you though being the impressionable child you are i do not wonder she turned with an acid smile to a little table hard by here she said is the latest intelligence of a country neighbour of yours that you once studied to take your cue from you mean tuke of course what about him why only that his hoyden hath presented him with an heir to his profligacyand she read out from a current copy of the ladys magazine the following announcement october the lady of sir robt linne bart of a son i congratulate them with all my heart said blythewood fervently miss angela looked at him with a stare of infinite scorn you were present at the wedding i think said she you know i was and you made quite an ingenious little speech to the mayday bride and her jackinthegreen or clownwhich was it and i think you got tipsy which was the best compliment you could have paid her i dare sayi dare say andwell what then what then sir why only that i think sir robert linne should have kept his wifes name out of an advertisement pooh she takes her husbands status and she is a noble wench by george and will never bring him to shame or he her of course said miss angelaand davy tis time you put on your pinafore and went to play in the nursery and here ends the storyso far as it relates to the

that fallen house that superstition must still be peopling with spectres they are gone now the ruins when the historian last saw them a profound silence reigned within the broken walls a riot of
