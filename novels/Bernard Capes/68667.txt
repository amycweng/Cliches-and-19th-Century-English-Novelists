imagination the world the unconscious self delusion of a spirit everything springs from love and love is the dreaming god two figments of that endless sweet obsession stood alone high on a slope of alp this time born of a dream to flesh they thought they owed themselves to flesh a sacred debt truth seemed as plain to them as pebbles in a brook which lie round and firm for all their apparent shaking under ripples there actual to their eyes were the white mountains the hoary glaciers the pine woods and foamy freshets of eighteenth century le prieur here actual in the ears of each was the whisper of the deathless confidence which for ever and ever helps on loves succession they loved and therefore they lived man has been for ten thousand ages at the pains to prove love a delusion and still he greets a baby and a kitten and the nesting song of birds and a hawthorn bush in flower as freshly as if each in its latest expression were the newest product of his wisdom but love is no delusion save in the shadows which it builds itself for habitation of dust thou art said the older god and unto dust returnest yet man does not inherit from the earth but from the imagination of that which created the earth and its life the brain of the dreaming love nor has he once in all his ons of sequence touched or borrowed from the earth the seed which is himself was his mothers seed herself the seed of another who contained his seed within his mothers seed within herself a nest ad infinitum womb within womb myriadfold he proceeds from love his flight a heavenly meteors his origin the origin of the star which has never been of earth until it falls extinguished on it he draws from the eye of the dawn he is the top section in a telescope of countless sections each extending from the other and all from all and the last from the first close it and it is he open it and it is he he helps to loves view of the dream of which he is a part he is loves heir in dreams or call him a bubble which rises in deep waters and floats a moment on the surface and breaks whence came he whither vanishes he is a breath the expiration of a dream the spirit of him looks out upon its phantom journey as a traveller gazes from a coach window on the landscape he is within it but not of it his destination is death which is loves sleep he is reclaimed to love of whom he was always a thought as a thought he can never be launched again he has played his part and is at rest in love but his part while he played it was loves part it was when he realised this most that the palpable world became a shadow the solid ground a cloud the sun and moon and hills but figments of a rapture of loves dream it was then that he stepped exalted knowing his fair succession knowing of whom he was born and for what reason he had been accredited loves representative so the man felt it here walking on air the mountains were more real to him than the rock he stood on he dealt in dreams paradoxes i have never lived till now he said there was a little wind abroad which fluted in the pines making sharp notes of their fragrance ones ears and nose were always at a conflict in the matter whether to claim music for perfume or perfume for music it was the same as to the battle between sun and snow which fought to a compromise on the terms of chilly warmth or glowing coldness yet the name was of no importance in the bracing sweetness of the atmosphere they contrived together one could not breathe there and think of breathing as a condition of life the temperature was the temperature of a neutral ground between earth and heaven of a present unreality and a real distance the two had just issued in company from a hillside chapel a little lonely ark stranded on a shelf of rock hung up in a pine thicket with rills of water tinkling all about it like the last streaks of a receded flood they had sent forth their unreturning dove and had followed it to find their phantasm of a new world budding in green islands from a lake of mist their feet seemed to sink in eternity only the bright heavens above them were actual a butterfly like a flake of stained glass blown from the robe of the christ in the little painted window within came wafted after them as they emerged from a loophole in the presbytery above the face of the old sacristan leered out secretly and marking their going grinned and apostrophised it in a fit of silent laughter you shant have him you shant have him thought he like the very sacristan of st annes chapel under the hinne mountain of whom children read then they vanished in the mist going upwards and he sat down to chuckle as they ascended the vapour sank beneath their feet or was rolled away like bales to topple over the precipices it had all been clear enough bright palpable fact before they entered the chapel the swift change was nothing surprising in these resting places of the clouds yet it seemed to them as if returning to their world they found it transformed beyond all precedent but then was not their rapture beyond all precedent none had ever before loved as they loved and that was true because there is no such thing as a stereotype in nature the whistle of a marmot straight ahead on a boulder startled them suddenly as into a self consciousness of guilt they saw an atom of mist cleave and close to the red flick of him as he vanished and then the phantoms of mountains looking in upon them above the place where he had sat it was like a priestly summons to loves shrift they stopped as by one consent and stood in scarlet confusion to falter out their confessions first love i think must reveal itself to fervent catholics as these two were in a more poignant form than to most others the wonder of it as a divine absolution for shamefaced thoughts as a divine authorisation of those thoughts indulgence to a natural end must thrill their most sacred traditions of virginity to the marrow then they must first realise on its human merits the sacrifice of the christ who died that men might live they have worshipped the transubstantiation apart now they are bidden to an intimate share in it that perhaps was why this man and woman were justified in feeling their state an ecstasy unparalleled love to them was a transubstantiation such as no heterodox soul could ever know they to whom flesh had been a shame were authorised in a moment of nakedness they were surrendered for their faith to the paradise of mortal raptures henceforth dear incarnations of a dream they believed they owed themselves to flesh while they trod on air young god and goddess certainly they looked poised on their misty ida the man was cream pink of face sunny of hair blue and a thought prominent of eye a fervour of soul perpetually flurried his cheek flushing or paling it in flying moods he had the air and appearance of an eager evangelist who had a little outgrown his spiritual strength he would sometimes overbalance on self exaltation and pitch into an abyss of depression he was tall and well moulded as a whole but his hips were unduly feminine his colour too erred on the feminine side of prettiness but he looked all in all a fit bright mate for the happy figure beside him she as like a dresden china shape in melting demureness as sunnily contrived in pink and blue and gold was only the others better partner by reason of eyes slightly bluer than his of hair a shade more golden of lips of a rosier dye on the soft pallour of her face by the same token she stood as much nearer to womanhood as he stood from manhood a step either way it swelled in her though she was but fifteen as the milk kernels swell in nuts i think she was at the perfect poise largeness in promise waiting on performance shapely as psyche when first stolen by love a covetable bud whom no mortal man could be above the desire to open with a kiss as this man this good man in a fury of love sanctified desired suddenly and uncontrollably she stood before him her face a little raised her lips a little parted the prettiest figure between tears and rapture her hat hung on her shoulders by a blue ribbon looped about her neck leaving her hair loose coiled to snare the sun her dress was a fine smock having half sleeves tied at the elbows with ribbons and a low bodice of rich blue velvet open and laced in front to clasp it about the middle from her hips fell in a fluting of greek folds a white skirt just long enough to show her ankles and silver shoe buckles and there were blue velvet ribbons fastened with diamond studs on her wrists so she stood gazing up at him tremulous and fearful unknowing but half guessing what she had brought upon herself what outrage on her meek decorum the shrine she had most cherished held most sacred was threatened somehow and god it seemed was on the side of the enemy for had not this mans piety sincere beyond question been his passport a divine one to her heart how could she have allowed his advances else they were friends of but a few weeks had met first in the chapel hard by bent upon a common worship some accident of stress in storm had been his pretext for a self introduction and she she had loved the pretext because in this figure she had come to picture her ideal of virtuous manhood and then words had wakened knowledge and knowledge admiration and admiration rapture the desire of the moth for the star he had not spoken of love till this moment he did not even speak of it now but all in an instant he leapt to the appeal of her lips and was fighting for their surrender to him she struggled a little uttering no sound and presently he conquered then speech came breathless and imploring forgive me what have i done i have done wrong my god i couldnt help it he was the one to break away she stood motionless white as a figure of wax yolande he cried dont look at me like that say you forgive me she did not stir but her lips moved did you do wrong o and i thought you knew i knew he caught at his storming pulses and took a new step towards her but at that she backed from him no she said if you have done wrong if for one moment you think you have done wrong you must not stay here not with me any longer understanding came to him no i do not think it he said why should i unless to dream of my being worthy of you was a presumption but that is too late an apology now yolande will you marry me she gave a sigh of heavenly rapture and came and put her sweet hand trustingly into his o yes louis if god will let me he cried amen and caught her to him again in an ecstasy why should he not my bird my love my dear dear angel he must speak through my father first he laughed in triumphant confidence your father ah yes but i do not come empty handed not altogether it is little enough dear sweet to pay this debt but in the worldly view such bargains are relative and the world forgive me has not treated your father according to his deserts she conned his face with trouble in her eyes no she whispered he is poor but he thinks so much of me what if he and you were to disagree as to my value impossible i will admit at once that you are priceless he saw her distress and tightened his hold little rogue he said playfully what is your value in your own eyes what do you put it at the money in your pocket she said smiling faintly i believe that is no more than a couple of soldi i am yours for a penny then give it me do you think i hold myself very dear with that in my purse yes if the king wooed me with half his kingdom i should say not even with the whole i have a greater fortune in louiss penny her lip quivered but alas she sighed it is not kings i dread moved beyond expression he could only strain her to his heart murmuring and adoring look he said presently you are trembling come and rest with me on this stone and set your feet with mine at its base and say to me as i shall say to you here on a rock i plant my love never to be displaced he helped her to the seat then threw himself down beside her and raising his arm was beginning in perfect gravity here on a rock i plant when without the least warning there came a snap and he went backwards heels over head into the grass and lay there kicking like a delirious acrobat some demon of perversity working with a wedge of frost had once split a section of the stone near through and he had sat upon that section the girl shrieked and ran to his help o louis she cried art thou hurt he did not answer with the poet i have got a hurt o the inside of a deadlier sort it is to be feared that both he and his lady were entirely lacking in the sense of humour he arose crestfallen but more mortified in his faith than his vanity the two looked at one another tragically then yolande suddenly burst into tears o she sobbed what were we to liken our love to gods church he has answered our arrogance with a thunderbolt louis you are all dusty and covered with prickles something in my heart tells me that i can never never marry you hush he said desperately we will go back to the chapel and pray for pardon i ought to have looked to the stone first but she only sighed miserably that would have made no difference do you think you are more foreseeing than he he put his hand in his pocket i have lost my soldi he said faintly that was the culmination for an hour these two ninnies of a dream sought vainly in the grass for the missing coins then together but apart they went like lost souls down the mountain verily the laws canonical like the lawyers of westminster thrive on fools chapter i on the day when augias conte di rocco was raised to the marquisate and made a member of the government of victor amadeus iii titular king of sardinia and duke of savoy and piedmont an express was despatched from turin by that newly aggrandised nobleman to the chevalier de france in his htel beausite at le prieur demanding in marriage the hand of the chevaliers only child and daughter yolande of the white hands no more than a day later the brass new marchese in person came treading on the heels of his amorous cartel for indeed that seems the word for it and had his formal interview with the solitary parent for yolande was long motherless this happened in the year when a certain democratic simplicity was beginning to temper the extravagances of fashion monsignore di rocco therefore had that much excuse for his rusty buckles his cheap wisp of a cravat in which a costly diamond burned his hired equipage and single equerry or valet dcurie who was literally his stable boy otherwise as the great man of the neighbourhood and a suitor to boot he might have been accused of that sorriest form of ostentation which is for rank to parade its independence of recognised convention on the other hand m de frances htel was just a decent abode at the southern end of the village rich in nothing but the magnificence of the view from its windows the marchese was already expected and certainly with no delusions as to the manner of his appearance m de france gave no thought to anything but his visitors expression as he advanced to meet him in the little salle daudience into which di rocco had been ushered of the two even the bearing of the chevalier though he was no more than a simple gentleman of savoy was the more overbearing in its self conscious vanity he gave the other stiff welcome and congratulations on his exaltation one would never have guessed that he knew himself very plainly for the mouse sweating and desperate in the claws of the great cunning cat which he took and pressed but the marchese with a high little laugh broke through the proffered formality here here to my breast father in law he cried and seizing strenuously kissed the chevalier on both cheeks verily like a cat in a sort of blood lust the thin white face of m de france pinked as he stepped back his hollow eyes glared his stern lips trembled every fold of his threadbare dressing gown seemed to flatten as if the wind had been taken out of it but an habitual self discipline came to his aid with an acid smile pardon me he said you take me by surprise the term is premature you young men are so impulsive the enormous sarcasm was in itself a confession of surrender he would never have essayed it save in the knowledge of the price he had at hand for acquitting himself of any and all such debts for di rocco was as a matter of fact old as times went a scarred and puffed ex libertine of sixty a monster of unloveliness moreover he was hideous as dagon in truth half man half fish with strained cod eyes a great wobbling jaw and lips which had shaken themselves pendulous on naughtiness and laughter sordid slovenly unclean in mind and body inordinate as a drayman in bulk and physical strength a voluptuary miser and a fecund raconteur his rank and wits had through a well filled life been procurers to his inclinations at a nominal cost to himself his parsimony not his vices had alone debarred him from taking that position in the state to which his wealth and social talents had else easily exalted him at the same time it had always made of him a slumbering force full of interest and potentialities the real power of wealth lies indeed not in expenditure but in possession there is a sacredness about the crowded granary which affects even the starving there is no fool so despised of the democracy as the spendthrift fool and when its time comes it is the plutocrat it bleeds with an apology the conte di rocco possessed the tastes of a sybarite with the soul of a usurer he lit his debauches with candle ends and could singe the paws of his tame cats with a most engaging humour whenever he desired chestnuts for nothing the army of pimps followers led captains and parasites which had always attended his ignoble career cursed him eternally through jaws as lank as those of falstaffs ragged company but it served him nevertheless on the security it would appear of phantom post obits everyone hoped some day to have his picking from the carrion of that great carcase even it may be supposed his physician bonito whose face in the meanwhile was like a cheese paring and it was this paragon grandissimo for all his imperfections who had nominated himself to be the husband of yolande the loveliest young lily of savoy how it came about was thus sated or merely whimsical or perhaps as some said in a sudden mood to withdraw himself timely from the world in order to patch up his old body for heaven the count had about the end of retired upon his estate and grand chteau di rocco on the flegre with the intent it seemed to make it thenceforth his permanent abode here having cashiered or temporised or compromised with or anything but paid off the bulk of his disreputable valetaille he resolved upon the simple life of candle ends and here he made the acquaintance of m de france and his lovely child with the former of whom he was able moreover in some fits of moral reactionism to play the effective usurer the chevalier was a creature of enormous pride though of fortunes fallen to the lowest ebb but he could never forget that his ancestors had lost chambry to the dukes of savoy nor his present despicable position in a state whose highest attentions to him might hardly have compensated for the dignities of which it had deprived his family he had served with credit under the reigning kings predecessor in the wars of the austrian succession yet not with such compelling brilliancy as to enforce recognition from victor amadeus when that prince came to succeed his father neglected impoverished de france had withdrawn from a court whose master was always more concerned with problems of ceremonial than of statecraft and had retired into necessitous oblivion debts contracted in the days of promise came winging paper billets after him and his situation was soon fairly desperate his wife died and he gave her grand ducal obsequies his child must always go attired in the right trappings of her rank he called his villa an htel and his parlour an audience room through everything he was gnawed with an eternal hunger for the recognition which would not come his way he loved his daughter as vain men love their rank holding it supreme above emotion humanity a thing untarnishable but by contact with the base the possibility of a consort for her in le prieur was a thing not to be thought of the fact that she was only fifteen and dowerless was inessential she was yolande de france and then one day old di rocco asked for her hand m de france was not so surprised as sarcastic he knew all about the count and his supposed reformation you would do a final act of atonement monsignore said he and dower a penniless girl i would do more answered the count i would burn those bits of paper of yours the chevaliers eyes glittered but his face remained like hard ivory pardon me he said there is a difference in your ages ah monsieur it would be obliterated when the rivulet mingled with the river you have lived fast the sooner to reach my redemption you are out of favour with the court pouf call it what you mean black disgrace and yet i tell you that i hold its favour in the hollow of my hand the chevaliers eyes glistened more i do not doubt your powers of propitiation else with grateful thanks for the proffered honour exactly you must decline so sinful a connection make it a condition if you will reconciliation with the government and yolande or failure and no yolande i am confident i know myself and others i will be marchese in a week and m de france will have won his first step towards the position from which he has been too long excluded hm moreover he will have acquired a devoted and generous son in law the chevalier smiled whose first act will be to settle the reversion of his entire property on his own widow you are serious and if i decline i shall leave everything including bills acceptances securities all the little pigeons waiting in my casier to be plucked to m gaston trix who is he i am very fond of him they call him also cartouche what does it matter the hawk is not named hawk in every country of the world here he is this there that trix was cartouche in chambry scaramuccio in turin anything elsewhere his mother was english he was born in london his father forgot to leave his address yes i am very fond of him count you have never yet honoured one of the sex with your hand alas it has lacked cleanness he held it out it was obvious he spoke the truth i have been a sad rogue he said it would be useless for me to deny it the chevalier put the confession by rather hastily it would appear that his conscience may have resented its intrusion it is such an advantage after having realised a personal ambition to be able to say i knew nothing of any moral objection until too late but that is just what some queer providence or fatality will never give one the opportunity of asserting he flushed a little and said with a stiff air of demand monsignore what attracts you in my daughter the powerful old rous face became a mere leering slop of roguery there was the picture for anyone who cared to consider it of concupiscence in its dotage he had come in the very exhaustion of his faculties upon an unheard of stimulant of loveliness but sacred and the more appetising for being so any sacrifice was worth to gain this ante room to heaven he felt once more the poignant ecstasies of hunger and thirst he whose sense of surfeit had seemed confirmed to everlastingness there is no need to enlarge upon his state ah monsieur he said can you who live in daily contemplation of such perfection ask believe me the question alone is the riddle the answer possesses a thousand tongues of rapture and adoration would i could speak in them all that i might ease my breast of this load of undelivered homage which stifles it i swear on my honour there is no interpreter between earth and paradise but yolande you will bestow her on me conditionally m de france didnt see or wouldnt see that he was being bribed there is a point of magnificence perhaps above which corruption is elevated to sublimity what earthly sacrifices can approach the gifts with which the gods reward them he actually smiled wintrily but condescendingly on the others enthusiasm well well monsignore he protested what would your ardour say to a compromise there is none possible a betrothal for instance on the conditions you were good enough to suggest i am flattered it goes without saying by your proposal i admit myself distinguished actually and potentially in the connection but the child is but fifteen i can never consent to it it puts ten thousand obstacles of accident and caprice between me and my attainment of beatitude mademoiselle to day is an angel but every feather of her wings so tied would invite the cupidity of worldlings those robbers of the heavenly roost i know them well i must indeed have the first and last right to protect her must count is she yours or mine i have said enough and you i think more than enough his brows and his mouth closed down his vanity could be a very obstinate devil di rocco felt that he had touched his limits ah my friend he pleaded loves best proof of itself is in outrunning discretion i went in truth too far let me hark back to reason i pledge you my credit that within a month my father in law shall be war minister di broglio wearies of his office and waits but for an efficient successor give me i entreat you that warrant to enlarge upon your claims no no the poor child scarce arrived at womans estate then let her come to it for me unabashed make her mine ceremonially and i swear on my honour to postpone the consummation for a year ah and if you fail i ask no pledge until my success is assured the chevalier gnawed his lip looking on the suitor he saw an old fat unlovely man scarred by the claws of depravity one of his eyes was bulging askew as if actually half torn out by them but the indelible stamp of rank and wealth redeemed the worst that could be in him he told himself that it would be a high mission for his yolande to make of herself the instrument for this monsters salvation it had come to be her only chance and his besides she was a de france and surely eager for the restoration of her familys rights he stopped there by a strong effort of will and pronounced on his word of honour from which there could be no receding his inexorable fiat accomplish what you promise signore and she is yours on the condition you propose nevertheless he felt something as nearly approaching meanness as it was possible for his pride to feel when the count returned triumphant with the glad tidings of his success bid mademoiselle attend me here he said coldly to the servant who waited on his summons di rocco rubbed his dry palms together tingling through every nerve of his dishonoured old body and in the doorway like dorothea the martyr stood the white lily of savoy wondering with wide eyes on her judges chapter ii the chteau di rocco stood well back among pine woods from the little village of les chables on the argentire road above it sloped the stony steeps of the flegre below were huddled neglected terraces like dams to check the further descent of the house into the valley it might in its relation to the huge quarry which contained it have been part of the mountain itself a vast boulder torn away from its parent rock and retaining in relief the form of the socket from which it had parted towers pinnacles and walls heaped up like an enormous ice mould seemed to have shaped themselves to the uproar of avalanches and falling torrents and the thunder of the wind which uproots whole hill sides yet it was so old itself as to have withstood a legion of assaults and survived unshaken it had been the stronghold of the di roccos from the days when the passes of the alps were a very active trust in the keeping of the border lords and was still a formidable veteran of its stones within a world of sombre and tarnished magnificence witnessed to the hands of great mechanics of the past generations only the spirit which could minister to such traditions was debased beyond recall what strain was responsible for its existing lords who could say the miser like the comet is a recurrent phenomenon eccentric in his orbit the chteau all in all was a savage stone locked cold harbour of a place the teeth of whose very ghosts chattered as they walked its vaulted corridors it was haunted throughout by sounds and whispers of cold the boom of subterranean waters the high rustle of snow the growl of ice splitting in the great glaciers opposite the wind whistled in its halls lifting the skirts of the tapestry in a sort of stately dance as if the phantom figures thereon were at a minuet to warm themselves there was not a closet in all its recesses which might have been called cosy nor a rat behind its wainscoting which had grown sleek on plenty dr bonito private physician to the count was himself as waxy a spectre as any which inhabited there his face was like a topographical map with all its features in low relief wrinkles for rivers dull eyes for lakes a nose like a rudimentary volcano there was no expression whatever on it but what seemed to derive from drought and starvation and no colour but a bilious glaze which pimpled here and there into red a death mask of him might very well have stood for a chart of the dead moon the doctor was said to be a rosicrucian a member of that queer sect then somewhat out of date which mixed up alchemy with ethics and thought to coin a millennium out of the alloy or it had thought to once rosicrucianism was not founded professedly to interfere with the polity or religions of states but simply to pursue the true philosophy to follow the gleam yet no secret society i suppose has ever failed when success has brought it self conscious of its power to abuse its mission and certainly dr bonito as a latter day frater rose crucis distilled other and less perfumed waters than utilitarianism from his alembics he was an empiric in fact and lived on the gross superstition of his employer barely it is true but resignedly since di rocco had promised him a legacy proportionate with his services in keeping him alive and a very bonanza should he conduct him well over the biblical span for which reason bonito scarcely resented his present treatment because he counted every penny now withheld from him as a penny invested against his future plumpness under the circumstances was hardly to be expected of him but the doctor was so very thin that when he hugged himself his elbows seemed to meet in his waist mr trix as he liked to be called sitting opposite at a little table with a solitary candle burning between laughed to see him so caress himself you have no bowels he said consequently no hunger what is the matter with you then old bonito the physician who in order that he might cherish his numb fingers had put down on the table an instrument which he had been engaged in correcting an astrolabe so antique in construction that it might have dated from hipparchus answered with a peevish wince of his breath hunger child what dost thou know of the hunger of the soul something said trix something echoed the other ay the baffled appetites of one whose sensorium is but a mirror to reflect back into his brain the visible lusts of the flesh mr trix laughed again pulling at his long pipe he had a reckless young dark face jet eyebrowed winsome out of wickedness and handsome enough to be a perpetual passport to his desires his form properly slim and elastic for the blade that he was was sheathed quite elegantly for di rocco in cloth of a fine black and with a ruff of valenciennes lace at its breast a glass and a bottle of old wine stood at his elbow true he said i deplore the loss of our late good company and so do you my bonito if for a different reason i miss its penny wisdom and you its penny fees but however our respective souls may feel the present pinch they would do well it seems to me to prepare for even to provide against a worse i think di rocco looks very bloated and shaky of late dont you ah you wish him to die first bonito rose to his feet and went pacing vehemently up and down trix watching him said quietly you are very wrong i wish the padrone no harm whatever least of all the harm of this ludicrous misalliance the physician stopped suddenly it is quite true he said i know the conditions we should both be disinherited taken by the scruff and kicked out the notary has already been advised what then the stars are always common land do you think so my friend there are no pastures so exclusive nor so costly in the grazing why else have i served parsimony these long years as galeotti served louis gripes if not for promise of the late means to their attainment let us be frank why have you for fun said the young man or my duty to an older scapegrace i dont see the possibility of either in a regimen of mademoiselle de france bonito sitting down again and leaning his elbows on the table searched hungrily the brown eyes which canvassed his imperturbably suddenly he dealt out a question m louis marie saint pray well have you come across such a gentleman here trix nodded eh you have said the other well what do you know of him that he is a young gentleman of france of slender means which he expends largely on impracticable enthusiasms anything more that he is in le prieur for the second time to attempt the assault of mont blanc ay and what else incidentally that he will never conquer anything why not because he is a creature of fervid aspirations and lame conclusions has he taken you into his confidence more into his arms how was that he would cross the glacier of the winds without a guide he fell into a crevasse which luckily for him his alpenstock bridged but he could not get out until i pulled him theres the thing in the corner do you see it i gave him my hunting knife for it the one with the jade handle and little rats head in gold nothing would satisfy him but that we exchanged blood tokens i dont doubt it a fair exchange and m cartouche all over why thou unconscionable hunks didnt he give me for his part what he had reason to value most in the world use it for my sake says he so that i may dream always of my two best friends going hand in hand there were tears in his eyes do you think he will ever ascend mont blanc maybe not but his aspirations mount higher you mean to the de france ha ha old fox you have not had me you see he has confessed to you no i swear but the sacristan of le marais is an exuberant toss pot and apt to overflow in his cups my information is from him what information why that miss and my friend have very much the air of being lovers secretly pledged to one another it is a fact but how does he know it his chapel is their pious rendezvous sweet souls there they met first and there they meet still it is well they take their loves to church a good sign he will want to make an honest woman of her cartouche grew suddenly and fastidiously articulate i will beg you to bear in mind dr bonito he said that m saint pray has made his honour my own that is admirable indeed answered the physician but has he introduced you to the lady no said cartouche irresistibly tickled for the moment there are limits even to his friendship you do not know her not even by sight she is very pretty mr trix cartouche staring at the speaker a moment took his pipe from his lips which as always when his mood grew ugly seemed to thin down against his teeth what are you hinting at he demanded low a pox on your innuendo out with it the physician grinned unconcerned only said he that i hope when you do see her it will not make you wish to take your blood brothers place in the spoiling of di roccos romance cartouche leaped to his feet beast he hissed if thou hadst as much nose as a barber could lay hold on i would take thee by it and shave thy cursed throat the other did not move as to my nose he said it serves its purpose i dont doubt it cried cartouche the smallest vent is enough for slander when have you ever known me wrong a friend in his love never indeed where the wrongs been expected of you perversitys your crowning devil youve suffered some losses for the pleasure of confuting your oracles i know well youve only to confute them here to earn my gratitude at least a dog to suggest such a villainy what to you ho ho have you ever heard of carrying owls to athens but let it pass its all one if we are in accord as to the impossibility of this alliance between mademoiselle and our patron and the timeliness of our young mountaineers intrusion you choose to believe that you will serve monsignore best by helping m saint pray to the lady well believe it and save us our reversions by an act of virtue cartouche yielding to humour with a sudden laugh yawned and stretched himself after all he said indolently theres no such sporting science as casuistry di rocco is certainly an old bottle for this heady young wine a villainous scarecrow to be asking for a patch of this bright new cloth the pattern is out of suits with his raggedness and calls for a seemly pair of breeches well save him his character in spite of himself it would be a veritable act of grace said bonito if we could only do him that good by stealth said cartouche relighting his pipe la la la cried the physician softly why need we appear in the matter at all what do you mean it is only a question of terms with le marais of sufficiently gilding the countenance it will give to a stolen union they have no particular tenderness there for di rocco whose ugly countenance for his part is the only thing he has ever given them the rest lies between you and your blood brother i can bring a horse to the water bah he will drink it is a pierian spring you will know when you see shall i and how about the lady bonito chuckled for choice she has di rocco a voice at the door little and gloating and jubilant took up the word di rocco di rocco di rocco what about him you rogues what about the knave of hearts the gallant the irresistible the latter day saint of love who is going to be so blessed that he will need no physician nor no runagate scamp to remind him of his days of unregeneracy bonito risen shot one significant glance at cartouche and then lowered his eyes as his patron entered monsignores suit has sped he murmured drawn by doves crowed the marquess flown straight as a bee into the bosom of love where it stops to hive he crossed to the table took up the bottle cried ha you inordinate dog to cartouche slapped him on the back with a thief of a cellarer go hang and blew out the candle who cant drink by moonlight he cried is no chaste dianas servant ill have to immure thee dangerous rogue among thy bottles the moonlight as he spoke striking from a white window sill threw up all his features grossly he looked like some infernal sort of negro flat nosed monstrous lipped it was my candle padrone said cartouche placidly sucking at his pipe i think i will light it again and this time at both ends but di rocco paying no attention to him was flicking at the astrolabe on the table this folly bonito he said i am at an end of it all what did it ever foretell me but lies the physician rescued his instrument gravely nay monsignore he said it cannot lie so its parts remain true yet i confess it strained my credulity to the extent this night that i was fain to bring it in and examine it and what had been its message sneered the marquess uneasy while he scowled that monsignores death must follow close upon his marriage said the rosicrucian calmly di rocco tore the instrument from his hand and dashed it upon the floor liar he screamed i know thy tricks and motives did it foretell this end to them begone thou ass inside a lions skin lest i spit and trample on thee begone nor look upon my face again without a word bonito stooped and gathered up the wreck of brass then clutching it walked softly from the room cartouche pulled calmly on at his pipe chapter iii m louis marie saint peray lodged in the house of a m paccard le prieurs respectable doctor and an enthusiast in matters of geology everyone loved louis marie even in a sweet impartial way the doctors only daughter martha who however had other geese to pluck in the matrimonial market the young man was so good and so good looking so pious so enthusiastic and so sensible anticipating the boy angel of excelsior he came storming the frozen heights which nevertheless he was not to attain but his failures made the true romance of his endeavours in the eyes of women at least who do not admire the cocksureness which comes of success as to the men the rugged mountaineers who were experienced in the natural limitations to their craft they mingled perhaps a little contempt with their liking it would be all very well to put their knowledge to school by showing it the way up mont blanc but in the meanwhile aspirations were not deeds they all for the matter of that aspired to conquer the great white peak but their women did not applaud them for the wish true they had not not one of them m saint prays serene white face and kindling blue eyes and hair of curling sunbeams yet le prieur was not deficient in manly beauty however little it might derive from an exclusive ancestry of angels le prieur in louis maries time was a rude enough valley and almost forbidden ground to the ease loving traveller that was one reason perhaps why the women so favoured this gentle stranger who came to them on his own initiative out of the despised world of luxury if he brought with him the traditions of tender breeding he brought also its fearless spirit it was something god like in him to defy in his frail person that unconquerable keep of the mountains that was good in itself but a closer appeal was to reach them on the occasion of his second visit for it was then that he and yolande met for the first time and provided in their meeting the basis for a more poignant romance than any which had yet glorified him within a week every wife in le prieur thrilled in the knowledge of a secret fathomed only by herself one wet july morning louis marie left the doctors door and turned his face for le marais which was a little dedicatory chapel standing under pine woods on the lower slopes of the montverd it was there he had first come upon yolande the saintly loveliness craving some boon of the sacred heart and what better rendezvous could the two afterwards appoint than the little holy shrine which had brought them mutually acquainted with the sweetest of all boons as louis marie walked up the village street his heart sang like a bird with joy it was full of thankfulness to the god of orthodoxy who was nevertheless the god of nature and of love how easy and how profitable it was to earn approval in those great eyes one had only to keep the faith of a little child to ask no questions to court no vexing heresies and be happy and so to be rewarded for ones happiness as witness himself twice blessed he had done nothing but be good according to his orthodox lights and for that virtue which was instinct here was he glorified in the affection of the loveliest lily of womanhood which had ever blossomed in a by way of the world he turned and breathed a laugh in the direction of the unsurmountable peak hidden now within league deep folds of mist what was there to gain which seemed other than trivial in the light of his higher achievement the mountain was shrunk to a mole hill under that star that altitude there was no wind the wet dropped softly caressingly the fields were full of flowers louis marie could interpret the talk between them and the earnest rain the patches of standing rye were stippled with poppies he recognised why the supreme artist had touched them in here and there and nowhere else sacred love was the understanding love after all he felt that he had been given the gift of tongues he took no sense of depression from the drowning mist the gloom made the lamp of his heart shine the more friendly smiling on all things in its consciousness of the ecstatic wings which were waiting up there to flutter to it in a little he had no doubt of himself or of his right to hold that lure to them perhaps he had no reason to have he came for all worldly considerations of an old and stately family and he had his orphans patrimony nothing great but enough to bring him within the bounds of eligibility in the eyes of a poor chevalier if he had consented hitherto to make a secret of his suit it was because he could not find it in his heart to materialise the first virgin rapture of that idyll to submit it to flesh and blood conditions there was no other reason or if one was to be suspected in m de frances pride and aloofness as gossip painted them he would not admit to himself that he had been influenced by it but in any case propriety always to him the little thing more than love without which love itself must lack perfection demanded its vindication the moment he realised that it was in question and he was now actually on his way in fact to entreat his loves consent to an appeal to the paternal sanctions half way down the village street he encountered a young fellow a friend of his and one intimately associated with some past ambitions this was jacques balmat already the most experienced of mountaineers at twenty two his dark eager face and bold eyes showed in significant contrast with the girlish pink and blue of the others he held out a handful of pebbles louis marie was in no hurry for dr paccard jacques he asked with a smile the young man nodded his head some of them are rare enough monsieur i risk my life in getting them but who would win the daughter must court the father there was significance as well as sympathy in his tone to him also there was a peak higher than mont blancs to attain very true jacques said saint pray i hope we may both find favour the young mountaineer nodded again and in the meanwhile monsieur there is no favour imperilled by showing what resolute fellows we are i was even now on my way to monsieur this mist presages a sunny morrow monsieur the mountain still waits to be scaled it must wait jacques for me there are rarer heights to gain for the moment i hold my life like the frailest vessel which it is my duty to protect from so much as a breath of danger well monsieur that sounds funny to me but then manliness is my only recommendation to win a great name out of venture there is my chance and now more than ever why now jacques monsieur has not heard dr paccard has been appointed physician to the chteau dr paccard will be a big man presently too big to countenance a son in law chosen from the people since when has he been appointed jacques since last night monsieur by the talk it tells of how the monsignores erst familiar the seer bonito came down into the village raging over his dismissal and there are other whispers of a libertine reformed of changes projected at the chteau i know little of their import i only this that jacques balmat will lose nothing by conquering the mountain shall we not join hands monsieur in essaying once more a triumph which would make all men our debtors monsieur to win or perish but saint pray shook his head another time jacques he said my claim to conquest must rest on lower deserts bonne chance camarade and he went on his way to meet the fate of the irresolute while young balmat went on his to climb to his martha by and by louis marie was grown thoughtful as he walked on nature somehow seemed a little further from his knowledge than before the talk between the flowers and the rain was like a whispered conspiracy the dank air chilled him as he turned out of the village into the wet meadows which sloped gently upwards towards le marais he started to see a figure standing by a little freshet as if awaiting him gaston he cried with an irresistible thrill of guiltiness in his note mr trix wore making a grace of necessity a thick dove grey redingote his buckish little tops which came but half way up his calves appeared scarcely soiled by the rain and mud the smallest of black cocked hats was placed jauntily on his black curls of which one and one only was privileged to accent the whiteness of his fine forehead over his head he carried a small spanish silk umbrella an innovation of such effeminacy that his daring it at all in the teeth of fashion testified to something in his character which was at least as noteworthy as his foppishness like the dandy wasp with his waist and elegance and sting there was that suggestion in mr trix of an ever ready retort upon the rashness of his critics some men there are who carry swords in their eyes and no one laughed at cartouche the macaroni unless behind his back he came up to louis marie and took his arm with an assured frankness his smile showed an enviable regularity of teeth yes i purposed to meet you he said are you in a hurry his self sufficiency somehow mended louis maries my business can wait he answered for a friend nevertheless he paused meaningly as if that business were exclusive cartouche laughed louis marie said he you have never yet asked me for my credentials you saved my life said saint pray simply that is true said cartouche but supposing it was for my own ends i am the very hawk of opportunism you must have quick eyes indeed dear gaston said saint pray with a smile if you saw your way to turn me to account during those few moments of my peril eyes of the hawk louis marie well i saved your life you say it is certainly the only thing i ever saved and therefore perhaps like a spendthrift i put a particular value on it and i too gaston i assure you there was never a time when i held my life so dear as now that is as i supposed and the very reason why i am here to warn you what is my life in danger that is as it may hit if someone came to me and said gaston there is one who has it in his power to administer to you the potion of virtue so that you shall wish to marry and live respectable i should say that my life was in peril but one mans food is another mans poison and it is possible that you might welcome such a physicking indeed i think i should very well then there is a priest at le marais i believe a professional dealer in such potions there is also if i am not in error the necessary other party to such a transaction awaiting you there i would seize the opportunity if i were you to be made respectable for ever what do you mean saint prays face was grown suddenly a little white and stern we are blood brothers answered cartouche quietly comrades of a very recent sentiment i honour the tie despite i say despite an older and to me more natural one i mean no reflection upon anything but the blindness of two simplicities living privately as they suppose in a little high paradise of their own will you not be satisfied with a hint will you not believe in its sincerity though i tell you that i should profit personally by its acceptance by you you have chosen to take me on trust i choose to vindicate that confidence by assuring you that my patron di rocco has spoiled more idylls in his time than i can tell he is in the way to ruin yet another this time by the churchs sanction and his arguments from the worldly point of view are overwhelming saint pray was like a ghost now speak plain brother he whispered or rather answer only is the marquess a suitor for the hand of mademoiselle de france is that what you mean cartouche stepped back and nodded he is an accepted suitor louis marie the young man dropped his head with a shudder as if he had been stabbed but in a moment he looked up again pale and trembling so vile he said hoarsely shes soiled in his mere thought gaston my god it must not be it he checked himself suddenly gazed a troubled moment into the others face then turned and went quickly up the hill as soon as the mist had hidden him cartouche followed easily in his steps i must see this folly out he thought perhaps they will want a witness the chapel of le marais hung in the clouds its stone walls streamed with rain the sop and suck of it were the only sounds which broke the silence of the hillside cartouche stepped softly to the door and looked in it was just a dovecot of a size for these two pious pigeons they knelt side by side before the little gimcrack altar the girl had been waiting there for the other to join her a picture of the sacred heart transfixed hung on the wall above her head it was thence she had sought to gather strength for the cruel thing she had to say cartouche standing without looked through the crack of the door he could not see yolandes face for it was hidden in her hands but presently with a quivering sigh she raised it and seeing her lover still bowed down in prayer turned towards the entrance as if seeking light so the young virgin of nazareth might have turned in great doubt and loveliness following with her eyes the dimming messenger of heaven and then she herself went to prayer again we have likened yolande once before to dorothea the martyr she who when condemned to death for loving christ promised that she would send to theophilus the young advocate who had bantered her a posy from the garden of her desires now like that theophilus when a child angel stood before him offering to his hand a spray of unearthly roses cartouche felt his heart suddenly constrict and rallying choke his veins with fire stepping softly back he tiptoed round the end of the chapel and gained the tiny presbytery which stood in a clearing above the little house was deserted it seemed both of father and sacristan no one answered to his low tapping as he stood undecided the voices of the lovers approaching from the chapel reached him the door of the presbytery was on the latch he opened it entered and stood hidden just within he had no wish to eavesdrop his heart was in a strange panic that was all he felt as actaeon must have felt as he backed into the thickets the two came close up to his hiding place and then they stopped and uttered for his shameful ears the tragedy of their lives in the first of their meeting amazed as yet and unrealising the abyss which was fast gaping between them they spoke in the soft romance the old love language of savoy but soon a woefuller cry wrung itself from the torture of their hearts garden of my soul as the rose clings to the wall so art thou mine i have clung to thee louis the sun hath welded us into one thy perfume is in me as my strength upholds thy beauty we cannot be torn apart but we perish i have climbed heavenwards resting on thy heart my cheek hath glowed to thee by day and at night when thou sleptst i have put my lips to the moon kisses on thy face who is this thief that comes into my garden to steal my rose a beast whom they liken to gilles de rais a thing so foul that i would rather my rose were scentless than that he should boast to have shared in the tiniest largesse of her perfume hush he is the husband whom my father has chosen for me at that louis marie threw poetry to the winds and seized yolandes hands and looked with madness into her eyes he may choose but let me gather no submission from your tone yolande we will go down together and claim our older pledge and win his heart by tears i had meant this very morning to urge you to that course why didnt i before o why didnt i before i curse my own delay i louis yes i was wrong tis loves it seems to damn come down yolande before it is too late listen dear love it is too late it was a conditional promise and the condition has been observed what should my father know of you his word is his bond and he will hold to it he cannot know the reputation of this man his breaths a blight upon the earth why even now he broke off with a cry and clasped his arms convulsively about her she was like a ghost holding up her white hands to him piteously cartouche saw what perfect things they were frail and slender yet of a beauty to cradle all love her face in its milky pallour grey eyed and scarlet lipped was like the face of some spirit tragedy flowering from the mists ask me nothing she whispered tell me what to do i tell you he said releasing and stepping back from her he forced his trembling lips to resolution what does your heart say yolande your stainless womanhood your duty to yourself my duty to my father louis now god help me is that a note of wavering in your voice this mans rich and powerful and im neither louis ill not upbraid you for dutys sake to tie yourself to a leper what abuse of authority will not women plead to justify their treacheries will you break my heart if i married him from duty i should kill myself from love hush dearest hush my lily i was a brute and coward forgive me yolande yolande have i offended you beyond recall i forgive you indeed but louis were it not better just now to think than kiss yes to think yolande i would carry you by force if driven to it would you o i am helpless but not unless all else failed to prevent one outrage by another god would not love us any longer yolande we must try all juster means first cartouche wincing ground his heel softly into the boards where he stood the girl was weeping very hopelessly you wring my heart said saint pray sobbing himself what am i to do what think i would pray for light before i act pray for fortitude and reason precipitancy makes self martyrs yolande our cause is better won by moderation she turned from him yolande he cried in agony you love me best cartouche uttered a very wicked oath under his breath but the white lily was in her lovers arms yes yes she said you are always right dear louis only tell me what i am to do supposing you went now to your father yolande and confessed the whole truth to him alone louis only for a little dearest i will follow when i have prayed for guidance would he know my name even i have done very wrong hush the blame is mine but we will mend it start afresh he must be broken to my idea learn my deserts before he sees me ill trust to you to speak them sweetheart better than myself we must not descend upon him with flags flying daring his enmity youll not be long yolande do you doubt me i only doubt myself louis if he appeals to me by all i owe to him you owe god your soul yolande yes yes pray to him for me louis i am so weak alone good bye louis au revoir yolande she did not mend her term however and they parted cartouche turned his face away when he looked again they were both gone yolande down the hill louis marie to the chapel i have seen an angel thought the watcher henceforth i am in love with chastity he lingered long in his eyrie waiting for saint pray to go at length restless beyond endurance he decided to take the lead in the descent as he went down the hillside the mist was already retreating before the onset of the sun it was the dawn of mid day cartouche looked over his shoulder towards le marais will that bring him out he thought or will he always put off making his hay until to morrow coming out into the road below he ran suddenly upon bonito the physician sprang back and stood breathing at him grinning horribly ha he cried well met fellow disinherited he champed like a rabid dog he was woefully unclean and disordered cartouche fell severely calm what is the matter he asked the matter cried bonito enough and to spare for us go and hear it in the village thou hast sped if thou hast sped to great purpose indeed le marais was already bespoke it seems they are man and wife this hour cartouche did not move who are man and wife he said the other raved who but the dog that hath disowned us and the woman that hath replaced the woman she of the white hands why she was up yonder not twice as long ago i cannot help that you should have kept her there if you let her go you were the fool i had nothing to do with it she went down to plead for her lover a pretty pleading i dont doubt shes like them all caught by a title anyhow springed she was and is and held at this moment as fast as church can bind her cartouche laughed recklessly well said he man proposes but woman disposes our best laid plans are nothing without the collusion of the party planned against we must carry our wits to a fresh market bonito with a fearful blasphemy hit out into the air i know my market he screamed i know my market and ran raging up the road cartouche turned his face to the hill once more a little way up he met saint pray pale and exalted descending at last he stood in his path louis marie said he you have delayed too long it does not do to give the devil tether while you pray mademoiselle de france is at this moment the marchesa di rocco he owed the young man no mercy he thought his own heart for all his cynic exterior was burning between contempt and anger but he was hardly prepared for the blighting effect of his own words louis marie fell at his feet as if a thunderbolt had struck him chapter iv yolande de france walked straight down the hill to her doom she had no spanish silk umbrella like cartouches to shield her head from the tempest nor any strength like his to dare orthodoxy she wore only a simple cloak and hood like red riding hood the darling the flower of fairy lore and that was quite insufficient to protect her from the wolf at the door of the htel her father met her distraught and nervous he led her his lips quivering into the little side study which he called an ante room he was obviously pitifully agitated where have you been he said but no matter since you are here yolande the moment has come when you must decide decide father she trembled whether he answered you will bow to my earnest wishes or commit me to dishonour and the grave she felt suddenly faint and sat down in a chair father she whispered i dont understand you i am only too easily understood he said the marquess di rocco who holds my very existence in the hollow of his hand renews his suit at this moment and peremptorily i cannot marry him wait before you condemn me me your father to worse than death i must be plain with you yolande in this terrible crisis i do not plead my word to him although you as a de france should appreciate its inviolability it is associated with other pledges which in default of your consent would mean my instant ruin i owe him money yolande which it is impossible for me to repay money borrowed chiefly to enable you my daughter to maintain the condition which is your due you alone have it in your power to liquidate that debt she did not speak she could not indeed but he gathered a little confidence from her silence and after all he said with a sickly smile one can conceive a less attractive way out of an impasse riches position a princely jointure an alliance with the most powerful house in savoy whereby our own would be enabled to recover its lost influence are these small considerations to be discarded for a personal sentiment which a month of such devotion would cure she shuddered repeating i cannot marry him on the other side he hurried on ignoring her words desperately utter material ruin and what is worse to me my word my honour foresworn listen yolande in that very hour when you become if you will become his wife he settles his entire property upon you by will you will be the most influential woman in the duchy a force for the good which is so dear to your heart is to put this in your power the act of a libertine or of one rather who yearns to find his redemption at the hands of a virtue which he holds so inestimably dear she cried out at last rising from her seat and staggering as if she were blind father father give me time at least even in her despair she knew that it were useless to plead how her heart her soul were engaged elsewhere the shock at this pass would have driven him to a very frenzy of cruelty as it was he leapt to the little concession implied in her appeal and sought to improve upon it instantly impossible he is on the very eve of a journey he demands the ceremony at once this moment the ceremony o mother of god a formal one only conditionally for a year not till that time has elapsed may he claim you for his wife in fact it was my provision made in consideration of your youth and inexperience she stared at him as if mad you are my father she began he interrupted to better her your dead mothers trustee for your welfare yolande as i hold that charge sacred from abuse believe at least in the sincerity of my desire to urge impartially upon you the wisdom of a step which i am sure she would have approved the girl gave a little rending laugh horrible in a note quite foreign to her is he m di rocco in the house she asked he is in the next room awaiting us the maire the notary and the good father of le marais are also there attending on your decision only my mother is wanting said yolande call her to this conspiracy against her child and see what she answers to the impartial head of it he had turned his fine eyes from her even as it is said the royal despot of beasts will cower under the fearless human gaze but at this the goaded fire flashed into them she would answer he cried cursing the graceless offspring of our house who could so misread a fathers tender love no father she is in heaven the secrets of our hearts are bared to her he cringed before her for a moment defeated and exposed looking in her noble eyes he knew that his moral tenure of her heart her duty hung upon a thread knew that nothing but the last poignant threat of self destruction could restore them to him his stately cowardice had even foreseen this contingency you leave me no alternative he said his face as grey as ashes i cannot survive dishonour and my broken word thus yolande do i take your message to her and with the word he fetched a pistol from his pocket and put its muzzle to his temple she uttered a fearful scream and flew to him wrenched down his arm cried and fondled him with inarticulate moans he stood quite passive give me time she could only sob at last i can give you nothing yolande he answered yours is all the gift i am a bankrupt but for you he made a movement as if to break from her she held him madly in that minute the whole joy of life drained from her veins and left them barren at length she released him and stepped back father she said in all your life never mention my mothers name to me again when i die bury me away from her in another grave i am only worthy to be your daughter deal with me as you will a double rose of colour had come to his cheeks he made an eager step towards her but she retreated before him it is enough for me that you have vindicated your name he said it is enough that i am not mistaken in you spare me that comment on my shame she said why will you keep me in this torture but he must still hunger to justify his self degradation by enlarging on it hush he said it is a sacrifice i know but perhaps yolande only a provisional sacrifice dare i whisper my own expectations you will be free for a year a wife in nothing but the material endowments of wifehood a a prospective dowager yolande the marquess is much shaken a prematurely old man a she turned from him feeling sick to death i am waiting she said icily that was how the marchese di rocco gained his wife for the rest the priest the maire and notary were creatures of his own and among them soon accomplished the ceremony and settlements at the end monsignore offered to kiss his newly made bride but she backed from him is this in the bond she asked coldly of her father he was very righteous and peremptory at once it is a breach of it he said i must ask you monsignore to observe our compact to the letter the old libertine grinned a pledge only to be redeemed in a year he said but it will keep sweet as roses in a cabinet in the interval i hope the marchesa will honour my poor abode during the absence of its master no pardon me said de france she will continue in her fathers house i shall do neither said the lily how cried the chevalier i am my own mistress she said from this moment please do not forget that and she swept from the room he stared after her dumbfoundered but di rocco burst into a great laugh by god i like her spirit he said she is a prize worth the winning chapter v there was a little auberge on the montverd kept open during the summer months for the benefit of those not many in who came to enjoy the view there in a green oasis planted amongst the stupendous buttresses of the mountains lived nicholas target and his daughter margot the latter a good sensible girl and the responsible aubergiste the father was a drunken scamp a guide by profession but long discredited as such in the eyes of all but his daughter whose faithful heart continued to make its compromise with the self evident the fellow spent his days of slouching and soaking mostly at the foot of the steep path which descended from the inn to the moraine of the winds where in a tiny shed he kept a store of woollen socks for the feet of those who desired to cross the glacier this at least left the auberge free of his presence and margot to the peaceful entertainment of her guests amongst these on a certain tragic day came to be included yolande new marchesa di rocco only the wonderful visitor came to stay it seemed and not merely to gather dutch courage for the passage of the glacier she took a bed at the inn and cold command as by right of her husband its rent lord of its general conduct she had always had an affection for margot the good girl and this was her way of showing her confidence in her discretion i want to be alone she had said and hither none comes but the stranger who cannot know me or my concerns i look to you to secure me utter privacy from man from woman from child from the whole world only if my father comes must i see him for i am his daughter for all else be my true and faithful watchdog margot margot had of course heard of the tragic ending to that idyll on le marais in common with her fellow women she had deplored the finish to a pretty romance but then when ones feudal lord stepped in at the door love must fly out at the window it was pitiful it was sad but it was inevitable she promised with all her heart to contribute what gentle salve was hers to that open wound she said it with fervour but in a panic it was difficult for her to reconstruct from this figure of bloodless hauteur the sweet and kindly patroness of yesterday who had never held herself other than such a simple girl as she was herself could shock so turn to stone it was a catalepsy of the soul and yolande made her home there in the auberge with all le prieur at her feet she elected for this chill small refuge of the hills she felt she could breathe there was nearer god and her mother she felt she could pray a little even and with more chance of being heard in that austere silence there was no sound of waterfalls in all the vast valley to strike between her and her isolation rushing down into the hateful plains where men dwelt dragging her thoughts on their torrents what voices reached her came from above the whisper of avalanches the echoing crack of ice falls in those enormous attics of the world she was alone with her desolation among desolations once and once only her father visited her there he was very humble and deprecating he had come to remonstrate and he remained to weep she saw his tears without emotion and bid him kindly to the descent lest the mists should rise presently and give him cold he went without a word did she ever think of louis and that dead idyll a will of self reticence had so been born in her that perhaps she was able to hold his figure from her mind if she had not the memory of the cruelty of her part to him must have driven her mad not to think at all was her hold on reason not to think what he was thinking suffering designing that he could come to claim her yet in defiance of law orthodoxy and every right but the right of human nature she could not believe nor wish to believe he was not so to be dethroned from her worship of him past it would be another louis than the louis of her knowledge who could so dare yet was she not another yolande an awful rapture should outrage have conceived a wicked will in him like hers but louis would not come he was a purer soul than she and prayed always prayed before he committed himself to action the far unconquered heights above her were her reassurance she told herself that he was of those who accept repulse unquestioning his faith was always first in heaven and its high reasons for baffling high achievement christs creed and he a christian he could not love her so much loved he not honour more she bowed to that higher rival and believed that the thing remotest from her wishes was to see her ousted and her brain reeled to the sound of every footstep which came up the mountain among them all she never dreamed of listening for her husbands that di rocco had kept his word and left le prieur on the morrow of the tragedy she never doubted it was not he but the interval which was to separate her from him which filled her thoughts nebulous unformed the idea was still never less than a fixed one in her mind that any consummation to that tyranny but deaths was unspeakable whether his or hers it mattered nothing the knot must be cut before it was double tied and in her heart she rejoiced to think of his succession to an empty bed she did not suppose she could possibly survive the year twelve long months of suspension between torture past and the prospect of the living question to come she had only to be herself and die duty could not traverse that decision her heart was cold already rare and alien the footsteps came up one day it would be a traveller one day a goatherd the world went by her thinly and vanished into the mists she remained alone and fell after each interruption into her old communing with death he was the only understanding friend left to her one day as she was in talk with him high on the hill where no one usually came a stranger suddenly stood before her either the watchdog had been slack or the interloper cunning he doffed his hat to her with the most sympathetic grace imaginable you seek the auberge monsieur she said haughtily it lies below you are off the road and mademoiselle also he asked but supposing we each undertake to put the other on it she had been seated on a stone she rose hurriedly the road lies down monsieur as i would convince mademoiselle he said i have just come up it from a stricken friend her intuition touched some meaning in his words she looked breathlessly at him if you know me monsieur as your manner seems to imply you will know that i am out of love with subterfuge i know you mademoiselle by sight and reputation scarcely monsieur if you so address me ah he said i do not hold by orthodoxy and yet there was a time when i was tender of it you would be madame on a surer title had i had my way tell me who you are she demanded icily it can hardly interest you they call me cartouche her face fell frowning i have heard of you i would not be ungracious sir she said you saved a life that was once dear to me i wish i could say i saved it because it was dear to you i had not seen you then you can dispense with your compliments sir your reputation is sufficiently well known to me without then doubtless mademoiselle is aware that disloyalty to friends is not a part of it moreover it is a human eccentricity to love what we have saved it is easy to love some people it is easy though our natures may be the remotest from theirs verjuice loves oil in this queer salad of life but where i have come to love through saving i would save again and yet again you speak a good deal of yourself monsieur forgive me if i cannot quite share your interest in the subject no doubt your friend appreciated your assistance in saving him a second time from destruction it is fataller i am sure in such eyes as yours to fall in love than into an abyss you misunderstand me i hope not wilfully i did not mean to speak of saving my friend from you but for you i do not mean it now i am here to offer you my services she drew herself up magnificently i thank you monsieur i was to be excused perhaps for wishing to read on the better side of an insolence you had done well according to your lights i am sure to strive to keep us apart well to your worthy patron well for your worthy self i could have respected you at least for that consistency but to offer to mend what you have helped to mar i am at a loss to understand how i have invited this insult a dark flush rose on trixs cheek what was this new born perversity in him which made him not only bare his heart to this sting of words but like a very anchorite of love take pleasure in his chastising her frost fired him you are bitter mademoiselle he said i could answer very truly in self defence that i was so far from choosing to have a hand in this business as it has sped that i foresaw from the first what has actually happened that your exaltation would spell my ruin i would answer that i say but that i own to no mans power to ruin me she was quite unmoved those who serve evil must bide evil she said if as you would seem to imply monsieur your employer has made you the scapegoat of his reformation i can only regret very sincerely my involuntary part in your dismissal believe me i would give all my exaltation to reinstate you i used the term unthinkingly said cartouche it was the formal phrase of a worldling will you persist in thinking me too bad to be moved by the distresses of virtue hard beset and how would you propose to help that poor virtue sir for what are your services offered i will not even sully myself by understanding unless to suppose that you design to make me an instrument of your revenge on one who has wronged you the flush on his face deepened you are an angel madame he said grimly you claim your full prerogatives i can never please you better i see than by avowing my knowledge of the gulf which separates us i too will be myself flagrantly and without compromise my affections are all earthly very well i love the man i have saved because i saved him i see him stricken down helpless his very reason threatened under a calamity worse than death her face had gone bloodless she answered faltering as to that monsieur assure yourself assure him if you please that nothing but a convention separates us now nor ever will he looked wonderingly at her did she mean to kill herself he could quite believe it as the more pardonable of two self offences then he breathed and laughed a convention he cried i am nearer you by that admission there is no moral bondage in conventions let me bring my friend to you and save him she reared herself like a very snake i would you had never saved him she said deeply i would you had never laid that claim on his regard my only regret in dismissing you is that i re condemn him to this corruption go sir and insult and trouble me no longer he had lost and turned to leave her but for a moment he paused in anger and confusion to fire his final charge very well madame only be quite sure of the strength of that convention as sure as your husband may be of its weakness i do not think he will wait a year for the test farewell and he went and no sooner was he out of sight and hearing than yolande bent herself face downwards on the rock and delivered her soul in a cry of agony louis my louis so ill so broken and i may not help thee nor think of thee chapter vi if all the rest of feminine le prieur was agreed in accepting louis maries discomfiture with regretful resignation martha paccard was certainly not going to number herself of that complacent sisterhood she was hot with pity and indignation and because vexed illogical of course what did the man seek she asked sharply of jacques balmat referring to the chevalier de france honour renown riches through this connection with a dbauch our monsieur had provided them all and with a better savour if only you had spurred him timely to achieve the ambition of his life but how was the poor boy to accomplish that ascent with you and your wisdom for ever at his elbow persuading him from it you men are all alike great promises and little reasons for not performing them no later than the day of the marriage martha i urged him to come and try once more then you did very wrong what title had you to demand that risk of him when all his happiness was at stake in le prieur to increase the odds in his favour to be sure favour and odds has he not his patrimony enough to frank a presence less angelic than his i do not see how to ascend the mountain could have added to it certainly dont you but there is money in fame let me tell you even if it is achieved ultimately through a book as for you you may ascend mont blanc and nobody will believe it because they will have to take your word which is nothing they will take my word nevertheless they will be more credulous then than i i have long lost faith in it and if i still doubted there is that poor sick boy at home to confirm me by this time if you had done as you promised not fifty di roccos could have equalled him in reputation is he very ill martha he wrings my heart why are you so strong jacques and so honest and so resolute i cannot conceive my father parting us at a blow and yet i am a dutiful daughter too i think we love weak men like mothers i am glad you are not weak jacques so am i so shall your father be some day you must learn modesty jacques poor m saint pray is a model of it and he has been jilted so he has that is the truth he still sits as if stunned i dont know what will happen when he recovers himself jacques for pitys sake watch him when that happens for pitys sake jacques i will be his shadow martha but not for him to know i dread the time terribly i think there is often no such fiend as a good man wronged through his goodness and there has been an evil one whispering in his ear i am sure an evil one m gaston the old lords black whelp he brought him home that day straight from hearing the disastrous news he has been with him once or twice since jacques i should not be surprised i should not be surprised i say if that devil were urging him to dare all and abduct her up there would you not i think i wish i could believe it o hush are you all fiends this cartouche they say is ruined in the marriage he may have his reasons but you well good bye martha i will watch him that is right to save him from himself such a self my god as he may come to be good bye jacques she went on her way home it was a chill oppressive day for the season with threat of cold storm in the air few people were abroad as she neared her door she noticed that a man was keeping pace with her he reached the house as she did and accosted her as she was lifting the latch she recognised him for the dr bonito whom her father had supplanted at the chteau and her heart gave a little heave whom do you seek monsieur she said standing with her back to the door as if to bar his passage she had not in her heart approved her fathers promotion to that distinction but to any outer criticism of it she was ready to ruffle like a mother hen at a cat the doctor it appeared however was to disarm her with a show of the most ingenuous urbanity m saint pray lodges here he said with a smile like a spasm of stomach ache i should like to have a word with him she looked at him with her honest eyes it was at least a relief to find that his visit was not connected with his replacement by her father he is not at all himself monsieur she said will not a message suffice doubtless he answered only i must deliver it myself a message she questioned his face searchingly whose possible delegate could he be certainly he and m louis were at one in the question of their discomfiture by di rocco there was that much of sympathy between them besides it was known that this man dealt in the occult could cast nativities and foretell deaths his message might be one of comfort and reassurance things were already at such a pass that no conceivable evil could congest them further a certain awe awoke in her eyes the neighbourhood of mountains engenders superstition is your your message monsieur she said with a little choke from someone somewhere that only such as you can understand he chafed his bony hands together leering at her wintrily yes he said i think it may interest him wait then she answered deciding in a moment while i ask him if he is willing to receive it she had intended to leave him on the doorstep while she went but he followed her in closely lingering only at the foot of the stairs while she ascended louis marie sat in a little room which overlooked the hills his ambitions and their unfulfilment were eternally symbolised before his vision he was not much changed outwardly only his eyes appeared physically to have shallowed a cloud had come between them and the sun and the transparency of their blue was grown chalky as if a blind had been pulled down over his soul and as yet no lights were lit behind to show the shadows of what moved there he was as quiet and courteous as ever in seeming but women are as sensitive as deer to atmosphere and martha never saw him now but she quaked in anticipation of a storm to come he was reading or feigning to he looked over to her kindly what is it martha he asked there is one come to see you monsieur with a message from the stars she trembled a little he laughed that is kind of him whoever he is is it a fallen star martha it can have no message for me otherwise it is fallen monsieur and therefore maybe in sympathy with its kind it is dr bonito the mage and soothsayer what is he too the victim of a reformation heaven is very impartial martha it condescends to no degrees in its chastisement as well after all to be hanged for a sheep as a lamb quite as well if it is necessary to be hanged at all said bonito at the door to which he had mounted softly martha exclaimed angrily but saint pray did not even stir pray make yourself at home fellow asteroid said he i must not complain if like attracts like you can leave us martha she obeyed reluctantly having followed impulse she retired on mortification which is the common way what is your message said louis marie impassively the moment his visitor was left alone to him you can sit or not as you like he added i am master of nothing bonito as apparently phlegmatic for his part remained standing where he was you may think you know enough of my reputation to insult me he said it is no concern of mine what you or anyone thinks the surest sign of worth is to be worth mens slander as its surest reward is ingratitude pardon me said saint pray i have never thought of you at all until this moment but i agree with you so far that to be vile and unscrupulous is in this world to be successful if you are fortunate we will admit by antithesis that you are virtuous they call me a rosicrucian said bonito i am at least so far in sympathy with the sect as to believe in the universal regeneration and the cosmopolitanism of the intellect they call me also an alchemist certainly i would transmute the dross of life into gold it is the worlds way to gild the calf and worship it we see below the vile enamel no idols of wealth or patriotism for us no states or churches as jealous entities base metal is under the skin of all into the furnace with the vast accumulation and there anneal it with the salt of godliness into that one and universal benevolence which shall be shoreless landless eternal a single harmonious republic of the entire human race he took breath saint pray sat as apathetic as a deaf mute the other never thought to attribute his unconcern to his own uninvited self exposition any propagandist even of disinterestedness is always absorbed in the first place in himself in a moment he gave tongue again no need to question of the force which is to compel this transmutation it has been growing consistently with the mind of man the shame of the dominion of the brute in a world which intellect has shaped for itself the shame of liberal knowledge lying at the mercy of illiberal ignorance the shame of the animal coercing the angel the fool cackling discredit on the sage these things must cease off the earth at last for when learning learns to combine it shall be to ignorance as is the little bag of gun powder rammed home to the material bulk which it is capable of annihilating this is as certain as it is that the moment of the intellectual renaissance age foreseen is at last approaching because i too hunger and thirst with the fool am i bonito no better than a fool the fool can make it appear so because in his numbers he commands the markets or has commanded we shall see the hour of his disillusionment perhaps is imminent in the meantime we who prepare the stage do not cease of our efforts to divert the paths of evil to over reach iniquity to gather each his quota of dirt and filth ready for the burning he ended on a loud note and wrung his lips between his thin fingers leering at the other if he had been tempted into an over long exordium the more plausibly he thought would its moral thunder in the index his craftiness was not to stultify itself by over precipitancy saint pray discussed his twitching face quite unmoved i am obliged for your interesting message sir he said you are reported to be a rosicrucian that concerns someone no doubt only i was under the impression that that sect eschewed politics thank you for putting me right good morning bonito did not stir i aim he answered coolly in common with kindred spirits many and potent at the universal purification our politics are no more than that latency cabala all the rest of the terms which are held by the ignorant to condemn us are only so many proofs of the divine sympathy with our mission we can read the stars because we have so to speak friends at court there woe on him that scoffs at our message woe on di rocco i say who heard and would not believe he had shot his bolt and as instantly saw that he had hit the mark louis marie gave a mortal start and sat rigid the curtain of his eyes was rent there seemed things visible moving behind it but not a word came from him my message now is to you said the physician low and distinct as to the one most intimately concerned in the scotching or expediting of a half acted iniquity i propose no plan i point out no way bear that in mind very clearly my task was accomplished when i warned di rocco that his horoscope revealed mars at the conjunction of the seventh and eighth houses presaging quick death for him to follow on his marriage consummated i have said that he disbelieved me disregarded would be the truer word passion in him was desperate enough to dare the test but not for a year it was saint pray who spoke though his voice was scarcely audible bonito laughed little and low do you believe it i know him very well indeed there is no monster in all the world so self convinced of his own irresistibility you think he has left le prieur as a fact he does not start for turin until to morrow morning when urgency compels him but he will not fail to storm the coy fortress first to night he will do it either to persuade or enforce he paused listening for an answer but none followed you may question how i know this he went on be satisfied we who read the stars command our instruments he is to go secretly after dark to night i say crossing the glacier of the winds from the further side towards the montverd nicholas target will be there to conduct him nicholas target will have been instructed first to dismiss his daughter from the auberge on some errand which will delay her monsignore will find the marchesa quite alone and defenceless nothing to complain of for a wife he will presently leave her to return as secretly by the way he came what then there are pitfalls on the glacier and target will likely be drunk perhaps fate will choose to verify its prediction during that passage i cannot tell for me i have done my part if this act is necessary for his destruction a young widow will be ensured in le prieur before long that is my message to you i speak it with absolute conviction of its truth for your consolation if the marriage is consummated the man must die on the other hand if one would save a threatened honour balk by a timely abduction the hand of fate one would certainly procure a renewed lease of life for a villain and a villain one might be sure who would not accept his despoliation with meekness it is a nice point in ethics upon which i will not presume to give an opinion it had occurred to me once i admit that a revelation of the plot to the father would be the proper course reflection however convinced me that he would be only too glad to sanction indirectly the most treacherous of means for breaking down the barrier which his daughter had raised between himself and a potential greatness in the end monsieur he prepared to leave i resolved to confide the issue to the hands the most strong in faith and godliness to direct it to your hands in fact you have my sympathy and good wishes i have the honour to bid you good morning he might have been speaking to an apparition for any response he could extort only saint prays eyes were fixed upon him with a greed more horribly eloquent than words he felt them following him as he left the room clinging it seemed like the discs of tentacles to his back as he descended the stairs pursuing him silently deadlily through all the convolutions of his way however he might twist and turn to elude them he was not a fanciful man for all his mysticism but the impression of this unwinking pursuit haunted his soul into the very dominion of sleep the eyes followed him upstairs in the little inn where he was sojourning for the moment and lay down with him on his pillow on that same day mr trix received his final cong from his patron with the most serene good temper rogue rogue said the old devil though i have loved a rogue we must part there is no place in this reformation for a cartouche you have taken good care of that said the young man pleasantly it is very natural you should not wish to be haunted by your past besides i can foresee all sorts of complications if we remained penitents together dont tell me that you also are a penitent no no said the marquess with a nervous chuckle he was fumbling at a cabinet against the wall see here he said i wouldnt do the graceless thing by your mothers graceless son if this hadnt happened had redemption been denied me i wont say but that it might have been my intention to make you my heir an evil inheritance thats past thats all over better to lose the world than your soul eh but i should blame myself to deprive you of the means to honesty take my advice rascal and live cleanly for the future weve sown our wild oats you and i we must both be out of the house by to morrow and leave it clear to the sweepers and garnishers in the meantime heres to commute your expectations money i cant command without abuse of the marriage settlements but its equivalent lies here take it he held out a handful of jewels of ancient setting and indiscriminate value cartouche received the heap passively it would be false modesty in me to refuse my wages he said yes yes said the other returning still agitated to the cabinet there may be another trifle or so there he paused holding a ring in his hand this is your mothers hair he said suddenly and sharply you can have it also if you wish cartouche received the ring from his hand thank you father he said quietly no such thing began di rocco loudly but his voice broke on the word cartouche stepped forward and kissed him on the cheek goodbye he said i wish you had made a good man of me di rocco turned to the wall when he looked round again cartouche was gone then the old libertine sat down and wept but tears in such are nothing but the provocation to fresh evil emotions chapter vii there was a night of hurried storm long remembered in le prieur all during it the wind drove up in squalls like the thunder of passing artillery unlimbered over the mountains crackled into brief tempest and swept on billows of black smoke marked its passage each in its retreat leaving a vacuum of dense silence until the next rushing in to occupy it awoke the echoes with new uproar the roofs smoked under the cannonade of hail the glaciers foamed like torrents with the dancing pellets the brows of the hills seemed to melt and flow down everything would be sudden stunning overwhelming for a space and then exhaustion and the drip of wounded trees alone breaking the quiet le prieur weather hardened inhabiting under the sky light of savoy thought nothing of all this sleeping with its face to the clouds what made this night of many nights notable to it was the period it marked in the course of a human tragedy which had certainly seemed to cry to heaven for some such solution of its riddle for so it appeared out of all the dogs of storm unleashed to hunt the hills one had found the quarry sought by many and had dragged him down and torn and devoured him so that not a bone remained to mark the spot of his undoing di roccos the morning succeeding opened chill and austere a brave day for a journey monsignores equipage ordered overnight was ready betimes to convey him to turin whither urgencies state had called him the lean horses champed their rusty bits the lean postillions whoad and cursed their cattle sympathetically for their ill lined stomachs when mid day came and with it no di rocco they dared the devil for the sake of a toothful of oats and polenta and drove back grumbling to the stables monsignore did not come then or thereafter monsignore was never to be seen in life again at first the story of his disappearance was received with utter incredulity one could not conceive a figure so potent so absorbing the sport of any such casualty as might overtake a little soul in its little pride of doing he must be keeping out of the way intentionally watching from some cunning eyrie to pounce upon the first self committing wretch who should venture to presume upon his supposed removal from the board a hope in that case predoomed to unfulfilment for even when curiosity woke on surprise and gossip on curiosity and emphasis on gossip his name was never bandied about but with decency le prieur rough as its rocks was too manly to flog a dead lion or even a dead boar there were no unworthy comments on the snatching of that terrific presence from its midst not in the first surmise nor in the last moral certainty for so at length it came to be how the whisper grew the shadow thickened one might scarcely tell it took form no doubt in the winks and becks and exaggerated secrecies of a sot too brain sodden himself at first to grasp the full significance of his innuendoes but as a word or two caught from the blabbings of sleep may linger suggestively in ears that listen so nicholas targets tavern maunderings came presently to be suspected of embodying in their text a very momentous cypher the fellow bewildered between apprehension and vanity was unable nevertheless to forego that hint of his marketable values nor his intention to negotiate them when his way became clear to him it became clear brilliantly clear all in a moment when he felt himself nipped by the scruff and twisting about saw that the law had got hold of him with whine and collapse then he let full daylight into so much of the mystery as it was in his power to resolve on that night of rapid storm ran his confession he had been engaged by monsignore to bring him secretly into the presence of the marchesa where she had sought refuge in his little auberge on the montverd the lady was to be taken by surprise for which reason his daughter margot had been despatched into le prieur on the pretext of some business which would detain her for the same reason of privacy monsignore had elected to avoid the popular route up the hill he target was to meet him at the place called the mauvais pas opposite and conduct him thence across the glacier to his own side he had known nothing of any engagement on monsignores part to hold himself aloof from the marchesa or if he had it was none of his business to cross the caprices of his over lord nor could there be any real sin in procuring a wife for her husband his conscience was as clear on that matter as on the question of his sobriety which at the time was absolute so he had met monsignore with difficulty for as it turned out the night was terrible he had met him and was already proceeding with him down the moraine when he target had slipped and fallen monsignore was very furious at that and had cursed him for a drunken sot which was quite untrue they had proceeded however and were actually on the glacier when by great ill fortune he had fallen a second time on each occasion the lantern he carried had been extinguished and had had to be relighted monsignore on the repetition of his mishap had flown into an ungovernable rage snatched the light from him and driving him from his presence with blows and curses had bade him seek his own way to the rocks for that he would trust himself to his guidance no longer the man was a demon in fact and he had fled from him instinct had guided him to his cabin by the moraine where he had crouched waiting for monsignore to follow while he dwelt there there had broken over the glacier one of those furious storms of hail and wind which for a time had made thought impossible its cessation was not followed by the arrival of monsignore in fact monsignore never followed at all knowing the resolute cruelty of his passions he target had not been long in guessing at the reason he must have foundered in that terrific blast have wandered astray with quenched light and pitched into some crevasse long he had waited for him and at last in an interval of calm had sought back so far as he might dare across the glacier he had peered he had shouted he had left at last no boulder or familiar crack unsearched when the first weak wash of dawn had come to his aid it was all unavailing the glacier it was as morally certain as anything circumstantial could be had bolted monsignore and there was an end of him so le prieur agreed awake at last to the full significance of the shadow which had been stealing in step by step to overwhelm it its verdict was untraversable as plain as reason monsignore had perished there was no need to question the essential truth of the drunkards story target could have had no possible interest in committing or leading his patron to destruction a just retribution had overtaken an illustrious sinner against his word di rocco the monster the miser was a thing of the past heaven in its own stupendous way had decreed the manner of his death and burial moral certainties are however by no means legal a man is not dead in law without proof of witness even though his carcase lies on the table before it much remained to challenge to certify to cite and answer by default before the widow could come into her own in the meanwhile the chevalier de france was not backward in righteous and indignant denunciation of his dead son in laws abuse of faith at the same time he was even extravagantly exacting in the question of the acknowledgments due to himself in his position of natural guardian to the marquesss august relict the village perhaps did not at the outset take him quite so seriously as he expected it was more curious to learn how m saint pray accepted this provisional change in his fortunes but there martha paccard proved herself a very cerberus in guarding the approaches to her charge she was agitated but quite resolute about it all only between her and young balmat was there ever an interchange of meaning glances and once or twice in moments of emotion some fearful comment she cried too in private a good deal however brave a face she might turn to the world for as a fact none but these two knew how louis marie had slipped out alone on the night of the tragedy and had returned home as secretly by and by death white and drenched to the skin then the next thing le prieur heard about him was that he had left the village and gone none knew whither at that for the first time men and women united in putting him on one side as an irreclaimable faint heart but for all the rest vogue la galre di rocco was dead dead dead one summer afternoon a young man stood on a projecting rock which overlooked the glacier of the winds at a point on the north east side at no great distance below that whence his patron had a few nights earlier descended to his death right in front of him the vast river of ice creeping to its fall over a precipice was rent and splintered into a throng of monstrous pinnacles one or other of which would ever and again lean topple and go spinning down the shallower bed below in a thundering shatter of fragments this happened more than once while he lingered and on each occasion he winced and stepped back and then expanded his chest and watched for the next ruinous downfall but at length with a sigh he prepared to go so breaks away the past he thought what will the future reveal well i am still cartouche he turned turned again and showed a wicked face to the glacier he was good to me he murmured if bonito did it bad for bonito i shall know some day goodbye evil father of a worthless child he went down sombrely into the valley end of part i part ii chapter i turin wedged into a corner between the po and dora with all its ranks of lines and squares criss crossing the angle like the meshes of a snow shoe was a depressing city to be abroad in on a rainy night it was characteristic of it of its unenterprise and unoriginality that it had never deviated from the pattern set by its roman founders it suggested when the rain poured persistently a vast congeries of waterworks with reservoirs and pumping stations all drawing from the rivers its barrack like uniformity of buildings its shyness of imposing faade its system of parcelled out dwelling blocks called appropriately islands which were ruled scrupulously rectangular along the wide channels of its streets its eternal monotonous brick and heavy porticoes all combined to produce an effect of unlovely utilitarianism artistry struggling here and there to emancipate itself and soar above the level roofs on wings of brass and timber had always halted in the end on a blank expression of futility and retired within doors there to fulfil its soul of the splendour which it had shrunk from daring without for some reason of taste or policy architectural display was not favoured in turin its fanes and palaces were all so many uncut diamonds dull surfaces to hearts of fire there was something in all this no doubt significant of the character of its government for as art flowers at its richest under despotisms so oppositely its growth is most stunted in the temperate climate of democracies turin it is true was not of those latter yet it was as true that its lords had never learned to rule independently of their people even as kings though when sovereign by a generation or two they had not come to take themselves very seriously they seemed to reign self consciously by virtue of a plebiscite they avoided superficial ostentation they kept all their grandeurs for privacy there had been those among them who had planned fitfully to face all this heavy monotony with light and lightness to overlay it with skin of marble stone or even as a last lame resort with stucco their ambitions had declined upon a policy of laisser faire in many buildings the very holes for their scaffolding remained unfilled ineptitude yawning from a hundred mouths turin under the rule of victor amadeus iii was still rome before augustus lacking its splendid autocrat at the same time there was this much to its credit it had never bred or allowed to self breed within its walls a race of tyrants the savoy princes were the militant monks of history always keeping a reserve of cloister for contingencies they were recluses by conviction freebooters by constitution the first duke of them all had died a hermit the grandfather of the present king the piedmontese lear had abdicated prematurely on a religious sentiment it had been his pious intent to efface the feudal system age dishonoured it was the policy of his grandson to attempt its restoration he made a mistake being a vain weak man it is not the wisdom of the proletariat but the folly of its rulers which opens the ways to revolt worse than the grudging of wise concessions is their rescinding when they have become establishments victor amadeus made much of his army which was a warlike fathers perfected bequest to him he also made much of his nobility with the result that according to the popular waggery there was in his reign a general to every private so he consistently favoured birth ignored intrinsic merit apart from it alienated the sympathies of his people and opened his passes thereby to the hordes of the french revolution it was always a figure of speech to say that he strode the alps he had lost his french stirrup long before he knew it and was jogging lop sided to his fall in the meantime lacking the soul of augustus he left turin much as he found it and in place of bread and circuses fed up discontent on the public lottery his kingdom was rotten when it tumbled montaigne in his time found turin a small town situated in a watery plain not very well built nor very agreeable some two hundred years later the ineffable count cassanova passed a verdict on it not much handsomer it was densely populated and full of spies he said it boasted as a fact at the latter date a population of some ninety thousand souls but it was not crowded nevertheless except to one who saw eyes at every turn a citys numbers are not to be calculated by one who moves exclusively in its markets turins population if regularly distributed over its area would have shown most of its quarters relatively empty it looked its best on a moonlight night when along its canal like streets the cobble stones glinted and sparkled like very ripples on water and the great hulks aligned on either side became shadowy leviathans anchored at rest its worst was kept for twilight drenchings when the mists trooped down from the distant alps and blotting out the intervening slopes the superga the hill of the capucins and others a green high stretching swarm made one shoreless swamp of all the level town on such an evening a man going with humped shoulders and dripping hat down the via del po which was one of turins principal thoroughfares cursed the citys original settlers with all his soul of venom he was nevertheless so bent on a particular errand that nothing less than a flood would have diverted him from it presently he ran to a stop before a dimly lighted shop window and peered eagerly up at certain labels and vouchers which were pasted to the glass within there were other inquisitors at the same business quite a throng of them and one and all including the newcomer like rude and ravenous poultry the shop itself might have been in its dinginess and gloom a mere money changers office which at the same time it was in a measure only on a national scale there were pious frescoes daubed on its walls as if in irresistible association of hucksters with the temple on either side of its door was hung a slim red board the one headed torino the other genova each board was ruled into five sections and each section contained a number these numbers represented more or less the victims of what the wags called the torture of the wheel the office was in fact one of the many bureaux of the never ending state lottery the stranger having examined to his hunger or satisfaction the numbers on the boards and the hieroglyphics in the window stepped back into the rain with a click of his strong teeth together weeding weeding he thought exultant and rageful in one next week will reach the grand climacteric for me my god and what then as he reflected or muttered chafing like a fettered beast the form of a man advancing up the street came between himself and the light instantly he started uttered a violent exclamation and quickly pursuing the figure accosted and halted it m saint pray he cried so after all you have come into retreat in our capital louis marie regarded the speaker ghastlily the young mans face in the shaking lamp shine seemed to twitch like the face of an epileptic it was white and haggard and indeed scarcely recognisable for the face which had kindled to the mountains of le prieur a month earlier he made no answer a la bonne heure cried the other very careful all the time not to let his capture escape him i had wanted much to come across you and never so much as at this moment conceive my ridiculous position monsieur realise me here on this spot debarred the heavenly mansions for lack of the necessary trifle of gate money you are dr bonito began saint pray clearing his throat to the effort and flattered in your memory of me monsieur interrupted the doctor with a little bow which seemed to creak at the joints as you will recollect i read nativities i foretell events however a capricious destiny may alter her tactics to procure them for instance you will remember i prophesied the consequences of a certain achievement which prediction was none the less verified because as it happened paradoxically the consequences anticipated the achievement what then it is the end which justifies the seer the lady you will scarcely deny is a widow at this moment saint pray put his hand to his pocket you want money he said hoarsely the other stopped him with dignity a loan is the word monsieur a little oil for the lamp a little grease for the wheel une pingle par jour a sprat to catch a whale you observe where you passed me just now he pointed to the bureau my star culminates there monsieur in a week so surely as the heavens cannot lie the numbers revealed at the next drawing will spell my apotheosis in the meanwhile one even a seer must buy ones promotion the gods are very human i have only approached this climax at the cost of all my little savings if you will condescend to drink a glass of vermouth with me i will explain there is a caf hard by and the night is cold louis marie seemed drained of will or resolution a flaccid half dead creature he followed whither he was told and drank his vermouth and lixir de china one glass then another and another a spark woke at last in his ash blue eyes bonito watching it kindled reassured the fates after all have been kind to you monsieur he said gently touching the others arm with a long thin finger as a spider experiments with a fly before he rolls it up there lives a spotless widow in le prieur and wealthy beyond words you could not yourself have managed it better if you had been a villain saint pray started half rose from his seat and sank down again if it is villainous to have lost belief in god he muttered i am a villain and no longer worthy to utter her name nor even to resent its utterance by you as you please said the doctor coolly i served virtue in serving m saint pray and so would serve again without asking thanks but to become an apostate and be damned at the instance of her whose name you are unworthy to utter that seems to me like meaning heterodox and acting paradox the spark had spread to louis maries cheek i desire monsieur he said loudly but quaveringly that you will state what you wish of me without further comment on my affairs bonito was not ruffled though immensely dry and articulate very well monsieur he said though you will forgive my proposing to amend your resolution by inserting the word present between the words further and comment the time will come perhaps when you will see my disinterestedness and your own interests more closely in the meanwhile i go wanting my gate money well for your apotheosis sir exactly by way of the lottery the last of my scrap metal like the sculptor cellinis in the crisis of his fortunes has gone into the mould it needs but a finishing contribution a final sacrifice and the perseus of my destiny will rise on winged feet other men have their systems worldly and fallible mine derives from the stars and is infallible saint pray laughed shakily starting to scoff but compromising with discretion his soul was always malleable by anothers strong conviction what then is this lottery he asked bonito threw up his hands in mock incredulity you have been in turin this month and have not discovered its distraction of distractions alas what a comment on your own the lottery i can explain it in a word the very grandeur of simplicity the art which conceals all art imagine monsieur a wheel which contains numbers up to ninety and a single zero within its hollow circumference of these numbers five are withdrawn weekly in turin or genoa turn about recorded and replaced well you or i select five numbers any after our fancy register them at a bureau and receive a counter check in exchange now supposing two out of those our numbers shall occur in any one drawing we score an ambo and receive two hundred and seventy times the amount of our stake if three or a tern we receive it multiplied five thousand five hundred times if four or a quatern sixty thousand times on the other hand if no such combination occurs we forfeit our stake to renew it if we please week by week month by month year by year there is no end and no limit enfin the zero occurring in any drawing forfeits all stakes of that week to the government there are complications such as distributing ones chances over the five numbers but the principle is what i say i throw for a quatern and i shall gain it its sum will be relatively the sum which you shall be good enough to advance me join with me if you will and foreclose on fortune you will be rich presently beyond the dreams of parsimony wealth attracts wealth you will lose nothing thereby if i may say it as a suitor wise men are often ready to listen to empirics who cite the occult with an air of finality louis marie was not very wise and was thereby the nearer superstition his faith had told him to discredit soothsayers but for the time he had lost his faith like all good men thrown from their self respect he greatly exaggerated his own potentialities for wickedness this man he thought had rightly foretold a misfortune might he not with equal certainty predict a fortune there was some material balm in that if he was to lose his soul would not to gain the world better compensate the interval than a life of inglorious brooding as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb he called the words to memory with a new sense of daring what a folly was piety a hair shirt on a heathen preordained to damnation it was no god no father who could set snares for the feet of his children there was no god unless a prince of evil let him serve the chance live the world and the lottery the spirit he had drunk revelled in his starved unaccustomed brain he thrust his hand into his pocket and drawing out all it contained offered the sum to bonito with a half maudlin laugh half for myself and half for you then he said i make you my broker with fate the sum was large enough to awaken a glitter in the rosicrucians cold eyes something the nearest approach to warmth which his heart was capable of feeling tickled in his breast he showed for the moment quite genial quite impulsive always understand monsieur he said that i am actuated by the most earnest desire to serve you we have a point of sympathy in our common wronging by one who shall be nameless let me here suggest with only the lightest touch on a sensitive place that women generally are not attracted by extreme ethical correctness nor won by diffidence so much as overbearance believe my sincerity when i assure you that nothing would gratify me more than to see the ultimate accomplishment of a union to which no bar but that of sentiment can ever something some shadow of reawakening terror in the face opposite him warned him that it would be present wisdom to pursue the subject no further he doubled instantly but i will say no more there he interrupted himself it is enough for the moment that i undertake to prove myself he touched the pocket of his coat your efficient friend and steward an uproar of approaching voices broke upon his word the caf hitherto had been but thinly peopled mostly by weather stressed citizens who had been conversing apart low and rapid on the subject of the eternal lottery while they sipped their liqueurs or bacchierino and flourished their cigarettes back and forth to their lips now cartouche exclaimed someone and the sombre quietude seemed instantly to splinter into light the mirrors cleared to reflect it the sensuous figures in the pictures woke to a bacchanalian dance louis marie stared speechless at his companion who for his part appeared as dumbfoundered sentite he muttered scaramucchio si vero the tumult as he spoke had broken in running with the feet and voices of half a score young men a contingent truculent and vivacious of the bellimbusti or bloods of turin and in the midst appeared cartouche commanding insolent policing a captive a youth of the same guild but unlike the rest in a state of moral and physical collapse he the latter struggled sobbing hysterically in the determined grasp of his gaoler while the others hovered cackling and circling about their neighbourhood listen my severo said cartouche thou shalt drink first and destroy thyself afterwards if thou wilt he has lost his whole fortune in the lottery whispered one onlooker to another the wretched boy fought to escape i will drink the river he gasped no dog shall prevent me cartouches hold tightened call me not a dog little severo he said or perchance i may show my teeth be wise while there is time there are beer and grassini still in turin and trollops enough at a penny beggary will yet buy thee all that fortune is worth but the silly gilding nay he darkened if thou wilt be stubborn for death insult me i am more certain than the river and save at least thy immortal soul the boy writhing round and sputtering with his lips managed to strike his captor lamely on the cheek the next moment he was free and cowering into himself the wind all clapped out of his heroics the whole company stood silent and aghast cartouche unbuttoned and slipped off his surtout hung it over a chair adjusted the ruffs at his neck and wrists smoothed a crease from his slim black undercoat and shifted the bright steel hilt of his sword an inch or two forward all quite quietly and deliberately then he spoke with a very soft courtesy that was the pious course little severo now shalt thou compromise with thy maker for no more than a spell of purgatory it will not be much i doubt with one so excusable for his youth his blade came out with a silk like swish death in the venomous sound hissed into the youngsters ears he looked up his face as white as paper i seek the river not thy sword m trix he quavered that is unfortunate because i seek thy life little severo the boy looked round fearfully his companions set and terrible hedged him from the door he gave all up in a pitiful cry i was wrong i dont want to die cartouche i dont really want to die that is sad indeed said cartouche you will have to summon all your resolution his face changed suddenly will you draw sir he said sternly or am i to cut your throat like a sheeps it is murder cried the boy i call all to witness it is murder some exclamations of contempt alone answered him rallying under the shame to a last agony of resolution he drew his sword and advanced his under lip was shaking and dribbling the bosom of his linen was torn he looked like a death sick girl the blades crossed cartouche held his motionless a moment while the others vibrated on it like a castanet an answering small laugh went up then he engaged deftly in a wicked little prelude of cats play and then it was at least as great a shock to him as to any other to hear a sudden leap and rush and see his sword torn from his hand and flung to the ground for the moment a fury of hell flew to his eyes and blinded them the next he saw louis marie standing before him white and terrible and denunciatory save thou thine own soul shrieked saint pray nor lose it saving this childs o my brother drive me not to this last despair of cursing all i have loved give me the boys life a stun of utter stupefaction had fallen on the company for the instant everything stood stricken a strange and pregnant tableau but in the still hearts of all was a terror of the inevitable crash which must rend in an instant the appalling hush to their confusion scarcely less astounded the crash did not follow but instead miracle of things the disarmed one drew a deep breath and smiled it is a trifle take it my brother he said even with the word he saw saint pray sway where he stood he darted forward and put a strenuous arm about him what is it louis he whispered saint prays fluttering hands went feebly about his neck i have saved a life o god dear gaston tell me that i have saved a life he whispered in wild emotion cartouche glaring around caught sudden sight of bonito standing slack jawed in the gloom the doctor seeing himself discovered came forward hist he muttered our friend is in a poor way mr trix and needs looking after get him to come outside with us you have certainly saved a life brother murmured cartouche though i am afraid not a very worthy one then he said aloud to pass by your favour gentlemen but deal gently with my character i beg you i am still in evidence to answer for it chapter ii under the porticoes in the thronged fashionable heart of turin two men met by appointment before the city was well awake their encounter was sharp to the point and made nothing of superfluous courtesies by your favour mr trix opened one we will eschew idle discussion of coincidences all roads lead to rome i am here you are here he is here and we have gravitated naturally into each others company what have you done with him why do you want to know friend bonito is not that rather amusing i encounter him we renew an intimacy in the middle of it you appear and appropriate him to your exclusive possession i undertook at the same time to answer to you for my claim i named the place and hour i am here to vindicate myself everything is convenient for a settlement bah will you never learn my indifference to such gasconade if you had struck me in the face i would not fight you no you would have procured an assassin to murder me i expect certainly i should my life and reputation are of infinitely more importance than yours men of sense have to consider these things only fools argue with swords what a miserable self confession you had better call yourself a fool at once well im not sure but you are right then if you see it you are no fool no more am i if you admit that you admit also that you are only withholding from me information which i can with a little trouble procure elsewhere you really may as well tell me what you have done with m saint pray perhaps i will tell you then but i should just as really like to be convinced of your reason for wishing to know for one thing i am his agent to the lottery and answerable to him for an investment which in less than a week is to bring us both certain fortune holy mother you are there are you i thought from the look of his face that you had been painting it with moonshine you are very welcome to a share of the gilding if you wish for old friendships sake i will place you too in possession of the winning numbers no i think not thank you you have put me a little out of conceit with the stars how what have i done why i think sometimes they get to depend too much on the human agencies which interpret them act up to arbitrary prophecies or anyhow are made to seem to o besides apart from myself i fail to see your interest in making m saint prays fortune for him things have altered with you certainly did we not once discuss his eligibility as a suitor well what was enough for mademoiselle de france is less than worth the consideration of the marchesa di rocco what you propose proportionately to restore to him his eligibility thats it exactly what advantage would success bring you i dont know if i mentioned that i was his agent o i see i see i beg your pardon his matrimonial agent of course that reassures me i confess at first i was sceptical of such altruism but heres my bonito well we are one there if from different sentiments and does he know of your intentions towards him the fates forbid i understand you it is quite plain that he wants nursing reassuring coaxing back into a measure of self confidence he is a desponding spirit thats the truth and determined to read his scrap of purgatory into utter damnation well i have answered you will you tell me where he is certainly i will your sentiments being what they are i have persuaded him to place himself under the healing care of the virtuous signorina brambello your bonito exclaimed and grinned you are certainly very silly or very deep he said how do you propose to speed his recovery that way she is a very good and sensible girl no doubt and a very pretty i must use my instruments they do not comprise many madonnas but why a womans arguments are everything in these matters she will convince his diffidence if any can of what that fortune has been very obliging to him how in giving him such a confessor well if you were worth my steel i am not i assure you i wish her the last success naturally if she encourages him to the venture and better if he prospers in it there will be none better pleased than i fate certainly has already interfered very opportunely in his behalf it would be criminal to forego that advantage believe me i shall do nothing for my part to balk the signorina what goodness but it is not always necessary to give fate the credit for opportuneness in this case for example one might suggest more than one explanation of a mystery of di roccos death you mean it is quite true we should consider the evidence of motives first perhaps there is none more powerful than revenge or with an astrologer the wish to verify the reading of his astrolabes he had certainly done you a great unkindness my friend and you no less my friend what do you suggest that i killed him with a reason quite as plausible as yours in accusing me i have not accused you nor i you no more you have there was no need he died plainly of an accident of the treachery of the elements i shall hope to call the elements to account for it some day well if we have no quarrel seer bonito addio he went off singing lightly bonito stood a moment looking after him wintry and caustic he thinks i did it he muttered the fool not to know me better let him beware if he once goads me to reprisals chapter iii there was a jumble of old streets and buildings in turin flourishing out of sight behind the palazzo reale like a scrap of wild thicket overlooked in the reclamation of a waste which to the many enamoured of orderliness and respectability was a scandal and to the few having an eye for haphazard picturesqueness the solitary oasis in a desert of uniformity this irregular quarter called lanonimo possessed the qualities of its heterodoxy and was consistent in nothing but its moral unconformableness it was not so much a rookery as a hive whence gold ringed donnaccias flew to gather their honey and having collected came back to store it against a winters day in their unconventual little cells it was always very vivid and very busy a never ending fair full of life and frivolity its stalls displayed a characteristic opulence of cheap parisian hosiery and genoese jewellery white ankles twinkled for ever in its doorways its stones were dinted with the clatter of little gilded heels it had its own cafs and its lottery office of course and its government shops for the sale of salt and tobacco for even nonconformity had to subscribe to the relentless gabelle finally it had its drones but they for the most part loafed at home it was not so very bad this quarter even at its heart and rippled into less and less expression of itself the further one got from it like the concentric rings extending from a splash in water at quite a little distance it began to merge into a compromise with order became a sort of sedate st johns wood until down by the dora it lapped itself away in an unimpeachable colony of washerwomen in the meanwhile flowing down by many outlets it threaded none prettier than that which was called the lane of chestnuts and of all the whitewashed maisonnettes in that same fragrant alley the signorina brambellos was assuredly the whitest and most sweet it this little house was called the capanna sermollino which means wild thyme cottage and it looked and smelt up to its name its walls were the shrine to a candid heart its jalousies were of the green of nature and its mistress whose beauty and perfume had come straight out of an english village was molly bramble bona roba nothing worse and nothing better poor molly once a rustic toast queen of a single may and then alas stolen to what she stood no further from honour now than by the thickness of a screen of convention loyalty faith honesty these were all hers unimpaired you could not look in her eyes and doubt it her shame was one mans possession near enough to the virtue of wifehood to be forgotten by her except perhaps in the presence of children cartouche was to answer for it all she was lovely of course her face like a human face sketched by some amorous puck was a little out of drawing a dear imperfection of prettiness but the artist had rubbed its cheeks with real conserve of roses and painted in its eyes with blue succory petals and scented its rich brown hair with fragrance from the oakwoods lanonimo even in its purlieus could hardly have justified a claim to molly bramble i never hear your name spoken molly mia said cartouche but it seems to bring a whiff of blackberries across the footlights she was dressed in a clean lilac sprigged muslin with a fichu soft as milkmaids half sheathing the white budding of her womanhood a mob cap sat at grace on her pretty curls a pity that her atmosphere was all of spring which perishes so soon molly had no arts to reap loves winter cartouche spoke took a pride in speaking english like a native mollys frenchings were as sweet an imperfection as her lips she laughed busy at the table preparing his breakfast coffee and chocolate mixed in a little glass and garnished with a number of tiny rolls like pipe stems and i never hear yours she said without thinking of a silly fellow she took a chair by him while he ate and drank he did it all daintily but she would have watched him with as much delight if he had guzzled like a hog it is all one to a woman whether her baby is nice or gluttonous but i have known a man turn disgusted from a ravenous infant cartouche sat preoccupied a long time nibbling his rusks suddenly he looked up dark and troubled why have you such a sweet face ma mie he said i wish i had never brought a blush to it she started up and went to the table again affecting business there then she turned and her lashes were winking let that flea stick in the wall she said id rather you had its blushes than its frowns her under lip was trembling a little as she came again and knelt at his feet what is it cherry she said looking wistfully into his face theres something i know something different since you since you is it anything to do with that fellow you brought here last night no yes he answered perhaps i cant say well i mustnt ask i suppose she said youve taught me not to though its made me cry my eyes out sometimes if youre bad dear i dont want you anything else its like a man he he doesnt want to take you from me does he she nestled her face willy nilly between his unresisting hands to take you he said distressfully his code isnt mine molly i daresay hed like to like a man quotha its like a blockish boy rather to make a toy of love a doll out of a goddess he wouldnt have done it she uttered a faint cry then he does want to separate us how can he little fool he doesnt know you even o you frightened me so love your molly cherry he had taught her early to call him chri which on her sweet fruitful lips had become cherry and so her love had christened him kent was her county i have shown my reverence for love he said sadly by desecrating its host i have broken open its tabernacle and eaten the sacred bread because it was forbidden a greedy blockish boy molly she wrung her hands to him what is it everything seems wrong i saw it in your face last night the moment you and he came in and me near crazed with joy to hear you at the door again o cherry after all these months he smoothed the hair from her temples thats it dear heart he whispered after all these months well rest satisfied id not been in turin twelve hours before i came to you she pouted gave a little tearful laugh o a fine coming to charge me with a tipsy gentleman poor louis marie is that his name saint pray to you madam if you please ill tell you of him in a moment hed lost his head but not his legs la now he wont bless its finding im thinking i warrant it aches this morning you shall ask him hell be down anon to greet his landlady let him lie on for me its only you i want and a tongue to say ten thousand things at once where have you come from le prieur that takes let me see how long it took me a month a month i came on foot i loitered by the road i had ten thousand things not to say but ponder cherry she looked at him amazed a shadow of some sick foreboding would not leave her heart she had never yet known him her gentleman her fond hearts tyrant in this strangely sober mood go on she whispered wont you tell me what he said of my adventures by the way i had one or two once a thunderstorm overtook me near a village some children hurrying for the church bade me come and help them ring the bells to keep the lightning off i smiled the poor rogues away cried i should attract it rather and went on the bells were already clapping behind me when there came a flash and crash the tower had been struck and every mothers infant of them killed the devil fends his own or perhaps he is as blind as justice well i stayed to see them put in the ground and i cried a little molly cry now with me darling o cherry the poor dears another time i passed some peasants preparing to fill in an old well a little whimper came out of its depths while i watched only a cur monsieur that has fallen in they said they were going to shovel the earth atop of him without a care i asked them to lower me and they did and presently up we came together he set his teeth in my hand the little weasel and i called him belette for it see the mark here it was only because his leg was broken and i hurt it there was a bone setter in the village an old toothless hecuba a lady youve not heard of she could mend bone if she couldnt graft it on her withered gums belette was made whole by her and i waited out his cure when he was done with the rascal came along with me eager to show that he had adopted me for ever hes thy rival for my love mollinda and ill kiss him for it if thats all he did not answer immediately is it not all she urged and staring at him sank away sitting on her heels no its not all she whispered gulping theres more youve got to say dont i understand its the old lord has got a match for you and im to go speak out and be a man is he here did he come with you hes dead cartouche rose and went hurriedly up and down a dozen times in silence before he stopped and spoke to her again where she crouched upon the floor hes dead and so my wages end she put out groping hands to find his feet he heard her sobbing and whispering ill work for you then he knelt and touched her and spoke to her very tenderly not so bad as that you shall work for me indeed but not with these soft hands listen while i tell you how he died and why god killed him and what is the moral of it all to me she turned her ear to him one arm like the rustic griselda she was bent across her weeping face but his first words seemed to catch her breath back and fill out her bosom holding her dumb from speech and tears alike there was a lady in le prieur called the lily because she was so sweet and pure of heart she was of an ancient family but poor the child of a proud cold man she had pledged her love unknown to her father to a stranger of modest means a soul as good and pious as she but the man was weak of purpose and delayed to confess himself to the parent then came di rocco doating and asked her hand of her father and she was given to him on condition that he settled everything he possessed on her and that the marriage was to be one in form only for the space of a year and the poor child was forced in a moment into complying and she became di roccos wife and a broken hearted woman she sought refuge defying her father now that it was done in a little auberge on the hills and thither her husband scorning his vow followed her secretly one stormy night in order to force her to his will but heaven intervened before he could accomplish his vile purpose and he went astray on the ice and fell into a crevasse and was killed he paused the girl did not speak for a minute her mind was still loitering on the road to that tragic conclusion di roccos death was only of relative interest to her her first word showed it is she prettier than i am cartouche smiled she is only an angel ma mie but eligible eligible have you forgotten her lover she clasped her hands looking for the first time breathlessly into his face i know now its him there upstairs yes he said its him why doesnt he go and claim her then shes better worth the winning than she was soberly my girl its early yet to rake over the weeds besides there are broken faiths to mend he took his jilting hardly an angel himself shed been his goddess hes down in the mud at present these sanctities are always for extremes theres no middle course for them the devils the gentleman for moderation thats why hes so convincing we must nurse up this friend of mine between us restore him to reason shes better worth his winning says you no doubt but by the token miles further removed from a poor suitor thats nothing if they love she spoke it impulsively and stopped poor she whispered suddenly whats his ruin to that shes brought upon my sweetheart so the old mans gone and left you nothing no fault of hers child dont breathe or think it yes he had to put his house in order settle old scores before he asked new grace he parted with me the day before his death hed already sent bonito packing you know him the old hungry dog he got his masters curse for wages i at least got a handful of jewels why should i love his memory yet though he died justly it was not good that anyone should kill my father even then she hardly seemed to listen but she saw her lover moved beyond her knowledge of him and put her arms about his neck and entreated him passionately dont throw me over cherry not altogether give me enough to live on and keep good for her sake there ill say it if shes shown you what a woman ought to be he sat on the floor beside her and took her in his arms pressing her wet cheek against his own you shall understand he said much moved this ladys for my friend well bring him round to see it by and by we two but the lesson of her whiteness is for all am i cartouche to own it i only know shes taught me to respect something i never respected before to pay to keep you good my darling with a fortune if i had it thats it shall we be good together sweetest never never never sin again youve loved me one way will you love me better this own the wrong and renounce it show not her ive been wicked ill pray to god to forgive me hes a man his face twinkled hush he said our act of grace shall be to mend this tragedy with love thats why i brought him here you shall teach him the way dont you see molly cant you see all that that means she clung to him with a burst of tears o ill be good cherry and perhaps perhaps some day youll want to learn from me he heard a sound overhead and rising lifted her to her feet dry your eyes he whispered hes coming he mustnt find a wet blanketing hostess no she said ill get his coffee let me go o let me go i shall be right in a minute and she went hurriedly from the room a minute later louis marie came down his haggard face bright eyed out of fever but there was an expression on it such as one might imagine in the face of a convicted felon summoned to hear his reprieve such dreams gaston he said crossing the room eagerly but the dream of all was the dream that went to bed and woke with me i thought i had saved a life gaston that was no dream my friend louis marie came and fondled him smiling all the while his actions were marked by a curious haste and agitation as if in everything he were restless to hurry conclusions to spurn the passing moment to urge on the hands of time wasnt it he said what a meeting dear gaston my brother who would have dreamt of that and the occasion we are always saving lives between us it seems you more than i i expect isnt it strange i know so little about you and you my blood brother do you always lodge here when you come to turin generally your life your habits your story are all a shadow to me i cartouche interrupted him my story is told in a word louis marie would you like to hear it indeed i should very well it wont edify you im afraid but its quite right you should know the truth about me innocent souls like you are apt to take too much on trust to judge all men by their pure self standards its time perhaps you grew up louis marie nay gaston muttered his friend if to be grown up is to be wicked im a giant already prove yourself what you like the worse the nearer to me trix laughed listen to this then he said i was born in mayfair in london during the absence of my mother that was why she would never acknowledge me my father always believed that i was her son by him but as he was not her husband she had no difficulty in proving an alibi he may have been mistaken for he had many irons in the fire but the upshot of it for me was that as no one would claim me i was pronounced a changeling and put out to nurse from that state di rocco rescued me for reasons of his own i was very like him for one an extraordinary coincidence he brought me up and treated me as if i were his son paternity always came easy to him i grew up under his tutelage the result is what you see but in case its expression lacks eloquence i may tell you that i am a very accomplished person a scholar a wit a capital swordsman a rakehell and a star gazer there is no folly of which i am incapable but love no hypocrisy but self sacrifice i owe the world nothing but myself and that is a debt i pay back with interest on each occasion of its demand enfin i am your very faithful servant m louis he rose and bowed with a grace of mockery his feeling towards this blood brother of his was always mixed of devotion and contempt he could resist one no more than the other but he loved the poor fool that sentiment predominated saint pray looked down and away from him his jaw a little fallen at that moment his hostess entered carrying his bread and coffee he raised his head and saw her uttered an exclamation and then like a lost child who recognises a friend in a crowd suddenly burst into tears no it was certain that louis marie would never ascend mont blanc chapter iv and yolande of the white hands how was it faring with her the lily gathered to perfume a saturnalia the victim of as heartless a casuistry as ever committed a clean virgin to outrage when she first heard of di roccos fate and of the unspeakable treachery on which it had foreclosed she came for the moment as near a fall from grace as louis marie himself that duty to a father must be held the paramount duty his will the household law his judgment the ruling wisdom nature and religion in her had once held for the first principle of conduct honour self respect sworn faith these pious recommendations in themselves were if pledged without a fathers sanction vain credentials his curse could blight them all convert their virtues into sins from god the primal word had come in straight succession his power to bless or ban she had believed in this his right so truly as to cede her whole heart to him for immolation on the altar he had raised letting it break rather than incur his malediction but when having sacrificed these virtues to duty she saw her moral debasement argued from the act saw herself claimed by very virtue of it to the vile company of the un self respecting held its legitimate sport her soul stood up revolting from its creed she felt like one who self destroyed to save her honour wakes up in hell she shook she shuddered she went white as death she felt her feet in snares of celestial sophistry heaven had laughed to lure her to a church which when she entered it had proved a bagnio following gods lead she had foundered in a swamp and cleared her eyes to find herself the scoff of uncleanness to know herself valued at the common currency of the common road that this dead beast could have conceived a hope of her argued how in his eyes in the worlds eyes her souls dread sacrifice to duty had cheapened not exalted her he would not have dared the thought in the days before she had bared her white bosom to the knife her soul for the first time rushed to pity of isaac on his altar the fathers tragedy was all in all for history what of the harmless child the hideous revelation to him of what love could sacrifice to faith no after kindness could blot out that memory she hated herself at last not because she had hitherto been self absorbed worshipping her own whiteness but because she had not considered herself at all until this moment she hated her body a shrine on which her mind had never dwelt until it woke to see it foul a thing defiled in thought a prey of beastly dreams a shadow had dethroned her maidenhood henceforth she was yolande of the soiled hands no man perhaps could gauge her sense of shame or understand it she had suffered no wrong in act a miss in his blunt logic is always as good as a mile but that in the eyes of woman it is not she whose innocence has just shaved a scandal feels a like grievance against fate with her who has solicited and been rebuffed in each case it is the outrage upon the womans self respect which barbs the sting unworthy of her lover but how unworthy she had never dreamt until she saw herself this lure to low desire she had not even been coveted for anything she had cherished in herself of moral sweetness the moral of all sweetness was carnality she had walked with uplifted eyes praising god and had trodden on an adder for the future she would look down to guard her feet it was all a chimera that figure of a beneficent father meting out justice and mercy protection and reward the lamb in the fold was cherished to make good mutton and the shepherds love watched and warded him to that end no picture of christ carrying home the strayed weanling could cover that flaw in its divine symbolism so with the pious aphorisms which were thrown in the eyes of men by interested priestcrafts to blind them from the truth god helped those who helped themselves yes who helped themselves unscrupulously to the best and least they desired a bold thief was always popular in heaven the lord was a lord of bandits she had but to run upon this blasphemy at last to recoil gasping and half stunned from the dead wall of it whither had her madness led her into what dreadful wanderings from the fold she had sped blindly in the mist and struck her forehead against hells gate o father rescue thy lost lamb so bleating to the wolves of her betrayal didst thou not make a pit fall for the dog wolf himself so that her fleece might escape his soilure and her flesh his ravening and her gratitude was this to cry out upon thee because thou hadst let a beasts thought expose her to herself for beast yet what else indeed were she or any other save for the measure of thy purifying spirit in her i have disowned him she thought and by that act alone become the beast his spirit once redeemed in me she believed then that she had committed the unpardonable sin the sin against the holy ghost for days she lay prostrated tended only by the little aubergiste poor margot who had meanwhile her own difficulties to contend with gossips to face and baffle little lungings of innuendo to counterfoil a drunken parent to answer for the world was restless about that refuge on the hills great issues were at stake there the law the church the home were all deeply interested in the potentialities of those white hands this unattached star of maidenhood had become at a stroke of heaven the centre of a system the lesser bodies enormously attracted to it spun and circled round incessantly but for the present it was obstinate in veiling itself in clouds from their worship how long was her retreat to last for how long would it be countenanced by those most concerned in terminating it no convention of seemly mourning could apply to such a widow widowed of a love before a husband le prieur did not expect that hypocrisy of her but it wanted its marchesa during all these days her father politicly kept aloof awaiting the first signal of her surrender to him he had learnt his lesson and recognised how any approaches from him would but aggravate the malady of her despair target kept him at very little cost informed of madamas state and in the meanwhile he made a judicious ostentation of his poverty implying see me here the natural trustee of thousands condemned by a childs undutifulness to go in mended boots his patience under suffering made an impression but presently quicker than his soles it wore out he would not climb the hill himself but he commissioned a deputy in the person of dr paccard shrewd and kindly to put a case for him the old man gained access to the patient by a ruse m saint prays landlord begged a word with her was the message he sent in and found her lying like a sweet thing thrown up by the sea white and just breathing she saw directly that the mad hope on which her heart had leaped was but another shadow of the shadows which were haunting her her eyes absorbed his soul he uttered some commonplaces of his craft she stopped him why did you send in that message he blushed and stammered then rushed characteristically for the truth i feared you would refuse to see me else i lodged m saint pray it is true and loved and respected him we are homely people i and my daughter martha it was that simple quality which most endeared us to him what he chiefly valued in my girl was the domestic probity which attached her first of all sentiments to the sentiment of filial duty old man i will not go home to my father o madama let me speak one even a marchesa i am not a marchesa one i say even a high lady may profit by the example of simplicity do i not know i yes very well that marthas heart is engaged outside her duty what then shes loyal to duty it is young balmat is it not wed her elsewhere sell her clean body for a price then come and tell me what she pays to duty i was as good as martha he ignored her bitter words urging his point across the interruption even a great thing for her ill say where duty is so tedious just a little daily routine the house the kitchen the conduct of small affairs there might be compensation else in such a state great compensation even where the life the happiness the salvation of many souls depended on one womans trust and example she held him with her tragic eyes theres no salvation possible by way of me tell the chevalier monsieur if you speak for him as i assume is your commission to charge himself with all that duty the lives the title the estates the administration of them all and leave me to give him thanks and die in peace hell find full compensation for duty im sure in what duty has bequeathed him please will you go now and take him that message never i say never madama this is a bad revolt i am old and i will say it is it do you imagine in your perversity to show honour to an honoured memory if you think so i will dare to say that i knew a noble heart better than you yourself and i speak in its name when i mourn your refusal to take up your cross like a christian thanking god for having spared you the weight of an irreparable injury to its burden she sat up with glittering eyes you insult me she began and burst into heart rending tears he let the fit run out before he spoke again gently my old heart bleeds for your young tragedy but believe my word by so much as i am nearer the grey shore which seems to you now so far it is not measureless if these thoughts were possible to your heart the all seeing was doubtless wise to forewarn it with a chastisement which even yet was not the worst lower your head come down from this false humility which only mocks at heaven if your feet for flesh is proud who can know it better than i falter from the whole descent at once make your first halt half way with martha and myself live with us a little i say at least for my own advantage because indeed people would be sure to point at me for a self interested politician and that would hurt my honest fame but come i say come down from these heights where your heart is locked in ice and where the ghost of a dead wickedness holds it frozen with his frozen eyes looking up through the dark window of his grave she was staring at him quite bloodless but her lips whispered mechanically i cannot i cannot come to you how can you pray or think aright he said or keep your health or reason with that horror hidden perhaps but a stones throw below you there its spirit rises like an evil emanation its she stopped him staggering to her feet what fearful picture was he conjuring in all her stunned misery her mind had never once turned to the appalling thought of her close neighbourhood to that baffled evil it had dwelt and dwelt in mad iteration on an earlier figure on the tragedy of a fruitless sacrifice on death as it might find her in the hills but now to find her perhaps trip her on the thought and entomb her was there in all that vast cemetery of ice a corner remote enough from him to keep their souls divorced horrors thronged into her brain once breached what if her clinging to this spot were construed into devotion to his memory what if he were not dead after all but were slowly toiling upwards to the light from some pit into which he had fallen she had heard of things as strange what wilder terror if he had never even suffered such a catastrophe but were hiding somewhere out of knowledge to descend presently upon his traducers and blight them with his mockery it had always seemed inconsistent with his character as resourceful as it was wicked to let itself astray in the little confusion of a storm instead of crouching while that passed she thought no more tried to shut out all thought shuddering with her hands against her eyes the doctor saw his advantage we have an empty room he said endeared to us by a memory come down madama and take possession of that memory he would have wished it she went with him that marked the first step in her surrender the next was inevitable fruit of a royal commission it was not to be supposed that a wealthy and powerful noble of the state new reconciled with its government too could be allowed to disappear thus mysteriously and no inquiry held turin sent its juges dinstruction and officers of probate and verification to look into the affair they examined innumerable witnesses and into as many as possible motives cartouche they would have liked to question but he was gone none knew whither so also was louis marie so also was bonito the thing might have taken an ugly turn so far as any of the three was concerned had not nicholas target been opportunely pinched at the psychologic moment he focussed the mystery for them brought it into form and coherence it appeared after all to be one to be hushed up rather than ventilated the matter ended for the widow with official sympathy and congratulations and she how had she stood the long ordeal they said her bearing was the very majesty of pathos like dorothea before her judges again one can keep ones countenance under torture as the statistics of martyrdom prove but every allusion to her assumed acquiescence in her own tragedy had been a white hot rake to her side they imagined her stately fortitude was a pose a compromise between decency and the exaltation her heart could not but feel over the thought of what she had escaped and the prospect before her that she must not undeceive them must suffer the onus of coveting a position which her whole soul loathed and rejected was not the least part of her anguish even if she had ventured to assert herself to call them to witness to her renunciation of all which they held so covetable her father was there to stultify her protests she saw him daily spoke to him even but there was a gulf between them the atmosphere it exhaled was felt by the commissioners and felt to be inexplicable some commiseration was shown for the victim of so unnatural a misunderstanding his noble candour in giving evidence his dignified endurance of that implied slander on his disinterestedness excited a measure of sympathy even of sympathetic indignation yet for all his public vindication as a father the triumph of his childs cause seemed only to deepen the abyss which separated him from her well a thing grown past bearing is a thing ended the torture consummated itself at last in anti climax in the official citation of augias marchese di rocco to the court of inquiry there to answer and show cause why yolande di rocco ne de france should not enter into possession of his estates as his widow and sole inheritrix which summons the appellee having failed to answer the will was declared proved the lawyers returned to turin and the lady to the privacy of her lodgings at dr paccards and so the matter ended at least so it seemed to it was a unique situation on the one side great houses great wealth great stakes in the country and a fluttering crew of prospectors waiting to negotiate their values for the benefit of a mistress who disregarded them all on the other the mistress herself living in humble lodgings on a few centesimi a day and this state of things held for quite a month after the inquiry it makes you an important person said jacques balmat to martha you are approached and courted like a queens confidante i hope your silly little head will not be turned by it all jacques she is dying of love and what right have you or i to say that she ought to live the right my girl of dutiful children to uphold the natural law she too is not so independent but she must owe her father a life it makes no difference that he crossed her plans for herself besides are we so certain that one we will not name has made himself unworthy of her it rests on our conjecture and that is the devils word for scandal they whisper that the old man is dying my god what is that you say i only repeat what i have heard it is that madamas obstinacy is slowly killing him it is certainly aggravating when one is starving to see a fine feast spread just out of ones reach martha went with her information straight to yolande that marchioness of shadows was a good deal altered during the last month grief where a flawless constitution defies its corrosion retaliates by turning all into stone she was white and unimpressionable as a statue martha dared an ultimatum you would blame yourself i am sure my lady if death were suddenly to end the misunderstanding between you and your father the blue unearthly eyes were turned swift upon her with a look of horror death she whispered o said martha weeping chagrin will kill a cat what is it do you think to lie starving and abandoned outside the walls of the paradise you have staked your soul to win abandoned repeated the other it is all his he knows it to do what he likes with she had assumed indeed that all this time her father was established at the chteau martha threw up her hands protesting do you pretend to believe that he so proud and stern has accepted a trust bestowed on him like that but believe it if you like he will not be long in unconvincing you give me my cloak do you hear my god how slow you are thus was negotiated yolandes third and final step to self surrender she hurried through the familiar streets a reincarnate ghost shocked from her grave by a cry as superhuman as the one which stirred the dead in old jerusalem a cry of mortal desolation god spare her the revelation which might have come to them the knowledge that she had out died her welcome the place seemed strange there was an air of dust and neglect about the htel the face of the woman who answered her summons was unfamiliar a smug frowzy laying out face in suggestion the girl could hardly articulate the words which strove for utterance on her lips but commanding herself she asked at last and was a little reassured yes the chevalier was in bed in a poor enough way but curable no doubt by one who knew the secret of his disorder she hurried upstairs to him entered his room with a choking heart he was lying back propped on pillows his face was stern and wintry with a rime of unshorn hair on its jaws his eyes cold and unscrutinising were like globes of frog spawn each with a black staring speck of life for pupil a withered crone ostentatiously unclean was dishing up for the patient a thin broth of herbs reason might have questioned of the meaning of her presence or of the soups poor quality de france was under no necessity for retrenchment just because he had been disappointed of a handsome legacy in trust but remorse has no reason yolande saw nothing here but the tragic figure of an ambition her perversity had doomed a dignified presence may command so much more than its due of sympathy for the common crucifyings of circumstance majesty covers a multitude of meannesses she fell on her knees by the bed father i have come to make my peace with you the pupils of the chevaliers eyes turned darkly on the suppliant dilated imperceptibly who is this who enters to disturb my resignation i have made my peace with heaven no no father no no i am yolande thy daughter thy one poor child know me and forgive me i have done wrong o my father i have been wicked and undutiful but god has cleared my eyes his own were brightening wonderfully the specks were grown to tadpoles he snapped at the wheezy beldame with a sudden viciousness that almost made her drop the dish begone thou old prying gossip what dost thou here pricking thy mouldy ears she scuttled he held out a waxen hand yolande imprisoned and devoured it art thou my child he said i had thought she had abandoned me indeed she wept bowing her head and mumbling not abandoned only to that i thought your soul desired the place the riches the the honour i had never supposed but you possessed them all managed administered them for you my daughter even my love must reject a trust so offered what honour could survive that imputation of self interest i would have consented to be your steward else faithful on a crust if love and confidence had sweetened it but it does not matter now nothing matters any longer since my child is here a penitent to reconcile me with the thought of our separation father o my god i have not deserved it look i will nurse you back to health and peace of mind i will be so humble and so loving father do not die he questioned her face searchingly he saw her heart was his so surely that any further fencing before he pierced it would serve but to prolong his luxury of triumph yet he fenced to nurse me he said smiling weak and saintly a simple task yolande even the remnant of fortune left me after my debts are paid might crown my few last days with feasting if i wished it but my wants are soon supplied only live dear father and your fortune she stopped shuddering and buried her face in the bedclothes he scanned the back of her head curiously my fortune he echoed ah i had once dreamed my fortune might have lain in helping to turn great evil into a blessing i had seen in my fond imagination churches enriched charities endowed all that wealth and power had used to evil ends converted to measureless good but it was a fantastic dream we exalt ourselves no doubt in planning for the human emancipation god has rebuked my vanity she lifted her flowing eyes to him had you had such dreams o father be my almoner then and let me live on the crust he stroked her hair rapturously murder would out at last you put new life into me he murmured you shall live on what you like only for appearances sake my child make yourself the nominal minister of that atonement and on these terms he carried her off to the chteau chapter v the royal palace of turin situated off the piazza castello in the east or distinguished quarter of the city epitomised in itself the policy of the savoyard rule externally it was as unpretentious a pile as any brick built factory or shall we say for the sake of apt analogy as our own original south kensington museum for in like manner with that illustrious emporium did the utilitarian face which it turned to the street afford no clue whatever to its inner meaning it was just a countenance dressed for the demos a sop of unostentation offered to that triple headed sleuth hound it was certainly unelating as an architectural composition but then we know by the story that the plain pear is often the most luscious beauty saith the sage a plain fellow himself no doubt is but skin deep that is an aphorism as untrue as many another but take it for what it is worth and ugliness by the like measure is also skin deep the palazzo reale at least was like its later south kensington parallel a very museum of treasures contained within a mean casket they were of all sorts from a benvenuto salver or a suit of mail worn by an enormous armiger at the battle of pavia to the individual kit of m dupr who had been le dieu de la danse in the supreme days of turins gaiety those perhaps were fled for ever as a characteristic and prerogative of privilege but their reactionary spirit lingered on awaiting revitalisation in the dumb strings of the great dancers fiddle i am not sure but that the present representative of the house did not hold this instrument among the first of his treasures it symbolised for him his beautiful ideal of humanity frolicking in an arcadian estate watteau gillot and the fte galante were always figured in the dim backgrounds of his policy he yearned to educate democracy with a harpsichord and pelt it into silence with roses he was not altogether a bad little fellow for his fifty seven years only his ideals were expensive and of course supremely unpractical while seeing very clearly that arcadia was only to be reached through education he endowed and encouraged learning quite handsomely he stultified all the effects of his liberality by conceding to hereditary prejudice the whole conduct of his government he did not walk with the world in fact and so it walked into him the palace in the meanwhile was as sumptuous within as it was bare without mr trix entering towards it one fine september morning by the gates opening from the piazzo castello tasted in some curious anticipation the possible flavour of the fruit hidden behind that uncompromising rind he was waiting by private command on his sovereign and the occasion the first of its kind to him found him by no means so possessed by its importance as that his self possession was moved thereby to yield an iota of its serenity he was received with consideration at a private door to which he was directed and after the slightest delay ushered straight into the presence of victor amadeus the monarch was seated at a secretaire heavily gilt and with painted panels talking or dictating to a little fat bedizened aide de camp who wrote apart at a littered table and who was so buried in bullion that he might have been taken for the first lord of the treasury just emerged from a dip into one of its coffers the royal toilet itself was a nglig dressing gown embroidered slippers and bare close cropped head all very gimp and finical shrewd wizened narrow victor amadeuss face a dough white flexuous nosed long chinned under jawed little affair perked up from its collar of white ermine like a beedy eyed condors thought was engraved on it in a number of thready wrinkles like cracks in parchment the deepest owed themselves to profound self searchings on such questions as the conduct of court precedents of royal hunts of ceremonial and pageantry the slightest might record some difficult moments accorded to the size of a button or the claims of the subversive shoe tie over the constitutional buckle to find the royal countenance simply vacant was to know the royal mind concentrated on affairs of state those might include the potentialities of the lottery the friendship of cousin louis of france a new uniform for the army it is certain that they never excluded the necessity of some new drain upon the exchequer victor amadeus recognised very clearly that the true evolution of man is in his clothes and he was right in a way it seems impossible to advocate even so much or so little as a return to nature without wanting to dress up to the part he was a petit mitre in short of the first rank and the most fastidious taste who had spent his reigning life in offering himself a leading example of refinement to his subjects he was something better than a benevolent caligula he went on dictating now while mr trix standing just within the doorway by which he had entered awaited passively his royal pleasure write my dear polisson said the king that as regards the pont beauvoisin over the guier we cannot consent to the abolition of the double toll to leave savoy may be a necessity to enter france may be necessity but two necessities do not make one privilege on the other hand two privileges make a certain necessity that of paying for both the gilded scribe raised his head and little screw eyes m polisson was terribly short sighted but was forbidden the use of spectacles because of their ugliness i must recall to your majesty he said that the petition dates from dauphiny chou pour chou said the king would it rob me the less because it would also rob king louis of his half of the perquisites to concede it would be to concede the first principle of the octroi the keystone is a small part of the arch but remove it and what then tell me that m polisson the secretary still ventured a deferential protest your majestys duchy of savoy is ultramontane it is perhaps infected a little through its contiguity with revolutionary doctrines its predilections as your majesty knows have always been for french arms french arts french sentiments it may happen to have imbibed some of the worthless with the sound a little concession to unrest would not make unrest more unrestful the king took snuff from a jewelled box that was a clumsy iteration my charming polisson said he but all concessions are an admission of weakness if we slacken the curb we shall presently be run away with be careful of that pouncet box or you will spill it on the carpet and make an unpleasant dust besides it was given me by a very pretty child and i love children but sire say no more m polisson is the document prepared all the while he was talking the corner of his eye was given to mr trix now he turned a little and said quite suddenly that is a very pretty idea of the earrings monsieur so he would pass butterfly like on unsteady wings from blossom to blossom of a flowery mind there was some purpose no doubt ahead of his irrelative flittings but it seemed for ever the prey to distractions by the way his allusion was to a certain novelty in dandyism it appeared to a couple of little diamonds which were let into the gold earrings worn by his visitor for the rest that visitor it was obvious attracted his most flattering regard he observed with admiration his coat and breeches of fine buff cloth and fastidiously elegant cut his tambour vest of white satin sprigged with silver and his white silk stockings his mushroom coloured stock and solitaire of broad black silk which was tied in a bow at the back of his natural black hair and brought over his shoulders to hold a miniature framed in diamonds and turquoises his silver headed malacca cane looped to the right wrist and the tiny nivernois hat held under his left arm the slim steel hilted sword at his hip for continental bloods still held to a fashion which was grown out of date in england his neat black pantoufles fastened with little gold tagged laces and only as to these last did his countenance express any doubt or qualification still admiring he arose from his chair at the same moment m polisson skipped to his feet and fell over a stool the king glanced at him vexedly you are always the one little polisson he said to cough in the exquisite moment of the opera then he advanced to the visitor very winningly it is all a triumph of taste monsieur he said accept the congratulations of a sympathetic spirit cartouche bowed profoundly i have the good fortune of seeing m trix said the king the protg of our late lamented marquis it is a pleasure of which i have often dreamed and now realise to my instruction you were very attached to your patron monsieur i returned his regard for me sire with duty and affection he is a great loss to us we had looked upon him as a bulwark against the licentious encroachments of the age he would have found for your modern rousseaus poor quarters at chambry or at le prieur for that matter no question of subversive petitions had he remained alive it was a pity he was so appallingly ugly i am not sure about the laces monsieur they are a little democratic they have gold tags sire was all that trix could find to answer true said the king and that perhaps redeems them like the jewel in the toads head i understand monsieur that the widow is as great a beauty as she is a fortune cartouche sniggered to himself dogging these apparently inconsequent doublings of the royal mind she is priceless in every way sire the king looked at him rather keenly it would want a courageous man he said to aspire to the priceless cartouche smiled in a state of inner astonishment to what end of favour or correction was all this irrelevance of the royal flibbertigibbet addressed knowing his own reputation in turin he could hardly flatter himself with a thought of promotion and the next remark of the monarch only deepened his perplexity have you ever heard monsieur said victor amadeus of a secret society calling itself the illuminati surely sire answered the visitor profoundly bewildered it is by general report a fellowship of star gazers who consulting the heavenly systems flounder among the earthly ay said the king and they meet at night as astrologers should here and there on dark hill sides on remote roads on lonely wastes but doubtless you know that i know nothing whatever about their habits sire so i think monsieur but i am not sure that these ruffles might be doubled perhaps however it would vulgarise in the tiniest degree the exquisite simplicity of your conception my faith what goths we have to educate artists like you and me hopeless to expect their appreciation of these delicate nuances of taste and selection the many flounced flower is always foremost in their approval sometimes in despair i feel that i must yield the eternal conflict go mad in pea green stockings and a scarlet wig but then i think how nature in her inaccessible eyries continues to produce without a didactic thought her tastefullest forms and i am comforted because i recognise that the final appeal of elegance is to the gods has it ever occurred to you monsieur that your patron was murdered by these illuminati the sudden swerve and swoop brought a gasp from cartouche verily as if his majesty had whipped a hand from behind his back and struck him in the wind he was momentarily quite staggered no never he could only ejaculate victor amadeus conned him curiously admit monsieur for the sake of argument that it were so he said how then would you regard this brotherhood sire as your majesty regarded the jesuits what as a canker to be cut from us lest it should come to corrupt the whole body of our estate the king scraped his chin thoughtfully i have heard said he murmured that of all compelling personalities that of the fire eater dilettante the truculent wit the gaillard with his tongue in his scabbard and venom at its point is the most to be admired for its penetration since it will pierce through both steel and brain i shall certainly adopt this inspiration of the earrings monsieur we are fortunate at least in recognising in m trix with whose exploits in turin report has made us familiar the qualities of his reputation courageous brilliant men men of resource and daring men even remorseless vengeurs at discretion are not to be gathered like edelweiss at the expense of a little risk and trouble and so la prieur has its illuminati monsieur i learn it for the first time of your majesty a convenient observatory m trix for the studying of systems wild remote high lifted a place for storing thunderbolts and launching them it would need a man to circumvent and storm it almost as courageous as he who should aspire to the priceless well di rocco though terribly ugly was that man on both counts and he is dead but nemesis if we are not mistaken bore a child to him will you be our prefect of faissigny m trix my god sire the offer was so sudden so unexpected that he could utter no more on the instant the king a disciple perhaps of walpole in the baser part of his policy hastened to clinch an appointment he had set his heart on munificence happened to be the price he could bid for it and without his being a penny the poorer thereby he spoke on eagerly eschewing hyperbole we are not unacquainted monsieur with the minutest circumstances of that tragedy or of some local meetings of the brotherhood which in our opinion were responsible for it the marquess was of all men calculated to be abhorrent to these would be subverters of the constitution whose aims are by no means so astral or so harmless as you would appear to believe that they and their pernicious doctrines are not unrepresented in faissigny i can well tell you from the col de balme to bonneville they have their secret rallying points the place is blotched with corruption it needs a strong man a man of local knowledge whether inspired by vengeance or by duty or by both to put his knife to those tainted parts i had thought of m de france in my difficulty bah he is an old pompous vanity i will quiet him with a little portfolio in the meanwhile but sire in the meanwhile i say we can conceive of no better man than yourself to instruct vulgarity of the fallacy of ugliness we do not expect m trix the exquisite the man of the sword to condemn himself unrewarded to a virtual exile from life as he regards it we have had a little bird to whisper in our ears and as a consequence we propose to endow our prefect of faissigny with a fine local estate and a fine fortune encumbered only with the condition of a wife in short monsieur we offer to bestow upon our faithful lieutenant the hand of the widowed lady di rocco cartouche dropped his hat picked it up straightened himself laughed a little laugh and answered his face was white and his lips were trembling pardon me sire but that is impossible victor amadeus stared a little then spoke drily you may misconceive our prerogatives monsieur or perhaps you are married already no sire it is well then we have commanded the lady and her father to court a little prematurely maybe but what would you he shrugged his shoulders a loveless marriage makes a short mourning in the meantime i will be your prefect sire if not for vengeance sake for duty alone you do not believe he was murdered the suggestion shall at least stimulate me and nothing else but we will see a stake in that country would afford you a strong personal interest in its cleansing we will see we will see he turned to his secretary make out m trixs patent as prefect of faissigny my dear polisson he said and for heavens sake straighten your stock chapter vi within a stones throw of the royal palace under its usurious eye as it were stood the palazzo di citta the headquarters of the banco del regio lotto there every alternate saturday at noon the drawing of the numbers took place and the impoverishment of a few thousand kings subjects guilty of nothing but fatuity was decided by lot it was a recurrently mad time whose agitation was transmitted to remotest parishes all over the country only with this distinction the pimontais watching the central game was held hostage to its excitement the poor savoyard ruined out of sight cursed himself for a blockhead victim to fraud and with the common inconsistency vowed hatred against a government which could thus rob him of his mite that was inevitable gambling in cold blood can only breed usurers where it succeeds and desperadoes where it fails the turinois possessed the glitter of the table it was not he who was to fail the monarchy in the dark days to come he was as fevered as voluble as gesticulatory as seething in his numbers on this particular occasion of the drawing as he had been any time since m daubonne first brought his damnable invention of the lottery wheel from france some fifty years earlier his cheek was as glowing his heart as fluttering with a sense of novelty as if he had never before seen a hundred or two of butterflies broken on the wheel even dr bonito standing amidst the pack with a young friend felt the infection of the occasion and bit his blue lips with that sort of agonised transport which makes men under the lash set their teeth in whatsoever they encounter he had had that vanity of his qualities the old grey rat to hold by an independence even to the last capacity of the gutter for yielding him one the stars the cards a greasy pack the astrolabe and divining rod had procured him thence latterly an obscene living in taking it he had had at least the justification of his own superstition if he sold immortal truths at a halfpenny apiece it was only because necessity obliged him they had all the value of genuineness in his eyes and to fake antiques would only discredit him with the gods upon whom was his ultimate reliance what he had borrowed from louis marie had been a loan to conviction a last ounce of metal needed to insure his winged feet to the perseus of his destiny that he fully believed beyond it it was a fact he had not asked nor accepted a farthing from the young man but superstition as a one devil possession prevails only through its plausibility let its dupe once be disillusioned and all the moral obliquities out of which it had shaped its pretence confess themselves the owners of the mansion the maggots which devour a dead faith were bred in it living superstition cast down becomes the prey of what it had entertained dr bonito a rosicrucian by conviction had never perhaps been really dangerous until the stars came to prove themselves impostors and then he delivered himself wholly to corruption in the meanwhile bond slave to his faith foreseeing nothing so little as the imminent disruption of that faiths particles or articles he cherished for the moment no particular thought of rascality towards anyone he may even have felt a little cold thaw of emotion towards the human souls about him as towards beings predestined to witness in him alone conversant with the hieroglyphics of fate that apotheosis which they all desired vainly for themselves smugly self conscious of his frowsy coat and broken shoes he likened himself to elijah on the banks of the jordan awaiting an unconsidered prophet the descent of the fiery chariot his eyes travelled incessantly feverishly from his companion poor louis marie the dull apathetic soul to the steps of the town hall on which was displayed under guard but for all to see the wheel of fortune suddenly a sound went over the vast throng like a sweep of wind over a bed of rushes bowing all heads in a single direction it wailed and passed and died and was succeeded by an intense hush the wheel was seen to turn and stop bonito clutched his voucher holding it under his nose for identification the number large and white cynosure of a thousand eyes went up on a black board a thin wheeze such as strains itself from lungs winded by a blow came from him then he gasped and twitching in all his features nudged his companion and set his finger on the card sure enough the sigh the wail rose again over the throng and died down bonito for all his faith was shaking as if palsied as his finger travelled to the number even louis marie standing staring in his place felt in his veins a sluggish thrill of excitement again the wheel turned and again the card duplicated its record and then once more it revolved and disgorged a single number and the quatern was accomplished bonito looked up his forehead was wet his lips were dribbling and smiling in one quantum fati parva tabella vehit he said crookedly and there are those who mock at astrology a roar instant overwhelming heart shaking broke upon his words it greeted the appearance on the board of the fifth and final figure a zero the gods had laughed all stakes were cancelled and forfeit to the government dr bonito stood quite still the sweat dried from his forehead slowly his face seemed to turn into grinning stone the surge of the crowd roared round him like fierce water about a pile he heeded nothing of it he only grinned and grinned until his grin became a blasphemy a horror then he recognised that he must stir speak do something human to cheat the hell to which his looks were claiming him he was conscious of a rigor enchaining his flesh his feet seemed locked in the jaws of a quicksand a little and he would be under at the crisis the card in his hand caught his attention very stiffly moving his arms mechanically he tore it into halves folded quartered requartered and at a wrench divided and sent those fluttering piecemeal the act spoke an inhuman grip it had hardly been possible to him a minute earlier but its madness rent the veil he twisted awry and glared up at his companion louis marie remembered that night in the caf he recognised well enough what had happened the calamity might have stirred him little on his own account had it not been for this look in the ruined face turned to him he shivered slightly so much for the taroc mysteries whispered the doctor chaff of the gods but i forgot that nought stood for the fool his tongue rustled on his palate like a dry scale he hunts butterflies he said why you cursed owl what are you staring at have you never seen him with his net on the cards nought is the fool i say and i am nought the butt of the gods ill pay them he took a frantic step or two returned seized his companions arm and urged him from the press come he said hoarsely you lent me the means to it i owe this to you ill not let you go now all his tolerance it seemed was turned to hatred he regarded the young man as the instrument however contemptible of his undoing the worse for the poor tool of fortune he would have to act whipping boy to her ladyship and serve the weak creature right for his flaccidity he sneered horribly at him faiths dead in me he snarled youll have to serve her turn quite stunned and helpless saint pray let him lead him whither he would as they crossed into the via seminario a royal carriage making for the palace was brought to a stand against a gabbling stream of pedestrians and stopped across their very path they faced direct into a window of it and there inside was yolande pale agitated her dresden shepherdess eyes glanced to and fro and all in an instant caught that vision of other two other four fixed upon them weve heard of faces stricken into stone before some gorgon apparition loves severed head converts to softer stuff his art is the plastic art and answers to his dead hauntings in features stiffening into wax so seemed yolandes features in that moment her breath hung suspended on her lips the colour in her cheeks she had procured loves death and thus was love revenged upon her like a thing of wax she confronted the sweet cruelty of his eyes there sat a thin grey gentleman by her side of a very refined and arrogant mien the chevalier de france had never encountered louis nor louis him suddenly the former projected his head from the window and demanded in haughty tones the reason of the delay monsignore said a postillion it is the lottery the chevalier sacred does that concern a minister of state puppy drive through the rabble the carriage jerked forward and rolled on its way saint pray stood motionless following it with his eyes a touch on his arm aroused him acrid vicious fearfully expressive the face of dr bonito peered up into his monsieur whispered the rosicrucian there goes madame saint pray louis marie gave a mortal start and put his hand to his forehead there is something weaving in my brain he muttered look look shake it out my god it is an enormous spider chapter vii the prefect of faissigny commanded for the second time within a week and with a flattering grace of intimacy into the kings presence discovered an exquisite butterfly where he had left a chrysalis the royal head erst as round and blue as a turks was adorned with a bob wig in buckle from whose toupee a couple of pearl pins stuck out like clubbed antenn the royal limbs and body were glossy with embroidered silks on the royal coat of maroon coloured velvet sparkled a diamond star twin satellites of this sun moreover twinkled like new discovered planets in the royal ears a sincerest flattery which his majesty did not grudge to pay to so unique a pink of the elegances as m trix as he advanced to greet his visitor he held a wisp of point dalenon a little raised between the finger and thumb of his right hand while his left poised a gleaming snuff box at a like angle his manner was as charmingly playful as his style was unexceptionable as a monarch he had no rival to challenge his pre eminence in the kingdom of puffs and patches welcome my dear prefect he said you come as irresistible as apollo in arcadia i vow i am jealous of you since seeing our adorable daphne alas that fate hath imposed upon me the rle of father ladon but it is some compensation to have a god for suitor your majesty flatters and confounds me in one cartouches eyes were bright and nervous he had not a full command of his lips the king smiled confounds you monsieur how is that daphne sire if i am not mistaken took refuge in a laurel tree rather than suffer the gods pursuit bah the king shrugged his shoulders and she bewailed ill swear her foolish precipitancy for ever after but the laurels in this case monsieur are for your brow i do not feel like a conqueror indeed fie fie monsieur is it necessary to remind m trix of his cervantes faint hearts and fair ladies forsooth o you have a character to maintain i assure you but certainly such beauty cuts the sinews of self confidence well it is no matter you have only as it happens to receive the keys of the capitulated citadel i do not understand your majesty i declare our majesty monsieur has already thrown the handkerchief for you and one without a crown in its corner that was a self denying ordinance for which we will not altogether insist on your gratitude but in plain language sir we desire this union and have made no secret of our desire sire hush monsieur or she may hear you would not damn your reputation with a show of diffidence hush cartouche looked at him aghast she is present she sire sire he made a hurried step forward the king smiling motioned him aside and tiptoed to a door the two were quite private and alone the royal closet was destined for the moment for loves confessional box ordered with a view to the stimulating of emotional disclosures and throbbing confidences it was evening and the tapers shrouded in their silver sconces diffused a soft motionless glow over a piled luxuriance of stuffs and cushions over a carpet tufted thick as turf over hangings of purple velvet they woke slumberous gleams in furniture flushed the drowsy faces of satyrs on polished bureaux creamed the bare legs and breasts of nymphs touched the cheeks of grapes piled in a gold salver on a table with little kisses of light slipped into the warm depths of decantered wine and hung tiny crimson jack o lanterns there to lure the already half drunken senses to red ruin no drugging pastille ever vulgarised the air of that enchanted chamber but a sweet and swooning perfume was contrived to steal all over it as if a bed of lilies of the valley lay beneath the floor and in a moment she was there before cartouches eyes the loveliest most lovable shape to be conceived in such a setting for an instant desperate and defiant he feigned to himself to claim her appropriately to it its sensuousness and artificiality her lily complexion was toilet cream her lips too startlingly scarlet were painted the flowers in her cheeks were well assumed since they owed to the rubbing of geranium petals all these with that gleaming gold for crown that spun starlight of her hair were but so many modistic arts to which her simple dress of black supplied the clue out of that dusk sheath her shoulders budded with a double emphasis of whiteness a cunning scheme of contrasts and so he lusted to slander her to his own heart and would have cut that same heart out only to lay it at her slender feet and feel them trample it and she could be so stately though a child giving the king her hand she held him vassal to its whiteness and smiled a gracious smile when he raised and kissed it reverently she had become woman at her tender years but through the hate and not the love of man she had borne sorrow and was a virgin still passion fell dumb before that poignant motherhood desire slunk ashamed before her eyes the king handed her forward with a sort of conscious chass he was at pains to practise every punctilious elegance in his reception of this untutored girl he looked even nervous and a little inferior but custom gave him command there are occasions madam he said on which even the king is de trop i leave it to a lovelier monarch to reconcile the parties in this suit sure that my affection for both their sense of duty to the state their own passions and interests will move them to a compromise respect that judge my children for whom i dethrone myself and accept his ruling on a cause which i have very much at heart with that he released the marchesas hand and bowed profoundly and withdrew she made no gesture to retain him the two remained standing as he had left them silent and far apart a storm of emotions swept through the chambers of cartouches brain he shook in its thunder what was the power in this child this white and pink wax doll to humble mighty worldlings in her presence bring them to her feet not to sue but to deprecate all suit of her as guilt not to pray only to adore and own themselves unworthy she had beauty and it was not a snare she had virtue and it was not a pose twas her inaccessibility made her covetable o thou fond ulysses but he did not desire her for himself he thought and yet after all why should he not she was unattached fair quarry to the free lance no other mans preserve he had the right of chase with the whole world no bond to honour even since she had let another cross the claim of his friend he would never have suffered that for himself she would never have dared that sin against cartouche he gloried suddenly in his name if he could only have met her first a man worth a womans modelling not a saint invertebrately blessed a passion not a sentiment was it too late even now to gain the whole world in her and lose his soul she could make an immortal lust of damnation cancel eternity to a moment he thirsted for that moment almost beyond endurance what was her power he had accepted this interview when thrust upon him with a cynic mock for its pretence a tolerant anticipation of the moral drubbing it was to procure him he knew that in her regard not all his brilliant worldly gifts and qualities weighed as one grain in the balance of good things a word from louiss lips a look from louiss eyes would have sent him and all his vanities kicking the beam he could not get behind that essential righteousness it was impervious to all cleverness all intellect all reason even she was a fool but a beautiful unattainable fool is as transporting a siderite as any other wisdom loved a fool not for the first time in mans history he loved her because her folly was inaccessible by him some say that sex is accident a chance development that we are all bi sexual within woman prescriptively is the one to covet most the unattainable to pursue the most where most scorned to love most the partner who most abuses her love but what if you please does man it all turns in fact upon the ineradicable human lust for adventure the weariness of the rut the reach at something out of reach yolande as virtue was forbidden fruit to this vice therefore he desired her madly fiercely but at the last with a saving grace of humour he found himself out of that presently and moved towards her very formal and demure though his heart was on fire at a pace or two distant he stopped madam he said the king wishes you to marry me he could see a shadow flutter in her white throat i ask myself monsieur she said softly how i have offended the king madam he rejoined quietly i told him that you would not marry me i ask myself she went on seeming to ignore him what i have ever done to justify these shameless solicitations by the shameless her frigid self possession as a quality of sixteen was a quite pitiful abnormity you are by all accounts monsieur she said a student of the world what is it in a woman that seems to mark her down your legitimate sport have i these unconscious attributes tell me only in your own excuse i have said once before madam that you are an angel then do angels beck like wantons at the street corners i am no angel monsieur and your assurance proves you know it claims me through my own act to be the butt of your scorn and mockery if you could see into my heart it professed to speak once of loyalty to a friend hold by your plausible surface monsieur i would not stir those depths if i were you then madam would you leave truth to perish in the mud my heart is foul maybe but there is that to redeem it at the bottom she stirred a little turning on him truth sir has it lain buried there since that time when for once it rose to foretell an outrage which o monsieur i have not forgotten your words your last when you parted from me on o indeed it is possible to accommodate a prophecy to verify through a confederate a villainy which one has foreshadowed my god if that is truth he went as white as stone he looked as petrified what madam he said in a quick whispering voice do you pretend to deem me capable of that baseness he gripped her hand suddenly so as to make her wince then flung it from him i scorn you not for your act he cried but for your cowardice in striving to make me its scapegoat he stepped back in great emotion and she herself was agitated only a little less her young breast rose and fell in hard pantings the force of her self control revealed itself in this sudden struggle for breath and in the end her passion mastered her she turned a face of lovely fury on him you monsieur the scapegoat so wronged and misunderstood the poor innocent bearer of other peoples sins tell me are you not that man who came and offered his services o god the slander of that word to a soul most wounded in her faith and therefore as he thought most susceptible to the sweet druggings of dishonour are you not that man who would have had me break my vows stultify all that tragedy of renunciation on the strength of a wicked sophistry a noble friend to honour that man who baffled in his devils purpose must revenge himself by instigating another to desecrate the shrine he could not force himself a friend he put out his hand and touched her once more quite gently this time but there was some quality in the touch the very antithesis of that which had impelled his former violence the girl faltered under it and her speech shivered into silence you are mistaken madam he measured out his words with a soft and painful accuracy if i proposed to commit you to what convention styles dishonour forgive me for using the word once more it was in order to save from worse defilement that very shrine at which i worshipped she started and flushed monsieur nay hear me out he said in the same quiet tones even the first of tabernacles is not soiled in the poor sinners worship my heart has always held your image madam the loveliest of its possessions and not the less because it cherishes a hopeless dream i would have served that dream loyally for loves sake i would have given my life and soul to keep it pure if i thought to persuade it to fly to its natural sanctuary there was a priority in vows to vindicate my daring have you ever considered madam how you broke one oath to love to swear another to dishonour she uttered a little cry moved a step forward clasped her hands to her bosom understand clearly madam he said i loved you and would have yielded you to my friend i had no alternative indeed but that is not to justify your slander of a renunciation which was at least as holy according to its lights as yours i did not urge your husband to that wickedness if i hinted to you of its possibility it was to open your eyes to the truth to save my dream from a last contamination to confide it to the shrine the most meet and the most entitled to hold it perfect for my adoration there was no selfishness in that sacrifice though it closed the gates of paradise upon me i was content so long as the vile thing was shut out with me i could have heard the singing of your loves within without a bitter thought but that you cannot understand no virtue in your narrow standard can exist in worldliness it must be all one or all the other vice or sanctity she was pale and trembling she made a little involuntary gesture of her hands half pleading half deprecating towards him he was cold as steel as to this royal crochet of our union he said quietly it turns upon some fancied policy of state to which i am no partner i am as innocent of its instigation as of its methods or mistakes it hinted a moment ago that you might be kind to me i was as incredulous then as i am convinced now that no tolerance towards sin is possible to your nature i have worshipped at an exclusive altar and my faith is construed into a sacrilege you are insensible madam to the exaltations of a great passion i do not plead to you i reject you even the weakness of my friend for he is weak raises him in my eyes above your cold methodic virtue i do not think you are worthy of him she bowed her head weeping i know it she whispered and at that he was disarmed he stood in great agitation a moment then burst out suddenly madam madam if it is any consolation to you to know such passion brings a self redemption i am not cannot be the man i was never again spare me that gentle association with yourself your memory ill persuade the king madam it shall all come right it his voice broke he hesitated a minute struggling with his emotions then hurriedly left the room and yolande of the white hands hid her face in them and for long remained shaken with sobs chapter viii louis marie was really ill though his complaint it seemed baffled diagnosis he was sunk in an extreme debility which from a moral had become a physical one there appeared nothing wrong with him constitutionally but he dreamt and saw vampires and the substance of his eternal illusions figured in blood boltered forms nightly they sucked him and daily his increasing wanness testified to their inhuman appetites he faded to a frail image of himself very pitiful in its suggestion of a sick prince of porcelain any sudden noise like the opening of a door was enough now to make him start and shake with terror a footstep outside the window vibrated in his nerves for minutes after it had passed his heart was become a very seismograph to record alarms but the unexpected entrance of anyone into the room most perturbed him a furtive aghast look an artificial rally and instant physical collapse were the almost certain consequences of such an intrusion once at a chance mention of bonitos name he sunk back in his chair as if under a stroke cartouche who was present and distressfully concerned attributed his state to a sort of hysterical resentment against that minister of ill luck and struggled to overlay some conscious contempt of it with a real anxious commiseration have you soothed him reassured him he asked of molly bramble when that frail sweet of nature came down to him to report upon the invalid i have left him asleep she said he tramped to and fro in the little room pondering a psychologic problem he fainted when i told him of another loss a real poignant one that time heres a mere slip of fortune a few ducats rolled into the gutter hes already recovered more than their equivalent in abstinence are these good people so utterly wanting in a sense of proportion think what it meant to him cherry and what did it mean mollinda why to go a courting to be sure with that in his hand to recommend him does he think she needs that form of persuasion i would not condescend to break my heart on such a mistress hes no worse off than he was well he maynt be but how about her cartouche stopped and took the girls soft chin in his hand talk about what you understand you little village wench he said you was bred in a cottage and think in pence a guinea is your standard of corruption noble natures are not bought with gold she did not move but her eyes unwinking filled with tears thank you for reminding me she whispered remorse smote him but still an angrier or a worthier feeling made him stubborn pish mollinda he said weve agreed to compromise there on a better sentiment that proves you noble too my girl she looked him fearlessly in the eyes though her own were like wet forget me nots do you know shes here in turin she said no well she is you neednt start and let me go shes nothing to you why should she be who told you he did she gulped but did not stir tell me honest she said is it for my sake or for hers that youre so anxious all of a sudden to be good he delayed to answer she gripped him quickly and fiercely if i knew for certain what ive feared she cried low id kiss and cling until you gave me back what ive lost i would for all it damned us both together she broke from him and went hurriedly out of the room reaching the invalids door above she paused to the sound of a little cry within hesitated and entered louis marie was sitting up on his bed his eyes were wide with fever he greeted her appearance with something like a sob who is it he whispered has he come my god dont keep me in this suspense she hastened to comfort him the more emotionally perhaps because her own heart was very full theres nobody indeed there isnt i heard voices it was only ours mr trixs and mine he sank back with the sigh of a reprieved soul but was up again almost immediately stroking and fondling the girls hand his eyes had grown flushed and maudlin out of relief the sensuous fever of him was uppermost dear little nurse he murmured dear kind little molly you never fail to frighten the dreams away i think you could cure me altogether if you would she sat on the bed suffering his caresses because as she wilfully told herself they were lavished on her as anothers proxy would she could act so indeed in the manner of those eastern enchantments of which she had read and secure that others compromise without hurt to herself he was emboldened by her passiveness molly he whispered if you would only put your face here down by mine on the pillow she did not stir he stole an arm about her we could make it all right afterwards he said with a thick little laugh if i once had that reason as i have the power to mend something id done i think i could face the world like a giant its only shadows that upset me perfection ive come to see was never meant for men its better to sin a little if one does penance for it better than being a saint we know that on good authority molly dont we ill promise amendment i will on my honour and and are you fond of jewels molly she slipped from him and to her feet are you dreaming still she said do you take me for her we dont do these things in our class she had had her little revenge and flushed triumphantly to it it were supererogation to confess what he did not know that she was engaged in these matters to another but after all the creature was a man and his offence therefore nothing very terrible of course if it had signified treachery to his blood brother that were another pair of shoes but inasmuch as only the betrayal of his fine lady love was implied by it why the marchioness di rocco might very well profit by learning that her supposed pre eminence in mens hearts was at least open to challenge a light sentence as she considered it was enough to meet this case she stood away panting a very ruffled little amourette and thrice desirable in those plumes i wouldnt promise on my honour if i was you my good gentleman says she tisnt much to trust on when you can speak to me like that and you sworn to another i wonder what shed think of it all youd best go to sleep and get the better of yourself he caught at her the poor devil as she was going all his gauche libertinism snubbed out of him at a breath the loss of his self respect was nothing to this sudden realisation of his contemptible immaturity in vice and of her recognition of it there is no such crestfallen dog in all the world as your seducer held up to ridicule by his intended victim he appealed to her abjectly dont go dont i am so ill i didnt mean what what you suppose my brain is all on fire he wouldnt allow for that he who she demanded withdrawing from him he still pursued her with his hands distraught half frenzied youre going to tell him i know and he so believes in me it would be cruel wicked to shatter his faith you ought to think of the demoralising effect on him and and im not myself you know that perfectly well i say and do things i had never thought of once do you mean mr trix she said you know i do he cried it would be wicked to tell him she stood conning him gravely a little there had been no thought of tale bearing a minute ago in her liberal heart but now for the first time it began to consider that policy in the light of a possible retaliation on a suspected rival the demoralising effect on him her cherry quotha what indeed if she were to try that effect with the result that it evoked jealousy there anger indignation a declaration of his exclusive and never foregone property in her his mollys person it might serve for the very means to dissipate this sad veil of continence which had come to fall between them and which only out of the inherent purity of her love she had agreed to respect for spiritual relationships it must be admitted were water gruel to this poor mollinda and tinctured with wormwood at that when as in the present case they carried suspicions of the disinterestedness of the party suggesting them should she go and tell him in truth no it wasnt fair to this other fellow for all the exhibition he had made of himself but her conscious prettiness was something to blame no doubt in that matter and after all he had been guilty of no disloyalty to his friend her ethics of the heart were natures ethics founded on a frank recognition of the logic of feminine lures and the reasonableness of wanting to pluck inviting fruit when one was thirsty a parched man could not be expected to drink water when wine was going nevertheless he deserved a measure of punishment less for his fault than for his mean attempt to escape its consequences a little suspense she decided just a moderate spell on the rack would do him no harm might even prove salutary ill promise naught she said it would just amount to my allowing a secret between us and you arent the man for my confidence no nor for any part of me besides if you didnt mean nothing why should you be afraid ill do as i think fit and speak or hold as it suits me she whisked away leaving the adorable fragrance of a dream unfulfilled to clinch the poor creatures damnation she did not know could not know how thorough that was at this last she would have been horrified kind heart to realise how her balmy breath had blown a smouldering fire into devouring flame how it had sentenced this victim of little ease to be transferred to the pillory for indeed in that sorry yoke did she leave louis marie exposed to himself and as he thought to all the world there is a form of morbid self consciousness which is characterised by a perpetual turning inward of the patients moral eye the man subject to it sees especially during the wakeful hours of the night his own past deeds and words imbued with a meaning of which they had appeared quite innocent when acted or spoken he writhes in the memory of mistakes of self commission or omission which no one other than himself probably is troubling to recall or is even capable of recalling what an ass somebody must have thought him under such and such circumstances is the reflection most distressingly constant to his mind nevertheless while eternally holding himself the irreclaimable fool of untactfulness he remains to his own appreciation a thing of price which he himself is for ever giving away for nothing modesty is no part of his equipment though he is so sensitively conscious of his own failings he cannot detach himself from himself in fact or even once in a way realise comfortably his own insignificance in the serene philosophy of the cosmos so far for his tortured memory of solecisms real or imaginary committed by himself when it comes to the question with him of a genuine conscience stricken introspection his reason is in the last danger of overthrow now louis maries was a temperament a little of this order it was the temperament of a man at once thin skinned and bigoted righteous and passionate it had all the conceit and the sensitiveness of conscious virtue the fellow could never forget himself in the abstract sense believe that people were not incessantly thinking and talking of him a morbid diathesis is the inevitable result of such self centralisation acutely sentient it will learn to inflame to the least thrust of criticism and to brood eternally over the pointlessness of its own ripostes then at last when it comes to sin as it is bound some time to do it will take its lapses with a self same seriousness as it took its merits it is always in its own vanity a responsible example people are always regarding it its attitude as a consequence will become a pose but by now it is a fair rind hiding a rotting kernel the devastating grub has entered and it dare not reveal itself by expelling it it hugs its disease in secrecy hoping against hope for some interior process of healing how can self centredom heal itself there comes a day when the last film cracks and its emptiness stands exposed to the world louis marie abandoned to his reflections thought that that day had arrived for him his hollow pretence was on the point of being laid bare he was to be made the subject of a universal contempt and execration a moments temptation had revealed him to himself for the sham thing he was would reveal him to gaston would reveal him in the certain course of scandal to yolande for ever more now he must be an outcast from social respectability his life for all that it was worth was virtually at an end practically too it seemed almost he fell back on his bed in a death sickness and lay there without movement without conscious thought for hours cartouche returning very quiet and sombre from his interview with a great lady in the palace heard him moaning to himself as he passed his door and went softly in the room was in darkness only a faint light from the lamps outside fell spectrally across the figure stretched on the bed he crossed hurriedly to it and bent over what is it brother are you so ill saint pray uttered a little weak cry between terror and rapture gaston is it you i believe i am dying no no i have so waited for you sinking and struggling to keep above this load i can endure it no longer you are so strong i seem always to have clung to you my brother and you will take some of the burden yet how can i ask you o my god my god to what can i appeal why not to my love louis ah your love there were older claims to it you dont know you know nothing of it all of what i am and have been of what i am capable even when tempted or do you are your eyes opened a little since but what does it matter i will confess everything i o my yolande my yolande now hush and listen do you attend i am but this moment come from her you o gaston fetch me a priest i am going she loves you still i say she loves you still is not that the best priest and doctor too i will go and fetch her the sick man clutched at him frantically and confirm my sentence you shall not though it parts us for ever i must speak i could live i think if once this load were thrown gaston i am listening it was i murdered di rocco chapter ix the burden cast the released soul ran out and on babbling half delirious growing in noise and volume until flowing to waste it sunk into the silence of exhaustion i knew as you all know now what he intended and where he was going i had been informed secretly and i set out to waylay him coming to the point from which he was to cross the glacier i hid among the stones and presently i saw him approach there were great clouds but a little starlight between enough to make him sure on the slope of the moraine a drunken scoundrel who carried a lantern veiled till then rose to greet him he was the others guide and pander and for whose undoing o my god o my god gaston think what it meant to me to heaven and heaven was the coward at the last it was all for me to do alone prevent this horror if i could not persuade it god sleeps i think when the riddles of mortal wickedness get too much for him and then he wakes and chastises weak nature for its false solutions it is so easy to say this must not be and ignore the circumstances which will make this and no other inevitable i saw them meet i say and even then i could scarcely believe that upon me and me alone was thrust gods responsibility to the maze he had permitted yet i had no thought at the first i swear but to prevail through gentleness as i followed them down upon the ice a prayer was in my heart that seeing itself discovered and exposed this sin would come to own itself would at least deprecate my worst suspicions of it and if for policy alone go the practical way to allay them i did not know the man no spark of decency or honour left to leaven his vileness a liar without shame how i came upon him is all a dream in my mind i had pursued the light now here now gone but always rekindling somewhere in front until in a moment it stopped and i had overtaken it he was alone had just it seemed re lighted the lantern and was taking breath from the exertion while it rested near him on the snow the other had disappeared and we two stood face to face and alone in the heart of that desolation i dont know what i said to him or he to me things on his part monstrous beyond speaking his tongue lashed me like a flame drove me to madness god should have torn it out but god was sleeping he would scourge me he said before he crucified for he meant to kill me for my daring and cast my body into a crevasse he pointed out hard by and whistle up my ghost to follow and witness to his filthy triumph he was a great man a great power a giant of strength and wickedness but as he came at me he slipped as even a giant may and i put my knife into his heart the voice in the dark room shrilled into a febrile transport the weak hand was re playing its ecstatic deed and the watcher sat without a word or sign and listened listened i heard his soul go from him like a hiss of fire and then the storm burst upon me it flogged me in a moment into reason i saw the crevasse stretching at my feet and i heaved him towards it and heard him go down knife and all he went and after them i cast the lantern and then there was nothing more only my love my loves safety the guerdon of my red hands it was that one thought which saved me while i cowered and let the storm roll over then i returned by the way i had come i dont know what guided my footsteps i knew nothing more until i awoke in my bed to light and the blast of that mad memory he paused a moment while his soul seemed to fume on his lips then burst out once more a curse upon those who forced the deed upon me who would have made a wanton of my idol they are to blame they are to blame not i i struck to keep gods law immaculate i was all alone while he slept and i struck to vindicate his law and he awoke and damned me for my deed no palm of martyrdom but torture the endless torture of a haunted wickedness agues of sickness and terror threats menaces a guilty conscience am i guilty o gaston where is heaven i lost her that i might save her her shrine was my heart and i bloodied it what she had been to me not you nor anyone can realise saint sweetheart loveliness too divine for passion and too passionate for heaven gods earnest to me of immortal raptures why i lived in her worshipped her o my god my god gaston if she was more to me than heaven was that a just rebuke to me to make her foul you all know now i say what i knew then put yourself in my place that man filthy iniquity no grace of truth or honour a ruttish beast o he was your friend i know forgive me what a friend i had been stone till then till it was whispered to me what he designed stone with a heart of fire perhaps i had built a little on the thought of that years respite a year in which to hold him at bay while we prayed and prayed for god to intervene o a cry to stone no hope no response when i killed him i plucked the dagger from my own heart to plunge it into his was not that good even then to send him to his account saving his soul those last two mortal sins tell me gaston was it not good it was good and just louis to lose her for ever that you might save her for ever the wild shape on the bed ceased its convulsive transports while it seemed to meditate the answer presently it spoke again but feebly as if in a gathering exhaustion yes i have lost her for ever you mean it indeed gaston he was her husband louis will you confess to her could she marry you if you did could you marry her if you did not you did right i say i take the burden of your conscience as a light one and commit you to rest gaston the poor wretch struggled to express his gratitude and relief in the midst his voice trailed into incoherence and ceased cartouche looking at him saw that he had topped the crisis and was asleep self composed an exquisite sans reproche carrying sword like a sort of sombre blitheness in his speech and mien the prefect of faissigny descended to his duties on the morning succeeding that poignant interview these were prefigured for him in the shape of a waiting chaise and postillions bespoken overnight and attending now in the street outside his windows and more intimately in an early bird of domesticity who was busying herself with the preparation of some worm like sticks of bread and the fastidiously exacted proportions of a cup of chocolate and coffee he greeted her with a half remorseful half irritable allusion to her swollen eyes my faith girl you look as if you had been fighting in your dreams and got the worst of it she faced on him bravely and so i have and so i have been fighting with my thoughts and got my punishment wont you kiss them well cherry put a blister to a blain child that would never do she held up her sweet soft lips to him put it there then and show youve forgiven me forgiven he cried cheerfully and moved away ive nothing to forgive but a rogue to our compact come bustle girl bustle i must be off she flushed as if she had been stung but she obeyed entreating no more you must go then she said presently for real and true cherry he shrugged impatiently havent i told you that im to receive his keys of office to morrow from the old prefect at le prieur and the congs of his staff morituri me salutant shall i be csar and subject to an apron string there are rogues waiting to be hung and conscripts to be plucked and dressed be quick child be quick or di roccos murderer may escape me cherry she cried out aghast was he murdered he gave a curious violent laugh the king says so and the king can speak no lie come i must go she busied herself about his needs and comforts once she paused when will you be back how can i tell he answered hurriedly what a drag on a restless wheel there dont cry i shall come again never fear i shall he was suddenly ready and standing fixedly before her his hat on his head a heavy cloak over his arm his voice his manner had all at once taken on a tone significant forceful imperious i have a thing to say before i go one last thing attend to it well m saint pray is asleep this morning i think he is better now and will recover but from this moment the treatment is to be changed no mending of an idyll any longer no leading of him that way to hope and sanity what i set you to do i set you now to undo the end we once designed has become impossible do you understand they cannot ever marry now why not her voice was like a death cry far away shes not for him i say let that suffice if he is weak he may be be strong for him hell thank you some day for the rest bear what i

motionless a bee a whiff of apples were blown in together at the open window the sing song of a bell high up and distant somewhere rippled in soft throbbings through her brain a crow cawed in the trees opposite there was a chair near her a plain windsor cottage chair which cartouche had bought at a sale to please some whim of hers she threw herself down at its feet and prostrate as if praying

fanatic face the creature was but a minerval an illuminatus that is to say having his foot on the lowest rung of that ladder on which he himself stood relatively exalted but it is pleasant to be apotheosised even by an insignificant groundling and the pleasure though to a philosopher may lose nothing from the fact of that groundlings social superiority for indeed if caius sempronius gracchus was not the rose he could say with benjamin constant he lived near it he was a house steward in the royal palace in fact and as such a useful humble auxiliary to these forces of anti monarchical transcendentalism whose policy it was to titillate the ears of their neophytes with a jargon of classical pseudonyms and by endowing mediocrity with resounding titles to stimulate it to a fervid emulation of its prototypes caius sempronius gracchus an enthusiastic well meaning little rantipole could conceive for himself no more flattering destiny than to be some time tribune under this omniscient praetor in the coming cosmopolis he lived for ever for all his little albuminous brain was worth in that cloudy castle and bonito found him useful this strange man indeed who let himself be supposed of the rosicrucians a discredited sect merely to cover his connection with the later and much more formidable society of the illuminati desired wealth only as a means to his personal advancement in his own mysterious order all his plans were directed to that end and to none other money for its own sake he despised but money alone could direct his line of curvature towards the heart the holy of holies of that great centrifugal force which under the name of illuminati or the enlightened was destined in its own conception at least to revolutionise the political systems of the world and what was that heart and why did its attainment figure so covetable to this close locked thin blooded misanthrope it represented to him one must suppose an ideal of power to which no existing autocracy could afford a parallel a power to be likened only to the sun of one of those starry systems which his brain had warped itself in considering a power the focus of countless satellites humming harmonious worship about it in revolving belts of light a power in short which was vested solely and indivisibly so far as mundane affairs were concerned in the person of the general of all the illuminati well as to this general this veiled prophet old nominis umbra mystic unapproachable a plain word in season as to him and his system must suffice for an irreverent generation he was a stupendous mystery to his creatures and was designed to be like an unspeakable spider he commanded from their middle point of contact the radiations with all their concentric rings of a vast web of political intrigue every touch on which was communicated to and answered by him automatically he was elected in the first instance from amongst themselves by a council of twelve called the areopagites these were the virtually absolute analogous to the roman decemviri thence in successive gradation extended the inferior orders the national directors each also entitled to his council of twelve the provincials or magistrates of provinces having their courts of regents and the deans of the academies of priests or epopts who were seers and star gazers to a man beyond these the mysteries diffused

it was no small ambition perhaps that of aspiring to the generalship of the illuminati and if fortune had fooled dr bonito by a quibble money still remained to him the sovereign test of truth the stars had read him his destiny for all that that earthly goddess being earthy had delighted to falsify their calculations it was her way it was his to trust a higher ruling and to have faith in its

its maternal admonitions to awaken a precocious curiosity as to the signs and indications which distinguish the bad male fruit from the good to put its virgins on their guard against suggestion by suggesting she was even a little remarkable for her artless pudency as maid and milkmaid she had invited no offence guarded her bosom from so little as a sun rays wanton kissing cherished her sweet honour jealously but simply within the bounds her state prescribed but she had had no arts to negotiate it beyond these and when the ordeal came and she heard it called a lovely superstition by lips adorable in seduction her innocence must yield it for the archaism it was pronounced to that bright masterful intelligence it had all dated alas from a village wedding or alas or not alas she had never thought to give it a sigh till now zephyr the god coming over the hill had taken chloris unawares amongst her flowers and the way of a god was not womans guilt but joy shame could not come to blossom from that divine condescension for its sake she had even stiffened to something of a precisian in questions of maidenly decorum and now the sigh wafted from that distant scene had overtaken her at last those weddings those weddings chaste procurers to the unchaste how men took advantage of their feasts and dancings of beating pulses and warm proximities of the sense of neighbouring consummations to plead the dispensations of the hour recalling that plea her god seemed all at once to reveal himself a mortal thing and subject to the mortal laws of change she felt no longer secure in him through her own unchanging faith her faith was shaken the glory of the morning fields blown blue skies and the squirt of milk into pails the cosy sweetness of ricks pigeons and the click of pattens on dewy tiles a voice singing far away in the sunny window of a dairy all the tears saint swithin can cry saint bartlemeys mantle shall wipe em dry such memories had but figured hitherto for the dim background sweet and a little pathetic to a more poignant pastoral now all of a sudden they were the commanding poignancy infinitely haunting infinitely remote and for ever and ever as realities irrecoverable was all st bartlemeys mantle equal to drying the well of tears which she felt gathering in her soul the darkness of a great apprehension was on her a spectre formless but menacing in the thrall of whose shadow she saw herself separated by a lifeless dumb abyss from her living past how had she crossed it unknowing that deadly gulf there had seemed to her no break in the continuity of past and present until lo in an instant her eyes had been opened and she knew herself for a derelict in a desert crying to a fading mirage what had happened so to blind her eyes obliterate space cancel all time a consciousness of guilt the very first stole in to answer love whom she had scorned had betrayed her had led her on revenging that slight to the very threshold of a brothel and there abandoned her and his protg for whom he had done this thing a chawbacon gallant the very antipodes of the other but then love was born in arcady and favours a rustic wooer poor reubens homely image rose before her heroic hobnails sentiment in a smock but honest and clear seeing within the limits of his vision reuben had seen and dared to expostulate and been smartly caned by cartouche for his presumption and reuben had blubbered that was fatal a crying man is always contemptible yet in what other way their relative ranks considered could he have answered to those flips of fate privilege in these days kept the stocks and gallows up its sleeve for the correcting of any such ebullitions on the part of a mutinous commonalty the odds were disproportionate and reuben could only express his sense of that in tears poor reuben what had become of him cured his harrowed heart belike with dressing of joan or betty she wished she knew could reclaim herself to the past with even that much of certain knowledge and comfort how he must hate her memory she felt very deserted and forlorn and all about what ask love when in its nerves it feels the first faint false harmonic jar within a perfect song forehears the strife of notes which that one cracked seed of discord must come to germinate sure ear sure prophecy sure sorrow the sound of m saint prays first footfall on her threshold had been that fatal dissonance to molly somehow by some sad and mystic intuition she had felt her hymn of happy days a broken sequence from that moment now left alone with him the unconscious ruiner of her peace she felt she could have endured better to nurse a declared enemy than this nerveless ballastless ally and patient whose very infirmity of purpose was her bane realising the poor emotional thing he was how weak in self control she could have loathed her task enough without this sudden embargo laid on her prescribed methods no longer to reassure his indecision rather to confirm it why that very task of comforting his faint spirit bidding it on to hope had been her own one reassurance in a world of doubts and now o heart o heart what did this change of policy portend what had happened to make it so imperative all at once she could think of no answer but one and that way madness lay ah her lord her gentleman she knew him well enough to know she knew him not at all his passions were had been for her his confidences were always for himself alone blind obedience was what he had exacted of her and with blinded eyes she had let him lead her even across that abyss she would never learn from him he loved in parables o why had this stranger ever come between them with his sighs and moans and irresolution it was that same irresolution which was the crux of all what woman could tolerate a diffident lover and in the face of a masterful one she for her part would grant how alluring by contrast must appear this puissant rival cartouche her own pretty gentleman if rival he were her whole soul rose aghast to combat the thought yet if he were not so indeed what was his interest in ousting this other from the lists the end we designed has become impossible they cannot ever marry now shes not for him they must be kept apart at any price these positive admonitions scorched her brain day and night sleeping and waking they beat fiercely through it what had m saint pray done to forfeit his right was she to serve as catspaw to those others loves and lay a troublesome rival a treachery beyond conceiving if hes weak be strong for him hell thank you some day thank her her the reward perhaps to irresolution for a claim foregone had gaston heard of that scene between them and chosen for his own ends to construe it into infidelity to himself she could not believe him so credulous or so base nor fortune so inhuman but her poor mad mind dwelt upon the monstrous thought wrought itself into a frenzy over it piled fuel on its fuel in and out of reason what if it were justified no disobedience could be too great to counter such a crime she had been good good good good and faithful and self obliterating how utterly she herself had never realised until these visions of her past had risen to renounce her what had she not sacrificed for him home honour that dear untroubled land of innocence had made herself an outcast for his sake and so to be dealt the fate of the heartless self qualified wanton o mammy mammy she wept again rocking and moaning but a fiercer thought rose to dry her tears this other this woman this white witch who had come between her love and her she had not forgotten a word of his description no nor the unspoken words that eloquence of silence which fills the gaps of speech eyes will betray what tongue conceals shed seen his look beyond her at some vision she o how she hated her hated her a lily well there were lilies and lilies the scent of some grew rank at close quarters sweet and pure of heart sweet candour indeed to own oneself an apostate from the faith ones heart had sworn to and for a fortunes sake scruples forsooth they were the opportunity of the unscrupulous shed betrayed her love once why not a second time loves an elemental passion in poor mollindas no finesse no pose no self consciousness about it they come from near the soil and follow natures instincts a mates a mate to them their season is a lifetime theres no cuckold in nature nor any room for one once pledged the dear doe animal but knows her lord and holds herself meekly at his pleasure he may be polygamous she is never polyandrous to conceive his condoning even encouraging such an offence in her would be monstrous cartouche was no joseph to his poor thais she did not expect him to be she expected only his recognition of her eternal bond to him the thought justified or not that he was seeking to repudiate his sole title to her smote her like a madness the thing was abnormal horrible beyond reason yet it struck and bit into her brain out of it its torture and its haunting this meek and pretty song bird threatened to grow a harpy louis marie lying exhausted on his bed like one lately released from some rending possession by devils accepting with shamefaced gratitude the gentle ministrations of his nurse never guessed how mechanic had grown the touch which soothed his pillows what bitter scorn of him was expressed in the averted glances of those saxon blue eyes for indeed molly could hardly look at him with safety to her patient reason this the thing destined to her loves succession she felt like one fairy struck who has gone to sleep under a hay cock and wakes to find herself in a strange place the sport of goblin company where had her lines fallen she thought amazed the sleep as it were yet in her eyes among what poor counterfeits of manhood her lines she had no lines there was the woeful thing the lack of the talisman wilfully foregone which would have rendered these wiles innocuous reuben had howled when whipped like a too forward hound lashed to heel a natural cry of pain but his boldness it was that had brought him his chastisement he would have been at the throat of his mistresss enemy and his grief had been that his mistress disowned him had she once given his stubborn constancy a pathetic quality she was now for the first time appreciating at its value the right to protect her she believed fully he would have answered hard and ugly in confidence of the law the outrage to his honour his tears tears shed by an honest lad helpless and writhing under the heel of tyranny triumphant what pure water they had been compared with the hysteric weepings of this saintly milksop of these amateur heroics of this tragedy to her protestant mind of a deposed churchwarden and so her thoughts recoiled as if from a sudden adder what was reuben to her any more than was this other a dull thick witted clown to resent his just whipping strike back hurt her dear lord o cherry cherry i never meant it him to presume and dare you were merciful not to kill him ah her own love her dark young tyrant come back to me cherry give up the bad white witch my heart is bursting in its wild great longing yet while she hated to look on louis marie one aspect of him could not but hold her curious observation hes better i think he will recover those had been her masters words recover from this death blow to his hopes take on new lease of life from the withdrawal of what had served for that lifes one frail support yet it appeared cartouche had judged aright the invalid grew better from that day more calm more self possessed had ceased to chafe and writhe what did it mean if not again that she was offered the potential salve to a damaged conscience a hectic convalescence only could she but have known it the wound was there and angry only the festering fragment which had made its intolerable fret had been withdrawn ease had come with confession and hope from the strong scornful self assurance of the confessor it was the interval marking the sevenfold rally of the exorcised demon but while it obtained louis marie knew almost the exaltation of a saint uplifted by a consciousness of heroic self sacrifice yet pallid throes would take him in the night gaston was fearless gaston was bold seeing but was gaston quite the man to resolve nice ethical problems would yolande lost to him he told himself so lingering on guilty dreams of her accept the ruling of such a spiritual director the thought was father of many a week kneed generation he would never dare to put her to that test not for his own sake not for hers for her sake indeed to keep sacred her minds peace he would be content for ever to bear his burden solitary an idle resolve since she was lost to him lost of course but what if god should hold that self conscious burden atonement enough superfluous macerations were not holy but distasteful to heaven was it not his duty rather to give himself to restore her faith in heavens dispensations likely enough she had come to think herself unworthy of him of him louis who had stood for her belief in providence did he not owe it to her to god at the cost of whatever self renunciation to reassure her in the ways of faith her faith might decline on heterodoxy otherwise he had so relieved his own conscience with the shifting of its burden into that stronger grasp as almost to have lured himself into the belief that not he but gaston was the one responsible to its past it needed however but the rematerialising of a certain spectre grown hazy for a little in that charmed atmosphere of casuistry to bring about in him a sharp and instant relapse one day he was sitting in his room listening with shut eyes and drowsy relish to the voice of one of the two little cameristas who comprised the signorinas mnage and who would delight to come and read to him when invited these were quite excellent little abigails decorous as molly could wish with a taste for the lives of the saints male if possible and a devotion of course for louis marie he was always a lovely sentiment to such with his angelic colouring his piety his gentle courtesy of manner towards the least of his inferiors each of these pinks of morality within the recognised italian conventions adored him and was never so happy as when bidden up to amuse her paragon with passages from his favourite anecdotes of the saints and thus read fiorentina in her shrewd small chaunt st pol de leon took a fancy to travel and walked over the sea one fine morning to the isle of batz the governor of which one de guythure greatly coveting a silver mass bell belonging to the king of england st pol commandeth a fish of the sea to swallow and bring it thence to him which the fish hasting to accomplish the bell itself on its arrival is found gifted with a miraculous power to heal even in some cases more potent than the saints own whereby st pol is shown to be of less account than a little silver bell and thereat he boweth himself to gods rebuke witnessing how that sanctity no less than worldliness shall be caused by him to over reach itself in any unjust employment of its privileges she stopped the book dropped into her lap monsignore she whispered appalled the invalid was leaning forward his face livid his hands grasping the arms of his chair in the silence which ensued a voice a step in the room below made themselves distinctly audible bonito he gasped and fell back as if dying she flew to him raised his head petted and consoled him feeling the ecstasy of her opportunity there weep with me sweet saint she said and indeed in a little his tears were mingling themselves with hers even this homely heart could compel his soft response she thought the story was to blame there there she said as if to a child if it has made a mistake in anything god will forgive it but he could hear nothing else than the voice beneath his feet inarticulate as it reached him its tones slow whispering on his brain seemed measuring out its madness tap by tap bon ito it was bon ito come at last it was bonito true enough yet for all the purposes of intrigue not quite the crude diplomatist a guilty conscience pictured him he had come in fact to condole the english signorina on her threatened estate come it seemed like a suitor with an offer in his hand and a flower in his rusty buttonhole his shoes were tied his looks commiserating and sympathetic as he could transform them he was to play a deep part this old ape of mystics and molly was his destined catspaw descending from that scene above we find him already well launched upon his course he sits watchful and guarded she stands before him one hand to her storming breast the other leaned for support upon a chair back say it again she whispered perhaps i didnt hear aright bonito licked his lips hes a suitor for her hand she started as if stung but not an accepted one he rubbed his gritty chin thoughtfully they say he was rebuffed what then you women will claim that privilege once or twice persistence by report will always carry ye perhaps you know hes a forceful suitor youd do well by my advice to forestall the inevitable drop the old shadow for the new substance she did not answer he affected to draw encouragement from her silence think what it may mean to you if you refuse a second lease of protection is not like the first disillusioned faiths a half hearted mistress your term will be short and again will be shorter until you damned old dog she made as if to strike him he sat quite unmoved a prophet in ones own country he said coolly i daresay youve heard the adage youd reject the unpalatable keep respectable in spite of me try it thats all cast upon the mercies of turin good lord and what do i offer you in place to be my confederate in divination chaste sybilline sacred through your calling wed make a fortune between us in a year she hardly seemed to hear muttering can it be true shes so heartless so forgetful and him sickening to the death for her he pricked alert him who he asked low as if responding to a confidence who she repeated staring before her why him upstairs saint pray he rose to his feet suddenly seized her wrist her eyes fastened on him but he knew his mastery you fool he said why dont you go and tell her so tell her that he lies here in the house of cartouches mistress dying for love of her why if id known the man who lent me money in a crisis id die to serve him and that other a dog to treat you so ive no love for him i own it and heres a score paid off go at once while the old glamour lasts before hes time to return and urge his suit youll find her in her house in the zecca di roccos ill she threw him off violently he pretended a furious anger snatched up his hat made for the door rot in your folly he roared ive said my last to you and so raged away confident of the fruit the seed hed sown should come to bear the dusk was falling in the shadowy room the girl lay flung face downwards on a chair to her palpitating sobbing wringing her plump hands entered fiorentina o mistress what have happened what have he done to ye and him upstairs ever since he heard his voice crying on yolande yolande to come and save him from a great spider that have got him in its web the other came to her feet gasping driving back the tumbled hair from her temples tell him she said that if shes human he shall have her tell him that im going this moment to fetch her to him she broke off catching her breath into a whisper no tell him nothing ill bring my own message chapter xii if the chevalier de france was destined a second time to suffer humiliation through his daughters perversity that daughter herself was spared the social ostracism which would surely have overtaken one less admired in the shadow of the kings displeasure the out of favour minister despoiled of his official nimbus had to borrow what satisfaction he could from the collateral distinction conferred upon him through his relationship with so exquisite and precious a creature that was a very bitter mortification to so arrogant a man though to be sure his exaltation in the first instance had hardly owed itself to his personal merits a fact which he had no excuse but an impenetrable vanity for overlooking for the bestowal of the portfolio it had been plainly intimated to him was conditional on his leaving his majesty a perfectly free hand to dispose of that of the marchesa nor had he been ignorant even at the first of the name and reputation of the royal nominee but his pride was the haughtiest of casuists in all matters touching itself the end it sought that is to say the re investiture of de france the ancient house in its former power and possessions must be held not only to justify but to glorify the meanest means to it any step if in that direction was a step sanctified of its purpose to him though to take it he must tread on the mouth of human nature evil be thou my good might have stood for his motto and now to owe what respect it remained to him to command to the affluent graces of the child whose mutinous conduct had deposed him from the leading position it was intolerable it was monstrous his sense of personal wrong stung him to a protest which if he could but have comprehended was the very worst he could have made in his own interests but vanity is blind and that same rebellious child child indeed in her young bodys immaturity in her tragic innocence in the sweet flower of her face whose blossoming conveyed such dreams of fruitage woman only in the independence which her heart had wrung from sorrow what had been her sin why that she had persisted in holding honour something higher than its vestments and so de france was tolerated his fall condoned for yolandes sake she was the hallowed toast of turin in these days its nymph angel passe rose its dorothea symbolising paradise in her cheeks who would not be a recusant advocate to win one flower from that nosegay of pinks the story was about she had refused to sacrifice to the heathen gods and the king had decreed therefore her social racking the king a king of powder and patches perish his decrees perish also our dear cartouche to a babble of lampoons and pasquinades the pretty mongrel had done sensibly to put his tail between his legs and run away then were withers wrung heads broken duels fought about golden danae in these weeks of her brief reign she knew nothing of it all thanks to her sad self absorption as much as to her innocence torn by womens tongues wounded by gallants swords her reputation gave her no concern save for the wounds herself had caused it she had no faith could never have but one and she had abused it her state her wealth her very fairness poor trappings of her shame she wore them all as a sinner wears the outward garb of penitence sheet and candle they were to her for token of her public penance to her the whispering inquisition of the crowds she moved amidst were articulate in nothing but rebuke its notes of admiration and of compliment were addressed to deaf ears she looked kind looks from inward dreaming eyes spoke gentle mechanic words of kindness out of a constant instinct but her sweet body was always like a lonely haunted tenement shut to the world its spirit dwelt for ever away in a place of solemn crags and shadows waiting waiting and for what that was the tragedy of it all the hopeless hungering for the fruition of a thing unfructified when she died surely this poor ghost of her would become a tradition of the montverd a shadow on a rock a darkness that no sun could dissipate listening listening always for the footfall that never came how beautiful are the feet of the peace givers o louis louis if thou couldst only be heard coming up the hill to comfort this torn heart with a word of forgiveness his face rose for ever before her holy righteous denunciatory too pure and pious a thing he to presume on gods prerogatives or not to hold himself from contact with this sin by whom his faith had been contaminated a dreadful thought of all wild thoughts the most despairing that maybe she had darkened this same faith in him driven him to take the name of god in vain if only he would deign one word to reassure her as to that she could be content thereafter she thought to go down into loveless oblivion unworthy of him thrice unworthy in that her mutinous heart had once conceived a dream of him grown masterful out of wrong that would not have been her louis whose ways were always strong in meekness so waiting always fruitlessly waiting in spirit on the montverd her eyes would seek the unconquered peaks her ears address themselves to the eternal silence of the valleys listening for the footstep it could never never sound and yet she listened that was to be her punishment endless listening until perhaps she faded into the ghost of dead loves echo yet moments of passion when the human nature in her rebelled against the intolerable cruelty of it all were not unknown to her then she would dare to think of him as something other than a saint her chosen her dear hearts lord whom wicked sophistries had cast from his right part of fulfilling the woman in her then she would cry to herself that she was virgin still in all but her desecration by a foul convention was even a thing could be held worshipful by scruples less exacting it was in these moods by some moral process obliquity she thought it when they had passed that the figure of cartouche would rise before her as she had encountered it on the hillside why should it intrude itself upon that thought of a less exacting worship answer her hearts alarum answering to a look a breath the first shadow of a truth or answer truth itself she knew she had conquered where she loathed to conquer such things must be and be endured because they cannot be cured even in the tiny wound of self consciousness they inflict and which will continue to irritate occasionally when analogies are in the air thus during these moods the thought would come and be hated duly for its persecution that there might even be certain qualities in wickedness worth virtues acquiring independence resolution force of character to wit not that for that she held herself the less insulted in a base regard but the thought would recur and then there came the day when pale suffering reproachful as she fancied it the face of her love stood out between her and a tumultuous crowd and in that sorrowful vision all other visions were instantly absorbed and lost the shock of it patent in her stunned manner had affected anyone less self centred than the chevalier he thought she was frightened by the surge of things and lent his high arrogance to reassure her she hardly heard or saw him he was in turin from that moment the desire for the footsteps grew intense she had hoped or had told herself she hoped that he had forgotten her and lo in every line printed on that lonely face she recognised the indelible scoring of her sin he loved her still and by every token of his love stood forth a conscious shame she was in deep waters then and cried to heaven to save her it answered with the offer of cartouches hand we know how that suit sped but it bore some fruit of tenderness towards a hopeless passion as how could yolande be woman and not feel it and it brought more a recrudescence in her of those thoughts which touched on the comparative qualities of good and evil this man he must have the seed of virtue in him so to have promised self redemption by way of a bitter loss that was strength perhaps he had had his excuses after all she prayed for him prayed heaven moreover to accredit her with her share in his reformation he was her louiss friend had spoken probably in ignorance of his friends presence in the city and he had promised her what had he promised o love thou crown and symbol to all time of specious egotism he had promised on the virtue of that very suffering she had caused in him that it should all come right his strength was in the phrase the strength of ungodliness and she built upon it while she abhorred his character had not scrupled to insult and misread it to the vilest conclusions she built upon its characteristic qualities built what no consciousness of any building in her she would have declared but it will all come right nay had it not been it shall all come right o how she sighed over her own impotence to stem the masterfulness of these sinful wills was she for ever to be their helpless shuttlecock no hope for her but the cloister so she and louis marie saintly casuists turning to face one another across a tragic interval pictured cartouche the friend the lover for the scapegoat of their loves reparations some men would make burnt offerings of themselves it was not for them ingenuous in the ways of worldliness to question the methods of their atonement one night she this dear casuist had driven home ah the bitter irony of the word to the via della zecca with her father great clouds sagged from the sky bellied over the house roofs swelling to their delivery of fire moans of their enormous labour shook the air jarring on ones teeth like glass a night of heavy omen its spirit drove with them menacing and oppressive the chevalier himself was a thunder cloud swollen with sense of injury he scowled silent in his corner they had been at the italian comedy to see the representation of a damned female soul and the audience pull off their hats literally to st john for his handsome conduct of her case and thence had driven to a conversazione at the house of the british envoy to the court of turin whence these tears the casa di rocco reached the chevalier alighted as was his custom first but seeming to remember himself bowed apart while the mistress of the house descended and entered the portal she flushed but made no comment and he followed in her footsteps furious now to vent his chagrin on the least menial slight to his importance he was very handsomely dressed and appeared to assume by every pomp of circumstance the right of the mastership of the household the two were ushered into the salon a room ablaze with tapers and there left to their august disputations the tempest threatened very near vibrated in the windows like the pedal stops of a vast organ there was wine on a table the chevalier offering to pour himself out a glass with a white not very steady hand refrained and looked towards his daughter have i your permission madam he said my natural fatigue must not let me forget that i am a pensioner on your bounty she fanned herself quietly there was a light in her patient eyes but he was blind to the warning sign what have i done to deserve this she asked softly his self control was a bubble he dashed the decanter down on the table and advanced a little towards her quivering with mortified anger you ask me that he said whence have we come this moment from what circumstances of slight and humiliation to the parent whose devotion to his child has procured him a return which should make her blush for her ingratitude she was still very quiet i think she was at length awakening to the irreclaimable selfishness of the man before her but her disillusionment fought against the last bitter concession to itself for pity and poor hearts sake she must struggle still to temporise not to let go her final hold on duty she forced a little painful smile but her honesty would allow nothing to subterfuge if you allude she said to his excellency the envoys attentions to myself i beg you to bear in mind father that i was taught a little english by my gouvernante and that doubtless the poor man courted the sound of his native language though on such imperfect lips he smote fist into palm am i a child to be quieted with equivoque i speak not of his attentions to you but of the contempt for myself which they were designed to emphasise o no father indeed i am sure you are mistaken then the storm broke its pressure within him had rushed to relief by any outlet even a pin prick and which you tacitly condoned he screamed have i carried my honour sensitive to a breath a hint a thing high and exclusive untarnished through all these cursed years of adversity and not to know when it is impugned but you will be blind because you desire it because your personal scruples sha are against a paltry sacrifice which would help to reinstate your father in the position which is his by right and from which he could rise to recover something at least of the ancient influence of his house no daughter of that or of mine i say it before god i am in the mood i think to curse you she had risen to her feet ghastly white but with something born and in a flash into her expression which had never been there before i think if you did she said the curse would be let recoil on a shameful head he uttered a terrible exclamation but she silenced him you talk of your honour what is mans honour to a maids yet for your honours sake you could sell mine a father sell his childs once you did it and i was obedient though it broke my heart i will not listen he raged you shall listen she answered i could have borne to suffer and be silent that first irremediable wrong i believed your honour pledged and i gave myself to redeem it you know under what persuasion but now having once sold me me your child to dishonour for your honours sake to think to trade upon my forfeited self respect as if myself not you were answerable for it to build yourself a name on mine so fallen o shame shame my father she quite overawed him he had evoked the spirit of his house in her to startling effect he had no answer but oaths and hysteria woman he shrieked i am sixteen she said you call me as you have made me is it to my reproach or to yours but if i am woman in her sad name i claim her saddest rights freedom through martyrdom i will be independent i will be mistress of my soul i will not hold myself a convicted wanton at your honours bidding this man you offer me this man whom you would bid to cast down my body for a stepping stone to your own ambition do you know what he is has been his life his reputation he was silent but only because his rage grew inarticulate i am not so hardened she went on but that i can shrink and shudder in the shadow of such a name he to be worthy of me me o father she wavered for one instant have i not been willing eager that you should take everything of mine everything everything only not this one poor possession that i cannot part with and remain your worthy daughter her eyes were moist she held out piteous hands to him but his passion by now was swelled to a monstrous thing deaf blind suicidal stand off he shrieked backing from her as if he loathed her contact you are worthy of nothing but a fathers curse she shuddered and stood rigid in that moment they fell apart never to be reconciled again i warn you not to speak it she said not till you know the thing youve done the lives youve ruined the broken faiths for which you made yourself answerable to god when you threatened me with that cowards act before you pledged me i was already pledged my heart my soul you did not know it i have accepted this heavy punishment for heavens retribution on me for that sin of silence i accept it no longer loves honour and loves vows would i know have counted for nothing with my father but they still hold me to the past for all my faith is worth we had met by accident we had no thought o no thought to deceive you only we delayed forgetting in our happiness he was a monsieur saint pray a name as noble as the man himself too good and true for such as we to honour and i broke my faith to him and you were the cause he raised his hand gasping she went on before he could speak i tell you now there is no man shall never be to me in all the world a man with claims like his if he would have me the stained and humbled thing i am i would give myself in tears and gratitude to redeem his broken past but i am unworthy of him and you have made me so then he spoke a babble of raging words but his lips forbore the curse perhaps from real apprehension perhaps from policy he was not one to burn his boats even in a fit of madness in the end he fell quite suddenly upon self control and stood like a shaking spectre of himself very well he said it is very well you are your own mistress you will wed this man this saintly paramour of yours if he will consent to make an honest woman of you i have no more to say no she answered you have said the last he stood a moment uncertain turned and left the room she remained motionless as he had left her a minute two minutes then suddenly was looking about her with a curious quick action of the head hunted alone quite desolate where could she turn for help support o god the wickedness the wickedness save her someone she could hear the hideous panting of the chase quite close she the entrance of a servant restored her to some self command the man after one inquisitive furtive look dropped his eyes and abased himself he deprecated madonnas resentment he had hesitated before intruding himself but these young women they were so persistent so full of self assurance so convinced that their missions were imperative he had done his best to get rid of her but in vain of her of whom demands madonna quieting her lips with her handkerchief he shrugs his shoulders and his eyebrows the young woman would give no name she had been waiting for hours but now vouchsafed the assurance of madonnas refusal he will go and dismiss her at once and finally show her in to me here says the marchesa and the man bows and withdraws the little interval the necessity of self control in it brought her to herself when the visitor was ushered in she was seated to all appearance a lovely waxen image of serenity she lifted her eyes and saw a fair young girl cloaked and hooded standing before her the servant closed the door and shut them in together well my child she said affectedly incurious and indeed it was a child like herself whom she addressed what do you want with me the glow and splendour of her surroundings must have their foremost influence on molly petted loveling as she was her senses must gape a little before the woe and despair in her could find their way to utterance then all in a moment the shock of an unforeseen difficulty had overwhelmed her on the threshold of her mission she uttered an exclamation alack a day she cant speak english and fell a little away in consternation english yolande frowned the word was curiously ill timed she looked intently at her visitor english she repeated are you an english girl so well you see i understand you what is it you want of me my man it came in an irresistible cry fierce emotional from the girls heart she gasped after it actually as if a spasm had rent it forth then she bent and looked with tumultuous irony into the others face ay she said its beautiful enough like a wax dolls as smooth and as hard i warrant but neither the wit nor the passion in her could keep that mood she stood up again i want my man she cried give him back to me i was the first with him yolande pale and indignant rose to her feet what is the meaning of this she said i know nothing of you nor of whom you are speaking im speaking cried the girl of him they call cartouche ay you may start its a name should make you blush for love forsworn yolande made a swift movement as if to summon aid the girl intercepted her fell at her feet clung to her skirts no no dont call let me speak ill be good and quiet i will if youll only listen i didnt mean no impudence not to such as you o lady for dear pitys sake hear me out who are you ill tell you though he kills me for it im his woman his kept woman there youll not think the worse of him for that we count for little with the quality when they come to marry like a mans brooch or the buckles in his shoes we were right enough as a fashion for yesterday but to day when our turns over tis bad taste even to speak of us but theres something different here there is o my lady you did ought to consider it before you rob me of him some terrible emotion between loathing and pity was struggling in yolandes heart as she looked down on the imploring figure an instinctive horror in her fought against its own understanding would not believe temporised with the truth speaking in a voice of shuddering pity a woman you poor child the other misconstrued her why not we cant pick and choose in our class but were no more blind and deaf than you to whats the best only if we want it we must pay i was just a village girl and him a gentleman dont you blame him for it i gave myself to him and with my eyes open we know the odds we take they must marry some day but to throw me over for you you whose true love ive took and cared for at his bidding and tried to nurse back into faith and hope of you that jilted him while all the time youve been undermining me with my own o lady havent you a heart to hear him that other calling on your name to know him dying there and all for love of you while you dally with this thats mine she broke down and buried her face in her hands weeping and her listener through all that distorted outcry some passion of the truth must penetrate her cartouche at first only a sense of utter outrage in that name predominated a libertine unredeemed and irredeemable a practising intriguant even in the moment of his suit to her that at least was clear she hated herself for that one impulsive thrill of kindness towards him this ruined life at his door and he had dared to approach her with such a lie in his heart to affect repentance to ah what was that this thing which was worse than all she withdrew her skirts a little her hand was ice her words fell like snow flakes soft and cold you are mistaken girl there is nothing never has been never could be between myself and and the gentleman you named molly looked up amazement and incredulity in her eyes doesnt he love you she said the little marchesa swept her skirts away dont touch me she whispered terribly i am soiled in seeing you hearing you the word is fouled upon your lips o my god these vermin in thine image am i like them have they the right to claim me to themselves she stamped in fury leave me go to your own dont dare to link my name with his again the girl had risen to her feet quite cowed as she was for the moment a joy was in her heart to hear herself so repudiated in that company her worst fears were laid her venom was turned to honey she whimpered a little in a panic half feigned half felt there i dont want to im going for sure then a spit of courage came to her and ill tell the other he may just die for all you care and she turned but before she could reach the door a swift step followed and a soft white hand ringed and scented was placed upon her shoulder she hesitated an instant faced round and the next moment the two high saint and lowly sinner were clasped together weeping poor molly knew her place she sunk at the others feet again till yolande knelt beside her and put her arms about the shameful head poor child poor sinful woman she said to a flurry of sighs and sobs o what was i to hold you so apart but you dont understand you cant god pity you the worse for him that killed your innocence he ill not hear his name he was my only one and and for your sake hes been wanting to make me good has he theres a way maybe but not the way you mean thats closed to such as us alas what way then make yourself impossible to him i sweet saints give me patience with this poor ignorance how can i make her comprehend that i could never be more impossible to him than i am o yes you could there there child how o mistress dont you know

sinking and not a straw to hold by ah hush ye pretty one hush ye the magdalen with winking wondering eyes was become the comforter she clasped the cold hands within her own warm palms and mumbled them and loved their softness yolande her head bowed sat grieving still a little to look all round and not to know where to turn no guide no help out of this maze she snuffled and mopped her eyes then struggled to regain her estate there child my heart bleeds for you what is your name o i forgot you havent one for indeed to this sweet orthodoxy an unchurched passion was a nameless thing a maiden title forfeited to anonymity im molly bramble please my lady she hung her head the other pursed her lips a moment well well child well call you as we call our dog or parrot terms for distinguishment then the moth plunged for the light about which she had been desperately fluttering this nervous while you mentioned of your nursing someone or perhaps i confused your meaning ay did i you know him saint pray the other put her away and got hurriedly to her feet youre nursing him you he brought him to me told me to told me to help him back to be a man and win you yet who brought him who told you

while i fetch my cloak fiorentina bidden to hold her tongue to louis marie told him everything under promise of secrecy how that one was coming in a little to break his brains web and kill the wicked spider a physician maybe maybe a wise woman for indeed physicians were not her and the signorina had stated distinctly in answer to his cries that she was going that moment to fetch her to cure him fortunately or not he heard her without comprehending he was lying apathetic by then quit of the fellow in the cellarage that thundering whisper silenced all commoner voices served him but as opiates by and by he fell into a doze and the little camerista drew his curtains and lit his candles and went below to gossip with her house mate the storm laboured up and over mingling with the sick mans dreams the rush of tempest smote on ice he was alone in a surging darkness it cracked with a roar of thunder and spilled a dead body at his feet madly he strove to spurn the thing into monstrous seeming abysses for all their blackness they were shallow troughs or else the glacier rolled like water and threw it up he trampled it in fury it writhed away reshaping then it took to laughing and the laugh was echoed from hard by and there was bonito hiding in a drift he woke with a scream but he was sleeping again when the little camerista hurried up and looked into his pale exhausted face and touched some pillows into comfort before leaving him sweet dreams this time but still of weeping rains only they fell softly on a chapel roof she was not there beside him and he wondered why she lingered till glancing at the coloured statue of the virgin he saw it stir and smile and stretch out wistful arms to him and heard it breathe his name louis louis and it was she herself descending and coming to him but before they could reach and touch she had vanished louis louis her voice wept far remote an infinite yearning faint and always fainter till suddenly with a crash the roof was rent and a flood of fire rushed in revealing her quite close to him a breathing apparition all love and sorrow paining her sweet eyes he lay and did not stir yolande he whispered she sighed and clasped her hands she answered with the plaint if not in the words of love lorn madeline o leave me not in this eternal woe for if thou diest my love i know not where to go she moved and was kneeling by him pleading with hurrying sighs the sin was mine the sin was mine and o a fruitless sacrifice so pale so worn o thing without a heart to have caused this cruel sickness in my love yolande a wilder thrill gave out the word louis if thou couldst still find that in me worth living for ah do not die i would be so loving and so penitent not forward no the shame in mes an ecstasy i cry to have you humble me lily of savoy the white lily and mine a gloating transport whispered in his voice thine still dear love and for all her shame inviolate she hid her face to speak it this was no swooning vision but reality no matter whence she had come or at what instigation the death warrant was cancelled life at her words flowed back to him lapped in a sensuous dream doubts fears proscriptions were all forgotten his pulses beat to madness a delirious hunger of her swelled his veins this sweet fruit of his desire it were as if the heavy bosomed grapes made animate by love had drooped of their own pity to the lips of tantalus should he not crush them in his mouth unquestioning praising the heavenly mercy not abusing it with one self scruple as to his deserts it was characteristic of him at least so to surrender his will to circumstance he flushed as if intoxicated he leaned impassioned towards her my wife he whispered and drew her to his heart she raised her streaming eyes what you have suffered for my sake and not the least to find you here here yolande the best that could have happened to me o my love you must not say it it is a wicked house yolande o god my saint is innocent louis this man your friend and the poor girl what of them they live in sin together o my lamb among the wolves old tremors old lost scruples seized him at the words he clung to her take me away yolande i am so sick and helpless yes yes my love my husband come with me no i am too ill to morrow dont leave me now youve come o i must louis then i shall die tis only you can save me make me a man again o love you kill my heart to save me yolande to save yourself that new self reproach if i died without and if you were to die in spite o love that cried to me to humble it we will be man and wife to morrow i shall live for that i must the thought will lay the spectres that would kill me else yolande you will not let me die o louis let me rather come to me my dear my love my wife there sweet my wife this seal upon your lips in the grey of the dawn cold and austere after tempest the signorina brambello hurried forth to procure an accommodating priest he was easily found easily bribed easily persuaded into quick conclusions the two were joined before the altar of san maddalena a dingy chapel in an obscure neighbourhood and molly and fiorentina were the witnesses at the end in the sombre porch the pale bride turned upon the english girl god in his mercy so give thy sin to mend itself my sister she hesitated an instant then threw her arms about the others neck kissed her on the mouth and hanging her sweet head went with her husband down the steps into the silent street and his face also was bowed as he walked feebly beside her chapter xiii cartouche released at the end of a week from his inaugural business in the le prieur prefecture returned forthwith to turin and to the re encountering a problem whose difficulties one had thought he might have studied more profitably at a distance but a characteristic precipitancy in deed and word as much acquired as born of self reliance in him compelled him from hesitating on the brink of things when angels and devils were at contest in his interests he was not going to miss the excitement nor the chance of applauding or perhaps damning the victors but he had had a more wearing time of it than he would have cared to admit even to himself he was not apt at moral conundrums and one had come to consume his peace confoundedly he felt it always smouldering in his breast ready to break out into flame at any moment and he had really laid out its premises very impartially for his own consideration he was an eclectic by nature as alas is the case with a number of naughty people it is unfortunate indeed that righteousness so often lacks the sense of humour which is the faculty for seeing both sides of a question the want seems to give obliquity such a superiority though it is a specious one of course he could admit then the inevitableness of a deed which had preserved an honour most dear and sacred to himself he could not admit a claim to that honour personified as the price of blood louis the slayer of a womans husband could not take that husbands place were she knowingly to let him her honour would be forfeit were he to take advantage of her ignorance he would be doing a vile thing she was not for louis could never be in any scheme of moral purifications for whom then why scarcely less vile were he cartouche to seek to take advantage of his friends hard fortune it will be observed that he somehow inferred for that problematic vileness its problematic opportunity the ineradicable instinct perhaps of an amoroso experienced in the ways of audacity to whom a rebuff had always stood and likely been always justified in standing for an incitement to fresh aggression as to another question that of his own relationship to the dead man he utterly declined to recognise it as one involving his personal interdiction the marriage had been a mere conditional contract of the essence of a betrothal and the conditions had not been observed no moral prohibition such as touched upon the forbidden degrees was implied by it he told himself and told himself so he insisted merely to emphasise the singleness of his renunciation he would have the full credit for his self sacrifice his responsibility was not to a sentimental scruple but to his ideal of an immaculate honour in the woman he worshipped remained the question of his attitude towards the murderer of his father and of his royal commission to hunt down that unknown assassin well he had both discovered and exonerated him but the offence was still officially un crime qualifi to condone it were to make himself an accessory he would condone it however since by so doing he testified to his loyalty to his ideal yolandes eternal fame should owe him that sacrifice of his duty to his nobler conscience by so little at least he would justify himself in the thankless wardenship of her honour by so little he would make himself the right to claim her into an association with himself so far and so good for his solution of the problem this dear prize was not for louis it was not for him what then was to be its destiny there was his ideal eternal maid by virtue of her deathless bondage to the past she was to exist the unattainable goddess of all desire he might not reach to her but he might enforce his own precedence in her worship he would be the high priest of that altar winning to his place by hearts devotion he pictured her a virgin for ever unfulfilled the flying figure on the vase and himself the passionate shepherd stricken to an endless rapture of pursuit what sweeter more idealistic heaven she cannot fade though thou hast not thy bliss for ever wilt thou love and she be fair a pretty pretty romance but was it practical his soul at least flamed out to it it gave him a mad wild joy to think that circumstance and by no contrivance of his own had removed the one mortal bar to its attainment whence now and wherefore his return to turin to make himself secure of his transfigured idol to confirm louis marie if necessary in his renunciation of an untenable claim for knowing the man he could not but have his doubts of his resolution so much of him was based on emotion a treacherous foundation and for the rest his own title by way of redemption to that priesthood why molly of course was to be included in the transcendent scheme she was to share his atonement and be appointed a vestal to the altar of his love he would pension her off for that purpose he would o a mad world my masters where love could not legalise itself without making a scapegoat of somebody and there was even another flaw his promise to yolande but he had been obliged to forget all about that as he walked in a sort of sombre self complacency as of a martyr about to testify through the streets his mind was busy over those first practical solutions of his problem which he was about to face it would be necessary he had decided to inform his friend restored he hoped by now to reason of the impossible situation which his appointment had brought about and to urge him to resolve its insuperable difficulties by instant flight that must be the first step and afterwards alert perspicacious by instinct his eyes had become aware as he moved on of something oddly inquisitorial something droll and furtive in the glances of friends and acquaintances whom he met whether directed at himself or slyly interchanged he affected to pass all by unconcerned nodding brightly here and there without stop or comment but he made mental notes abstractedly stroking his sword hilt as if it were a pet terriers head he felt quietly a little wicked his theory of self reforms it would appear halted yet something short of meekness and the second cheek to the smiter at the corner of a street he ran plump upon dr bonito the adverb is figurative the doctor was always as shrewd an encounter as an edge of north wind he cut into ones meditations like a draught on the present occasion it seemed he cut to get home into an adversary unprepared his lean face kindled to the unexpectedness and opportuneness of the meeting hail hail m le prfet he croaked in hoarse glee heres a magnetic conjunction what man so much in my mind and lo i look up and the man himself have you despatched both rogues and measures in your new province but doubtless you are returned betimes to assay the truthfulness of the great report well be satisfied it is true cartouche balanced on his heel imperturbably conning the face of his old familiar he saw enough there to detain him a reflective moment the two had not met since their parting under the porticoes father bonito said he i do not want to possess your mind you can stick up a bill for a new tenant i have grown a little particular in my tastes in the meanwhile i am only this hour returned to turin and greatly pressed for time what in a word is this report of which you speak and i know nothing the doctor sprawled up his hands in feigned astonishment gods i believe he really hasnt heard it and the very stones of the town babbling with it these days past not to have heard it the one most interested with myself he hasnt im my own first suitor to his gratitude for this well the devil give you brevity no no one moment stop the marchioness di rocco mr trix ah he withdrew a detaining hand grinned took off his hat and mopped his forehead with a ropey clout eying his halted prey the while a long throw that monsieur he said yet it hooked you but to be sure shes a killing bait cartouche just lifting his eyebrows vouchsafed him no other answer he knew his man was steeling himself quietly against some blow which he felt was preparing and which he saw would be designed to take him off his guard let bonito in that case extract what satisfaction he could out of his manner in fact when the stroke actually fell his reception of it was so apparently unconcerned as even to deceive the doctor into a doubt of the effectiveness of his own home thrust and to aggravate his malice proportionately yes a killing bait a killing bait he said and threw his handkerchief into his hat and covered himself all deliberately well he said congratulate me mr trix he was shy but hes taken her at last cartouche yawned in the name of patience whos taken whom said he who why m saint pray has taken his marchesa thats all well those are news to be sure are they not eh he he you are looking worn mr trix im afraid you take your new duties too seriously you shouldnt forget that all social office is a compromise a figure representing the balance between good and evil to lower one of which unduly is to exalt the other unduly yes weve married our couple have we indeed and who are we my bonito there these low levels tell on one coming from the heights you must be careful of your throat i notice a huskiness in it already why indeed save for a natural diffidence i might say monsieur that we stands for i seeing that as a fact the initiative was mine in any case what we were one in desiring is at this moment an accomplished thing the two are married not as you may suppose a union regarded with favour in certain quarters no i suppose not and how did you bring it about ah ha theres the marrow why how you flush and pale i doubt the prudence of exciting you mr trix in this present turbulent state of your blood exciting me what do you mean why should i be excited have i been hanging rogues so few as to start at the mention of a noose tell me how you managed it my dear excellent old devil well i will there are points you maynt approve but the end must justify the means listen then i could not make our friend eligible in the way i proposed but still i was his matrimonial agent you remember the term it was your own as such my duty to him my duty to myself demanded renewed enterprise on my part you who have expressed an eagerness no less than mine to secure this match will i hope condone even approve the advantage i took of a report concerning yourself to realise our common wish a report what was that why that you yourself was a suitor for the hand of the lady yes and the advantage you took of that same veracious legend it may have been a legend it was certainly an opportunity what did i do why forgive me sir i simply went and repeated it for what it was worth to the signorina brambello and left the leaven to ferment the result was quite astonishing she ran straight off it appears in a pet of jealousy to the lady induced her to return with her to the bedside of her stricken gallant by which or thereabouts it seems our madam spent the night and married the two incontinent the next morning at a neighbouring chapel called somewhat appropriately la maddalena giving herself and another for witness now am i to be congratulated or not a word in season hath accomplished what all your theories of pretty heartenings and reassurances had failed to you appealed to the signorinas sympathies i to a baser but more practical sentiment acknowledge who was the better sophist cartouche clapped him on the shoulder you you my bonito the credit is all yours and the triumph i will not forget it i will not overlook your part in this happy consummation bonito grinned nor your innamoratas eh mr trix egad shes a name in turin to day she might command but there these reports are not for my lips her price you mean well she shall have it now i must go i have business which can wait no longer he went off humming a little song as once before the doctor stood conning his receding figure until it had vanished round a corner then he gave a short sudden laugh and turned to his own way well acted he thought and well out of the reckoning he and well saved my own skin for the present im a little afraid at the expense of the dear signorinas but bah if the wind were to hold its breath for fear a leaf or two might fall thered be no clearing the air in this world of scruples cartouche walked straight to the little villa in the lane of chestnuts it was a glowing lustful day the white curtains in the windows bosomed out to him like loves own welcome lizards basked on the walls the flowers in the garden hung sweet drowsy heads he was singing still when he reached the door singing when he greeted fiorentina with a chin chuck he walked with a song on his lips into the parlour she was there sure enough a flushed palpitating beauty with a brave front of greeting and a quaking heart behind it he had no idea of making many words about the thing he stopped in the middle of the room smiling at her what said he no kiss for me she had never realised until this moment the fulness of her daring nor its madness she gulped sickly as she crept up to him without a word and put her lips to his cheek he had a purse of gold ready and held it out to her there are your wages judas as if her legs had been knocked from under her she went down at his feet no no he was dying cherry better he had died o dont condemn me unheard did you disobey me yes but that is enough o my god am i to go yes think what it means to me i am thinking and you can do it and i can do it a hundred times and worse than that if you tempt me take your price and go back to england if you are wise do you see this in my hand its my last mercy he drew away from her where she lay cast upon her face and moaning i am going he said but i shall return in the afternoon at three oclock if then i find you still here understand what i say your chance to save yourself is past ill kill you on our bed i mean it a wild desolate scream broke from her throat he threw the purse down beside her on the floor and left the house without another word at three oclock to the minute he returned not till he had searched into every corner of the villa would he question the red eyed cameristas huddled awaiting him in their kitchen then he learned that she had gone indeed they would have besieged his heart with tearful clamour telling of the scene its rending piteousness but he stopped them peremptorily paid them their wages double and treble and dismissed them he had already seen that the purse of gold lay untouched where he had thrown it down upon the floor for all his gripping will that gave his heart a wrench he stooped and took it in his hand hesitated then with a curse at his own weakness thrust it into his breast he went from room to room bolting the windows in one upstairs he paused so long that ghosts began to stir and whisper in the empty house something he thought was moving the curtains of the bed to which his back was turned little slippers stole from underneath a chair and walked without sound upon the floor he heard a sigh it was himself sighing with a mad oath he turned and tramped downstairs resolutely making all the noise he could the next moment he had clapped to the door behind him and was in the open air that night pacing the streets he passed a hospital for magdalens a box beseeching charity was in the wall he stopped and taking the purse from his breast dropped the coins from it one by one into the slit then he turned and disappeared into the darkness part iii chapter i we mortals discuss the world as a subject of our common understanding and no two of us see it with the same eyes to victor amadeus the thirds for example it was a stage for ftes galantes to the chevalier de frances a ball fettered to the ankle of an heir at law infamously kept from his inheritance to those of a certain little corporal as yet unaccredited it was a potential family estate to yolandes and louis maries a reformatory for original sin to bonitos it was a footstool to the stars to cartouches an absurd necessity to jacques balmats a glorious field for adventure in jacques was the most famous man in le prieur and for long distances beyond it in notability he had outstripped all these other claimants to our attention for he had won his mountain and his wife and basked in the lustre and the reward of a great enterprise greatly accomplished yet he took his reputation modestly as became one who had looked on death too often and too close to boast himself superior to that god hed propitiated not defied him there was something very solemn very sobering in having gained that awful shadow for ones friend so he accepted his part without arrogance but without hypocrisy ah monsieur he said to saint pray lord consort to his lady of the manor you should have held on you should not have lost heart you should have been with me there are no heights so inaccessible but that the good god will surrender them to our trust in him as the first guide of us all there is no corner of his world of which he hath said faith shall not enter here madame saint pray she had dropped flung away rather her title looked up from her needle work with a little frown like an acute accent nicked between her eyes she was conscious on this occasion as she had been on others of that half protective half accusatory note in the young mountaineers respectful addressings of her husband which somehow touched a corresponding chord in herself it vibrated on a thought of weakness it was the tremor in the heart of dying dreams its first movement in her had been co instantaneous with the fall of her saint from transcendent to merely human heights something of discharm spoke in it a sense as of an idol convicted of petitioning his worshipper a sense as of an unwilling accessory to anothers secret sin a sense as of a responsibility incurred where help had been expected these several emotions she found suggested somehow in young balmats tone were they common to all sympathetic spirits brought into whatsoever relations with her husband she feared so she feared more that louis marie liked it to be so his caressing confidence in all others than himself constituted at once his strength and his weakness he ruled by sweet dependence and was satisfied to rule there were hints of a certain change in her in these days signs of an enforced self emancipation which in its process had a little chilled the texture of her faith it was in its moral like that hardening of the grain which only a close observer can detect in the fixing of a pastel the bloom was a thought less virgin the eyes less liquid clear the lips had tightened to a scarce perceptible primness her love was as single as great as self sacrificing as ever only it had altered its habit to a sterner garb it ruled where it had served it had made a subject of him who had been its lord it justified itself by every concession to the loved one but that of self abandonment and in such implied reproaches as those of honest balmats it felt its attitude vindicated you should have been with me he had said he should if he had if it had been in his nature to be this twin history of theirs she believed had never come to find its tragedy and redemption louis at this moment had been her king her tyrant even their parts had never of necessity been reversed of course in all this she only skimmed the truth there was more to be inferred even than she supposed from the young mountaineers tone it implied in fact a troubled conscience seeking to allay its own suspicions on the strength of a serenity in their object which must surely it told itself be incompatible with guilt for indeed a certain serenity had come to succeed in louis marie the storms and anguish of a former state his wifes tender ministrations a year of utter peace of utter immunity from disturbance in their retreat had restored him to a measure of self confidence even to a point of view something broader than that in which cartouche had confirmed him now he was inclined to think that his deed had been not only righteous but heroic that his bearing of its burden in silence was a saintly discipline that in any case his confiding of his awful secret like king midass barber to the reeds had acquitted him of the first responsibility to it and the last was after all his most characteristic comfort he grew well on it as a worried schoolboy quit of his imposition to a merciful parent forgets his troubles in a moment there remained only to disturb his conscience the question of his conditional absolution as decreed by cartouche well as to that he had assured and reassured himself his friend was scarcely matriculated in moral philosophy but even were he called upon by him to answer for his act he had still this to plead that he had not married yolande but yolande him for the rest slow growing sense of security had come to mend his sickness of another shadow a year had passed and it had not yet pursued him to his fastness in the chteau di rocco he hoped now it never would he hoped he read in the social exile which their own mutinous act had decreed upon himself and yolande an abandonment of any interest in their further fortunes god grant they might be permitted to make out their days in peace justifying as they for ever strove and intended for ever to strive to do in their devotion to their church in a wide and noble beneficence their inheritance of a wicked mans possessions for to this end only had they decided to take up the burden of an estate otherwise hateful to them it was a mellow september noon the three sat under the front of the grim old chteau in the quiet sunlight far off across the valley on a level with their eyes great flakes of silver white spangling a golden haze were the huddled masses of the alps no less soft and unsubstantial in appearance as the floating iridescences one sees in water they were still the native home and most austere dominion of primordial rock and ice it seemed impossible to realise it the very shadows on their slopes were traced so soft they were no more shadows than the blue veins in marble than the blue inter webbings of running surf surely that mist of peaks must be descended cloud and the changing colours of it the bloom of angelic wings beating within below the sitters feet terrace declined upon terrace until halted against a buttress wall the cultivated land gave place beyond to stony pastures which descended to the lower verge of the estate and the great wrought iron gates of the entrance and between poised high in the mid ether of the valley a watching kestrel floated like a leaf madame saint pray looking up answered for her husband her recognition that neither high achievement nor great failure was ever for this dear weanling of her passion was not to find her loyalty to him at fault rather to confirm her jealousy for his reputation that is a very right sentiment for a guide m jacques she said but there may be nobler conquests for duty even than those of mountains monsieur owed his life to me and he sacrificed his ambitions to that debt that was the thorn then she offered the rose for you you owed that conquest to your love and bravely you strove and gained i hope the dear father recovers himself of your naughtiness jacques laughed then essayed his little gallantry no frenchman however primitive lacks that essential grace i said monsieur should not have lost his heart for the enterprise i was a dog an imbecile what summit could equal that to which his heart attained i thought myself near heaven as i stood up there alone the first to get so near alas madame monsieur staying on the ground had already gained it monsieur lying comfortably back in his chair smiled kindly that is very true jacques and i wish i could take credit for the best deserts but you have not answered madamas question of dr paccard monsieur the old man is almost himself again he can see his son in law at last it was cruel of you to force him to the summit said madame why what would you answered the mountaineer he would never have believed else and upon his belief depended my reward but by all accounts he could not see even then that is true but others could my faith he was bad but it was his bargain not mine that he should accompany me to witness he would have given up before we slept the first night on la cte there had been enough and to spare already to terrify him with dusk had come an oppression of the air our axes sang like flutes suddenly as i climbed holding my staff by the middle it had a knob of light for head a thing like a luminous bladder that palpitated and swelled and shrunk and swelled again till in a moment it detached itself and floated away far far into the shadows where it burst with a clap like thunder then came the lightning above everywhere one blaze struck the ground right in front of us it was as if a bucket of fire had been emptied from some window of the rocks it splashed up and was gone leaving a stench mon dieu the fish they had been gutting up there were not very fresh o horrible horrible better than that our heads had received it but i am fatiguing madame no no go on i have wanted so much to hear it from your lips he slept exhausted for all his fright wrapped in my blanket and moaning for the good roast chicken which he had ordered at home against his soon return when he awoke it was bright calm sunlight and he had gathered new heart of rest we went on and up but his courage soon ebbed running out at his heels until mon dieu he was crawling on his belly like a mole that was laughable enough but even so my merriment could urge him no further than the dme du goter where he sat down and refused to move a step further i gave him my glass and told him to look how the villagers watched us from below and at martha herself the brave child waving to us with her handkerchief it was all of no use i had to leave him and go on alone the thin air suffocated me the wind shaved my cheeks drawing blood from them like a clumsy barber every sweep of its razor was a gash but by then i was mad to conquer or perish though it strip me to the bone i thought my skeleton shall stand on the summit and presently all in an instant i was there o madama it is something that to have seen the stars by daylight they were all about my head crowning me perhaps their glory intoxicated my brain in any case i was fierce now to go and fetch my comrade and force him to come up and believe and i went down to him again and roused him from his stupor and drove him before me up the heights he was quite dumb and silly like a drunken man but my will was great and i got him there he could see nothing the snow blindness was in his eyes he would hear nothing take your martha he said and let me sleep that was all how i got him down and home is known to none but god it is not known to me louis marie listening in a glow had caught something of the speakers transport he turned with kindled eyes to yolande see his looks confessed what i have foregone for your sake she gave a sudden cry ah and pointed down the hawk had swooped into a tree and re emerged with a little fluttering life in its claws that is very pitiful she said i had heard the poor thing singing to his mate but a moment ago balmat took up his hat he sang of himself by the token madama he said of what a fine fellow he was it is the way with cock birds that was a good lesson to me be sure it said before you start to blow your own trumpet that an enemy is not within hearing as having made his respectful adieux he went down the hill at a swing the lodge gate clanked at the foot of the drive far below they saw his diminishing figure halt against another which was approaching the two appeared to exchange greetings and a few words at the end balmat resumed his way down and the stranger turned again to the ascent as he came on the cuttings of the hill path swallowed him and he disappeared from view in the same instant yolande bent over her work heard her husband get hurriedly to his feet and glanced up at him silks and needles went to the ground she was by him in a moment what is it louis louis he was deadly pale he was holding his hand to his forehead in a lost way take me in take me in he muttered i i think the sun ah it was perhaps too strong for me he was wild over her momentary hesitation i would not stop to question if you were sick he said she put her arm about him at once and guided him into the house entered into its refuge a little reassurance as of a sanctuary gained seemed to brace him he moved of his own accord and towards the stairs making for the upper rooms she never released him until he was lying back on his own pillows then he seized her hands and kissed them as she knelt beside him dear wife he said in great emotion i think perhaps the sun and the excitement of listening there i shall be well in a little only rest utter rest i can see no one no one yolande it would be very bad for me it she soothed him why needst thou most sweet with me to stand between if visitor there be sleep here in confidence thou shalt not be disturbed a servants voice at the door announced that a stranger craved a word with madame madame answered that she would be down in a minute the invalid uttered a little tremulous cry no no at once in a second he urged in extremest agitation think if he were to anticipate you by mounting to this room my god i have known him do it him she exclaimed astonished whom i have known people do it he responded in tremulous irritation ill mannered people why do you delay do you want to drive me mad if he comes in here i will not answer for myself seeing him so wrought up she felt it the wise policy to obey with a last word or two of assurance she went quickly from the room and down the stairs the old corridors the old house the old chinks piping in the draughts which swayed the old tapestries the old dust which seemed to crawl upon the floors as if the swarming of their slow decay were for ever being disturbed by ghostly footfalls in all this dark old habitation with its stony echoes had never before seemed to her so instinct with the spirit of a watchful secrecy wickedness hung somewhere brooding in its vaulted silences the air was thick with omen she had to pause a moment to recover herself before opening the door of the room into which the visitor had been shown but at last she turned the handle and entered and there was dr bonito facing her chapter ii she had seen something of this man before had heard to loathe more of him than she had seen he was not one to be forgotten once encountered least of all by gentle souls only her memory of him could not somehow reconcile his past and present habits a threadbare pedant dull eyed and malefic a godless truckler to the vicious prostituting his learning for a dogs wages abject while starving that was how knowledge and report had painted him to her here indeed was the frame but how reinvested snuff as of old seamed the wrinkles of the jaw but now that wagged upon a lace cravat the hands were as skeleton and unclean but rings sparkled on their frowsy knuckles the brown mouldy duds had given place to a gold laced coat and breeches of black velvet there was something evilly potential something suggestive of chartered mischievousness in the change she thought so instinctively do we estimate all human authority by the quality of its cloth she curtsied and stood up frigidly to await his explanation this sinister vision did nothing to allay the tumult of emotions which had accompanied her from the bedroom her heart was foreboding she knew not what the chill of her manner hid a nameless fear she could not analyse its nature nor trace it to its source in herself she did not know how during all these months it had really existed in her as a germ which had shrunk from its own quickening to some unspeakable disclosure whispers perhaps half heard and put away shadows in conscience troubled eyes cast down on half betrayals of their secrets to the faint record of such faint percussions on her soul maybe was due that vague sense of uneasiness and here all in a moment the seed in her was stirring swelling touched into life by what and to what monstrous birth was this ominous presence accountable for the change this dark spirit associated solely in her mind with a dead and gone abomination what spectre could he be risen from that grave to curse her later peace what power in his hand to have struck her love with terror through that far recognition for to that recognition she could not doubt was due her husbands state he did not keep her long in suspense the old dreary wolf in him was quick to sharp conclusions his tooth was his special pleader and he showed it at the outset without a thought of compromise he just essayed to make a responsive leg to her but even in the clumsy act grinned in derision of his own mockery and flung his hands behind his back humping his shoulders bullyingly you know me he snapped i have seen you monsieur she answered i was physician he said loudly to your late husband that is something to you you owe me your present one that is more to you she held on to herself bravely a little longer you asked to see me monsieur she said quietly i desire you will state your business you or your husband he answered it is all one to me thank my gallantry alone for this precedence if you scorn it send for him she trembled in spite of herself did he see me coming he continued i have reason to think so he is shy of greeting me no doubt though to be sure we are quite old friends and confidants it is not possible that you are his confederate he saw her poor helpless quarry look towards the door and he laughed out yes summon assistance if you want the truth blazoned many or one it will not change my purpose then in her fear she became the serpent her eyes glittered her lips parted in a conciliatory smile ah monsieur she pleaded you rebuke me rightly for my cavalier reception of a guest but there are memories associations cannot you understand it that one would fain forget yet if you were my husbands friend and yours and yours mistress he broke in violently dont overlook that you owe one another to me why should i conceal it if i had not blown into flame a little spirit of jealousy in the bosom of a certain chre amie of but you know his name our admirable dear prefect down yonder she stopped him flushing intolerably spare me that mention at least monsieur it is my humiliation ever to have been associated even indirectly with that infamous man he sniggered hatefully why it is true by all reports he croaked that he has not taken salvation of his disappointment knowing him of old as i do that miracle if it had happened had converted even me i think monsieur she entreated half weeping i beg you she checked herself disciplined her anguish anew held out fawning hands to him if you want thanks recognition of that service o monsieur i am prepared to give them to make it to the utmost of your desire are you he said we shall see perhaps your gratitude may take something less than full account of my claims on it we shall see for there is a deadlier claim yet to come her tears her innocence her beauty moved him no more than a poor calfs sobbings might move a butcher baiting made meat tender in the opinion of his day she drew back a little a deadlier claim she said faintly he looked about him a moment then approached her closely his evil eyes his acrid tongue took instant command of her di rocco was murdered he said she uttered a weak cry caught at a chair to steady herself stood with closed eyes and her head fallen back a little murdered he repeated only i and one other know by whom what other she did not speak it but the horror of the question took shape on her lips your husband he said she never stirred nor cried out in the crash of that agony her first instinct was not to betray her love he let the thrust sink home watching with some diabolical curiosity the settling of the flesh as it were about that cruel wound suddenly she moved and came erect hating him his inhumanity base and wicked you say it to torture me because to torture is the lust of devils i will not listen to you i will not even understand what you imply go before i have you scourged out of my house he never moved an inch your house he sneered well bought at the price only you left me out of your calculations you and your confederate she came at him then this piety with set teeth and clinched hands she was like a tigress in that instant but he waved his arm disdainfully and she stopped are you not he said then the others my sole quarry ill make my terms with him no no the cry broke from her instinctively and having uttered it she knew her own surrender pale and broken poor lily she drooped before him very well he said then with you i care nothing for the deed the terms are my concern ill not be diffident about them ill justify them on your invitation to the utmost of my desire your husband mistress killed di rocco o my god why he had his provocation the man meant lewdly and he knew it knew of his intent its method and occasion ask him if you doubt me ask him what he was doing that night crouched hidden by the glacier where the other was to cross ask him why he followed in di roccos tracks down upon the ice and further ask him why he returned alone later and slunk home in the storm and darkness the brand of that on his forehead which hell never rub out to the end of time o believe me i have a hundred eyes for things that touch my interests this did and closely he murdered di rocco ask him i say if you doubt me her ashy lips moved but no sound came from them or ask him nothing the beast went on he did it for you and maybe youll think you owe him that silence let him live on in his fools paradise taking beatitude of grace winning his redemption as he views it ill not interfere to damn him so you gild my tongue from speaking he did not do it ask him what do you want of me money do you understand money why as it is ive arrears to make up youd have seen me before if circumstances hadnt interfered if i give you what you want will you will you take it in discharge of of this fantastic of this debt you say i owe you now and for ever he leered derisory crooking his jaw to rub it back and forth with deliberate fingers on which a dozen gems sparkled will i this fantastic debt he said do you think there is any end to that while he lives no no mistress i commute no pension paid to my silence why ill be frank with you im no common blackmailer for a personal gain my vileness as you deem it aims at a worlds redemption this augean stable filth of rotten governments theres no way to cleanse it but by flood pour socialism through the stench but funds are needed to divert a river you shall contribute be great by deputy ill not be hard ill spare you what i can so youll be amenable when i cant youll come again why i understand you better risk all you think than face that prospect no need to send when i ask what i ask and forestall my visitations moneys what i want not lives ill not kill my goose with the golden eggs unless im driven you can keep me away tell me now how much you want she said like one half lifeless it was dusk when lamp in hand she stole up the stairs to their bedroom he was lying asleep sunk in the reaction from emotion but the light on his face awoke him he opened his eyes drowsily without speculation at first but in a moment wide apprehension sprung to them he half started up yolande hush she said it was nothing somebody who had come on business and is gone think no more about it husband dear husband have you prayed to night he whispered a negative she threw her arms about his neck o louis we have been happy during this year have we not he returned her caresses but his hands were damp his throat was stiff he could not answer she released him feverishly get up and pray now she said we have forgotten god in our deep content forgotten in our bodies loves the blows and anguish which his flesh suffered to redeem them he rose unquestioning and knelt by the bedside he prayed that she might not know that his suspicions might be unfounded that the burden of that knowledge might never be hers not that he might find strength to ask her if it were he prayed and prayed until the chillness of the night air seized his frail body with a very ague of shivering then she kneeling beside him was smitten with remorse and blamed her thoughtlessness and got him into bed again with all speed and watched beside him till he was once more warm and restful then his comfort was so great her beauty so pitiful he held out rapturous arms to her and wooed her to his heart shrinking reluctant she surrendered passively had he not wounded his soul to save hers how could she deny him the fruits of that wild sacrifice she was a murderers wife there was even a thrill of ecstasy in the delirium of that thought a spark of new life struck out of a dead delusion he could answer to a provocation after all for her but later when he had fallen into a deep sleep she rose softly from beside him and crept to her oratory and kneeling on the icy stones before the statue of the holy virgin broke into prayer and a passion of tears o mother show me how to love and yet be clean chapter iii on a flat open width of the argentire road a mile or so to the north east of le prieur a little company of astronomers was gathered to gaze at the moon they carried glasses and instruments there was not the least air of privacy about their proceedings the spot selected was open to all there was an extension in the long tear of the valley in this place the increased interval between the mountains being occupied by a humpish land strewn with boulders about eight oclock of a september evening this group of enthusiasts drinking in lunar obfuscation its telescopes like so many glasses brimming with moonshine tilted to its eyes was joined by a single individual whose approach from le prieur it seemed had occurred unnoticed by it in its preoccupation nor did his arrival affect it now further than to its tacit acceptance of his company as of that of a recognised kindred spirit the newcomer taking a short tube from his pocket applied the smaller lens to his eye and joined in the general scrutiny of that placid orb which floated over the mountain tops in a liquid mist gradually and scarce perceptibly as he gazed the others edged about him until all were within a common focus of hearing then one who appeared to have some precedence of authority opened his lips but without removing his instrument from his eye the oracle great spartacus hath it worked it is working ajax and paris shall be deposed in time in time we move swifter to that end swifter swifter but while we gather speed he strikes like the lightning defy him art thou not ajax ajax defied the gods he had a quicker way with mortals what words what example are these from a regent is not the dagger alien to our policy hast qualified in the tables of our law to no better end than this forgive me spartacus i spoke in heat but this man he harasses us drives us from point to point forestalls our meetings with his devils wit and rides the country like a scourge a faithful prefect an alva sunk in vice he shall be deposed i say it cassandra hath prophesied it priam inclines our way well find a substitute anon more to our tastes in the meanwhile the sinews the sinews ajax they gather in strength they with the word he was gone had dropped slunk like a shadow behind a roadside boulder the others inured to all quick evasions and surprises stood like voiceless statues conning the moon the next moment a little company of horsemen the hoofs of their beasts muffled came picking their way out upon them from the black glooms of the stone strewn hillocks they drew up in the road their leader foremost a fine moon raking night gentlemen he said by my faith a very constellation of enthusiasts what is that you m lotade and armed with nothing more defensive than a telescope why my friend you can hardly realise the danger of these valleys ill see you home with your permission laughing urging persuading deaf to their explanations and protests he got them apart and invited each to take the road to his separate destination while he made m lotade his own especial care in a minute or two the place was deserted only bonito crouched undiscovered behind his rock too good a servant to your master he muttered but the rod is already in pickle for you mr trix chapter iv that rod nevertheless was not to come out of pickle for some six years yet and in the meanwhile cartouche remained prefect of faissigny for one thing kings favourites are not easily deposed for another the light seat in the saddle is the sure one cartouche rode his duties springily and appeared to take them with only a shade more seriousness than he took himself during all this time he ruled his province with agile nervous young hands asking no favour and giving none an easy subject for defamation the malignity of his enemies missed no opportunity of distorting in the public view the most harmless motives of his actions he might he thought have cared under impossibly different circumstances it mattered nothing to him now he admired his own character too little was too little impressed with the disinterestedness of most others to resent aspersions on it it would give a certain lady great satisfaction he was sure to have her opinion of him so confirmed that was the only way left to him to prove his regard for her truly life for the future was to be an upside down affair a test of wit not principles he had no principles he told himself but only a commission to administer the law in the first place to root out disaffection in the second he had a whimsical idea of confounding equity with justice and making an elegant sancho panza of himself as to the other task that of combating the spirit of an age bent on immense social displacements on the reconstitution of states on the launching of democracys huge engine down the ringing grooves of change he accepted it as airily as if it were one involving just a disputed question of etiquette it suggested a gallant picture that of this slim rake with death at his heart all the time facing the rising tide of revolution with not so much as a mrs partingtons mop in his hand but only a ribbon of steel there and a song of gay contempt on his lips he had little doubt but that the red waters were destined to submerge all savoy in the end and beat their crests against the alps well though he were but a coloured pebble in their path he would delay them by that microscopic measure he owed it as much to his own constitution as to the states in the meanwhile slander nursed by deep policy convicted him of the seven deadly sins and more advoutry barratry crapulence debauchery one might run down the alphabet of infamies and leave the tale incomplete there is no need to it would be unedifying and as a fable unnecessary alas that as such it could even be held plausible in the district but experience in savoy put no limit to the infinite rascalities of prefects appointed to represent a despotic government as tyrannys proxies district autocrats they were potential as roman tetrarchs for good or evil they might honour their offices and sometimes did but more often they abused them the enforcement of conscription of the imposts of the many heart crushing taxes was all in their hands they controlled the gendarmerie and could substitute a military for a civil jurisdiction on slight provocation they could hang fine imprison whip brand bleed and grow rich on extortion if they chose in cartouches time the prefect of faissigny it was to be observed did not grow rich he expended his shameful gains in riotous living said scandal such gangs of chained convicts again it remarked had never yet been encountered on the public roads wending their way to chambry and the state prisons such a healthy moral condition it might have added had never yet obtained in the province the majority nevertheless thought him a strong prefect if privately a bad man the evidences for the former were unquestionable and rather admirable for the latter not even circumstantial but they were admitted it is the human way to require convincing proof of a mans virtues but to accept his wickedness on hearsay there was a vile story of the colonel kirke order which related of a fathers life sold to a child at the price of her honour and the contract repudiated after receipt the facts lay in the unconditional offer of herself to the young autocrat by a bold eyed jade who had been smitten in court by the beaux yeux of her parents judge and of his answering by impounding her for a time while he despatched the old miscreant to his deserved ending on the gallows the truth is that this fable with others as odious was no more than a political expedient for procuring the prefects downfall and removal mr trix had proved himself an annoyingly sharp thorn in the side of illuminatism and that body was for ever wriggling and twisting to get rid of him it was as a matter of fact in a particularly sensitive state during the first years of the young mans ascendency owing to an unhappy determination on the part of the elector of bavaria to put his heel on its head which lay in his dominions the result being that that same head weishaupt by name general and brain of the society had flicked itself away none exactly knew whither leaving to the corporate rest of it the solution of the problem as to how a body was to continue to answer as a compact international entity to an unlocalisable brain that bitter stroke was indeed the beginning of the finish with illuminatism the society survived for some years longer but more as a local than a universal power it retained for a time a certain mystic influence on events until in the end that influence with many another as inherently socialistic was absorbed into the elemental energy of the revolution a significant revelation on the seizure of its papers in was its rle of names they included princes nobles magistrates bishops priests and professors men of a condition weighty enough to carry them and their occult propaganda into the very heart of society to bring their suggestions to bear even upon some heads that wore crowns there was one of those pretty vain and silly which did not fail you may be sure to make itself a subject for their practices it had looked out of the windows of piedmont on the tide rising down there in savoy and with all the first tentative assurance and none of the after humility of canute had commanded the waters peevishly to retire they had not on the contrary they had come determinedly on until they threatened to find a way through the passes into piedmont the king was disgustedly amazed he heard of peasants refusing to pay their lawful taxes he heard of bread riots he heard of a dissemination of pernicious doctrines such as those which spoke of commonwealths and the right of the many to exist other than by sufferance of the few was this the way to realise his ideal of a piping arcadia what were his provincial viceroys doing so to let corruption over run his duchy innuendo whispered to him of one of them at least his prefect of faissigny it murmured into his ear was as responsible as any for the subversive creed that justice to be effective must be impartial that gave him thought he had made rather a pet of this man although it was true his plans for his aggrandisement had fallen something short of their intention was he this cartouche making his disappointment the text for a popular dissertation on the fallibility of kings he began to wonder if he had misplaced his confidence and the gay prefect himself the bright siderite of all this conspiracy something conscious of the forces at work against him indifferent to results and for himself he continued to administer his office in the way most characteristic of him he had no ideals nor delusions equality to him in a world nine tenths asses was a vicious chimera he was a magistrate of the crown and he simply sought to make that respectable in the popular view the rights of man in his were solely to be governed justly roguery in whatever form must be suppressed no man should be privileged to tyrannise he gave practical effect to the loose tenets of reformers who obsessed with a personal vanity could see nothing in them thus presented but a hide bound reactionism many people it is certain think less of their own ideals than of the credit they may gain in pursuing them they are quite blind to them when achieved by others mr trixs prefecture in le prieur was a very court of barataria it was flanked by a lofty stone tower known as the belfry which had once formed part of a long vanished monastery of benedictines and was now used as a lock up for those condemned to walk the long road to chambry the committed to it seldom had reason to question the justice of their convictions or to complain of consideration of extenuating circumstances having been withheld cartouche proclaimed a libertine and martinet had nevertheless a happy wit for justice he could tell a rascal under a silk frock so much for his public life what surcease of private pain he sought in its incessant action in that airy yet vigorous administration of his office might not appear he was always reckless for himself for his reputation he walked like one gaily damned conscious of his own bond to the devil what did it matter what she thought of him now what did anything matter in a world where man was held responsible for the resolving of irresolvable ethical problems he supposed and rightly that she felt his mere presence in her neighbourhood to be an insult to herself what if she were to be told the truth it could never cleanse her of an indelible stain it could never restore her to him for what she had been sometimes he told himself now that he hated her that the proof of it was in his indifference to such reports of himself as might reach her ears was that a proof he took pleasure on her behoof in refraining from forcing his slanderers to disgorge their lies did not she want him wicked every nail knocked into his character was a fresh vindication to her of her self sacrificial love for another and there was a worse true story of him after all than any his enemies could invent it was part of the irresolvable problem but he believed she would answer it if she knew with a more utter condemnation of him than any he had yet suffered at her hands that he had cast the girl away because her disobedience to him had wrought an irremediable wrong to another herself would that appeal to her even if in the hot blaze of the truth for righteousness she would answer he knew that he himself was the one solely responsible for the situation which his double dealing with the woman most entitled to his candour had created what justification had she herself ever given him for submitting her to the chance assaults of jealousy if he had been honest with the wretched child this climax had never reached its period and instead he had made her the scapegoat of his own deceit he had and yet if he had not if he had confessed the passion of his soul to her the victim of the passion of his body how would that have bettered things for the victim would she made vestal to that altar of his idol have thought herself well compensated for her jilting he mocked now at the absurdity of his old conception cartouches was it or some sick neurotic monks high priest he what a figure of elegance in urim and thummim and with a thing like a flower pot on his head he laughed tears of blood recalling the ecstatic vision better to be accursed than ridiculous better louis marie should have her than she be made the sport of such a mummery he did not blame his friend week kneed robber as he was he rather admired him for his unexpected part would not he himself have dared all hell to win the passion of those lips o god the passion would he not had he not he had at least bargained with the devil for her and had prevailed just so far as that it was made his privilege at last to serve for deep contrastive shadow to that idyll of their loves for shadow and for shadow within shadow for all this time he knew he was a haunted man that spirit of lost love betrayed poor molly the blackest gloom in him was due to it not the way he thought defiantly to light him back to love he wearied of its eternal presence yet he could not shake it off it leaned out to him from the dusk of mountain passes it flitted before him through the sorrow of infinite woods it cried to him for help from the hearts of squalid tenements where villainous deeds were enacting he had done that thing it was past remedy not past clinching his damnation why not then rest on that assurance and cease to agitate both herself and him yet step warily as he might he could never escape her that desolate phantom crossing beds of gentian he would tread upon her eyes the little freshets which he spurned from their wreathings about his feet were her white arms the low wind in the pines became her low english voice always faithful weeping appealing never rebuking god was not this insatiable hunger in him enough anguish without the eternal memory of that fruit which he had plucked in his wanton appetite and thrown away just tasted for the shadow of a sweeter not enough not enough then to her hands be it after death to heap the coals upon his breast he owned their right would submit to them and face the eternal ordeal only let them refrain now was he so prosperous so happy as to invite their vengeance prematurely torture too exquisite it was said became a transport did they want to qualify him for that balm in hell he execrated the shadow in his thoughts its endless voiceless weeping he told it that he hated it let it take solace of his hate as he of anothers he meant it yolande hated him and that she did was a wrung rapture to him at this last by so much he had a place in her passions where any other was impossible he would never imperil it by controverting his slanderers let her think of him as wickedness incarnate if only she would think of him thus was the last state of this loves agony while he laughed bleeding inwardly and met his traducers on a hundred points of wit he had thought now and then in his prostrate moments that if he could only once trace home the shadow he might find it to be after all no better than a black mailing ghost supposing good fortune had attended her dismissal it might and he have saddled his conscience with a self invoked incubus why not set himself to discover he dared not that was the truth he was a coward there he feared the answer better even the shadow than the revelations possible of the thing that cast it he dared not for this reason and others he avoided turin in these days he was in the city only at rare intervals of time when officialdom compelled him once or twice on these occasions he happened across the chevalier de france heard him rail to others of the ingratitude of children the man had never forgiven his daughter her msalliance but nevertheless in repudiating her in refusing to visit her he was only had the truth been known making a virtue of necessity madames self emancipation had taken strict account of his share in the events which had made it peremptory he had to answer for it to a daughter strangely converted to new conceptions of duty strangely altered in many ways she made him a princely allowance which he spent en prince she would accept him at di rocco only on her own terms and to those he refused to subscribe he would not submit to the part of a mere honoured dependant on her bounty franked by her husbands grace she denied him any closer rights therefore he kept away it was best for both of them and maintained his individual state in the via della zecca sneering to intimates of the niggardliness which any promotion to affluence was sure to find out in women posing as an injured father enjoying his independence arrogantly in his dull selfish way cartouche longed to insult him could indeed have found plentiful opportunity to do so had not the fact of his being her father withheld him the chevalier on the few occasions when they met always scowled at him askance as if to imply how he knew very well that to this bastard this faux enfant this royal favourite disappointed of his daughter was to be attributed his own disfavour with the king but he was let live for the sake of her whom he traduced and so the gay prefect with that death always at his heart and the tongue in his mouth a sword to wound stood up against the rising tide fearless before its roar and babble he was well served by his police admiring thralls to his courage his quick wit his retentive memory in these days there was not much of secret information touching the moral health of his province which did not reach his ears thus he early learned of bonitos visit to the chteau and to draw some odd conclusions from its sequel their fruit will appear in the course of things in the meanwhile it was observed by him that some curious retrenchments reported up at the great house dated from that visit and were seemingly coincident with a look as it were also of retrenchment in madame saint prays beautiful face it had to happen occasionally that he encountered the lady of the manor in the exercise of his duties and inasmuch as she always disdained at such times to acknowledge or even to see him he had ample opportunity for studying her expression that was beginning to shape itself he could not but think on the lines of some gripping inward reserve it were too much to say that it betrayed any confirmation of the chevaliers coward accusation but certainly it looked pinched and drawn as if the sweet sap in it were somehow souring from its freshness he wondered he wondered still when whispers reached him how maire and priests confident almoners of her bounty were softly complaining of an inexplicable parsimony in a hand once lavish to munificence in charity his wonder increased to hear the charge substantiated by her husband he had never avoided louis marie nor had ever put himself in his way he had held his deed justified and had told him so for the rest he was no precisian in matters of conscience and if saint pray could reconcile his marriage with his as by his growing air of resignation not to say of self complacency he appeared to be able to do he had no mind to deny him his lovely provocation he had never referred to the subject on their meetings which were rare because louis was a dutiful husband but once to his surprise his friend opened upon it voluntarily they had chanced upon one another on the road when each was unattended something of an ancient warmth spoke in louiss greeting gaston he said we see so little of one another now is it because you blame me si on est bien quon sy tienne said the other chauntingly why allude to it because i cannot bear to think i have lost your respect gaston i must always hold that of more worth than than some others do cartouche smiled you are looking very well under the infliction louis that is the moral of your loss the young man broke out eagerly she was losing her faith in god only i could restore it i have always so longed to tell you you know it was not the money the first condition of our union was that it should be given all away that curse turned to a blessing i have never touched a penny of it have never claimed the right to only as her almoner and now o if that dead mans hand should still be on it buying her soul to his in vengeance what do you mean i think i must always have someone to hold to gaston you were so strong i dont know what i mean only now when i ask her for my own charities often gaston she says she has none to spare no money she she is a better business man than you thats all it doesnt surprise me perhaps god bless you gaston certainly if he will but i havent many dealings with him bonne chance old friend cartouche set his private agents to work but the information he sought was long in coming to him and in the meanwhile the tide rose up and up under an ever more lowering sky and the snarl of coming tempest shook the black waters but slow as the years drawled on for those up at the chteau to cartouche they racketed past like a dance of death chapter v at the lower end of the via del po where it debouched upon the river stood nicked out of the north side of the street a little square of houses known as the court of doctors the buildings in this square for the most part unoccupied were very high very narrow very crazy and so few in number that no more than two or three of them counted to any one of its three sides the fourth lying open to the stream of fashionable traffic which flowed by it all day quidnuncs had always been a power in turin whence this one time appropriation of a niche to their worship the court of doctors in its present aspect was said to date from the regency of madame reale daughter to the fourth henry of france and wife to the first victor amadeus of savoy to whose politic superstition it had been indebted for a sort of unofficial charter for what destinies foreshadowed for what poisons brewed for what villainies set bubbling in crucible and alembic within its precincts its past history was responsible only its own dark heart might know to this day the atmosphere of that sunless well of brick seemed brassy with chemicals its doorways emitted a faint stale scent of drugs an air of stagnant mystery overhung its pavements but it was mystery grown unnegotiable the moon of its prosperity had set black decay hung brooding on its roofs the ministers to its former notoriety were flown not that empirics were fewer than of yore in turin nor less potent in their persuasions but traps for credulity like traps for mice miss of their efficacy after a few score or a few hundred captures and the bait must be laid down in some other place and form there was one building in the square however which of late years had been infinitely successful in reclaiming to itself a full measure of its own past fame or infamy this house stood on the north east side one of three compact whose rears were to the river from whose swift waters only a rotting wharf sinking in sludge and slime divided them in front panels of starry devices suns and golden orbs reeling in strange elliptics on an azure field betokened the particular business of the houses master while they gave the building itself a meretricious distinction over its frowsy neighbours this was in fact the mystic abode of spartacus the famous seer to whose sances all turin was thrall in these days and of his lovely sibyl cassandra they did a roaring business between them there if any such term may be applied to methods quite cavernous in their secrecy thus anyone seeking converse with the soothsayer must commit his destinies to darkness from the outset he approached the black egyptian door and after a pause to rally his sinking heart knocked thereon no sound of footstep answered him from within but all in a moment the door itself gaped an inky mouth engulfed him and closed again noiseless on his entombment he strained his eyes through pitch in vain not one tiniest theft from darkness could they compass suddenly a label sprang to light on a wall ascend he saw a stairfoot stumbled upwards between bat wing hangings the light shut behind him at the turn of the stair another glowed out suddenly ascend directed him on and vanished a third time this occurred committing him to a short passage along which he slunk until lo greeting flashed out an instant before his eyes was as instantly extinguished and halted with strained breath and prickling skin in a close vault of night he realised that he had gained to the inner arcanum the unholy of unholies that was a lofty attic room panelled all round its walls to confess its properties with tall mirrors hidden behind black curtains but those were so controlled that all or any one of them answering to a noiseless drop and pulley worked from without could be made to gather softly away revealing unrecognised by the fearful visitor the lustreless glass behind one curtain however concealed a mid wall alcove a cimmerian cavity in which stood a tripod of cunning construction for under its chafing dish burned perpetually a concealed lamp which kept the metal above it at a heat sufficient at need to ignite spirit cast upon it or even gums and aromatic resins the effect being as of a very immaculate conception of fire but the dim blue flame thus evoked was of a luminosity just enough to reveal to the terrified observer the pale shadows of misbegotten horrors about him his own reflection if he had but known it in such uncurtained mirrors as were not exposed to the direct rays of the burning naptha but so it seemed to him a film had been withdrawn in the silent rising of the draperies from his own mental vision crystal globes there were moreover strings of phosphorescent balls which could be made to travel hither and thither on invisible wires webs of luminous thread entanglements of all sorts at command the wizard himself like a livid spider poised in their midst but even so great spartacus despite his skill and compelling magic it is doubtful if with all the abode of mystery had won for itself any exceptional notoriety had it not been for its loveliest mystery of all that hebe who called herself cassandra and dropped flowers of prophecy from sweet lips offering it might be asps in roses she it was that like a caged nymph butterfly brought the males to beat their wings upon her crystal prison scattering about it an incense of golden meal one dark evening in the spring of two gentlemen coming rapidly down the via del po turned into the court of doctors and stopped before the wizards door they wore masks and dominoes they were both small men one lean and the other plump the plump man was by many years the junior of the lean one he was also by several social degrees his inferior being no more indeed than our friend caius sempronius gracchus alias the vicomte di mirobole house steward to his majesty while the other was his majesty himself no less is this the place then muttered victor amadeus drawing a step back he looked pinched and harried like some little petit matre of a frankenstein pursued by a monster of his own creating my heart beats mirobole he said i think i fear the test m mirobole clasped his fat hands and opened remonstrant eyes ah sire he said condescend to deem one truth better than a multitude of conjectures these hundred shadows on your heart what if he show you how one tree may cast them all branches of a single hate which if severed at its root the sunshine shall be yours again without a fleck you have certainly a reassuring confidence in your magician viscount said the king with a smile then he sighed well i have only to reveal myself if he presumes too far lead on my friend m mirobole knocked instantly and softly on the tomb like door it answered with a startling unaccustomed promptitude to his summons but his majesty never having visited here before was without suspicion of any collusion implied in that show of eagerness to secure him forcing himself to resolution and treading on the heels of his companion he stepped within the black jaws which snapped immediately on their prey almost simultaneously the tablet on the wall shone out craving his royal charges close attendance the viscount led the way upstairs he was familiar with the mysteries of the place though to be sure there was no mystery in it all to be compared with that of his own blind faith in the charlatan its master presently the two were committed scarce breathing to the dark operating room i do not like it whispered the king suddenly there was certainly nothing very likeable in that profound gloom it was so dense so gross as to appear palpable to him sooty cobwebs seemed to stroke his face he swept his hand over it disgustedly understand he muttered in angry agitation that you are my mouthpiece that i will not be betrayed that ah he gave a little jerk and shriek something touched me on the instant light glowed out in the room or rather diluted darkness than light and in the same moment an apparition showed itself bonito in black skull cap and black skin tights his unearthly face and long white hands showing in the gloom like detached members made a sufficiently ghastly spectacle even the little vicomte accustomed initiate could never surmount a certain terror of him under such circumstances and the present ones found him exceptionally nervous hail spartacus he whispered his voice fluttering like a leaf thou seest before thee a petitioner for what the soothsayers face seemed to hang a livid intent blot in the darkness its lips alone alive for the truth canst thou not then conceive it save out of magic the truth walks in the sun nay but if the suns eclipsed we come to thee to light a candle to the truth obscured we sayst thou i speak for him beside me here what is his name why were not to withhold it to honour best your skill shall spartacus show no better than the egyptians guile fitting his prescience to his subject once identified name him quotha what need wiser is spartacus yet not so wise it seems as m mirobole the king started violently knowest thou me too magician he muttered ay monarch answered the pale lips and thy purpose in seeking me sancta maria tell me then what is that for light on an ancient prophecy it is true god in heaven what prophecy it occurs in the almanac for by duret de montbrison wherein it is stated that in the year the monarchy of sardinia shall suffer an eclipse the king was trembling violently he regarded the soothsayer by now with a fearful reverence tell me magician he said the courses of the heavens are i know inexorable yet may not the results of their forecastings where directed upon perishable things be nullified if those objects be withdrawn the shadow of its ages ceases from the felled tree may it not be so it may be king fatality creeps on me the land is thick with threatening voices i am like one in the dark hearing whispers all about me not knowing where to strike and where to withhold if i could but tell the shadow where it lies and uproot the tree whence threatens this eclipse show me the place if thou lovest rich reward the wizard looking upward raised both his white hands there floated into the dark above him luminous twin spheres attached like a two fold bubble seest thou those he said the one is piedmont the other is savoy so are the hemispheres of the human brain of which one is dedicate to the fiend and one to god between them is that eternal strife for precedence which we call mans dual personality but in the encroachments of either upon either who is to distinguish between the sources of good and evil this tree may stand in piedmont or savoy answer for which cassandra with the word she was there before them the curtain over the alcove had silently risen and revealed her the flame in the tripod going up like a blue draught shot her tawny drapery with streaks of emerald a broad cincture heavy with large green stones was looped about her hips her bare arms and bosom rounded into soft violet shadows amid the chestnut loopings of her hair a coil of little jewelled serpents shone entangled she was lovely in her face life blooming out of death her lips incarnadined with lust of sorrow large eyes of tragic blue the king looked on her fascinated priestess said the wizard in a hollow voice answer if of thine inspiration thou mayest whence threatens the shadow of this kingdoms foretold eclipse as he spoke there came out of the darkness a string of little stars of softest radiance and many colours which took noiseless flight about the sibyls head and circled there in wondrous convolutions faster and faster until they seemed to whirl like lashing snakes then in a moment one of a red tint poised itself above her brow and the rest fled away and were extinguished his majesty flaccid with awe was by now in a condition to believe anything and the priestess answered in that old soft english voice poor mollys broken frenchings had by now mended themselves wonderfully but no call to shriller accents could spoil the quality of the throat which uttered them i see a figure down in faissigny she cried the figure of a man it standeth in the sun like other men and like other men doth cast its shadow but lo the shadow of this man swells outward from his feet onward and ever onward until it engulfs the whole province laying it under tribute to his darkness the prefect muttered the king he saw his confirmation here of some black suspicions ask her he said trembling to the wizard is the figure that of mine own prefect of faissigny thou hearest cassandra said bonito ay she answered it is the man the king uttered an ejaculation and lifted deploring hands what motive in this monstrous thing the motive said the sibyl of resentment for a reward once promised and withheld the motive of mans ambition which is ruthless the motive of one whose nature it is to betray all trusts confided in him she really believed poor girl on the misrepresentations of her employer that cartouche was conspiring to overthrow his the king smote his thigh he shall die he cried bonito saw though he did not how cassandra started at the word nay he said hurriedly the fates are not to be propitiated with blood uproot the tree not fell it but the shadow magician said the king peevishly how it hath spread already sowing the ground with insurrection that crop would but grow lusty with his blood nay i know not but that only to uproot him might not precipitate the eclipse my god you falsify the parable the parable was thine own king what am i to do he was jerking and mowing in a fever of petulance the wizard turned to his priestess shall nothing then arrest this darkness stunt its growth and nullify the prophecy one thing one man alone she answered impassive indeed she was only repeating a lesson what thing he said to plant another instant in his place while yet the ground gapes wide from his uprooting what other she held her hands palm downwards over the chafing dish instantly a lurid smoke rose from it and in the midst appeared upright letters of fire which spelt the name lotade she raised her hands and the letters sunk and disappeared in one piece the king muttered the name evidently at a loss but the pythoness with tranced eyes fixed upon some imaginary figure before her pointed her shoulder level with her chin and spoke its qualifications i read a healing sweetness there as of a pine tree taken from some harsh plantation and put to root within its native soil the man is of that province strong and honoured no stranger from beyond its bourne like him that hath planted its pastures with dark hate and shadow looking to reap the storm o name in thy bright influence i see the clouds dispersing the darkness leave the land the eclipse become no more pass on in silence the final words seemed as if addressed to some ghostly scene shifter she had vanished in their utterance and the chamber was recommitted to its shadowy glooms shaking with agitation the king turned upon the magician let this lotade this sound health giving tree supplant the other i say it and will see it done i know him not what matter truth shall be vindicated bonito laughed grimly not so easily o king are the powers of darkness despoiled this prefect will not budge at thy command he will not why of what texture think you is this same shadow that spreads from before his feet this shadow of thine eclipse is it not woven of black sedition which ever answers slavishly to him its master obedient to his least gesture hed have a fine dark following did he once turn him to the sun of monarchy and march to overwhelm it why should he budge and yet maybe i could induce him how your words fall on me like a pitchy rain heralding that egyptian darkness before god how id put a spell on him a loathing of his office i care not go thine own ways for me nay good spartacus wise spartacus thou must help me here indeed i care not i say i say strike at him openly if you will and see him bristle through all his hulking shadow like a boar i will not i will have it your way well if you like give me the warrant to dismiss him and appoint this lotade in his place him or another what concern is it to me only i could so take him with mine art hed greet this chance as of a release from bondage construe it into his resignation offered and accepted abandon his following leaving it to die of an atrophy like a body whose brain is withered if you could do this thing and earn my lasting gratitude dispel that darkness and be like moses honoured with burnt offerings ill send thee on the warrant in the meanwhile take this in earnest of my debt to thee he threw a purse upon the floor it struck weightily and turned and left the room with mirobole a minute later the door below had shut upon them bonito with a loud snigger touched a spring in the wall which acted on the curtain of the alcove folding it up and away and striding to the tripod took some hidden powder from beneath it which he cast into the pan a glowing flame shot up immediately lighting the whole place and he called out in ecstasy cassandra ma belle prtresse ma petite she came out from a little room hidden behind the further curtain and stood up motionless between their inky folds we have won he cried boisterously we are partners in this triumph ministers of fate what a triumph mine own nominee elected the other deposed and disgraced savoy is ours we will cross the alps ere long rejoice with me child thine enemy lies low thou art avenged yes i am avenged she answered dully he looked at her shrewdly art thou not satisfied you will not hurt him else bonito why should i he stood in my way he will stand no longer that is enough for me but you will not hurt him hurt him hurt him thou art tenderer of him than of his doxy look how you smile on while i bleed her no pity there and shell have to bleed the more for this we take new life of it no bottom to our need for funds shell have to bleed again i say and make you fresh sport no tenderness there you will not hurt him plague on the parrot why should i hurt him swear it why i will let him go free for me to beggary i swear it there remember that she dropped the curtain and was gone chapter vi he had done this thing for her had stained his hands with blood to keep hers clean had darkened his own soul that her soul might shine the purer for that shadow what was her debt to him for this great self sacrifice how could she pay it and not condone his sin so we pass to yolande and her mortal problem poor child so straight in candour as she was no compromise with facts seemed possible to her nature she must tell him all or nothing and if she told him all revealed her knowledge of his crime made herself its accessory thereby hed answer would he not that leaves me no alternative sweet love for sweet loves sake i must acquit you of this shadow of complicity give myself up and vindicate your spotless fame before the world would he not she told herself he would deafened her ears to her own hearts whispered treason would admit no justification for it in the evidences of a slandered character could one so un self reliant so irresolute so much the whimpering prey to circumstance as circumstance had seemed to paint her louis have braced himself to do that deed the deed was there to answer her to answer triumphantly too that by very reason of itself that saintly soul was convict of a heroism of which its meek patience had once seemed incapable and which in its revelation had found the woman in her secretly exultant over the angel was that so indeed had his fall from grace made him dearer to her than ever his perfection could a dreadful thought for which she paid to herself and god with anguishes of penance but she could not control it nor lay its unrighteous shadow how could she when father to it was the wish that what it implied of manly strength in him would answer to her confession of that dark knowledge were she to make it by an instant surrender to the law she could not tell him then and so what other course no mid way steering for this whole hearted heroine no hints no tell tale sighs no tearful looks askance to haunt him with half truths no lagging partner snivelling unspoken resentment of her burden shed bear it all and bravely the weight the heat and pressure of the day and cheer him smiling on to self redemption that be her mission by ways of healing grace to guide him to that summit he would never attain alone mans responsibility might be to the civil laws but womans was to love for love hed saved her love should save him the rest was for his confessor conceive this poor soul then with her monstrous self imposed burden never to be put down facing the steeps of life if her feet would sometimes falter her eyes grow strained with agony beneath it her heart never admitted by one false beat a sense of disproportion in their loads to fend him from the truth while hiding from him that she knew it to pay his debts to vile extortion and suffer the stigma of a parsimony which appeared to grudge him the means to realise their compact of a boundless charity worse to suspect sometimes that he guessed her knowledge of the truth and was content to build upon her loving hypocrisy his house of later peace was content to let her live the lie while he enjoyed its fruits these things were the hardest of her task another grief she suffered but that she told herself was in heavens withholding of a greater she was thankful for it thankful as a martyr whom great pain has numbed from further feeling thankful that in all these years no child was born to them to bear the heritage of its fathers sin and while she praised heaven for its mercy the starved woman in her hungered for the milk of motherhood and fading on that deprivation made her task of youth a burden yet she must bear that too or pay the penalty to love estranged since only the gifts of motherhood could compensate for youth and beauty bartered against them so she must be young and sweet in spite of ageing conscience must sing about her duties must smile away those shadows in her husbands eyes which she sickened to think were the reflections of her own enforced avarice her waning beauty her barrenness a sordid destiny for this child of lovely purity this yolande of the white hands this lily light of truth and to work out in what unnatural atmosphere transplanted into what lifeless soil she was the mistress of a golgotha an old dark windy necropolis whose massive gates her husbands hands had closed for ever shutting her in to consort with its ghosts in di rocco had perished the last of his name in him the old blotched trunk his houses life slow withering to its roots had sunk for ever the branches long were leafless to her a stranger had befallen the heritage of death she could have administered it have justified heavens severe choice of her as receiver in that estate such ages bankrupt in charity have wrung a sombre joy even from dispersing its evil accumulations had not fate thus imposed upon her this awful seclusion paralysing her hands as antique graveyards are sometimes made the sporting grounds for little feet so had she once pictured to herself the joy of budding life at play in these stony corridors and empty gardens redeeming them from the melancholy of great wrong it was not to be and for the withholding of that lovely mercy she could only give heaven praise give it with weeping eyes in solitude and elsewhere with a bright countenance turned to her husband did he find that inscrutable nevertheless was he so far from sharing her thankfulness for that grace denied as that he could visit upon her in those shades of altered intimacy those reserves in confidence those nuances of alienation which only love can detect his secret disappointment she prayed that it was not so prayed also that in the enforced restraints she must put upon his charities his sweet and reasonable nature would look for no baser motive than necessity she was always frank with him as to the extent of what she could command exclusive of bonitos periodic drains upon her and those of her father a creature scarcely less abominable and held all within those limits at his pleasure rather she should be whispered for parsimony than that his generosity should suffer in its name he was so good so bounteous so utterly improvident for himself though he would not claim one penny that was hers there was no question of his acting as her almoner indeed the money was no more hers than his but in trust to both of them for gods good business she was by heavens grace but the acting paymaster and so long as she might bear the whole burden of that duty she was content that he should enjoy its credit the question was one between her and love alone its very exclusiveness made its bliss yet sometimes in her moods of desolation when for all her prayers and self reassurances that sense of their estrangement would glow a more definite gloom and the problem of her double life smite sickly on her heart a dread doubt would arise in her as to the sureness of her guidance of this afflicted soul the physically blind are apt to become the morally blind intent only on their self interests some people say because of the consideration with which pity hedges them of the licence which it allows them for their infirmity what then if love in pity had so rallied this stricken life as to lead it to regard itself as a persecuted thing a thing privileged through its own helplessness to presume on the self sacrifices of others for its sake louiss apparent obtuseness to the meaning of the atonements her sweet example exacted of him his apparent ignorance of any provocation to them caused by himself filled her when in these moods with amazement had he lost all sense of responsibility to his own deed in her voluntary acceptance of its consequences that were to assume that he guessed her part and could justify it to himself on the score of his own infirmity an obliquity which surely could not be held to vindicate her self sacrifice before heaven yet sometimes the assumption would arise to hurt her cruelly even to sting her to a momentary revolt he could not be really ignorant of her burden must have surmised some coincidence between bonitos visit and the instant restrictions she had been forced to put upon their expenditure his terror of the mans presence on that day his slow and shaken convalescence from the date of it these were evidences of his knowledge hard to be discredited and that in the face of it he could expect of her a pledge of their full confidence could imply a reproach of her for her barrenness o that were an addition to her load beyond her human endurance the mere shadow of its oppression killed her heart drove her in her agony to blow cold upon the little chill which already spoke their differences and then the reaction would come he had done this thing for her and she had accepted the burden of its consequences she had prayed prayed that even as he had saved her out of silence so might she save him and this was her heroism to deprecate his blindness as a wilful vileness then poor child she would call herself a wicked traitor to her lord blame her own foul suspicions and seek by loving demonstrations to atone her wistful guiles to win his favour her rehearsals for his sake of that old forgotten part of tranquil innocence her gratitude for only half thawed acknowledgments were moving things to witness how could she dream her louis guilty of this monstrous meanness the man who had dipped his hand in blood to keep hers white his first terror of that apparition had been real he had afterwards accepted her word for its being an illusion he always trusted others assurances that very weakness it was which made him so lovable so lovable so lovable and she had let her wicked heart condemn him could he have recovered from the shock of that visitation so utterly as he had if he had seen in her the ever present hostage for his immunity from deadlier hauntings her whole protecting knowledge of him was to answer and it answered piercingly remorseful no dear soul it said had ever less power than louis marie for affecting to ignore the influences of a present depression yet louis marie the terror once laid had rallied had even come to recover something of the serenity of his earlier innocence why should he not indeed she thought with heart felt joy it spoke his peace made with god and so justified of her burden was more frenziedly determined than ever to hide her bearing of it from him while she smiled and smiled under its load impersonating out of torture her own untroubled youth alas blind love who yet perhaps deserves scant pity for did he not put out his own eyes now she saw and was rejoiced to see as the months drew into years his soul relax upon an ancient sweet security the spectre of his fear grew less and less his natural goodness mature into the full fruitage of its blossoms promise so peaceful did he grow so seemingly unvexed by apprehensions so confident in his demands upon her charity for others sake she was sometimes moved to wonder if after all she were not being made the victim of a hellish conspiracy if he had really committed the crime with which villainy had charged him but as often she recalled bonitos words ask him if you doubt me and that she dared not do the answer might destroy at a blow the whole structure of his souls redemption which her self obliterating love had patiently built up for him year by year fruitless all her devotion then useless that cementing of its bricks with her own hearts blood he had come to be nearer heaven now than she raised on the altar of her sacrifice she had lied to save him should she risk his soul at the last to save her own divinely steadfast to her purpose she kept her way her sweet eyes shone inspired to it though she were lost by holding to it he should win to harbour what greater love could woman show if god would forgive her for that concede her the mercy to creep into heaven lost in her dear saints shadow for he was her saint again twice beatified through his fault he had been guilty of his one worldly lapse for her had done outrage to his nature that hers might suffer none was not such sin the prerogative of consecration so with an unfading resolution through days of exaltation and depression through drear heart burnings and the agonies of misunderstandings not to be explained through poignant ecstasies and thorns of non fulfilment she strove unfaltering until lo there came a time when all her struggles seemed in vain when bursting from the thicket her bleeding feet stood halted in an instant not before the dear meadows they had hoped but at the base of a monstrous god veiling cliff that year the heavens themselves had seemed to speak the omens of disaster from its opening they had poured down incessantly from sooty reservoirs a torrent like the deluge the season was an abnormally mild one if any such term could be applied to tempests of wind and water overwhelming inexplicable the ice in the mountains cracking and answering under the assault boomed an unceasing cannonade the land slid down in continents trees were tossed in flood water like sprouts boiling in a saucepan and to all this descending hubbub the rising of a human tide seemed to leap sympathetic the waters of unrest were gathering force and volume the dark hour of savoy was drawing near the prefect had hard ado to keep his feet then at last came a period of respite when the powers of darkness seemed to sleep exhausted and the sun came out and the waters sounded peaceably on the hills and spring opened its drowned eyes and preened its draggled plumes one day when all the land was glowing in a noontide rest a servant came to inform madame saint pray that his excellency the prefect of faissigny craved the honour of a word with her alone she opened her eyes in amazement the prefect impossible the man could not have heard aright but the man was not mistaken m le prfet it would appear had foreseen this reluctance on madamas part to grant him that honour inasmuch as he had impressed very earnestly upon the messenger the importance of an occasion which could thus excuse his presumption in calling upon one with whom he was unacquainted madamas cheek flamed as she rose her lips set tightly she looked an inch taller than her wont thank you benot she said i will go down to him chapter vii he bowed to her gravely as she entered she responded with the iciest salutation throughout their interview they both remained standing he noticed with dark ruth how wan her face had grown how sharpened from its blunt youthful curves how prematurely aged even like a late blown lily shrunk in its first lovely opening to a freezing wind the nearer thereby the more pathetic to his own barren passion he could claim his pallid kinship with this sorrow as never he might have done with insolent felicity he was so changed by love he could have prized dead beauty in this woman above all the living graces of her happier sisters had she waned like the moon his arms had lusted for the last shred of her his heart beat thickly for whatever reason he was to have speech with her once more was to reclaim her to some interest in his own so that that might be he cared little how she wounded him you asked to see me monsieur she said frigidly i am here to what importunate circumstance may i ask do i owe this yes this insult monsieur of your visit she had hardly intended to be so explicit but her indignation took her irresistibly and on the instant off her feet cartouche slightly shrugged his shoulders importunate madame he said you shall judge i come as prefect the insult is official his eyes fastened on her feeding gluttonously after their long abstinence saw how she started slightly at his words how she looked at him in sudden fear to whatever offensive motive she had thought to attribute his visit the possibility of its impersonal character had evidently not occurred to her he was become master by that disillusionment and would have been less than human not to have recognised it not to have held her frightened heart fluttering for one moment in his hand it was fierce ecstasy to feel it beat to have it own him lord of itself through terror if only he might reassure it in the end and release it to fly away on wings of poignant gratitude she struggled for the self composure to answer him after his kind i have no right then monsieur to resent it the law exacts its privileges however represented you come i am to understand on business business monsieur demands the fewest words to be effective that is perfectly true madame he said quietly this of mine though its processes have extended over years is summed up in a sentence you are in the habit of sending periodically large sums of money to one who is well known by me to be conspiring against the government she stood as rigid as stone every atom of colour had fled from her face he longed to cry out on its moveless agony o woman on the merit of my hopeless passion believe in me trust in me i am here to save not ruin but he must strike deeper before he could seek to heal this fact madame he said has been made known to me through the ordinary secret channels of my office it is indisputable i do not ask you to dispute it i ask you simply i give you the opportunity of answering privately a single question does m saint pray who is my friend identify himself also with this movement is he in short in your confidence in this matter of your supplying it with funds she tottered towards him holding out frenzied hands o no monsieur o no no he knew it all now he had her at his mercy for one moment this soft cruel thing should yield herself to his will its abject slave he lingered out the rapture as one condemned to death might hang on the lips of his souls love his dark cheek flushed he backed before her approach unresponsive you reassure me madame he said coldly i had been concerned for him i own it is enough that friendship has helped to exculpate where a closer relationship it seems had found its better interest in deceiving for the rest you are doubtless prepared for yourself with a sufficient answer to the law the law she whispered it aghast as its representative madame he said i have no choice but to demand one of you you can refuse to give it referring your defence to a public occasion he would not see how her anguish entreated him in that event i make my bow my apologies and i withdraw the issue then is very simple you will be called to account for your subsidising of a dangerous conspirator against the state and will probably be put on your trial with him as prefect of this province i can guarantee the case at least an impartial hearing my presence madame does not insult the law however offensive it may be to the criminal she hurried nearer to him broke out and down in an instant before god monsieur you must believe me you must i know nothing of this mans use of what he wrings from me i am not his confederate but he interrupted her sharp and sudden but his victim she cried o monsieur monsieur o my god and buried her face in her hands now at that his gluttonous moment passed henceforth his heart was hers to sport with it had only played the tyrant hitherto to nurse to ecstasy its own compunction he spoke in a strangely softened tone he is black mailing you no she cried looking up in quick miserable panic i have not said it he smiled slightly no need to well i suspected as much she seemed to strive to speak but nothing came from her i say he repeated i suspected it do i not know this man of old his craft his villainy how he will go long ways about to reach an end traverse the world to stab an enemy in the back most to be feared when most he feigns benevolence bonito that old dreary misanthrope to play the benthamite why i never doubted but that he had his deep reasons for scheming to marry you to i never doubted it i say madame and heres the proof he was playing for hush money she stared at him as if her very soul were paralysed how he discovered the truth he continued by cunning or coercion he paused questioning her at a venture with his eyes she made no answer and he went on shrugging his shoulders like enough twas he himself who laid the train who first supplied the insidious damning information to my friend and but it matters little he discovered it he questioned her face again still she was silent if i had guessed in time he said in a deep passionate voice this should never have been it shall be no longer madame i have twice before offered you my services and twice been rejected with scorn once again i lay them at your feet it was for this in truth i sought you i entreat you do not refuse me it was not in her nature to do justice to this man so far as his devotion touched her it was to nothing but a sense of humiliation the thought uppermost in her mind was of his cognisance not his chivalry you know she whispered her white lips could hardly frame the words i know he answered he had confessed to me before you married him an irrepressible moan came from her pitiful heart rending he broke upon it passionately i told him what i tell you now that on my soul he had done right but that having done what he had done the prospect of his union with you had become impossible to me though what i am the thought was horrible believe me madame before god believe that i had no thought of myself in so urging him she drew a little away her eyes were already freezing to him but his emotion made him blind i am not to blame for what followed he hurried on the villain that same dog bonito over reached me he took advantage of my absence to practise on one there i will not pain you with the record you know who came to you she had been warned by me against abetting him she nursed in any designs upon your ignorance i do not blame him if you can do me any justice in your womans heart you will guess why he staked his soul against a chance for which i would have sacrificed a thousand heavens but with her it was different she paid for her temerity with my curse he ended greatly agitated his eyes were lowered before her he did not see the new abhorrence of him spring and flame in hers he did not see how the majesty of her womanhood rose to answer and reject him you cursed her for my sake monsieur she said quietly if you will have it so he answered low and this her suborner her confederate you say he shall trouble me no longer not while i have hands to strike and teeth to hold she sprang away from him that i have fallen to this she cried to be asked to approve myself the instrument of that poor creatures ruin to applaud the wicked deed and crown the doer of it with my gratitude would you murder also for my sake smear the feet you profess to worship with a fellow creatures blood o go from me go from me monsieur you are horrible in my sight we take the burden of our sin will atone for it as heaven wills better a hundred cruel witnesses than one advocate like you she thought to save your soul poor child by winning it to justice done to hers one marriage brings another those were her pretty words and so for your requital of her love love o i am fouled in having heard you humbled myself before you go say do what you will monsieur we refuse your help why will you for ever impose your hateful favours on me he listened to her standing quite still and ghastly pale then he bowed slightly and walked to the door turning at it he spoke i have made it my mission in life madame to protect the shrine of my devotion from sacrilegious hands no scorn no misconstruction no wounding hate will deter me from that purpose while i live the idol of it shall owe me at least that debt of fidelity if she hungers for the opportunity to retaliate as debtors will there is the precedent of lazarus in heaven to reassure her i will be sure to call to you for that drop of water madame he opened the door and was gone she stood quite motionless for minutes after he had left her then suddenly flung herself exhausted into a chair no grace no pity towards him was in her heart if they had been possible to its pure narrow code his parting words in which she read a scoff at religion would have alienated them finally for hours she lay in wretched thought half hypnotised by misery no tender sprig of hope could ever again be hers her uttermost fears were confirmed he had confessed his guilt the road stretched dark and endless now before her the house was deadly quiet she was quite alone and very desolate louis marie had gone into france on business concerning his patrimony and would not be back for some days she had not even god to help her with dusk as she still lay unstirring came a quick step which she recognised in the hall outside she caught herself up making some effort towards composure as it hurried towards the room in which she sat and the next instant young balmat entered he shut the door upon the servant who had announced him he was so agitated so breathless that he could scarce stammer an apology for his freedom he came towards her hat in hand at an eager run his eyes were shining his chest heaving in the prospect of some wonderful announcement mon dieu madama madama he whispered excitedly what news christ in heaven what news she rose trembling her heart she felt could not bear much more what is it jacques she said faintly balmat iron nerved made but a sorry mercury it is only he said that the marquess your husband was murdered that is little there was more than one of us had suspected it but by whom god be praised for enlightening us for vindicating the innocent it has all come out and who do you think is the guilty one no other than m le prfet himself who is lying at this moment under arrest ah ah what have i blundered great oaf madama madama that same night an express was despatched by madame saint pray to her husband in france bidding him for reasons of her own not to return until he heard further from her chapter viii that sunny forenoon on which dr bonito carrying the kings commission in his pocket and m lotade whom he had taken up by the way on the seat of the chaise beside him came posting down the valley into le prieur found the whole village in a flutter of excitement which the apparent opportuneness of his arrival was presently to inflame into a fervour alighting at the doors of the prefecture and conning acidly sardonic the perturbed faces which gathered about him sought to reconcile this frowzy magnifico with an earlier familiar figure he was conscious of a moral agitation in the atmosphere which at first he was inclined to attribute to some shadow of the truth having run before him but in that he was wrong the announcement of his mission when it was made took the populace like a clap of wind at a street corner the village staggered in it then rallied hurriedly to appraise its significance for the moment the fact was important only in its relation to another more instant and insistent the two combined ran up the public temperature to fever heat m le prfet it appeared was absent at the time opportunely for m le prfet in the light of a certain amazing discovery there were those indeed a boon friend a sympathising official or two who would have liked to urge by secret message upon m le prfet wherever he might be found the wisdom of confirming his own absence practically and for ever but no one knew where he was for the rest m lotade being long identified with the popular movement and personally a local favourite the change per se was accepted with an easy resignation events to be sure had made such a change problematically inevitable the wonder was that it had come to occur at the intensely psychologic moment for how could a prefect shown guilty though on circumstantial evidence of a startling crime be made to bring about his own arrest the advent of the newcomers had resolved that difficulty mr trix was m le prfet no longer the story as poured by agitated officialdom into the ears of dr bonito and his protg was soon related that very morning it appeared a goatherd emerging from the woods over against the ice fall of the glacier of the winds had been halted petrified before a sight the like of which had surely never before astounded human vision for there embedded in one of the toppling glassy pinnacles hung poised before the very eyes of the man a human body dumbfoundered he had presently taken out his spyglass to inquire more closely into this wonder only to recoil aghast before the revelation it brought him the obscene thing huddled in semi transparency appeared squatting like a great toad there was something horribly unseemly in its attitude an extravagant pose of limb which in a mass of its bulk was sickeningly abnormal it might have been an arm flung over its head until one saw that it ended in a boot its face twisting from under anywhere came very close to the surface of the ice it looked as if flattened against a window grinning out on the observer as he that observer had brought its features into focus he had uttered a startled cry and leapt back the face was the face of augias marquess di rocco there was no mistaking it by anyone who had once been familiar with its loathed enormity the man had stood staring and trembling before it in a deadly fascination possibly it was due to the phenomenal weather that the glacier had thus early yielded up its secret at any rate it had yielded it the murder was out yes and literally murder it appeared the dead slowly travelling down through these years had claimed at last to be his own damning witness even while the onlooker gazed spell bound the great ice turret had tilted over sunk torn away and still holding to its secret in the main had gone shattering and waltzing down the slope until it had brought upon against a heap of brash whereupon seeing it settled for the time the peasant had girded up his terrified wits and pounded down into the village half demented with his news he had been heard with incredulity his urgency had compelled his listeners in a little half the village was trooping up the moraine one of the party the place being pointed out to him had descended hurriedly upon the glacier to investigate the venture was not without peril death was for ever thundering down in the wash of that icy weir but he had succeeded in reaching the spot in safety and the next moment a strange cry was carried from him to the watchers on the moraine then they had seen him running furiously back to them young balmat it was his face was death ashy there was an exultant fury in his eyes his breath hissed from his lungs it is true he had gasped and he was murdered the knife is still sticking in him i know that knife well it was m le prfets it was this news which had run down into le prieur carried by those who were despatched thither for ropes within the next hour or two the block containing the body like a hideous mass of spawn had been salvaged and drawn to the edge of the moraine then all who had the stomach to look might satisfy themselves even as the tale was ended into the ears of dr bonito and the other there came down the village street a hushed and solemn company bearing its awful burden silence sowed itself before them even as if death walked there scattering his grain they carried it to the church and laid it on the stone floor of the vestry there it rested alone like an infected thing shut away into quarantine not a soul would approach it when once it was delivered to the law and how did the law accept its trust sourly as represented by dr bonito this ugly visitation indeed was the least agreeable to his schemes he saw on the instant how were cartouche to stand convicted of the crime his own hold on madame saint pray would be loosened for ever if on the other hand he were to reveal a certain secret of which likely only he and the deposed prefect were cognisant the indictment of the actual murderer would end only the more certainly his chances of extortion perhaps even would be used to claim him as an after accessory to the deed he was in a villainous quandary that was the truth this accursed accident had confounded all his plans and to increase his perplexity the new prefect who once secure in his promotion was already showing an aggravating tendency towards self importance and independence betrayed what he thought was an unwarrantable officiousness in taking the matter promptly and masterfully into his own hands he had jacques balmat brought before him at once you have no doubt he demanded that this body so astonishingly brought to light is the body of the late marquess di rocco no doubt whatever monsieur nor that monsignore met his death by foul means not even he monsieur could resist the full length of that blade it lies buried in him to the hilt and it is by that hilt that you identify it precisely so monsieur how it was familiar to me of old as to many others in the hand of m trix monsignores protg the haft was of jade surmounted by a golden rats head it was monsieurs hunting knife well known granted that the knife was monsieurs there remains the question of a motive it is not for me to suggest one monsieur at least it is to be believed foresaw no advantage to himself in the event of his padrones marriage it was whispered indeed that he had every interest in preventing it the two came to words it was reported on the subject of a settlement compensation what you will that was just before monsignores disappearance m trix also had disappeared it would seem opportunely i know nothing more than that i repeat only to monsieur the common gossip gossip to be sure but quite reasonably damning that evening monsieur the ex prefect returning unconcerned to the village was arrested in the street and conveyed to the prison of the belfry he had still friends there had been voices timely to warn him he had laughed them away unheeding here perhaps was to end his part in that pantomime of necessarianism which men played to the gods he hoped in the transformation that he would be found worthy to be made a harlequin but he was not sure judged by his present fooling at fates hands that he was not destined for pantaloon he took his deposition and the rest with an imperturbable coolness and good humour and apart in the dark church lay the body of his father a hideous thing yet there was one as inhuman though living who moved by a sardonic curiosity could be found to dare the terrors of that mortuary in the dead of the night bonito candle in hand stood to look upon the corpse what he saw is not to be described the ice had preserved it as whole as when seven years before it had plunged into the crevasse as whole but it had enclosed as it had caught it a thing writhed and racked obscenely a horrible thing like a guy fawkes they had chipped its glassy prison away from the dead form in the warmer air the frosty glaze remaining had already melted and the body lay in a pool it looked as if it were struggling to relax its contortions to settle into the lines of an ancient repose sometimes it actually moved the terror of the suggestion woke no responsive thrill in the watchers nerves he was as stoic as callous as a mongol not unlike one indeed in feature and temperament he bent down searching with his candle flame yes there was the rats head fastened into the shattered breast gleaming on it like deaths own order there was even a stain of red about its teeth he stood up frowning grating his chin the same he thought no doubt about it what am i to do the lines on his harsh face deepened if i were to see her bid her a last price a great price a fine sufficing price against my keeping silence at the trial would she agree close see him condemned unwinking damn herself to this is the venture worth how now di rocco the dead man seemed to nod up his head chapter ix they had exchanged tokens he had parted with this knife to your husband it is the damning link to which ill swear the court is my court and my testimony will be final i hang your louis madame twist a saintly neck to save a rakes well let it be women have these penchants his vile innuendoes passed her by white withered in the scorching blast the exaltation of her purpose kept her still erect and steadfast to the end on which shed staked her soul herself in that foredoom counted no longer for anything she would save her love her saint though all the dogs of hell combined to pull him down dusk was trooping up from the valleys the sun lit distant peaks budded from it like flower spires in a fading paradise as point by point they misted into vapour so eternal darkness seemed to claim her to itself in a little she would be quite alone a childs laugh coming up faintly from the road below smote on her heart like a death cry she started involuntarily then stood stone still it was fearful to see tears running down a stone face but each syllable of her voice when she spoke was as if carved and rounded a worthless life but innocent of this he will not speak you think reveal the truth not unless you bid him ah even her loathing of that emphasis of all that it implied could wring no more from her he conned her pitilessly but say that he did a palpable subterfuge to escape the halter ill swear i saw the knife on him that very day she hardly seemed to hear him worthless she continued lifelessly but i would not have him suffer not for you say he may be saved once sentenced given the means to escape i say i can procure one an order to visit him no more appearances must be kept the government still counts though in savoy what then ropes are cheap nights dark the window of his prison is unbarred they reckon on a precipice to hold safe enough not counting helpful friends and lovers once over the border and in france hes safe may snap his fingers at us so long as he stays there give me what i ask and you shall have the order o not for me for whom then mistress no no none else i wash my hands of all collusion you entreat me for a friend or better my kind heart yields the permit shall be an open one made out to bearer ill promise that much confederate with whom you will im not to ask nor know those are my terms take or leave my ruin well its a large sum i confess worth a saints ransom if you think not you neednt sign the covenant its true your estates of a constitution to heal itself of even such a wound and theres no heir for you to nurse or nurse it for but please yourself give me the paper with a hand stone steady she put her name to it and heres in acknowledgment for need signed lotade and countersigned said he and held the order out to her she made no movement to take it he threw it at her feet and without any sign of triumph or emotion left the house she heard the door clang on him the sound seemed to snap some fibre in her brain suddenly she was hurrying up and down laughing weeping imploring no no it was a jest i have let myself be frightened by dreams the sky is all full of laughter at me they dont do these things not to the very young o little baby why didnt you come my little unborn child i was too young to bear even a little child too easily deceived it would have killed me and i should have gone to heaven such a jest heaven for me children children dont laugh i heard you down in the road look though im not a mother i can bear secrets monstrous horrible things dont come near me i should cry and cry to see your terror i said dont come near me dont my god they are not children at all louis louis save me i did it all for you louis she struck blindly against the wall and sank down moaning at its foot chapter x the trial of mr trix ex prefect of faissigny for the murder of his patron made a tremendous stir not only locally but throughout the cisalpine kingdom of victor amadeus it was really a trial of strength between the forces of revolt and those of reactionism a tug of war between piedmont and savoy with the alps for toe line but from the first there was no doubt as to the issue wind muscle new blood self confidence were all in favour of the savoyard champions while the acclamations of a whole nation their neighbours and backers thundered in their ears opposed were the degenerates of an effete rgime themselves not without a spitfire courage but in physique no match for this new vigorous young demos for this bristling force suddenly sprung into life from seed of dead dragons teeth to savoy this opportunity to assert its virtual independence came at the ripe moment with the means to point the right moral cartouche offered himself providentially for the rope with which to test the relative haulage values of progress and conservatism that was his obliging use at the moment he was not personally unpopular save with the illuminati and other such fanatic extremists and he was arraigned on a popular charge that of having destroyed an enemy of the people but he stood convicted of privilege was an autocrats nominee and the question at issue was not one of popularity but of principle the severe justice of the people now first coming into evidence had to be vindicated prejudice and partiality and other dynastic prerogatives had to be suppressed wherefore the matter was held to turn not so much on the guilt or innocence of the prisoner as on the necessity of making an example of a kings favourite liberty justice and equality as representing in the bulk the new heresy of humanity were unanimous in demanding the sacrifice of this scapegoat to the sins of his class he was offered up in the public esteem long before he was sentenced and the worst of it for reactionism lay in the absence of an effective retort it could not move for the pardon of the prisoner if convicted without appearing to hold him justified of the worst offence against itself on the other hand to surrender him to judgment by default would be to admit the right of popular jurisdiction so it endeavoured to temporise weakly by citing the parties in the case to appear before the criminal court of turin whereupon le prieur answered by bringing the prisoner to immediate trial and sentencing him to be hanged incontinent in its own market square before the church so much for the political aspects of this cause clbre the private and personal only ceased to be subordinate to them with the certainty of the democratic victory then at last general interest began to concentrate itself on the scapegoat he proved himself in one way to be a disappointing scapegoat lent himself to be done to death with scarcely a show of resistance it appeared as if he recognised his doom for a foregone conclusion and was determined to accept the clamour for his aristocratic blood as a sign of an improving taste on the part of jacques bonhomme he signified his disgust of any rudeness directed at himself but was always ready to applaud and retort on the least essay of wit during the brief course of the trial he always seemed more concerned for his coat than his character for his pose than his peril sometimes his dark eyes would take eager stock of the gloating audience as if they sought among it the evidences of some sign or hope beyond their expectations but as often he would seem to rebuke their credulity with a little laugh and shrug and would recompose himself with a weary insouciance to the fatigue of the business the little court of the prefecture was crammed on the fatal day in addition to clerks advocates public representatives of the government and private reporters for the king so many idle visitors attracted by interest or curiosity had latterly flocked into le prieur that the accommodations of justice were hard set to find standing room for all the place indeed was an inferno but luckily for its unclean spirits quick evidence against and short shrift for the prisoner were timely in releasing them the leading interest before the appearance of the accused centred in the pice de conviction which lay on a green baize covered table before the president it had been necessary for obvious reasons to withdraw the blade seven years hidden from the body of its victim that lay in the churchyard under consecrated ground while a second grave was already morally digging in the unhallowed acre for its murderer if the fact might be held in any degree to justify the indifferent attitude of the defence it was as certain that it vindicated in all its impartiality the severe justice of the people six foot of earth was as much the right of an aristocratic as of a vulgar assassin in the meanwhile there was the gold rat to show his teeth and the red rust on the blade to suggest a horrible intimacy with the inner processes of the crime they must suffice for curiosity until the appearance of the prisoner monsieur the ex prefect dished up at last to a ravenous company surveyed the court as he had always been wont to survey it with a manner as from the chair rather than from the dock he was perfectly cool and self collected dressed as for a gala white handed and sweet scented a fastidious macaroni self consciously caviarre to the general proceed m le prsident he said i will venture to suggest to you the values of a dramatic brevity i am entirely at your service and the hangmans dr bonito sitting slunk out of observation below the presidential chair watched across the room the effect of this entry and rodomontade on a veiled female figure which standing among the spectators had from the first caught his attention dull sighted to all the world of beauty and sentiment he was keen eyed enough where his own appetites were concerned he had early marked down this figure for his consideration as a carrion crow ogles a nesting rook its presence in this place did not surprise him he might have wondered more if a case so far reaching in its sensational attractions had failed to produce this apparition among many less interested his curiosity was chiefly exercised as to its object in attending whether from lust of triumph over or from an inalienable infatuation for a ruined betrayer but he could gather nothing from its immovable attitude the court took monsieur the ex prefect at his word its processes were sharp brief and dramatic by four oclock in the afternoon it had sentenced the excellent petit matre to his last dressing at the hands of the executioner balmat had testified staunchly to the ownership of the knife and the prisoner had applauded his evidence well spoken jacques thou art as upright a witness as a guide yes the knife was mine he had been advised by the president m lotade to sheathe his tongue it is a weapon thou hast sharp reason to fear prefect he had answered there was some recapitulation of former evidence which it is unnecessary to detail among others the drunken rogue target had been called and margot his daughter to all it may be supposed the drift of the inquiry was morally evident they were summoned to condemn the prisoner not to acquit him it was very curious bonito when it came to his turn sniggered over the manner in which fate had accommodated itself to his scheme of a persuasive magic he recalled how he had engaged himself to put a spell on this man so that he should volunteer a loathing of his office he had not aimed at the moment at more than his deposition which so enforced might have entailed troublesome consequences now whatever ensued cartouche counted politically no longer whether he were hanged or allowed to escape he had ceased from the running the gods had played into their oracles hands it was with a sense of this triumph upon him that he had risen to clinch the prisoners condemnation his evidence was necessarily the most damning of all turning as it did upon the question of motive every thin measured word that drew from him pulled the knot tighter about the foredoomed neck he told of the prisoners anger over the projected union of his fruitless plans to betray his patron of his disinheritance and dismissal despite of his suggestive words to himself when they had met later in turin finally he also swore to the knife cartouche smiling shook a finger at him rebukingly i will meet thee on that issue some day old comrade he would speak nothing in his own defence he was proud to have deserved a thousand hangings at their hands he said he was indifferent on what indictment that truth was brought home to the world for himself he only regretted that he had left unhung among his enemies so much intelligence as was able to formulate a plausible reason for destroying him they were not altogether such fools as they had appeared a little wisdom made revolution a dangerous thing he had foolishly hoped that he had eliminated the last of it since it had hidden itself so successfully from him now he must congratulate that little on its taking him effectively unawares behind his back but he warned it to seek a cleverer substitute for himself than m lotade m lotade in consequence had much pleasure in committing him viciously to the gallows bonito when the sentence was pronounced stood up to watch its effect upon the veiled woman she was nowhere to be seen an hour later the ferment and excitement having locally subsided and the precincts of the court been redelivered to quietude he put the knife which he had begged and secured into his pocket parted amicably with his colleagues and set out on foot and alone for his lodgings these to suit his secretiveness and his parsimony no less than his democratic unpretence were in a little smithy on the argentire road he had put up there on the occasion of his former visit there were conveniences about the establishment of jean loustalot forgeron et vtrinaire for one thing loafers were not tolerated in its neighbourhood for the reason that jean a suspicious saturnine man of few words and lowering aspect could not endure that idleness should borrow a lounging zest from his labours as if he were a cursed puppet man for another he was a soaker of the solitary unsocial type and given the means could always be persuaded whenever his room was to be preferred to his company to withdraw into the little dwelling house at the rear of the smithy and there drink himself swiftly and silently into insensibility anticipating in the present instance an occasion of the kind dr bonito provided himself on his way out of the village with a flask of spirits which he deposited with the knife in his pocket he then walked slowly on with an air as of one who was loitering in the expectancy of being joined by a comrade it was in fact no engagement with him but a premonition having all the force of one and the event came to justify it though later than he had looked for the encounter only happened when he was hard upon his destination then instantly he was conscious that a figure was waiting for him in the dusk of the road side he paused a moment darkness like a precipitate was beginning to settle down into the valley from the distant village came an excited bee like murmur ahead of him some fifty feet a welter of shapeless light the ring and clang of an anvil marked where the smithy stood within a clump of trees high up on the hill opposite twinkled the lights of the chteau di rocco he took it all in squeezed his lips between finger and thumb and jerked himself suddenly forward as he passed the expectant figure he addressed it wait while i get rid of jack smith i will call to you in a little he went on and entered the forge took the flask from his pocket held it up before the eyes of the panting cyclops i have a visitor jean i want to be alone the man who had been softly manipulating the bellows ceased of his hold on the instant the handle the fire his brow all went down together with no more than a hoggish grunt he seized the flask and disappeared bonito went to the door and called softly the fire had fallen so low when she entered that they were only phantom darknesses to one another but he kept a shrewd eye for his part on the undulations of the gloom which was addressed to him he was the first to speak so you decided to follow priestess and to satisfy yourself of the reality of your vengeance i had half looked for you i confess your presence in the court did not surprise me her silence something in the atmosphere of her regard warned him to be vigilant and watchful it was strange he went on how circumstances rushed to complicate my simpler purpose call it coincidence if you will tis but another term for providence ill show you why show you good reason to be grateful for the course that things have taken do you know what i have in my hand her whisper came like a snakes hiss through the darkness it was his turn to be silent i have my finger on the trigger she said i give you a moment to answer have you forgotten what you swore no not to hurt him and you have taken his life no i say as i am going to take yours if soulless courage be a virtue he could boast that one he never flinched before the crawling horror of that unseen death his voice as he spoke had not altered by a note a tremor from its accustomed harshness yet all the while he was desperately enough calculating his chances thats as you will he said only id advise you hear me speak first all considered ive done my best for you she gave a little wrenching laugh well he said will you listen ill listen she answered i can aim better being silent make sure of me then his life stands behind mine ah does that shake you now be reasonable if you can was the glacier my creature and coincidence in my pay i might never have opened my lips and they would have convicted your cartouche a dozen times without the people cried for him you knew the truth what if i did do you bear in mind how for years we have made a fortune out of its suppression i know how you have dog i have kept you in comforts priestess at least i think in comforts no more of those if our parts were once confessed but straw and chains and rods and a stone bed in penitenza the oracle would fall with the priest what will you do when you have killed me go to her up there and tear the truth out of her throat or end her too he shant die unavenged my god do you hear me melodrama melodrama well if you prefer it to the prose of commonsense but for that he might be saved yet he heard how her breath caught at the word and his own found relief in a little silent snigger the truth he said shed not yield it to save a sinner at her saints expense though you dragged out her tongue with pincers i know the stubborn fool but grant she were to what benefit to you when they hanged you for my murder my neck for his melodrama i say i say theres a better way for you why look you i might have warned him let him forestall his enemies escape to france and so a condemned outcast he had been lost to you for ever now you can save him go with him if you will and win back his old passion out of his new gratitude i can i o god if i might i say you may there throw down your silly weapon our principles confirmed your fools life counts with us for little ill give you proof ive already put it into the hands of her up there to deal with it as she will her his life his life you put it i she hates him maybe but she keeps a conscience what have why cant you understand that the man convicted of the crime and hanged for it my draughts on her would be dishonoured she were a bank stopped payment fine reason to be sure for my seeking his destruction i calculated better i calculated on her conscience i say a perverse organ in a woman but it stuck at his death just that it served me to commute my pension so to speak to exchange her the means to save him once condemned against a little bond a promissory note its here he tapped his breast significantly to save him she repeated stupidly why he said i told her ropes were cheap nights dark that there were no bars to his window and i gave her an order made to bearer for a private interview with him shes got it now unless shes used it already if she has youve ruined her i suppose thank god for that i did my best but the soils fruitful the forest will rise again from its burning if youd be beforehand with her claim his first gratitude he stopped a little swift rustle had passed him and he was alone he listened a moment uttered a small dry chuckle and then bestirred himself to get a light he knew where the lamp hung on the wall and in a little had kindled it looking well satisfied round and about him his eye caught the glint of a pistol lying on the forge he took up the weapon and examined it curiously it was primed and loaded she had meant it then he had been a little sceptical but now he congratulated himself on his escape he put the thing into his breast pocket it was better out of the way in case of accidents she might return upon him with god knew what fresh aberration in her brain the night air came in chill and searching at the open hatch of the door he blew the smouldering ashes on the forge into a glow and fetched a stool and sat down leaning against the brickwork to think things pleasantly over he had no fear of being disturbed from without neighbourliness was the last thing encouraged by m loustalot the smithy was no rendezvous for gossips least of all after dark when its remoteness and its masters reputation made it a spot anathema his thoughts pursued his visitor he wondered if her mission accomplished she would in truth succeed in winning back that errant passion to herself on the whole he rather hoped she would it would serve to kill two birds for him with a single stone she would keep cartouche away and cartouche her neither once escaped could afford to return that would be as it should be he himself was in need of her no longer had wanted in fact only a convenient pretext for dissolving their partnership here his usual luck that had offered itself opportunely the sum for which he held the saint prays bond was so large that its investment would justify him in an immediate retirement from business he had no desire at the same time to hamper it with the burden of a sibylline pensioner and so yes he hoped the two would escape together never to reappear in savoy he had every confidence in their being permitted to even in a democracy it was no good precedent to hang a prefect any more than it was its good policy to alienate at the outset of its campaign by the vindictive sacrifice of its first prisoner taken the sympathies of the temperate among reformers he believed that le prieur in the person of its new prefect though intentionally uninspired by himself saw this clearly and would be satisfied with its moral triumph since whatever the real facts the execution would be given a political complexion he believed that though the girl should carry into the prison a rope ladder bound about her waist its visible presence on her would be winked at winked at forsooth the thought tickled him what a deal of winking there had been here from first to last the association of ideas brought the knife to his mind and he fetched it from his pocket and examined it curiously there had been nothing but a morbid sentiment in his desire to secure it for himself it gave him a gloating pleasure now to finger the long blade and to think how the smears of its rust were the very dried essence of di roccos heart what secrets it might speak through its seven years intimacy with that corrupt organ wouldst thou not rejoice to utter them into mine hard in fast in he croaked grinning and apostrophising the rats head as he held it out before him but theres none to wield thee at the last bonito poor old scorned and wronged bonito stands the victor and immortal he had no taste for bed in the present tingling poise of things but presently lost in ineffable altitudes of star dreaming he dropped into a doze where he sat his head fallen back upon the forge give me the order youve not used it say you have and i think i shall kill you ive not used it not yet not yet you beast without a heart you kissed me once on my lips id tear them werent they his so youd have let him die but for me in the melancholy half light of the room the two women stood facing one another here was tragedy in white and red blood and spirit in gripping combat it was veritably in its aspect in its significance a struggle between life and death the issue hung upon a word o my sister i love too it was death that spoke flinging herself with a heartworn cry at the others feet a poignant pause ensued the body of hatred strained and trembled a cry issued from it and lo out of the husk of the pythoness a cracked and scaly mask came the soul of molly bramble and the next instant the two poor creatures as once before were weeping and rocking in one anothers arms they mingled their tears and speech incoherently poor soul o what a life i deserve to be whipped and more for having helped it to its misery but there we each struck for our own did you help to it why not he cursed you for my sake and i would have let him die no no i didnt mean to but to go to him myself there i understand youve always held by providence poor fond simple thing havent you youve not changed in all these years only to grow more beautiful o sister tell me youve been good ive never shamed my love a bitter struggle not to ill say no more take the order quick you may save him yet his soul most of all when he hears my god youll betray my louis not us whats a sin or two charged falsely against my cherry hes known a many such and laughed at them i must get a rope its here its waiting for you o you dear woman a thing of spanish silk as light as gossamer and as strong as a cable a hundred feet of it what it must have cost it will go round your waist under your petticoats come while i fasten it o be quick we mustnt lose a minute leave it with him and come back to me tell him therell be a horse waiting ready saddled for him in the road beyond the gate you can join him later ill come back never fear ive that to tell you that beast bonito you know him o my sick head of course well be even with him yet there im all twittering to be gone go then in gods name let them for pitys sake have no suspicion of you o i doubt you can play a part do you sweet innocent there ill not ask you for a kiss o come to me woman woman love me forgive me we are one in our despair despair you i wont it shall all come right dont leave me why dont you go every seconds precious there cover up your face your sweet strong face i shall be dead before you return dont speak when you do until i bid you i shall know by your looks how you have sped there its fastened make him turn his back chapter xi so the end was near at last and here high up among the flying winds and shadows like old stylites on his pillar he stood poised to take his flight not self glorified like that grim evangel but none the less a martyr to his faith a martyr he he could join in the mad laughter evoked by that image the laughter of damned spirits down in the basement it came reeling and echoing up the stairs to him the old belfry stairs to what would he descend those next there was a frightful humour in the prison nomenclature of his time and country speranza purgatorio costanza pazienza penitenza such were the mocking names they gave their noisome cells like eating cubicles in a devils cook house they spelt a devouring cruelty the moral of them all was shattered nerves they substituted filth and misery for the old first question and were scarcely by design less demoralising he who entered one of them had always this much more than his trial to face the weapons of his brain blunted against self defence they were careful to dull and befoul the wits committed to them cartouches cell by comparison with custom was an angels loft a fitting hutch for pigeons he told himself wherefore perhaps it was called il paradiso there is always at least an advantage in having the upper berth it had once been actually the belfry of the tower though the holes where the great beams had entered into the walls were now plugged with bricks the old lights too across which the luffer boards had stretched were all filled in save one that gaped unglazed and unbarred he might escape by it if he would the wall below went down clean and precipitous seventy or more feet to the pavement yet after his doom was pronounced he was tempted more than once to take the plunge to jump and cheat the gallows there was something perhaps even a little characteristically attractive to him in the thought to trick his enemies out of their triumph to despoil them of their vulgar profits won of a gentleman an ex prefect a court favourite there was a gamblers whimsey in the reflection always not a little of the chevalier dindustries calculating recklessness in his attitude towards his fellows towards all save one she was his saving faith to her strict soul self destruction was a deadly sin hopelessly damning to leap would be to leap for ever out of her thoughts her prayers he could not do it then hed wait and hang to win a place in her remorse that was his only hold on her at last it even gave him an exquisite joy to believe he was secure of it secure in his utter abandonment by her to the fate from which she might have saved him only at the uttermost cost to herself he would not have it otherwise not be cheated of that place by any barren compromise of hers none could suffice him in this pass only his life for her and hers hed give it without a murmur for the rest he told himself he did not much care life was a farce without this yolande impossible with her it was strange how his thoughts clung about that one figure it was only of a woman bigoted and foolish not even now with beauty supreme in her to redeem the lack of liberal qualities and she could let him die upon a falsehood her piety was not proof against the last temptation so much the madder truer lover she he worshipped not her perhaps but love in her he worshipped her at least would die to save her what was his life worth sometimes leaning looking from his window old dreams would come to him a far back retrospect like that which opens out its vista to the drowning he could see a little figure at the end leaping in green sunlight it came dancing along and jumped into his breast he wept nursing it nursing the little image of himself if she could see me now he thought and yet he was no traitor to his fathers memory the old dog had been kind to him sanctity and self indulgence he sighed i could never tell the decent way between only she might have taught me his view commanded the market square he wondered when they were going to begin the people went their busy way below seemingly unconcerned they looked squat things ridiculously foreshortened lilliputians to the giant he felt himself to be by contrast why should he let such absurdities hang him no matter so he died for her always she the others claims he hated she vexed him in the night with her eternal weeping weeping weeping for an irremediable sorrow what use in this invertebrate lament let her come and save him if she wished to prove herself the nobler soul not that he would concede her that triumph but he loved deeds not tears would rather that love defied than petitioned him and so one night she came it was pitch dark without he had been dozing on his pallet but some cessation in the sentries monotonous tramp across the landing to and fro brought him wide awake the door opened and shut again something was in the room he listened curious cherry whispered a voice he was on his feet on the instant the shock had half unnerved him he stood straining his eyes his elbows crooked his heart hammering who are you he muttered he heard her panting softly weeping then he knew it was she he made a mad effort to compose himself to stand up in the breach this sudden ghost had torn in his defences the voice sighed on o love dont you know me cherry i have come to save you not you he could not help his tone would not if he could she gave a little very bitter cry hush speak low she sent me yolande yes o my god he felt for her touched her in the darkness his heart was on a sudden kind and pitiful poor child poor child how did you hear come find the means these long years ive no right to ask you of them no need to neither they find me what i always was your woman well ive got a rope about me will you take it not i o o why not owe my life to her whose life ive ruined she found the rope i say and the pass to let me bring it to you private paid for it too paid whom bonito there paid bonito with a bond that just spells her ruin hes got it on him now i understand where is he at loustalot the blacksmiths i left him there not two hours since i went to kill him cherry for what hed done to you and to save his life he sent me on to her shed only lain close a bit for lack of such a messenger and im to say there shall be a horse waiting for you in the road by the gate give me the rope let me have your hand only that there its on the floor put it away somewhere till im gone he obeyed and groped his way back to her felt for her poor face and took it in his hands she stood quite passive molly im not worth a thought only her low heart rending sobs answered him thank god he said we cannot see one anothers faces never shall again cherry yes call me that cherry maynt i hope ive been good i may not molly she told me to to save your soul perhaps when youre gone away and safe i could wait until you changed to me her words wrung his heart this child so true and faithful to him to the last and his own immeasurable baseness to her in thought and deed alike what could it matter now let love be still a casuist for loves sake he put his arms about her set his lips upon her face with some new rehearsal of an ancient passion before god molly if i live i will marry you an hour later he stood at the window waiting to descend the rope was in place he had fastened it to a beam deep mid night slept upon the village she has done this thing for me he thought given the bond risked all to right her fault what else or greater could she do god make her happy chapter xii bonito startled out of dreams of immortality returned to earth with a shock something somebody had spoken to him even so taken by surprise his wits momentarily confounded habitual wariness kept him stone still where he lay his head dropped back upon the forge while he strove desperately to excogitate his right answer to the situation for the instant of his waking had been one with his recognition of the voice and of a flaw moreover in his own policy the consequences were facing him at once and tremendously he knew that his life at this moment hung upon a word where is the bond i say will you wait for me to cut it out of you still he made no answer the sooty beams in the roof seemed to undulate above his half closed lids as the light pulsated in the lantern he thought he saw the pin point eyes of innumerable spiders watching him from their secret places they affected him curiously he could not concentrate his thoughts while they held him so intently there were some means he possessed he was certain of it for retort or self defence could he only recall them but those eyes held him from the effort while he was still in a mortal struggle to escape them the voice spoke again quick and damning what use in this pretence i know thee never so wide awake thou dog o thou ineffable dog to wring it from her ruin that once for last was once too many down you go still he lay as silent as death though a pulse of life it was plain enough went shadowing up and down on his strained chest not said cartouche horribly do you know whats here bonito the pretty little jade and golden toy what providence dropped it at your feet it wakes strange thoughts in me to hold it in my hand again the throats it split blood lapped all honest sport so long as it was mine will you not give me up the bond lest her pure name put to it be soiled well then no law for you not to be thought of where shes concerned id come to kill you beast just my hands against yours and behold youve given me a weapon with a leap like whalebone released the figure was on its feet and screaming help help moi loustalot the prisoner hes escaped help a cry as useless as desperate he himself had paralysed the drunkards hand had closed his ears even as he uttered it he was down doomed saw the blade whisked up last in whose heart a mortal shudder seized him and then all of a sudden he remembered he tore something from his breast even as the knife descended a shock and spatter of fire leapt from his hand and cartouche reeled and fell not too late perhaps yet dropping the reeking pistol he tried to pluck the rats tooth from his throat it held like a vice fumbling with it feebly and ever more feebly his fingers relaxed half rose again to grip the agony and so poised mid way crooked and stiffened slowly for a minute silence reigned on the fallen echoes of that tragedy then the ex prefect stirred he was bleeding horribly the wound in him was numb only his every limb seemed faint with sickness he crawled to the dead thing and with shaking hands searched it and quickly came upon what he sought rising by a superhuman effort and supporting himself against the forge he found her name and put his stiff lips to it they left a crimson wafer his sign manual this is my act and deed some ashes yet smouldered on the hearth he blew them into a glow the blood pumping from him regularly to each beat of the bellows and thrust the paper in and saw it go in flame then tottering for the open door he sunk down upon its threshold the lights of di rocco twinkled on the hill side they found him sunk against the lintel with his dead eyes fixed upon them afterward these shadows pass yet to what possible redemption through that blood had it not been said that whoso sheddeth mans by mans shall his be shed it was not for that poor sinner to usurp the divine prerogative those for whom he suffered must still expiate as they had wrought far on i see them moving the devoted woman still shadowing the weak man the old order has passed away and they with it the kingdom of retaliation has risen on the kingdom of despotism savoy is bound with a red ribbon to the republic its people shout for france its rulers are betrayed to her one day these two go to the scaffold it is a last mercy that they are permitted to go together so her lifes purpose shall find its consummation what sorrows what disenchantments have been hers in these years of her fading beauty of her hopelessness for herself only god may know they have never affected her steadfast resolve she has given herself to save her saint for heaven up to the very last her patient lips are shut to him on all that she has done and suffered for his sake his passage shall be bright and confident she kisses him and sends him to die before her only then for the first time she seemed to realise what she had done he had passed in and the gates were shut between them for ever they say that she dropped where she stood and had to be carried under the knife the end transcribers notes
