introductory i am convinced she rivalled at fifty the exquisite diane de poitiers herself in the brightness of her wit and the perfection of her form and might have passed as triumphantly a like test of the marble the marquis de c in his foreword if the public seeks any apology for this introduction to it at a late date of the extraordinary woman whose self dictated memoirs form the staple of the following pages it must look for it in the references of her contemporaries it will be far from gathering it from her own autobiography diane rosemonde de st croix to give her her proper mother title considered that she owed to romance in a glowing age what in a practical one is conceded by a thousand dull and petty vanities to a vulgar curiosity her personal reminiscences she had at least the justification of her qualities and the good fortune to find in her latter day friend the marquis de c an enthusiastic historian of them in the question of their appeal one way or the other to the english reader the present transcriber from the original french notes must hold himself responsible both for choice and style madame de st croix was a passionist as the french called casanova and indeed she had many points in common with that redoubtable adventurer an unappeasable vagabondism a love of letters an ardent imagination an incorruptible self love and lastly what we may term an exotic orthodoxy if subscribing to the universal creed which makes mans soul his fetish she worshipped an exacting god she was at least always ready to sacrifice the world to gratify it and now no doubt very logically sings among the angels in the matter of her more notorious characteristics m de c lest her part on earth should suffer misconstruction by the censorious is so good as to speak with some show of finality i deny he says the title adventuress to my charming and accomplished friend it is nothing if not misleading every day we venture something for love for hunger for ambition he who deviates from rice and barley water venturing on spiced dishes makes every time an assault on his epigastrium he who is not content with an ignoble mediocrity though he do no more than take pains with a letter is a candidate for fame and as for love it does not exist on the highway why should it imply distinction to call a man an adventurer and be invidious to style a woman adventuress ulysses dallying in a is surely no more honourable a sight than godiva traversing coventry in an adorable deshabille to have the wide outlook the catholic sympathy is that to merit defamation no it is to be heroically human better sin like an angel i say than be a sick devil and virtuous it remains only to mention that the present transcript conducts no further than to the finish of a dramatic period of madame de st croixs story and to that even at the expense of a considerable lacuna referred to in its place which no research has hitherto been successful in filling it is hoped however that in what is given enough will be found to interest b c note an ingenious etymologist supplies a likely derivation for the duck stone so often mentioned in the text from the slavic dook or duk signifying to spirit away accepting this genesis the duck stone given to mrs please by the gypsy becomes the dook or bewitching stone and is imbued with whatever virtues our faith or our credulity may suggest the extraordinary confessions of diana please i i make my dbut at my friend m de c s instigation i sit down in the noon of my life to talk of its morning i look first to your gallantry my dear alcide to see that this statement is not misconstrued that i have a past argues nothing of my remoteness from it in comparison with the immortality which is surely to be mine everything on this side is youth i am seventeen or thirty seven or whatever i choose and i intend that heaven whenever it calls me shall find me irresistible possessing all the ages it cannot grudge me my arbitrary disposition of my own little term now tell your friends my dear alcide that to succeed in life one must never ask a woman her age or a man his intentions and so we shall all be comfortable i owe my mother the most whimsical of grudges my existence i will nickname her the comtesse de lombre and so shall abuse no confidences in relating of my debt to her and to lovelace her collaborator in the romance of which i am the heroine she was very beautiful and he an english cadet of distinction was an aristocratic paragon at the age of sixteen convinced of the hollowness of life she had taken the veil and become the sister agns of the communaut de madelonnettes notre dame de la charit in paris whence a year later she was transferred to an english branch of the house hence and from her duty my father whom she had approached upon a begging mission succeeded unhappily in inveigling her to the day of her death my mother bore the disfiguring sign of a little cross on her breast it has succeeded to me but in a faint reflection a grain de beaut only i will tell you in a word the story of my inheritance the ladies of les madelonnettes had in inviting all the feminine vices to their inauguration ceremony with the object to pension them off handsomely overlooked the bad fairy jealousy thou knowest alcide the meanness of this witch to revenge herself she cast lovelace into their midst as eris cast the apple of discord upon the nuptial board of thetis and poor de lombre was made the consequent scapegoat driven forth in ignominy from the fold she could not suffer so much but that one over zealous or jealous must strike her an envious blow across the bosom on which she always wore a little crucifix the gift of her father the ebony cut in and left an indelible scar to which i was to succeed in pathetic earnest of my origin it has never ceased to be a symbol to me of the vanity of self renunciation how can we deny ourselves and not deny one after whose image we are made i was born in a lodging at brighthelmston whither my father had conveyed my mother the town which has always possessed an attraction for me was at that time a very paltry affair of scattered houses to which the mumpish or melancholic came periodically to salt their spleens against a fresh course of dissipations locality has never however influenced my temper the perfume of contentment breathes from within and is not to be affected by soil or surroundings let us who have good constitutions continue as the way is to accept them for virtues and to abhor the dyspeptic as unclean let us have the discretion to ask no questions of our neighbours about what we dont understand in this entertaining comedy of life so shall we justify ourselves to ourselves and avoid being made uncomfortable is it not so my friend my mother had never i do believe had a doll till i came she was very young even then and could not tire of playing with me in our pretty cottage near the steine and i responded in all endearing gaiety and innocence with the very trustfulness of which she must i fear have come to reproach her apostasy maybe she did for as time went on i can recall a cloud settling upon her brow the shadow perhaps of the yoke under which she was passing from girlhood to womanhood i was already four when she came of age o mon chri think of the tragedy of those italics and think of me a child of a precocious observation and little ears as pinkly susceptible to murmurs as the inside of a shell doomed to wake wake to some misty understanding of the unusual in our relations by and by i even confided my suspicions to my father whom i adored and who visited us occasionally coming down from town very elegant and mondain and in great company he laughed and then frowned over at mamma who returned his look steadily dear sir she said only the child is growing very critical do not encourage her and make this cross harder than i can bear but i too have a cross i said only it is little and faint and not blushing like mamans my papa laughed again and again frowned saying it is a fact and hard on the infant who has done nothing to deserve it then he pushed me from him and rose and going to the door turned at it with a peevish face i weary of these heroics said he if you persist in them remember that you are qualified more than ever for les madelonnettes he went and she cried out as if over some dreadful awakening but thenceforth for some reason our confidences grew estranged i loved my poor mamma so well that i think she should not have responded by striving to make heir to her melancholy the innocent cause of it at the root of all our moral revolt is a sense of the injustice of original sin i at least had done nothing to make me unhappy presently i was given a governess my dear careless fathers nominee she was french a ci devant matresse de pension very lazy and self indulgent and if not sleeping she was always ogling for unattached beaux vicious and insolent she delighted in prompting me to reflections on my mothers self reserve and honour was as much in her mouth as false teeth i learned nothing from her but indecorum and innuendo one day for the moral to her teaching it was when i was ten years old i was playing truant on the downs when i saw a small smutty baby crawl from under a bush into the road at the very moment that a carriage wildly driven was approaching i had just time to notice the gilded splendour of the equipage and perhaps let us be frank my friend to be inspired to heroism by the sight before i leapt and snatched up the child from under the very feet of the galloping horses as the chariot thundered by an elegantly groomed head thrust itself from the window and a ruffled hand waving to me standing there unhurt but bewildered flung back a gold coin into the dust i turned my back immediately disillusioned by the insolence of the acknowledgment as to the disinterested quality of my deed and the more so as the baby was parler franchement decidedly unpleasant i put the imp down and began to re order my little ruffled plumes wouldst thou hear what they were my alcide i can recall them at this hour a dainty gipsy hat knotted to a blue ribbon a stomacher laced over with silver twist and a skirt to the ankles both of flowered lustring three pair of ruffles at my bare elbows a black solitaire at my neck and black shoes with red heels and the prettiest of paste buckles alas how better than our sins of yesterday do we remember the stockings we wore to sin in let me for penance concede to history these my failings i was in fact colourless in complexion like tinted porcelain with what my detractors used to call spun glass hair and the eyes of a dresden shepherdess and i was not at that time light on my feet with which my volatile spirits were always at odds now as i smoothed my skirt i was aware of a mad gipsy woman hurrying from the bank towards me and crying and gesticulating as she came she caught up the infant and finding it unharmed put it down again and fawned upon me inarticulate then she broke off to curse the distant carriage up hill and down and finally went to pick up the coin from the very spot where she had not failed to mark its fall it is yours she said striding back to me take it you can keep it i answered with my little nose in the air a lady does not want for money she slipped it into her pocket and fell on her knees before me nor beauty nor love nor silken raiment she cried and yet they are not all think my darling there be no need so wild but the poor grateful gipsy may show a way to gratify it i laughed half annoyed and half frightened and then suddenly and oddly there came into my head the thought of the stocking needle the gouvernante was wont to stick into my bosom at meals to prevent me stooping and rounding my back must i confess my alcide that there was ever a time when thy diane was a little less or more than a sylph make me light i said so that i can dance without feeling the ground she looked at me strangely a moment then all about her in a stealthy way while she slipped her hand into her pocket hush she said for none other but you only tell not of it and she brought up a little greasy packet of parchment writ round with characters like a hebrew phylactery have you ever heard tell of the duck stone she whispered i shook my head full of curiosity no she said nor any of thine it fell from the sky from another world deary thats strange to ours and the gipsies found it in the wild places of the woods there was a smell came from it like the sugar of all flowers and it was as light as foam and as hard as the beaten rocks she undid the packet while she spoke and i saw a number of tiny grey cubes like frothy pumice stone one of which she detached and gave to me it wrought upon them even to madness she said so that they took and broke it with their mattocks and lo the nameless thing was found in its scattered parts a virtue even like the poisons which taken in little heal smell to it when the world is dark and your brain shall flash into light like an inn to the tired traveller smell to it when your feet go sick and heavy and you shall feel them like the birds whose bones are full of wind but tell not of the gift or giver lest i die involuntarily as she spoke i had raised the stone to my nostrils a faint scent as of menthene intoxicated my brain the downs and the sky swam before me in one luminous mist lightness and delight took all my soul and body with rapture a shout brought me to myself i was sitting on the grass with the duck stone still tight in my clutch the gipsy was gone how long i could not tell and up the road was coming a second cortge more brilliant than the former a dozen young fellows all volunteer runners and dressed in white preceded a coach in which sat a rich apparelled lady very bold and handsome and escorted by a splendid cavalcade of gentlemen it was the duchess of cumberland who followed her husband to the seaside as i was to learn by and by for while i was collecting my drowsy young wits to look a wonderful thing happened a horseman drew up with a cry dismounted seized and bore me to his saddle and rode away with me after the carriage it was my father flushed and jovial the pink and corinthian of his company as he always was he showed no curiosity over the encounter nor scruple in taking me with him he was in wild spirits laughing and teasing and sometimes he reeled in his saddle in a way to endanger my balance but the rush of air restored me to myself and i had the wit for all my excitement to slip my charm which i still held into a pocket so we raced for the town and presently drew up at the castle tavern where his royal highness and his wife the late mrs horton were quartering themselves the time which followed is confused in my remembrance i was put in charge of a chambermaid given a dish of tea and cake and presently fell fast asleep to awake smiling and rosy to the summons of my pleasant clarinda a lackey in a magnificent scarlet livery awaited me at the door received me into his arms and carried me downstairs to a long room blazing with waxlights where at a white table spilt all over with a profusion of fruit and crystal sat a gorgeous company of gentlemen and ladies such silks and laces such feathers and diamonds i had never in my young day encountered it was like the most beautiful fair i had ever seen and the red faces of the company were the coloured bladders bobbing in the stalls still i had not lost my self possession when my father reeled round in his chair and catching me away from the servant set me on my feet on the table itself i was a little confused by the tumult which greeted my exaltation diane whispered my father in my ear go and tell the duke in a pretty speech that i send my love to him i flicked up my skirts and went off immediately among the fruit and decanters my progress was a triumph the women clapped in artificial enthusiasm and the men stopped me to kiss my little shoes and presently down that long lane i saw the dukes smiling face awaiting me it was not a temperate face it is true its thirty four years were traced upon it in very crooked hieroglyphics but then cest la dernire touche quinforme the royal star of the garter glittering on the apricot coat beneath made everything handsome by his side sat the lady his duchess ne luttrell as brand new as i to her exaltation but it was the difference between hebe and thais for all my innocence i felt that and did not fear her rivalry i dropped a little curtsey amongst the grapes and melons monsieur i said my papa wishes to make you a pretty gift and sends you his love he applauded laughing as did all the table and lifted me down to his lap what price for the love he cried see i return him a dozen kisses he kept me however plying me with bonbons while madam tittered and fanned herself vexedly you will make the little ape sick enrico she said put her down for shame i know where to stop i retorted and by god you do said the duke with a great laugh and held me tight i had a thimbleful of liqueur from his hand by and by which made me think of the duck stone i was the little queen of the evening and a delight to my father and all faith said a merry irish rapparee a bit of a courtier captain man has been vainly trying to fit woman into the moral scheme ever since she made herself out of his ninth rib and the fashions out of a fig leaf and here in the eighteenth century anno domini is the result i was carried on to the steine presently by my father my little brain whirling the whole of the castle tavern and every house and shop adjacent were illuminated and the lights and crowds of people quite intoxicated me there were sports enacting on all sides and i screamed with laughter to see a jingling match played for a laced coat and hat in which the jingler hung with bells dodged and eluded and dropped between the legs of the blindfolded who sought to capture him then there was a foot race run by young women for a holland smock and i jeered at their self conscious antics with all my little might as they went giggling into place coy and hobbledehoy and pushed and quarrelled secretly and stopped the starter to do up their greasy tresses and then all but the winner snivelled over the result pronouncing it unfair presently i was taken to see an ox roasted whole and it was here while we were looking on at the lurid tumult occurred a rencontre which was to alter the whole current of my life a fat drunken sweep in his war paint jostled my father who himself in the fury of wine turned and felled the beast to the ground we were isolated from our friends at the moment and a ring was immediately formed and the sweep called upon to stand up and pay his interest like a man he rose nothing loth it seemed and faced my father who was forced to engage my little orse and cart to a red un that i whop ye cried the sweep done answered my father and they fell to i was sure of the result and stood by quite self possessed and eager while they fought a round or two settled it and there sat the sweep unable to rise again with a white tooth dropped on his coat front when my father came away i clung to him and kissed him in ecstasy he was quite cool and only a little breathed and when for the honour of sport he had settled for the sweeps trap to be driven round to his door in the morning intending to put it up to auction he shouldered me laughing and carried me away amidst cheers it was near midnight by then and happening upon a royal servant he gave me into the mans charge and in spite of my remonstrances bade him convey me home i sulked all the way and was in no mood after my excitement to sympathise with my mothers agitated reception of her truant she had been near distracted all these hours thinking me drowned or kidnapped and could not control a gust of temper upon hearing how i had been employed o my maman i said saucily you must understand i have never been in a convent and so know how to take care of myself it was wicked but it was my governess speaking not i ii i am abducted my mamma questioned me again in the morning about my adventures she was very hollow eyed and nervous which offended me for for her to appear ill in body or ill at ease in mind seemed to make my own young sanity something that it was wrong or selfish in me to enjoy i was inconsiderate no doubt yet tell me my alcide is it on the other hand considerate of dyspepsia to be always wet blanketing health and contentment is not the human the only animal permitted of right to inflict his sickness on his fellows while in every other community the invalid is out of the law of nature it is thus undoubtedly that deterioration is provided against to be attracted to the sweet and wholesome and repelled by distemper is that selfishness if it is not then am i content to be misunderstood by all others so long as heaven will recognise the real love of humankind which inspires my wish to secure its untainted image in myself there must be a divine virtue in health seeing how disease is the heir of sin is not to sympathise then with depression to condone evil i leave the answer to profounder moralists than i content in default to admit that the misery which now befell me was the direct consequence of my wickedness papa said i tossing my head gave me to the beautiful duke and he took me in pledge of the love papa bears him will he come and fetch me do you think mamma i shall be glad to belong to one who does not have headaches whenever the sun shines she went quite white and broke into a torrent of french invective i do not understand these hard words i said is it so they pray in les madelonnettes my sauciness took her completely aback she stared at me for some moments in silence and then cried out suddenly god forgive you diane and the vile creature who has instructed you to this and your father who i am going at once to ask that she may be removed and she went out unconsciously consigning me to my fate and i never saw her again may heaven pardon her i was a little frightened though still defiant and i loitered about the house singing in my small voice which though never an organ has always been attractive so people say presently i remembered my duck stone and thought i would seek a case for it i was alone in the house for our one maid was gone marketing and the governess not yet arrived i went upstairs and rummaged in my mothers bureaux and by and by found a tiny silver vinaigrette into which the stone fitted beautifully then i went and sat in our little front garden which overlooked the road running to the downs and there rocked and mused amongst the flowers in a recovered temper i hoped my father would fetch me again i expected he would and so smiling and dreaming put up the vinaigrette half consciously and sniffed at it in a moment all sense of my surroundings went from me and sky and flowers and the grey downs were blended in a rapture of unreality i came to myself amidst an impression of jolting i thought it was night and that i was suffocating in my bedclothes i threw something from my face saw daylight and cried out incoherently immediately the jerky motion ceased and a horrible mask looked over and down at me it was fat and sooty with a handkerchief startlingly white by contrast going obliquely across its forehead stow that my pigeon it said hoarsely and shortly but at the first sound of its voice black inspiration had come upon me in a flood it was the sweep of my last nights adventure and he was bearing me away captive in the very little cart he had lost to my father whether he had driven that up sportingly to time or was merely escaping in it i never learned anyhow temptation had come to him recognising me lying there senseless and unprotected in the garden and moved perhaps by some sentiment between cupidity and revenge he had seized the opportunity to kidnap me he swung his fat legs over the sitting board and lifted me up from the midst of the empty bags where he had concealed me we were in the thick of a little wood and the pony was quietly cropping at the trackside grass the sense of loss and isolation the filth of my condition the terror of this startled awakening from happy dreams wrought a desperation in me that was near madness i screamed and reviled and fought the man opposed to my struggles just his two hands but their large persuasive strength unctuous as they were with soot was more deadly than any violence alas how the star that lit last nights heaven may be found fallen in the mud to day my alcide when i was quiet he put me up between his knees and smacked my face twice deliberately on either side not hard but in a lustful proprietary way blow for blow says he and lifted the bandage a little from his eye it was horribly swollen and discoloured knew how to handle his morleys he said dee seet now it be my turn what are you going to do with me i sobbed make ee my climbing boy he answered promptly and with a hideous grin youre my luck dee see say youre a gurl and ill he hissed in his breath and looked at me like a beast of prey there he ended get under and so muchs sniff at your peril some distant sound perhaps startled him he stuffed me into my former position and covering me again with the bags turned and clicked up his pony i lay in a half faint scarce daring to breathe so utterly had this monster succeeded in subduing me i cried incessantly but quietly hearing hour by hour the wheels grind under my ear till the sound and physical exhaustion induced in me a sort of delirium all this time the hope of pursuit and rescue never occurred to me i believe did they occur to proserpine having once felt the inhumanity of her sooty abductor but now all of a sudden the anguish grew unendurable i must move or die and at the moment i became conscious of the vinaigrette still clutched convulsively in my little fist sure never death offered a sweeter release very softly i raised it and found oblivion i might have sought to use it on my enemy and escape but alas the unsophisticated mind of the child could compass no such artifice we went on all day as i realised during the intervals of my waking by the unfrequented roads jolting loitering sometimes in lonely places halting to rest the pony the moral force my master as i must now call him put upon himself to avoid the wayside taverns is the most convincing proof of his tenacity at last a thicker darkness descended upon me lying there in hopeless apathy and night and sleep stretched their shroud over my miseries i awoke to rough movement and the sound of voices my master was carrying me into a little ill lighted cottage which stood solitary upon the edge of a common sharp and brilliant at no great distance in a soughing night sparkled the first lamps of a town i was borne into a tiny room where something covered with a cloth lay stretched upon a rickety table my master put me to the ground and stood back to regard me another man an expressionless sweep like himself but gaunt and bent shouldered joined silent issue in this scrutiny well said the latter at length theyll fit right enow but damn the exchange he stopped to cough rendingly then went on if you mean a deal im game for half a bull and theres my word on it but burn them duds johnny i wont take the risk on em my master considered mayhap youre right said he call it done the words were hardly out of his mouth before the other had jerked the cloth from the table and there underneath lay the dead stiff body of a little sooty boy his hands were griped at his chest as if in agony of its dematous swelling and his bared eyeballs and teeth were as white as porcelain i could not cry out or do anything but stare in horror while the gaunt man with some show of persuasion began to strip the little body of its coat and vest and trousers all its poor harness then in a sickness beyond words i comprehended i was to be made exchange for these foul vestments my own pretty silken toilet come along georgy wheedled his late master you wouldnt be so unhandsome as to deny a lady and she doing you honour to accept of them he rolled the body gently from side to side so coaxingly forceful and intent that someone bursting in upon him at the moment took him completely by surprise it was a wretchedly clad woman with resinous blots of eyes in a hungry face and a little black moustache over a toothless mouth strange contrast that was never more still than a crabs so hes dead you dog she cried seeming to feed on the words and you druv him to his death and may god wither you the bent man jumped like a vulture from the body and hopped and dodged keeping it between him and the woman you took the odds he cried coughing and kneading his cracking knuckles together you took the odds and you mustnt cry out like a woman if they gone agen ye i did no moren my duty as the lord hears me both on us said the woman well speak out he stuck said the sweep he stuck beyond reason it were a good ten inch square for all it were a draw in bend i were forced to smoke him but his lungs were that crowded there was no loosening the pore critter till they bust and let him down he were a good boy and worth a deal to me thats true put in my master a man though he be a flue faker dont cut off his nose to spite his face missus she made no answer staring fixedly at the corpse he were my seventh she said he made no cry when you come and took him away from me a yellow haired devil did he cry for his mammy chokin up in the dark there no said the man an unnatral son she threw up her hands with a frightful gesture i could have borne it if he had i could have borne it and cut my throat what were you doing with him the sweep hesitated but my master took the word from him its a question of his slops missus he jerked a thumb over his shoulder at me where i stood in the background paralysed with terror half a bull or nothing and you and him to share the woman put her arms akimbo ho indeed she said and where does he come in its my own smalls swore the man excited and truculent at once i wont bate an inch of em if im to die for it they were facing each other across the body like tom cats when my master pulled his friend aside and whispered in his ear amongst ladies and gentlemen said he and waited smiling and oily while the other fetched a black bottle from a cupboard the woman visibly relaxed at the sight of this its owner uncorked it and putting it to his mouth gurgled and smacked his black lips the deal passes cried my master and he snatched the bottle and handed it to the woman with an ingratiatory smile it was the psychologic moment which loosened and harmonised their tongues they waxed confiding and genial presently the woman commissioned politely to effect my transformation swaggered across to me with devil daring eyes and began roughly to pull off my clothes damn you she said with such a heat and violence of hate that my very sobs were withered in my throat come up you young limb what the deuce well cry quits for my georgy when the black smoke finishes your ladyship she never had had a doubt of the meaning of my presence in that vile den but my beauty and refinement and helplessness were only so many goads to her implacability her fingers were like rakes in my tender flesh she would have torn me with her teeth i believe if any had been left to her and i could only shrink and shiver under her hands terrified if they wrung so much as a gasp from me when i was stripped she seized a blunt dinner knife and sawed off all my golden hair close to my head a horrible experience the tears gushed silent down my cheeks they might have moved the heart of a wolf there she said when finished chuck us the duds and as she received them scrubbed my face with the filthy tatters before she vested me in them i had hoped perhaps until thus hopelessly transformed and then at once i hoped no more lasciate ogni speranza voi ch entrate i was behind the bars i wore the devils livery o my alcide pity this poor little proserpine so ravished from her plains of enna iii i escape hast thou the nerve to follow me my friend my martyrdom was severe but after all brief comfort thyself with the thought of the brilliant moth which is to emerge from this sad chrysalis my master was an itinerant sweep he jogged from town to village and from village to town in his little cart an untaxed bohemian and carried me always with him i had wild weepings at first and frantic schemes of escape and fits of sullen rebellion but they were all persuaded out of me presently by his thick black hand then as the past grew obscured behind me in ever densifying clouds of soot i came by degrees provisionally reconciled to my destiny and even canst thou believe it to some enjoyment of its compensations these were its changefulness its irresponsibility its little adventures that always had our bodily solace for their end we pilfered orchards snatched an occasional fat duckling from a pond smoked hives at night and carried away the dripping comb to eat under warm ricks in the moonlight and i had little to complain of ill treatment except when engaged professionally my masters ample receptivities laughed and grew fat on self indulgence liquor made him to my good fortune beatifically helpless rich meats paternally benevolent and even poetical it was only in business that he chastised with a large and incorruptible immorality i learned the jargon more readily than i did the practice of my abominable trade my first ascent of a chimney was a hideous experience an ascent into hell reversing all geographical orthodoxy but my particular devil was a moloch who would either be served by exaltation or vindicate his majesty in smoke and fire he was diplomatic to put me through my first paces so to speak in a dismantled vicarage that was in preparation for a new tenant he simply thrust an iron scraper into my hand and with the briefest directions drove me up i was refractory of course and at that without wordy persuasion he lit a brand of tow and applied it to my bare ankles the pain made me scream and writhe as he had philosophically counted upon its doing involuntarily i found myself ascending the flue as an awn of barley travels up inside ones sleeve the very ease of it made me rebel and i stopped immediately the brand below flaring at the end of a stick was lifted to spur me frenzied and sobbing i felt its hot rowel and struggled on the soot with which the chimney was choked began to fall upon me half stifling and filling my pockets then self preservation the great mother recalled to me my directions i looked up and saw a far eye of light denoting freedom and i began desperately to scrape clear my passage towards it letting always the black raff descend between my knees before i rose to take its place the eye enlarged and with it grew the dawn of a strange new enthusiasm i rose to it like a fish to the angle as my master had calculated i should these fiends bait their hooks with heaven suddenly the last feet were conquered and i emerged and saw below me a beautiful village prospect of trees and homesteads did i then sit there and weep on the contrary i was radiant account for it thou fripon as thou wilt thou knowest better the devil to applaud us than none at all i swear to thee that for the moment i coveted nothing but my masters admiring praise breathless as i was i bent and uttered down the chimney the shrill cry all up as he had bidden me a little strained laugh came back and with an oath of distant approval a command to descend but at that oddly enough the horror came i could not stomach the evil pit with its reeling return into a night from which i had mounted to heaven my knees trembled beneath me i sat crying and shivering while my master stormed thin gusty blasphemy up the flue at length i remembered my duck stone it was in my trousers pocket safe in its silver case which having dropped in the cart i had found again to my delight lying undiscovered amongst the soot bags i took it out let myself down gingerly to the arm pits clutched it tightly in my hand and sniffed but not vigorously i awoke to find myself sitting on the hearth and smiling foolishly into the frightened face of my master he recovered himself at the moment i did and was the implacable martinet again and at once why you cust little back slummer he said to let loose and think to take a chalk of me like that ill larn your nerves and he pulled me to my feet with his hand raised but thought better of it and gave me another chance chimney after chimney i must mount till fagged and heart broken i stood rebellious against his extremest persuasion and he was obliged with at least a few healing words of commendation to postpone the finish of his job so began this terror of my new life and so fortunately ended within a period that was not stretched beyond my endurance in this phase of it after the first there were no compensations but only degrees of misery if my master had ever thought to make capital out of my restoration he soon abandoned the idea as impracticable and devoted all his persuasion to turning me after the inhuman methods of his class to his best profit once i stuck tight in one of those clogged draw in bends which had been fatal to my predecessor i could move no way and in my struggles a little crossed stay of iron fixed in the chimney so pressed upon my breast as almost to stop my heart i was in a dreadful condition of terror and suffering and in the midst he lit some damp straw on the hearth to smoke me down the fumes took away my senses and so perhaps flattening the resistance of my lungs released me but i was in a sort of conscious delirium for days afterwards sometimes where he had got the worst of a housewifes bargaining he would shout to me working two thirds up pike the lew boy which in sweeps jargon meant leave the job unfinished to spite the old slut and then i would descend at once sometimes where a cluster of flues ran into one shaft i would come down into the wrong room causing consternation amongst its inmates but through all the idea of escape was very early a dead passion in me so utterly in soot and sexlessness was i lost to any sense of self identity so always homeless always enslaved always wandering i was one day some nine months after my abduction come with my master into the neighbourhood of streatham which is a little rural suburb of london reclaimed with other contiguous hamlets from the thick woods and gipsy haunted commons of that part of the country for some days past we had moved unhurriedly as was our wont through an atmosphere charged with a curious nervous excitement housewives avoiding contact with us as with possibly compromising emissaries of ill omen had vanished into their cottages as we came near tavern cronies grouped at tap doors were to be seen looking citywards until dark tramping up the long white roads drove them within with unreasonable frights of shapeless things approaching then sure enough the night horizon grew patched with flaring cressets and we learned that london was in the hands of a no popery mob its area of destruction spreading like an unchecked ink blot and we moving to meet it brought us presently involved in the fringe of the disorder protestant dulwich had sent its contingent to help petition parliament against the legalising of the poor harried catholics and had got its warrant as it chose to consider for an anti romish crusade and for that whether right or wrong i at least owe it gratitude we were rolling one afternoon along a certain knights hill or road which skirted a stretch of common when we came upon a great inn called the horns where was a considerable concourse of people assembled all in blue cockades and buzzing like a hive about to swarm the word most in the mouths of this draff was pope which at first we took to mean the vicar of rome but soon understood for the name of a young jesuit who was lately come as chaplain to a catholic family of the neighbourhood now such insolent defiance of the penal laws was not to be tolerated and so the loyal protestant burghers of dulwich were going with no disrespect to the family to cast down its graven images and hang up its chaplain for a scarecrow to all propagandists who should venture out of the holy see into our tight little island and here they were gathered to organise themselves the process taking good account of malt liquors and hence when they moved off we to cut the story short accompanied them walking foreseeing some prospect of swag in the crusade going in a pretty compact body with a great deal of howling and hymning such as that with which all conscripts either of the cross or guillotine are accustomed to stimulate one anothers courage and vanity we crossed a croksted lane and again a sweep of wild heath that spread towards the dense forests called northwood which fill all that shallow valley from sydenham wells on the north to penge common on the south and presently coming to the trees and entering a wide elegant clearing amidst them where the woods were banked behind and the ground dropped towards us in terraces on the highest we saw the house standing a great sunny block of brick and stone but shuttered now and apparently lifeless the mob at first knocked on the door with a diffidence inspired of its varnished and portly exclusiveness but provoking no response presently grew bolder and more clamorous still i believe its fervour would ultimately have wasted itself on this inflexible barrier had not my master with some disgusted expressions of contempt come to the front and taunted it on to a violence the more vicious because it was shamefaced under his stimulus then the panels were beginning to crack when in a moment the bolts flew and there stood in the opening a little sinister fellow in grey who asked us curt and ironic our business all but my master fell back before him though there were some broken cries touching the scarlet woman which the sweep took up the little man wrinkled his little acrid nose he was nobody it turned out but the scotch steward holding staunch to his post but he was cut and coloured like steel dye ask here for your doxy he said go back man and look where you left her in the tavern the sweep only half understanding spat out a mouthful of oaths we want that there pope he roared bring us to the black devil you after you sir answered the other politely my master looking horribly ugly repeated his demand well said the steward this is fair humours newcastle asking for coals the words were hardly out of him when my master smote him down and pushed into the house he gave a little quiver like unstrung wire and lay senseless the red running from his nostrils mon chri hast thou ever seen a pack of mongrels snarl aloof fearful and agitated about a dog fight and in a moment break in with coward teeth upon the conquered so over the body of the steward trampled this rabble blooded now at anothers expense and reckless in its consciousness of self irresponsibility they had found a champion to take the onus of this and all worse that might happen off their shoulders but they were destined to discover no further chestnuts for their catspaw the jesuit had fled it appeared with the rest of the family and so they must content themselves with wrecking the private chapel where the household was wont to practise its treasonable rites now my master who was eager after spoil sweating and toiling in the thick of the press left me unguardedly to my own devices and suddenly i found myself quite alone in a closet hung with vestments where there was a fireplace with an open bricked hearth having no signs of usage which immediately from habit caught my attention and straight at last god pitiful to his poor little derelict touched the cross on my breast and quickened inspiration in that where i had supposed all was dead i slid into the chimney and went up up like an eel in a well rising for air the sounds of destruction grew attenuated beneath me i smelt life and freedom and swarmed faster in my agony to attain them the chimney clean as at its building let down no token of my passage by it and in a few moments i emerged from the summit and tumbling into the cleft of a long double roof found myself face to face with a man who was there before me iv i fall into the hands of a collector at least i call him a man but o my alcide he was a marionnette his joints creaked all the bran in his body seemed to have been shaken down into his calves his hat supported itself on his ears and the top of his coat collar his sleeves were sacks his nose was nothing but a wen and being no better adapted to the burden of some enormous spectacles he wore had led his fingers to an incessant trick of adjusting those in their place he carried under his arm an immense folio with which as i appeared he aimed an agitated blow at me only to miss and fall forward on his face on the roof i instantly dodged past him and stood panting while he collected himself his glasses without which he was helpless had flown off and i saw his eyes which before had seemed to fill the whole field of the great lenses mere swollen slits like a pigs he groped about in the utmost consternation as he knelt pawing the tiles for his lost property who are you wait ill be with you he ejaculated excitedly as his bony hands swept the roof i backed out of their reach without replying at last he found what he sought and fitting the rims to his nose rose to his feet and stared at me hey what he said a sweep well and blew out a rumbling grunt which he checked suddenly as if he had turned a cock on it a moment after he put his hand into his pocket and fetching out a dirty fragment of biscuit held it to me persuasively as one might lure a colt seeing however that i still held away from him he threw the biscuit down in a pet and stood to canvass me in a baleful manner what do you want he snapped out suddenly how did you find your way here still with my eyes on him i answered in a husky whisper dont you know up the closet chimney ay he said dropping his own voice in tacit response to the warning in mine but not to sweep it no i said to escape by it his hand went up to his glasses he glared at me through their restored focus watchful of him lest before i could explain he should silence me provisionally with some stunning blow i ventured to approach him a little nearer theres killing i whispered going on down there a poor old man in a grey coat he started violently and pulling his jaw down uttered a sort of mechanical crow and let it go again grey he muttered its the steward then he didnt give me away did he i shook my head dumbly he was readjusting his glasses to meet the answer ay he gulped swallowing with relief poor mackenzie and to think that for all his loyalty he must burn i whispered why must he because he said he wasnt of the faith this uncouth creature was getting horrible to me i suppose he read my repulsion in my face for his own suddenly grew agitated and menacing are you thinking of betraying me he said i retreated before him working my foolish young arms keep away i cried i dont even know who you are o he said and stopped and was at his spectacles again then suddenly he held up his hand hark he said i listened far and faint below through the hubbub of destruction came wafted at intervals the name of the chaplain pope the cynosure of all this iconoclastic zeal yes its you they want i said and you he retorted fiercely are pointing the way you little its a lie i cried vehemently i came up here to escape from them like you he looked at me doubtfully you said you didnt know who i was no more i did i protested till you told me i told you he cried humph and he glared at me sourly sit down then he said and hold your tongue till i speak to you again it was the wise policy certainly he squatted himself between me and the chimney and we dwelt in silence while the mob wreaked its blind vengeance below i was in a dreadful fright all the time every moment i expected to hear my masters voice boom up the flue by way of which i had climbed and desperate as i was i devised the naughty expedient to curry favour if necessary by claiming the credit of having run this fugitive to bay it was a base thought perhaps though natural under the stress of the occasion chiefly however i regret it because it was uncalled for and it is aggravating to burden ones conscience with unprofitable frailties the monster i had run from was never in point of fact to cross my path again probably thinking i had fled from the house he went hunting counter and so put ever a wider interval between us it was not after all so very long before the racket of despoliation down below died away and we heard the mob clatter from the house and go streaming and singing across the common in its retreat i believe that either realising how in my master it had evoked a demon to its own legal discomfiture or perhaps frightened by the bugbear of some reported troop of militia assembling in the neighbourhood it was suddenly decided to temper protestantism with prudence and so dissipating itself with great speed and piety left the building to a solitude more dense by contrast than before it was not however until every whisper and echo had long ceased that i durst let myself be persuaded of the reality of my reprieve and when at last i did the joy that grew minutely in my heart came near to upsetting my reason my excitement hungered for something on which to flesh itself i rose and went up and down quickly and softly in the space left me seeking the means to some larger action then i saw the great folio lying discarded on the roof where the chaplain had dropped it and all of a sudden felt itching to know what it could contain to tempt this man to burden himself with its care in so anxious a situation he sat with his face in his hands or cuffs rather he appeared to be in a sort of uncouth trance i stole very noiseless by him and unobserved as i supposed had actually lifted the book when he started awake in a moment hey he cried thats mine i was going to bring it to you i said he scuttled towards me on his hands and toes and snatching the book from me squatted down hugging it and glaring at me in a sort of dumb malevolence i had no retort for such rudeness i stood crimsoning under my black a moment then in default of a better answer began to cry he was not the least moved the ill conditioned boor but he was disturbed by the noise ur rh he bullied thatll do do you hear indignation gave me decision i turned my back on him where are you going he cried i stalked on without a word no you dont he said scrambling up and he followed and caught hold of my jacket let me go i cried struggling my master will be looking for me o he said quite suddenly agitated come here and ill show you a picture i let myself be drawn reluctant is it of the scarlet woman i said he started and roared the scarlet then conscious of his mistake dropped his voice to a panic whisper theres no such moth said he if you mean heraclia dominula the scarlet tiger come and ill show you one he persuaded me to sit by him on the roof slope and gingerly opened the book away from me dont touch he said its called fasti sanctorum natur cultoribus proprii is that latin i asked yes he growled but he looked at me rather curiously it means the naturalists calendar of the saints how did you know o i know i said he turned some leaves while scanning me covertly and sourly and i exclaimed becomingly over their contents on each was a picture of a saint hastily illuminated and of many insects most beautifully coloured after nature the saints it is true were pigmies and the moths life size but it was through the former that this uncivilised churchman justified himself in a secular hobby he was as i came to learn presently a crazy collector of the small game of fields and hedges and had only drifted into the church after a particularly fine specimen of the painted lady or some such immoral creature i tried to appreciate in order to conciliate him but i could see that my flattery was not expert or perhaps fulsome enough for his taste presently on the score that my mere neighbourhood threatened the lustre of his illuminations he shut the book and placed it discontentedly by his side did you do it all by yourself i asked ay he grunted and why did you bring it up here when he smacked his great hand on his knee interrupting me if you havent the intelligence to see sooner part with my blood to those vandals there let the book alone and tell me what brought you here ive said already i was escaping from my master a master sweep yes now he said how did you know this was latin i hung my head come he threatened youd best tell me i was considering what i should do i reddened excited under my mask and rose to my feet again after all these months of obliteration a wonderful thought was beginning to dawn in me the thought of my sex as a possible factor in my redemption for how long my dear friend had i not lost the art to play it for the value of so much as a sugar plum and what was there now to prevent me from reassuming that charming confidence in men which so disarms them alas it was a vain recovery here a waste of art on a material no more responsive to it than a pulpit hassock how did you know he repeated angrily because i whispered blushing and lingering over the sensation i felt i was about to produce because father i am a little daughter of the church he had been gnawing his knuckles as he bent his morose brows on me and at my words stopped suddenly his great teeth bared like a dog looking up from a bone i am the child of a great gentleman i was stolen from my parents i said and clasped my hands to him i am not a boy at all but a girl he leapt up as if i had struck him how dare you he shouted then choking in another hoarse reaction to panic how dare you try to impose upon me im not i cried in a childish fury of chagrin over his insensibility its true every word my mother was a sister of les madelonnettes and i was stolen from her and i want to be sent back i did not in truth save in so far as that way only lay my chance of restoration to my darling father but the point was inessential the priests eyes dilated monstrosities devoured me through their lenses les madelonnettes the magdalens he muttered amazed and frowning his hand caressing his chin grated on the stubble of it come he said brutally im an old bird to be caught by chaff confess to me if youre a catholic you wretched little sinner i wanted nothing better this sacrament of penance must convince and win him in a moment my young elastic soul had leapt the dark interlude which divided me from my past and my little feet were tripping once more in fancy down the royal princes table i fell on my knees say your confiteor he commanded harshly i repeated it without a mistake humph said he what are you waiting for i told him my whole story he listened to it after the first abstractedly with one eye caressing his abominable book at the end he gave me absolution canvassing me distastefully as he pondered the penance presently he spoke i order you he said twenty ave marias and to return to your master i jumped to my feet my master the sweep i cried certainly he replied stubbornly you were obviously the foundling of providence which has elected this honest tradesman to be your foster father but my mother i choked it is her judgment he said to remain and mingle her weeping with the ashes of this sacrifice in the hospital of which her crimes have made her an inmate he had listened with his elbows as i supposed i recognised the hopelessness of my task very well i said i daresay he has finished with the steward by now i will go and tell him what you say and i made for the chimney he was after me in a moment at a gallop stop he cried what do you mean that your master was one of this rabble one the worst of them all i answered it was he knocked down the poor grey gentleman and the last i heard of him was crying for you he released me to throw up his hands the intolerance of these heretics he cried stop dont go i withdraw my pronouncement you shall name your own penance i breathed quickly standing before him father that is soon done i will go with you with me with me he complained stamping distracted where to anywhere from here i pleaded you cant stop the whole countrys up and a second time if they come youll be caught snorting with agitation he took off his spectacles to wipe them its quite impossible he said i know of only one asylum beyond and that with a quick little snatch i ravished the glasses from his hand and running away with them hid behind a chimney for a minute or two he raved round stumbling and grabbing at the air and finally tripped over his book and subsided quite prostrate upon the roof little sweep he panted in a trembling voice my daughter child of magdalen where are you i held my breath and he went on in broken sentences come back give me my glasses where are you i believe all you say what will you give me up and the calendar unfinished then as i still did not answer holy saints the little devil has hobbled me and i shall be caught and martyred a longish pause in manus tuas domine com i wonder if in paradise the scarce copper hm he began to gnaw his knuckles with a sort of pleased abstraction over the thought it would never do i came out of my hiding will you take me with you i repeated o its you he cried with a start where are my glasses in my hand will you return them to me will you let me go with you scandalous i will carry the book pooh i will walk behind pish if anything happens to me then fah he interposed and then added what could happen to you do you suppose i shall stay in these clothes i said i shall return to be a girl and what am i to do then without someone to protect and help me back to my parents thats nothing to me he said good bye said i he scrambled to his feet with a roar give me back my glasses i stood quite still making no sound he thought i had really gone this time and began taking little strides hither and thither and throwing his arms about suddenly he stopped sweating with agitation are you there he said i did not answer he hopped from leg to leg pulling with one hand at the other as if at a tight glove child he cried youre a good child a perfect little sweep you shall come do you hear if we ever get off this roof well escape by the woods nobody will see us there together and i can catch some arguses lasiommata geria that will be in season v i am carried away as a specimen the very rudeness of the creature nominated by fate to be my warden gave me a feeling of confidence here was a shepherds dog ugly enough to frighten away the wolf himself should he cross us in the shape of my master i thrilled to have secured his promise which for all his boorishness and perhaps because of it i had faith in the dark pit was already half bridged in my foolish young imagination and i dreamed of alighting on the farther side to what not indeed to the old melancholy life of the cottage near the steine for all my sad experience i never entertained that prospect for one moment i was but now in my eleventh year yet some instinct informed me that the dead amongst whom surely i must be written should not return if they would avoid the mortification of home truths that broken threads cannot be made one again and leave no scar perhaps the spirit of vagabondage even had entered a little into my blood in any case it was the breezy security of my fathers not my mothers protection to which i hurried in thought with this reverent cur for escort as for him accounting for his presence on the roof he growled out to me once after this in order to still my inquisitive importunity while i still held the spectacles in pledge that he had indeed taken the alarm that morning with the rest of the family to whom he was spiritual director but that remembering his book left behind he had insisted upon quitting the general flight and returning for it with what awkward results for the steward had appeared though as a fact i believe the poor man recovered later now i was to understand he had the intention if he could make good his escape to seek asylum while the storm blew over with a lady a co religionist and connection of his patrons who lived distant a two days journey on foot and so having grudgingly informed me he subsided into his unsavoury self and would speak no more i did not much care once being put in possession of the facts and the chances they afforded me no one it was evident guessed at our retreat and for the rest i was content to bide my time and the opportunity i foresaw of impressing even this dull animal with a revelation of the pretty romance he had undertaken to squire evening fell and we were still sitting there not a footstep sounded in the house beneath us not a voice but the birds came from the garden presently emboldened by the quiet i went softly climbing and investigating finding the trap door by way of which the chaplain had ascended and peeping between the gables and over the roof ridges so far as i could see nothing human was stirring in all the placid demesne the sundial on the lawn the arbour in the corner the brook embroidering the low trees like a ribbon run through lace were things inanimate in a painted picture but there was something in their voiceless watchfulness that made me long to open the door as it were and run into the air i was not born like my mother for cloisteral seclusions i was passing my companion once soft footed when he startled me by demanding suddenly and savagely whats your name diana please i answered in a flutter diana please he protested crossly fah diana please dont please and he subsided into himself again but he had christened me i had gone lacking nothing but a name of my own hitherto and here was one given me apt and pat from that moment i became diana please the very sense of its possession made me forward arent we safe now i said or are you going to stop here all night he looked up at me hurriedly and scowling motioned me away from him then without a word he snatched his book rose and striding to the trap door began to descend i followed him closely the way led by a flight of steps in the walls to a cupboard under the main stairs where they rose from the hall we emerged from darkness into a wide echoing twilight for the first time the thought of my master secreted somewhere watchful and waiting for me sent my spirits reeling i slunk against the wall where was it demanded my companion brusquely i stared at him he stamped his foot so that the noise resounded horribly through the empty house the steward he cried where did they leave him by the door i whispered trembling out there it was still ajar he hurried to it looked out went out returned after a minute or two and slammed the oak thunderously there are trails of blood down the steps he has been removed or has removed himself he said and began immediately to ascend the stairs o where are you going i cried fearfully to bed he snapped to bed i clung to his coat tails there was a sort of nightmare struggle between us up as far as the first landing there he rent himself away and leaving me sprawling banged and locked himself into a room i crouched on the mat outside sobbing and imploring what am i to do where am i to go he answered not a word to my pleading presently i heard him snoring and would you believe it the gross carnival of sound was heavenly music in my ears in all that vast loneliness it was my only human stay and comfort o my alcide to think of thy diane owing her reason to the grunting of a hog it was a terrible night i dared not move scarcely breathe but fear and exhaustion at last overcame me and i slept i awoke to sweet soundless daylight the look and smell of sunshine restored me in a moment to myself i had not been disturbed the house was utterly abandoned i arose resolved at once to put into effect the plan i had formed a little memory of something i had noticed yesterday was urging me i fled softly upstairs signs of the raid met me at every turn broken crucifixes torn vestments scattered hosts up and down they lay trodden into dirty rubbish by the swarming footsteps there had been i believe no secular looting unless as was probable by my master who would be sure on that account to have withdrawn himself remote from consequences i had nothing to fear from him i looked for a room where i had seen some childrens clothes scattered and finding it still undisturbed quickly selected from among the litter the simplest outfit i could adapt in mind to my figure a common watch lay ticking on a table i examined it scarce five oclock lingered hesitated and left it where it was i had not yet come to thieve even had it been less bulky for my juvenile fob hastily i snatched soap and towels from a washing stand and holding the clothes so as not to soil them against my own stole out there was not water enough in all the house for my cleansing my spirit rushed to the little river i had seen gleaming under the trees at the back of the hall i found a low window unlatched it and dropped into the garden a light fog was spread abroad which dripping from the trees alarmed me with a thought of unseen things moving near but presently a bird piped close above my head with a note of reassurance and i slipped on and made my way stealthily towards the river until i heard it gurgling and in a moment later i came upon it there with only the wild things in the grass to scare my modesty i made my bath the ecstasy of it as all that foul husk slipped off and was carried from me down the stream the joy to recover my near forgotten self the thing of pink and pearl from its long mourning the wonder and the strangeness of that reincarnation to a maturer estate i was not like the sleeping beauty to renew my old but to awake to a newer self a different from the diana from whom i had departed nine months before it seemed incredible and still when i was washed as white as a lamb i must sluice and relather and sluice again to convince myself that no stain of my horrible livery remained then at last i came out and dried and dressed myself hurriedly and so being secure sat awhile on the bank to let my hair sun it had never been but roughly clipped since that first cruel shearing and now was down to my collar thick and golden i could see it in the water glass when i bent over reflected like a dim glory and i nodded and laughed to the picture in my delight and was only sorry presently to bind it about gipsy fashion with the silk handkerchief i had brought down with me for the purpose but time was moving and so must i be i rose and returned to the house i heard a shuffling on the stairs as i re entered by the window and in a moment tripping lightly came upon father pope descending he had his great book under his arm and he tiptoed with a sort of scared effort to hush the creaking of his tell tale shoes he gave a guilty start on seeing me standing smiling before him and stumbled and caught himself erect by the banisters frowning at me i did not speak i stood dumbly to let him canvass the transformation but the creature had no nerve of sentiment in all his dull anatomy what do you want he said who are you i could see he only fenced with the truth to recover himself i dropped him a pretty little curtsey diana please i said i was in trepidation that he would deny me as i was convinced he had designed to give me the slip and though for policys sake i must propitiate him i hated the creature for his treachery but despite his being a jesuit he was too crude a wit for the double part humph he growled i was wondering what had become of you which no doubt was true enough he glowered at me dislikingly then bidding me wait for him stalked off into the gloom of passages from which he presently re emerged with a bagful of bread and biscuit ends which he had collected i have no money he said you must manage with your share of these or nothing if you look for better it must be out of my company what does for you will do for me father i said meekly but nothing would disarm his churlishness thats a matter of opinion said he i could do very well without you to begin with i dropped my eyes now then bestir yourself he bullied if youre to come at all come before the worlds awake he strode off and i followed through shuttered glooms and along silent corridors to a distant part of the building emerging from a door in which we found ourselves in a close shrubbery walk going up towards woods very soon the comforting screen of trees was about us and the peril of watchful enemies surpassed we pushed on without rest or pause my spirit and my feet danced together it was all so free and fragrant and the rapture of my new emancipation was like a second sight fays and sweet things seemed to melt before me round green corners or overhead among the branches leaving a scent of the unknown world in their footsteps i sang low i laughed to the birds i seemed incapable of weariness and indeed my late training served me in good stead for this clerical caliban had no mercy on my tender limbs he desired only the least excuse to shake me off and i would not gratify him with one all day he led me south by wood and common avoiding the living places where men were like to be alert on the new crusade we hardly exchanged a word as he swung on with the gait of a camel but in the end it was he who succumbed first the weight of his great folio crushed him that is the truth he called a halt in an unfrequented copse and flung himself exhausted on the grass go find yourself a lodging he said i will sleep here i did not dare cross him i crept away but only so far as a low thorn tree mounting into which i could easily hold him in view but i need not have feared the poor wretch was sunk in fatigue and incapable of further effort he had an odious night i am sure while i from my late habits slept as securely as in an arm chair early next morning we were afoot again my companion mouldy cheeked and limping greeted me with a scowl what have i not suffered of humiliation as a priest he said to have thee breathing in the same wood the world must have been an insufficient dormitory to this misogynist at noon having wandered for hours through forest so green so profound that its deer haunted vistas seemed the very byways to the infinite we came out suddenly when half faint with toil and hunger upon the foot of a low hill on whose summit was a queer octagonal stone tower crowned with a dome like a pepper box my companion sputtered anathema upon seeing it and stood stock still what is it father i whispered creeping up to him weve overshot the mark thats all he growled conceding a point to civility heres shole beyond and i aimed at no farther than wellcot herring well we must go over as the shortest way and he began to mount the slope i followed him emboldened to ask whats this were coming to ruperts folly he answered viciously old lousys spy house whats he i asked he gave a rude laugh hes an itch on the skin of my lord that he cant scratch away and with these coarse enigmatic words he motioned me to fall behind the tower sprouted clean from the grass reaching and skirting it i had occasion barely to notice a figure seated under a low door against its farther angle before the liveliest prospect below engaged all my attention the hill went down on this side into a wide valley in the midst of whose trees and pastures dominating a tiny village with forge and tavern stood a great old house of grey stone on the green before as we could see was a merry making sports and dancing and long tables spread and a vast broaching of casks and the villagers in their ribbons were all there so that my eyes and my heart danced to see them but my companion stood looking down with a most venomous expression fah a nest of heretics he muttered what golden calf are they met to worship the red herrings spawn good sir said the voice of the creature behind us i turned and stared at him for the first time he sat sucking at a long pipe at the open door of the tower the filthiest little scrub you could imagine his face was like old crumpled parchment his crafty eyes floated in rheum and he scratched a dusty tag of beard down upon his breast as he leered at us what lousy john said the priest is it our heir of all the herrings come of age ay said the old wretch nephew salted you know him ay ay you should be the man pope of course by your rudeness go down to your whore of babylon sir she mingles with yonder company youd have me into the range of your burning glass hey said the priest with a snort between laughter and contempt the other smoked on unperturbed all in good time priest he said im not for anticipatin the devil is that his scriptures youre a carryin to propagate my companion uttered a furious exclamation and hugging his book shuffled out of range most like a woman he could not bear to have his spiteful humour returned upon him i understood nothing of all this of course and was standing bewildered when the old obscenity beckoned me see he said taking his pipe from his mouth and pointing with the scarlet tongue of it a beautiful landscape aint it yes i faltered ah said he ill tell you just you mind i dont take a many into my confidence its the beauty of pain child a local inflammation in the system i murmured something and he chuckled they call this tower ruperts folly he said privately and i laugh settin up here in my shell dye think theyd laugh too if they guessed where the smut came from that blasted of their crops from you i whispered he bent over and pointed upwards for the first time i noticed that the muzzle of a telescope projected from the little dome on the roof while i was gazing i suddenly felt my wrist in the clutch of his apish claw hush he said its there i gathers my star powder and discharges it where i will im briareus the last of the uranids left behind to rack the world to all eternity for its presumption he let me go squinting and nodding at me i backed from him in horror nothing was plain to me but that here was one of those astrologic demons who delight to bring heaven close that they may measure our remoteness from it and to cast away poor souls amidst the eternal silences that he seemed to rave was nothing such inhumanity is in itself a madness ay he chuckled hugging himself in a secret way you didnt expect that did you you must be a god to lust in pain why lord child the earth would be drab all over but for its galls and breakings see where ive set a withered crop among the green see where ive teased the soil to scarlet a blazing core of fever i know the world the wanton so long as she can cover her cancer with a ribbon shell smile by and by i shall set a spark to the west and burn up the days rubbish look when the sun drops and youll see it a little point of white and afterwards a bonfire i backed still farther lord he cried doubling with laughter what headaches ive projected into their beer barrels down there what poison laid on the lasses lips i shall have some fine incense of sufferin risin to me to morrow what youre goin are you down into the fire hey a pretty little faggot to mend its blazin and he kneaded his hands rapturously between his knees i saw the priest had disappeared over the crest and half crying pursued him he turned on me angrily as i came up now said he adjusting his spectacles to glare through them if that old carrion speaks truth i come to an end with you he gripped my shoulder hold your tongue dyou hear not a word of us till we find out how the land lies he dropped his hold on a sudden thought to my elbow and with a muttered menace marched me down the hill at the bottom in a little lane with hedges to screen it from the view beyond we came unexpectedly upon a lady gathering wild flowers she started violently upon observing my companion and dropped her nosegay he accosted her with a manner of gruff civility and here it was somehow that as they broke into talk of an urgent nature we got separated vi i am pinned out the festivities were to celebrate the majority of the viscount salted only son to hardrough fourth earl of herring baron rowe of shole and wellcot herring warden of the cinque ports and official verderer of the forest of down the lady sophia rowe aunt to the young gentleman had driven over from wellcot her estate in tail female and distant from shole by road seven miles to lend her saintly countenance to the gathering and it was she whom father pope steering his course erroneously for shole instead of wellcot herring had fortuitously encountered culling wild flowers in her brothers lordlier demesne the lady sophia was unlike her orthodox kinsman a convert to the catholic from the established church and within her limits and because of them a zealous fanatic in her one saw acutely demonstrated the denaturalising power of creed gentle as a dove by temperament there was no crime but self destruction which she would not have gloried in to justify hers she would have thought the world well lost to save her own soul colourless as that dear little article was though she was modesty incarnate her self importance in this respect was amazing she schemed through all the virtues for the apotheosis of lady sophia and she called her scheming the vindication of truth which she held to be a romish monopoly she would have made me a nun as part of it and taken all the credit with heaven i can hardly regret that she was foiled i love truth as well as any woman only being a woman contre cur and not a saint for me it must be coloured and in the newest shades to ask me to love it for its own sake is to ask me to be a dowd and for all my respect for lady sophia i have never fancied a heaven of dowds when we alighted on her she was by great good chance withdrawn from her company and communing with nature for relaxation flowers to her were sanctified of the altar so bringing her faith and her inclinations into line she was terribly agitated over her encounter with father pope whom she knew and over his peril which she exaggerated the shock of intolerance was hardly extended to shole but she had heard by private despatch of her dulwich kinsfolks flight and of the chaplains eccentric desertion and all the day had tormented herself with fears of the fate which he had invited to befall him now while they were engaged in earnest discussion eschewing for the moment all thought of me i was driven by curiosity to steal down the lane till through a gap in the hedge i was able to observe at close hand the lively scene that was enacting on the green below it had certainly looked prettier from the hill i saw links of red faced oafs sway roaring across the turf and whip themselves in mere drunken impulse about any mock bashful hoyden who stood feigning unconsciousness in their path i saw blowzed over fed women dragging squalling babies struggle vainly to be included in the amorous capture and when they failed or were ignored vindicate their outraged respectability in coarse recriminations i saw farmers seated under trees weep fuddled tears because they could hold no more and stuffed children crying for nothing so much as breath i had been drawn as was natural to me by the bait of gaiety and life and this was my reward the ground between the booths was strewed with trampled fragments of bread and meat and sodden with rejected ale it was a fair with all the licence of a day gathered into an hour i dont know how long i had been standing absorbed in contemplation of this gehenna and of the stately mansion across the green on whose terraces a gay company gathered to see the beasts feed was clearly distinguishable when a sound of hoofs coming up the lane behind me brought me to myself and almost immediately three horsemen with very flushed faces rode into view and perceiving me halted one was a fox featured gentleman in fulvous cloth one good humoured and quiet wore a grey coat and the third was resplendent all over and as drunk as chloe he at the first sight of me tumbled rather than dismounted from his horse and forsaking the reins which the grey gentleman caught came staggering upon me hey my vitals he lisped whom the devil have we here he was quite young and like a pretty toy with a spangled coat in the maccaroni club style a great bow at his neck and ribbons to his knees but he frightened me with the stare in his glazed eyes and as he advanced i backed into the hedge i was only looking i fluttered i didnt mean any harm please let me go harm he exclaimed with a tipsy crow o but youre trespassing missy and must give an hic count of yourself come long now before my lord i saw the eldest of the three regarding us from his saddle with a sort of mordant humour and the sudden recognition of his state made my heart leap red and lank jawed and vicious he sat watching us as a fox might watch his cub negotiating the helpless struggles of a lamb he always had a fine appetite for such occasions and could sin very sweetly by proxy could hardrough wounds my lord cried the boy is this a larsh surprise for me youve ranged besh preshent of all the day come cock horse child and well kiss a riding he put an arm about me for all my distress the musky contact of him so precious after my long degradation seemed half to drug me from resistance i struggled feebly to push him away get on with your gallophic said he addressing his companions knowingly ill follerer by m by come salted cried the grey gentleman suddenly in a laughing half vexed way remember whats due to your guests child now and to be come along and ride yourself sober as you engaged shober nunky shober you cake sputtered the fool shober nough yourself to wat me go on and break my neck hey my lord he leered tipsily to the earl his father who grinned and blinked his red eyes let him be george said the nobleman damme the boys not fit to ride a broomstick youre precious anxious for the gipsy brother id as lief you was concerned for your nephew and so i am says the other hotly tis foul so to take advantage of a stranger and a child call your cub off sir says he if im not to take a whip to him he gathered his reins in and twitched his heels he was bronzed and comely a man of thirty or so younger by ten years than the earl he the latter had turned quite white a frost seemed to have pinched his cheeks in another moment i believe he would have drawn his riding switch across the handsome face but in that moment i was aware of a lady hurrying up and i broke from my captor and fled to meet her help me i cried dont let him hurt me she received me very kindly she was a tall and colourless figure gentle in mien but with a bad complexion the lady in short in whose company i had left father pope hardwick george she whispered in an outraged voice the earl pushed up to her with a snigger there sophy said he what are you doin here but im glad youve come is this here your protge well take the little baggage away that was near bringing us to words about her words she said this child o he exclaimed thats all one come boy she detained him some minutes murmuring to him as he bent down at the end he rose grinning at me what says he the sly old crow be sure the little sweep wasnt fathered by a black cassock before you adopt her she started back flushing scarlet hardrough she said i ask you to go on well i will said he with a little breathless laugh and carry your secret sister safe in my keepin he half wheeled and in an ironic voice summoned the young viscount the boy got to his horse as sulky as sin in another minute the three gentlemen were ridden out of sight the moment they had disappeared the lady turned to me why didnt you keep by your friend she asked rather sharply from what he tells me you are in need of one i hung my head and broke into sobs she was softened immediately there she said i didnt mean to be harsh but discretion was so necessary will you come with me i am the lady sophia rowe and we can discuss your case in safety at home but every instant means peril and we must hasten i suffered her to hurry me up the lane her gait took no grace from urgency being awkward as with most over tall women and the worse to view because she was reckless how she raised her skirts in a little we came round a curve that swept beyond the limits of the green and here under some trees we found her coach which had been ordered round earlier with the priest and his great folio ensconced glowering in it in a moment we were in and rolling along quiet country roads the noise of the fairing died behind us the world of new peace and beatitude lay before for seven miles we sped soberly on deeper and deeper into the pleasant hush that was broken only by the incessant confidential murmuring of my companions at last taking a road high above a little village bowered in trees we turned between beautiful scrolled gates into a drive that seemed to me to pierce gardens as enchanting as the hanging ones of babylon there were soft lawns and placid groves of timber with lofty rookeries there were vivid parterres and terraces stooping to blue depths wheredown a little silver brook bubbled through mists of foliage there were rose bowers and great jars like plentys horn brimming petunias there was a mossy fountain with lilies and goldfish and a baby triton in the midst spurting a jet to heaven there were grassy walks and beyond their vistas the eternal solace of distance and dominating all there was the house at least it seemed less to command than to partake of the serenity of which it was the habitable nucleus the human nest in the garden it stood before us not suddenly but in quiet revelation a simple old structure of red brick unlaboured with ornament unweighted of stone a pleasant home for happiness set on a wide level platform of grass and gravel my eyes had hardly accepted it before my heart we alighted into a fragrant hall and madam led me at once into a large low room with windows bent upon a heavenly prospect of woods and meadows and there bidding me await her until she could come and talk with me shut me in and withdrew i had not stood many minutes in a silent dream of wonder and expectation when the door opened softly again and a little girl stole in she was about my own age or somewhat older and very dark and pretty but with foolish large eyes like a dogs for some moments she stared at me wondering without a smile then came and touched my hand madam sent me she said i live here i am her adoption child are you come to stay i shook my head bewildered o she whispered i hope so i have no little friend at all and you are so pretty i have golden hair i said we cant all be the same but yours at least is very curly what is your name patience grant she said my mother died in the convent and i have no father i am not allowed to play with the village children what is your name i told her diana please it is a nice name she said did your mother too die in the convent i am very happy here but i shall be happier if you come lady sophia had entered softly while she spoke hush patty said she with a smile and run away now the child went looking wistfully back ah mignonnette ma petite jamais mmorable toi que jaime sans discontinuer how wert thou to me from the first the most attached of little dogs madam drew me into a window and looked earnestly into my eyes as she held me father pope entered and stood near my morose and baleful inquisitor do you like my home she said in her level toneless voice the labour of lifting it seemed always constitutionally beyond her i clasped my hands o madam i said i could be a very good catholic here she smiled in a surprised way then looked grave i waited in a fever of expectation for her to speak again i had already decided that i would wish to be adopted like patience in whom i seemed to foresee a little adoring vassal so welcome after my own long slavery and that i must be adroit to gain my point brighthelmston with its questionable potentialities had darkened in contrast with this paradise i felt even that it would not be good for me to return there that i was destined for a virtuous if not a devout life it is no contradiction that i had not thought so an hour before our moral development is intermittent its phases of growth are inspirations of adaptation to circumstance a fever made of francis of assisi a saint out of a profligate these high lawns had revealed to me the pit from which i had escaped lady sophia looked very sweet and grave or anywhere i hope she said faith is not a question of surroundings i was not so sure of that but i held my tongue hanging my head let me see your face she insisted and put her thin hand under my chin it is a pretty and an innocent one she declared how came you child in the position in which father pope found you i told her how i had been stolen by the sweep and had escaped from him rather than seem to concur in the violence offered to my religion it was an ingenious and a courageous act she said gently kindling was it not father the bear snorted dissent or commendation it was all one ask her about her mother he growled true said the lady with a gesture of involuntary repulsion for which she the moment after atoned with a caress she had been a sister in the hospital of st magdalen father pope tells me she said very low she had returned there to expiate her her no i broke in you told me so roared the priest i didnt i said half crying you were looking at your book all the time i confessed madame sophia could not restrain a smile fie father she said i admit it does not sound the least probable part of the childs experiences but she sobered again in a moment she did not return she asked then she is dead i whispered after all i believed it was true that she could not have survived the wreck of all things which my abduction must have meant to her the gentlewoman gave a gasp of pity and self rebuke and enfolded me in her arms forgive me she cried o i was cruel the poor lost lamb so white so helpless so delivered to the wolves but she bethought herself where was this and your unhappy father he had taken me to brighthelmston i stammered he was not of our religion of any he made me dance before the pretty prince and would have given me to him but that the sweep whom he fought stole me out of revenge first the priest and the lady exchanged looks am i justified she asked the peril the iniquity o surely father surely he shrugged his shoulders write to the magdalens first said he and verify it she thought a little then addressed me again and if i do would you like to make your home here in the meantime diana the strain had been very severe i fell on my knees before her weeping i knew from what my governess had once told me that les madelonnettes must confirm the worst of my story o madam i cried if you would train me in goodness and piety she kissed me then looked up her immobile face quite transfigured perhaps she thrilled some day perhaps some day to fill the place and vindicate the vows of the poor weak apostate who gave you life write to the magdalens growled father pope vii i am put away in camphor i cannot hold lady sophia altogether irresponsible for the loss to the calendar of a very promising saint i entered wellcot enthusiastic to devote the rest of my days to the practices of piety and self renunciation and i was moved to this resolve not least by the example my benefactress seemed to offer me of the most perfect detachment from the world alas i was too soon to realise how the chaste aloofness of a mind may mean only a vanity so sensitive and an irritability so nervous as for ever to be on their defence against unwarranted approaches i had thought her serenely above the littlenesses of life and all the time she only sat on a level with them but apart in alarm lest her moral distinction should be held to justify familiarities with her social the folded wings of piety may be used to conceal some uncelestial humours i had supposed at least that passion was the remotest from her temperament and there even i was wrong as you shall learn she wrote in accordance with father popes advice to the superioress of the sisterhood to which my mother had belonged i confess for all my confidence i awaited the answer in some trepidation it fulfilled however when it came my best expectations the charitable mother confirmed the story of her former postulants recreancy and flight with a profligate man of fashion whither she had never concerned herself to inquire the woman in leaving the convent gates she said had died to her to all save the lord of hell who she was rejoiced now to hear had so soon claimed and secured his own she would command a magnificat that night in praise of the eternal chastity and there her interest in the matter ended she wrote in french with much pharisaic unction which betrayed nevertheless its underlying gall madam quoted to me only so much i found an opportunity later to read the whole as appeared to justify her in the course upon which she was resolved my present adoption that was to say by her for the sake of my soul i was becomingly meek and grateful in placing myself unreservedly in her hands and in this manner began my self obliterating martyrdom of five long years in the placid nunnery of wellcot for a time i was very happy until a ripening intelligence revealed to me by degrees the limitations of my moral and material surroundings i have no intention to detail the processes of that growth i can hardly indeed claim an independent life until detached from its dull experiences it is enough here briefly to review them my first warning disillusionment was the knowledge to my infinite disgust that father pope was to remain a permanency in the asylum to which accident had translated him whether his former patrons seized this opportunity in the first reactionary days after riot to rid themselves of an ungainly incubus or whether which is more probable he himself manuvred for transference to new hunting grounds not of souls but grubs i do not know anyhow his baggage being his book the change was easy and at wellcot he remained titular chaplain to the lady sophia but positive to a community of nuns across the valley who were her most cherished protges and to whose ranks i in the first blind fervour of my redemption unprovisionally dedicated myself i had not been long settled before speculating on the relationship between shole and wellcot herring i began to wonder if i was destined ever to see again the young gentleman who had so insulted me perhaps i thought i might help by my example and even persuasion to wean him from his evil courses however the opportunity was not to be given me as it appeared he was not sufficiently in love with his aunts ways to pay her even the periodic courtesy of a visit but his father the earl came occasionally and from him i was bent upon discovering whether or not my image was entirely effaced from the sons remembrance happening to meet him alone in the gardens one day i was actually emboldened to beg him to convey a message from me to the viscount that i forgave him he stopped and looked at me with admiration then took my chin in his hand i shall do nothing of the sort miss presumption he said in his thin ironic voice but im not so particular for myself you shall give me all of your confidences that you like thank you i said saucily i will choose a handsomer to fill the place of my papa was he so handsome says he grinning he was the most beautiful man in the world i answered well i can believe it he said but not so handsome as my brother george hey fifty thousand times i said and fifty thousand times better i dont know he was good enough for me that i can well believe he chuckled then took a turn or two and came back harkee missy says he im not going to peach on you whatever you say so you can be as free as air with me only promise not to make me jealous of my own son and well be fast friends some day and with a laugh he left me i hated him instinctively and longed for the time when i could set my wits to discompose him he was a widower and socially and politically a man of bad character and it should have been madams duty to see that we were not brought into contact but she could conceive no evil of the head of her house the brother the good one came near us no more than the viscount which nevertheless did not trouble me because i owed him a debt and he was too poor in purse and reputation to expect me to liquidate it little patty after her manner loved this unfortunate whom she had seen often in former days before his character went over some racing transaction which ruined him and made him shy of his familiars her loyalty was proof against the worst where she was pledged she never dropped away and her heart had the truest instinct for finding and attaching itself to what was lovable in another she adored nobility of mind and was always my most faithful little adherent i came early to discover that her origin was none of the most select and on this account perhaps condescended to her more than i should she repaid me with a blind devotion and admiration which were sometimes more affecting than diplomatic and before i had been at wellcot a year would have followed me at a word to shame or death in very despite of her duty to her patroness but by then i think she was coming with me to recognise certain flaws in the character of her former divinity it was from her in the first instance that i learned all that she knew of the family history how my lord was a brute and libertine who had done his wife to death and was hated and feared of all unless perhaps by the old dirty astrologer on the hill who was his kinsman and naboth and defier in one holding the folly in fee simple as he did from a scientific ancestor and persistently refusing to be coaxed or bought out of it how my lady as pious as her brother was worldly had embraced the romish doctrine many years before and had not scrupled on the jesuit principle to procure herself through his most questionable political relations a virtual exemption from the penalties which attached to the open exercise of her religion how trading on this connection she had planted in wellcot herring a community of the sisters of perpetual invocation whose munificent patroness and dupe heaven forgive me they were certainly very plausible little sybarites she had constituted herself how the honourable mr rowe his lordships younger brother was suspected of royal blood in his veins and was only spared the scandal of proof so long as his nephew the viscount salted kept him out of the succession how in fine and this was where my interest was most intimately engaged her ladyship had once had an affaire de cur with a mr de crespigny an artist who came to paint her portrait and who left it on the canvas half finished being given it was whispered his cong in reluctant return for his insensibility to the proselytising advances of his sitter from little patty i extracted all this chronique scandaleuse and if she enlightened me in her own inimitable bashful way blundering prettily on the truth out of innocence i was not so backward even then as to be imposed upon by half revelations or to refrain from construing them on my own account into the language of experience and so i entered on my new life having to endear its strangeness and soon alas its monotony to me the most loving simple minded little comrade one might imagine from the first my position like my friends was undefined we were not adopted daughters or servants or companions to madam but a sort of pious pensioners on her bounty she claimed some personal menial duties of us which might be likened to those exacted of ladies of a royal bed chamber as was befitting with so great a princess we might approach and handle her but reverently as one might uncover a reliquary of sanctified bones and indeed she was little else for myself i did not much care my eyes and ears served me for all her case howsoever little of her intimacy was vouchsafed me i often put her to bed after supper and prayers when she would love to engage me in little drony dialectics on faith we had amicable contests of wit god save me on the qualities which endeared our favourite saints to us i observed that the male beatitudes were her choice her room was hung with as many fathers as a fribbles is with madonnas of the opera house the ways of piety are strange i was no dvote alas like madam yet i should have been abashed to go to bed in such company but indeed there was no disputing with her principles faith was her covering argument in everything she wore it like a garment high necked and impenetrable only to my taste it was none the more becoming for being fitted over broken stay bones then too she moved so stately by faith that i had often speculated why her heels should be trodden over until i discovered that she had bandy legs truly faith like charity covers a multitude of sins i attribute it to her that mine came so soon to be in myself i have never had reason to be ashamed of anything it hid only instinct tells me to be more particular about my garters than my scapular if the lady susannah rowe had found herself being spied upon by the elders she would have snatched and donned the latter and had complete faith in its shelter that may be grace but it is not graceful i think since the first mother started the fashions there has been every obligation on us to consult appearances and i at least though never more worldly than the most have persistently declined to let faith make an ostrich of me she used often to send me to the convent across the valley with messages to the nuns and i was early in discovering that i was the more welcomed by them when a little offering of fowls or hothouse grapes accompanied me then i could gain indulgences as many as i wanted for my peccadilloes up to twenty at least for a couple of fat gallinas and perhaps rather presumed upon my purgatory in consequence this community was a praying order and eternally vowed from washing as a personal indelicacy or from stepping beyond its convent gates as a first faux pas into the world or from ministering to any needs but its own or in short from being of any practical use on the earth whatever save as an authorised agency for the distribution of indulgences a natural consequence of all of which was that it grew to be a very pot bellied little community as tight skinned and ruddy as the pears on its own south wall and through its superioress as knowing a judge as any of old port and early asparagus the bell that prostrated it on its fat little knees to angelus was the same that rang it to dinner the throat of the thing was hoarse with the steam of rich pasties and salmis of game that rose from the convent kitchen hard by it had mushroom pits and a peach hung pleasaunce and indeed by the help of my lady was altogether as epicurean a little company for saints feast days as could be gathered the devil it is certain sets up his tent in an empty stomach he would have found close quarters as was proper in the convent of perpetual invocation i will say for the sisters that i never heard a cross word among them now to have the command of indulgences for feast days and for dispensations from fast in such a neat little paradise as theirs seemed to me at the first a very desirable thing only i hoped that by the time i was ripe for the novitiate the chaplain would have been replaced by one more personable the mother had in common decency to undertake to instruct me and patty by and by in the articles of our creed and father pope complete gentleman to conduct our secular finishing we never saw any other man except village chawbacons and at rare intervals the foxy earl it was a deadly life i could not have endured it but for the society of my sweet little adoratrice she grew up the dearest thing with the face of a christian shepherdess one saw lambs not babies in her eyes holding her little kind hand in memory i pass over four years of this self obliteration until i awaken to find myself in my seventeenth year viii i meet mr noel de crespigny life without the male element is worse than being limited to shop windows for the fashions we can read with patience in a nunnery of the modes but not of marrying and giving in marriage still i will ask any candid critic to judge if an utmost desperation could have induced me to a conduct with an accusation of which madam inaugurated the series of misunderstandings which came to arise between us an attempted corruption of father pope to wit the whole truth of this fantastic invention is as follows when i was near fifteen i had begun to grow troubled in my conscience as to my confirmation how could i face the cloister an uncertified soldier of my creed the chaplain had seemed kinder to me of late or perhaps it would be truer to say less bearishly unapproachable to be sure he could not always be adamant to the natural graces it was his business to help adorn and in proportion as he relaxed i was moved to conciliate him with fifty little winning attentions to which he could not be altogether insensible i found plausible excuses for his confounding entomology with theology citing the little bedesman of christ in vindication of the nature god i learned to rear clammy grubs in pots of earth that i might surprise him with the results beautiful winged creatures which i likened to the souls emancipated under his tutelage i discovered or invented a hundred symbols for his hagiology i sewed buttons on his coat and brushed his great hat with actual reverence for the moth which had settled in it from the brain below was it my fault if the ridiculous creature misconstrued all these little wistful gards i sought my way only by him as one might propitiate a surly but indispensable guide and in my utter innocence took his morose silences and the scowling suspicion which grew in his eyes for some late dawn of sympathy some increased consideration if not tenderness towards the pupil whom he was conscious of his heart having maligned how cruelly my trust was abused will show in an interview to which madam unexpectedly summoned me diana she said she was seated knitting a comforter for the monster himself and her lips as she bent over her work had a mechanical but rather shaky smile on them have you a daughters regard for our good chaplain o yes madam i answered wondering what was to come yet it is not a daughters part to indite love sonnets to her father she said steadily without looking up i stared and flushed and burst into tears she also reddened and produced a paper from her pocket is this yours she demanded he found it slipped into his breviary it appears to me to bear only one construction and what is that madam i asked coldly my little outbreak had been mastered as soon as vented my heart blazed with anger over this outrageous cymon in a cassock i put the question to you she said her thin bosom heaving a little if it is as i suspect i should blush to name it blush rather for yourself i said in the same chill tone to plant the slander in a young girls soul i will be a catholic no more she rose pale and agitated do you know what you say she breathed in fear you self dedicated to the cloister i renounce the pledge i cried in a sudden burst of passion i will no longer believe what father pope believes or confess again to him anything but lies since those are what he likes to trade in hush she said aghast at my fury her hands trembled fluttering the paper hush be calm you say things you cannot mean god forgive you the threat of such apostasy and you i cried still stormily such a witness against a poor childs character no no she entreated almost abjectly i wish only the truth father pope wishes only the truth tell me frankly do you recognise these lines with a great effort i subdued my emotion and took the paper frigidly from her hand it was folded at the following verse which i had to bite my lips pretending to read thrice happy she who from thy kindling eye shall draw some spark to illuminate her breast a wistful wanderer between earth and sky with doubts of loves true haven sore oppressed do you recognise them she repeated yes madam i acknowledged looking up between reserve and defiance you do she murmured taken aback and it is your hand no madam i answered quietly it is miss grants but disguised she echoed the word at once incredulous and fearful of exciting another outbreak by appearing so disguised for what purpose and to whom addressed to me i answered it was part of a game between us but we will play it no more she echoed in amazement a game then asked faintly what game i was the hermit of the rocks i said and miss grant the princess camilla who wrote to consult me as to her vocation whether for the cloister or for marriage with a pious young gentleman it was an inspiration which i had no sooner uttered than i feared for my rashness but i need not have madam as her slow perceptives kindled grew one shine of happy intelligence a game she repeated smiling holy motherly over the decorous innocence of our inventions well i will say it was a very proper one though a little ambiguous in the articles of love to be addressed to a hermit but how came it in the chaplains book child i confessed that i had had the curiosity to read in the fathers breviary and must unwittingly have left the paper there for a marker she kissed me then and while deprecating my inquisitiveness in matters which did not concern me apologised very handsomely i will say for having so traduced me on a shred of evidence it shall be a lesson to me and a penance she said but child go now and retract your wicked recantation before perhaps the devil shall claim you to your sin it was very hard madam i said still rebellious why being disguised should father pope have decided as of course that the verses were mine ah she said blushing and embarrassed that i do not know i think but little patty is no genius the moment i was free i hurried palpitating to my friend and confessed all and implored her by the love between us to play her part in the little innocent deception i had practised she gazed at me with her sweet shocked eyes as if i were inviting her to murder you really meant them for him for father pope she whispered half choking o diana it was blasphemy it was i said to waste the princess camilla on such a block then as my friend still cried out i knelt and took her waist prisoner in my arms and begged to her i am not like you darling i pine and pinch in this cold air if it was not for you you little warm thing i should run away with giles the handsome stable boy dont she wept you dont mean it say you only intended it for a joke of course i only meant it for a joke i said urging her though its true i believed the creature was expecting it of me but tis a joke that will cost me dear if you dont back me o she cried despairing i do i will but how can i ever pretend to have wrote them when that cat rhymes with lap is the best i know of verse you little dear i said laughing in sheer love of her artlessness pretend nothing but hold your tongue that she would have done for me i think though they racked her to confess and all might yet have gone well had not the lady sophia meddlesome like most self righteous consciences sent for her to question if after all her simple verses might not have been the instinctive expression of her leaning towards the cloister my poor transparent angel managed to articulate a panic denial of any such tendency though indeed there was no need to to any but a blindworm if ever little maid was built for loving or to lay her pretty hair in a puddle for some rogue to reach heaven by it was she the sense of guilt would confound her however and what between her duty to madam and her loyalty to me she must have answered her examination so ambiguously as to raise some new doubts and suspicions in the minds of her inquisitors she flew back to me with very red eyes and a fresh horror of the imposition she was forced to practise i will never never tell she sobbed though they tear me to pieces but o diana i dont want to be a nun i comforted her though furious with the others for their jesuitical practices on her innocence wait i cried and i will pay them both out what right had they after what i said to try and torture a lie out of you dont fear for the convent child i pledge my word you shall have a husband and fifty children nun or no nun i want no husband she answered blushing and clinging to me and no lover but you i have taken pains to record her fond little reply in view of an odious charge once concocted to my injury of my having traded upon my friends faith in me to rob her heart of its dearest possession that indeed was then and always no less than her loved diana of whom none was ever permitted by her to take precedence any sacrifice which was designed to maintain those mutual relations she thought too cheap for discussion one result however of her questioning was that madams attitude towards me was thenceforth marked by a reserve and jealousy which inasmuch as i was unconscious of having done anything to merit it served only to prejudice me against a religion which could be used for a cloak to so much hypocrisy i grew quickly disenamoured of my supposed vocation and decided that faith which seemed largely a matter of digestion could be better realised through independence in short in the world i could reach beatitude through twenty self indulgences to one in the convent and such being the case and my constitution perfect it seemed folly to take the short way madam seized an early opportunity after this to inquire into my plans for retiring from the world and taking the veil i confessed to her in reply that her late suspicions had engendered in me thoughts a sense of grievance inimical to my right contemplation of so momentous a sacrifice she was very much shocked and troubled and recommended me a stricter observance of all those self obliterating virtues which are such a comfort to those who dont practise them she rebuked my pride she prescribed fasting and discipline and maceration tortures which would have killed a dray man in order to lower and submit my system to its final severance from the world she would have had me at her mercy before she drove in the knife only unluckily for her my constitution was impregnable it flourished equally whether on bread and water or vol au vent and finally she surrendered to it i rather liked a little pious game we played called the moral lotto in which the discs were sins and those left uncovered at the end entailed an obligation on the losers to maintain a particular guard against the temptations they expressed though we all in the end must have been warned through the calendar from simony to powder puffs i believe the contest was so sanctified to her by intention that she read a design of heaven in every missing counter and the fact that i generally won did more than many assurances to convince her that i was perhaps after all not so black as she had painted me but between me and father pope after that little malentendu there was no quarter asked or given he treated me with a persistent coarse rudeness and i retaliated with all the interest of wit i dared i dropped blobs of wax on his spectacles left his hagiology open under a drip from the ceiling put crumbs of cheese in his cabinets of moth to tempt the mice in and confessed his own most obvious sins to him as mine for which i accepted furious penances as meekly as a lamb he hated me and i contrived at least to give him a substantial reason for such an abuse of his cloth now i will mention one only other little incident before i pass on to the subject of this chapter i was playing in wellcot attics on a certain wet afternoon with patty when i discovered a locked bluebeard chamber what is it i said but she did not know i tried the handle i peered vainly into the keyhole finally i took a pin from my hair and contrived a little pick of it o what are you going to do whispered the child quite scared get in if i can said i dont she said horrified if we are shut out tis for a reason of course i answered and its no good looking for it on this side of the door she clasped her hands in a little paralysis of curiosity while i worked it was a simple lock and i was successful as the door swung open we saw before us a sky lit room wedged under the slope of the roof and quite empty save for a framed picture which leaned to the wall back outwards patty uttered a tiny cry o diana its the portrait in a moment all excitement we stole in a tiptoe the place was very still and ghostly only on the dusty canvas itself lay a melancholy grid of light palpitating in our sense of guilt we turned the frame round let it drop softly back again and there before our eyes bloomed a smiling wistful face the light which had saddened it in reverse was quickened now to an illuminating glory it greeted and dimpled to us the face of a dead woman risen a dead woman had she ever lived i could not believe it thinking of that unsympathetic dvote downstairs was she ever like that i whispered she was beautiful murmured patty fervently i remember him painting this and going away and leaving it unfinished said i for indeed the portrait was but sketched in though masterly in its promise yes said the little girl gulping and i never supposed what had become of it till now it seemed incredible the change that but a few envious years had wrought had love done this thing before me or could love forsaken so warp the loveliness which love himself had created it gave me a new little thrill of respect for the humanised sophia because whatever the truth of her face a man had been found to see this beauty in it she was st cecilia whispered patty there is the harp in her lap it was without strings an unborn music perhaps the christian lady had declined to accept a pagan muse for midwife and had temporised with her would be deliverer hoping to convert him if so she had played her cards badly i wondered if the man had been a fortune hunter but in that event madame sophia would certainly be madame de crespigny whatever the case however the picture made a deep impression on me and from my first moment of seeing it i was haunted by the desire to become myself the subject of such a masters devotion ma vue et mes minauderies firent tout coup tourner la girouette for the first time i felt myself a woman encumbered with the heavy responsibilities of her sex one day it was some eighteen months later returning from a commission to the convent i walked straight into the presence of the original of the picture and its painter yes that is the truth he had run faith at last to earth it seemed and armed with it was returned to add the strings to the abortive harp and perfect the ancient harmony i could have thought that to do so he had need of faith indeed until looking at madam i started in sheer wonder she was transfigured rejuvenated the happiest light bashful coy defiant and surrendering its defiance was in her eyes she was more like a wife in the first wonder of motherhood than the starved religieuse of yesterday and the cause ah my alcide the creature rose upon my entrance and i could have laughed in the face of my own befooled ideal i had thought of raphael and the fornarina and behold a slack half drowned looking figure with an expression and conduct of its limbs as if it were just risen gasping from a pond there he stood no sort of natural fowl at all but a freak of genius like a five legged calf at a fair he he giggled he and held himself as if he were waiting to be told what to do next he was tall it is true and there was a good deal of him mostly gnarled bone if that counted to his credit his forehead streaked with dark hair turning grey was strong and ample and in itself something of a feature but mercy the loose indetermination of his lower lip and the way it overhung foolish and disproportionate as an elephants the little folded chin as i stared too mortified for manners he returned my gaze suddenly startled it seemed into a speechlessness so stertorous that little patty who had entered with and stood behind me fell back a step in confusion ah he exclaimed at that chuckling and is hee ar the little girl i knew he spoke when he did at last drawlingly and ended as was his way by wrinkling his thin hooked nose and hee hawing a little laugh through it she is grown is she not said madam answering for patty to whom he had referred though indeed his eyes were all the time on me her voice was so changed and soft i hardly recognised it she is grown he said she is become it appears a double cherry no said madam seriously the other is a second little foundling of my care and destined to gods our gods she added coyly service de crespigny she had no sense of humour the dear creature the next moment noticing the direction of his gaze with a little frown she bade us begone to our books we fled and once remote i turned with a tragi hysteric stamp upon my companion patience and is that donkey him it is mr noel de crespigny she said amazed he is not o diana do you really think him hee haw i broke in with a little passion of laughter and then fury overcame me how dared she i stormed how dared she tell him that lie about me what lie said poor patty why to claim me to her worship of a golden ass i cried it was a calf said my friend bewildered i screamed with laughter o dont patty implored it really was diana you dear i gasped i daresay it was but he was so badly made i couldnt tell she followed me upstairs utterly bewildered on the landing above we encountered a strange sight the picture the picture was already on its way down from the attics a groom and maid bore it and the oddest creature stood above superintending its resurrection gogo whispered patty its gogo i could well believe it of such a monster he was a man and a huge one down to his mid thighs and there he ended in a couple of wooden stumps his face lapped in a very mask of red bristle was as savage as sin and he growled and rumbled like an interdicted volcano ay he thundered im gogo the dutch tumbler who calls me by my name holding with one hand by the banisters he struck with the strong stick he carried at the stairs missed the tread and was within an inch of falling the stick rattled down and he swung and clung with both hands to the rail in an instant some whimsical impulse sent me tripping lightly up to help him take my arm i said down to the landing the giggling servants paused in their task to stare up but the monster himself laboured round with quite a stunned look to help me he whispered hoarsely the little scented rush to prop the oak i was in love with his changed voice at once it was something to meet only two thirds of a man no no he said touching my arm as if it were a relic im gogo the colour grinder the bottle washer not worthy to latch your ladyships little shoe ill go down ill go down ho ho its easy ive done it all my life while he spoke the odd creature had descended unaided and recovering his stick struck his wooden limbs fiercely with it do you see he cried a stiff kneed dog as ever limped after fortune he flounced upon the servants and roared them into care of their charge then turned again to me where i stood with my friend who had run trembling to my shelter tis our market ladies he said in apology i must be particular in its custody we deal in new lamps for old in he descended a few steps then turned again ah he groaned tragic and comical in one pity the poor genii who has to serve pity him pity him he heaved a sigh that would have turned a windmill and followed the picture and disappeared patty i whispered when he was gone patty lord patty who is the creature im terrified of him she gulped hes mr de crespignys dog he calls himself and follows his master everywhere loving and growling at him he used to say there was no such painter in the world if he could be kept to it but he always frightened me dreadfully i do hope they wont stop long hm i said and is that queer name all hes got i never heard of another she answered but anyhow it suits him yes i said and sighed if he only had legs ix i am committed to the i learned as you shall understand to readjust my first impression of de crespigny it is certain one must not judge the quality of the wine by the vessel he was a great artist who ran quickly to waste in the passions evoked of his own conceptions from the mouth downwards he was a sensualist and not fit to trust himself with a fair model shut into a monastery he would have been a fra angelico at the first he captured me when once i was familiarised with the ungainly exterior of the creature to see him work ardent engrossed unerring in the early enthusiasm of a subject was a revelation he stood so slack he ran so to moral exhaustion when delivered of his inspiration it was impossible to recognise the master of a moment ago in this invertebrate body with the loose wrists and silly laugh if he could only have been kept always at the high pressure of his conceptions sometimes i wondered if it was in me to make him great and hold him it would have been splendid to be the hamilton to this romney yet in the end i found the game not worth the candle he was soft wax indeed for seven eighths of his length and the littlest puff from red lips could blow all the flame out of his head still while it lasted his influence over me was an education his portfolios were the very minutes of inspiration suggestions impressions of loveliness caught and recorded and passed by for others he finished little and perhaps would have been a lesser artist and a stronger man if he could have laboured to consolidate his dreams he taught me that not facts but shadows of facts the reflections most moving most intimate which they cast are the real appeals to the emotions that there is no landscape so beautiful as its reflection in a mirror no chord so pathetic as its silent vibration in ones heart perhaps the heavens are an eternity of echoes of spectral perfumes of dreams derived from experience and we the authors of our own immortality if so we should live passionately who would dream well what this man lacked in nerve and backbone his strange servant and comrade supplied and many times over he was the oddest monstrosity savage in criticism caustic in humour a caliban bellowing grief and tenderness through hairy lungs how he could ever have come to attach himself and passionately to so flaccid a bear leader was a problem pure for psychology now at least the two were inseparable as ah my friend i was on the point of saying as valentine and proteus but the analogy i protest is too poignant for have not i too been cruelly declared the sylvia who divided them the portrait on that first afternoon was carried down to a convenient closet on the ground floor and there de crespigny worked on it always alone or in the sole company of his henchman when finished for the day he would invariably lock the canvas into a press and none not even i there is virtue in that parenthesis was permitted to see it the room was held sacred to him and madam herself refrained so religiously from intruding on its privacy as to evoke in her guileless trust of the singleness of his conversion the very hypocrisy which to her faith was inconceivable for indeed he converted this closet which stood safely remote and approached by a back stair way into a sanctuary for deceit often to confess the whole truth when she supposed me engrossed in books or the construction of celestial samplers was i closeted with de crespigny and gogo learning to handle a brush or inspire one while patty with a code of signals kept panic watch on the stairs madams exclusion no doubt cost her many a patient sigh she wondered over the idiosyncrasies of genius which preferred or professed to prefer to labour its mental impressions rather than toil to record the living and mechanical pose still it was true the sophia of to day however rejuvenated was scarcely the model of that older time and that he could finish that beautiful inspiration from her staider personality was what it was folly perhaps in her to expect poor woman though i had my grudge and no taste or reason to commiserate such vanity i suffered some qualms of remorse for the part i was led to play it is natural after all for the sex to see itself never so immortal as through the eyes of love and when a man has once praised its complexion to claim for itself an eternity of roses father pope the old spiritual curmudgeon never quite credited i think the genuineness of this late conversion i daresay from his experience in the confessional box he knew his man pretty well and the value of such emotional abjurations the sick devil turned monk was not to his taste and if he ventured to intimate as much the coldness which certainly befell between madam and him at this time was easily to be accounted for it all amused me hugely and i felt delightfully wicked while the fun lasted but retribution my friend was to overtake your naughty little diana one day stealing into the studio i found gogo alone grinding colours into a little mortar god ye good een little serpent said he you can sit and beguile me for practice till my master comes gogo i said shocked why do you call me by such a name because you are as like eve as two peas growled he eve was not a serpent but a beautiful woman i answered pouting and so was lamia and yet she was a serpent he grunted i dont know what you mean you said eve well why not he replied turning his red morose looking eyes on me eve accused the serpent of beguilement didnt she and adam eve but eve was made out of the man therefore adam accused himself but eve accused the serpent therefore adam accused the serpent yet he accused eve therefore eve was the serpent which is what she would and will never understand o god bless her god bless her which if he would do blessing the serpent might unriddle this sinful problem of life he set to pounding vigorously with his pestle and for a minute i watched him in a bewildered silence there was always something in this shorn cyclops which oddly attracted me gogo i said quite softly he threw down his pestle at once and faced round writhing his hands together and glaring at me who spoke he said in hoarse trembling tones a voice from the garden making me in love with my own clown name o always so always so thou spirit of eve and though it lost the world to god id take the apple from thy hand i laughed a little tremulously as he stumped across the floor and stood close before me the vision of this great storm of a creature condemned to play the comic relief in the tragedy of his own manhood came as near my heart as anything look he cried his rugged chest heaving i cant kneel to you and im your slave i walk open eyed hating and adoring you into the toils you spread for our feet feet he groaned looking down with a despairing gesture perhaps who knows having them i might have escaped how did you lose them poor gogo i said hating and adoring he groaned unheeding my question hating and adoring look little serpent i could crush your slender throat for what you do and hold on and sob my soul away to see you die why have you come between us united we were strong he and i i drove his genius on and loved the poor ape for its spark of divinity and propped the weak spirit while it wrought you knock the prop away you knock the prop away and we both fall and where is my compensation for the injury he clasped his great hands to me give me back my genius he cried in pain and let us go i rose to my feet half moved and half resentful it is not i who take him or want him i will not come here again as i turned he barred my way no he said near sobbing i lied do what you will with us make us angels or swine i am content so long as i may serve you as he spoke the door opened and de crespigny entered he greeted me with a rather shifty look i thought and his manner seemed too distraught to affect any particular notice of his servants obvious emotion o well ma bella unanina said he but a little sitting for this afternoon please i flushed and was about to refuse to remain at all when an imploring scowl from gogo softened me with plenty of hauteur i stalked into a little curtained off alcove which was consecrated to me for tiring room and there dressed for model when i emerged again my feet and arms were bare my hair loose in a golden fillet and for the rest i wore a kind of seraph smock in which les convenances had been constrained to clothe me for the peerless una for as una i was being painted looking one day through de crespignys portfolios i had come upon some impressions royal strenuous of lions in the tower menagerie and was admiring the lithe strong darlings when his voice breathed behind me with that little eternal foolish giggle have you decided naughty yes i whispered i will be the fairy lady whom the lion came to devour and remained to serve and protect because she was so pure and innocent he did not know who i meant so i found him the book and place ah to be sure said he reading eagerly she laid her stole aside did she yes it is an inspiration it will suit me if it does you so i was painted wonderfully as una making my own stole from one of pattys bedgowns and glorying out of my very shamefacedness to feed the inspiration while it lasted of this impassioned art now for days it had wrought without slackening so that it was an offence to me to find it suddenly become it seemed without apparent cause or reason out of tune with its subject he worked fitfully dully almost as it were disregarding my presence and drawling commonplaces the while to gogo who had returned to his pestle and mortar and was grinding away sullenly gogo he yawned presently after an idle preoccupied silence which would you rather marry a woman of wit or virtue neither you blattering genius cried the other turning round with such an instant roar that i was almost frightened off my perch the master accustomed to his strange fellows moods only laughed and leaned back indolent why you old dear said he gogo thundered shes a rotten fish at best shining the more the more corrupt she is but if she dont shine said de crespigny coolly then shes a dull fish said gogo but a fish still the other mused and sniggered whos for ever playing to be caught added gogo grumbling she loves the angle play her what you like man only throw her back when hooked mr gogo i exclaimed ay mistress una said he youre all pretty players from miss to my lady dowager dont tell me you all love to excite the emotions you dont understand and then off with you from the stage sweet ethereals to the suppers of steak and porter which you do while jack and my lord are wetting their pillows with tears over your sensibility thank you i said rising highly offended as i for one am not playing to be hooked ill take your warning in time i had expected de crespigny to strike in in angry protest over his servants insolence but to my astonishment he did not move or interfere a little pregnant silence ensued and the tears were already rising to my eyes when to my horror i heard madams voice at the door de crespigny she said may i come in for once he stumbled to his feet and stood paralysed a moment before he answered a minute you know the conditions i must hide it away and then when she entered a little later there was he standing to receive her with a spasmodic grin his easel was empty gogo pounded at his mortar and i i was shrunk behind the curtain peeping in a very shiver of terror she looked at him with a little shaky propitiating smile her eyes were red as if she had been crying she tried to speak and could not he understood so far the poor clown and bade his servant withdraw when they were alone she turned upon him with a little appealing motion of her hands am i never to be allowed to see it she asked he frowned and bit his trembling lip no no she said i know the sensitiveness of your beautiful art only o noel i cannot rest where we ended just now believe me it was so far from my wish to offend or alarm you but time goes on and the pledge this finished picture was to redeem is withheld until i am at a loss how to explain to whom he muttered sullenly to that priest o i know what right has he a grudging churchman and you a saint o indeed i am but a weak woman she said with a faint smile and he an anointed father he does right dear he does to be jealous for his daughter it is only that he would ask you that i would ask you what period art is not to be forced he interrupted her peevishly i made the finishing of this picture as it was begun as it was begun mind the condition of my being received into your church didnt i now yes she sighed but there are some vows better broken a bad recommendation to what you call the truth he sneered but noel it is the truth she cried o say you are convinced that it is well i dont know he answered since you bid me to a lie i will take the burden she cried her eyes streaming to save the soul i love she hardly breathed the final word for a wonder the poor creature she entreated found enough in it to move him there he said dont distress yourself sophia ill work hot handed on the picture to morrow there i promise i will thank you noel she whispered so kindling so grateful that de crespigny shrunk before her i i wont interrupt you any longer it was like you kind and considerate not to blame me for breaking your rule the room remained so still after her going that i thought he too had followed until stealing out presently in a panic i found him seated in a corner biting his nails i had better go now hadnt i i whispered half choking yes he growled to the devil x i bewitch a monster on the following morning going indifferently by the studio where was a back way into the grounds i encountered gogo hes at work on the portrait he said standing moodily against the room door hell be at it all day its no good your coming i tossed my head vouchsafing no reply and singing to myself passed on and out the day after descending the stairs i observed that the studio door was left ajar i laughed taking no other notice and went my way into the garden on the third day seeing de crespigny walk out with his sophia i borrowed the opportunity to slip down and investigate the truth was i was devoured with curiosity to learn how madams little explosion had stimulated the artistic verve and to obtain a glimpse of the portrait even if necessary by bending myself to the corruption of my poor infatuated gogo but i was to be disappointed for the room was empty and the canvas locked into its press peering here and there considerably chagrined in the hope of discovering the key i came in the alcove upon the full sleeved waistcoat in which the artist usually worked and diving eagerly into the pockets thereof found not the key indeed but some scraps of paper much scribbled over which instantly aroused my curiosity and presently my amusement ho ho thought i you are inspired in other than the pictured arts are you my gentleman a poet and fainting in the perfume of some little naughty mignonette so he had fancy named the subject of his agonised muse and indeed why should i prevaricate to myself about the application i blushed a little making myself merry over these suffering scrawls and scratches of which i was sure my own poor little person must be the victim i had a face it seemed the calendar of innocence une bonne poitrine a sweetest little double chin like a robins throat swelled with song i put my hand to my neck i could not but admit that the poor man had taken a poetic licence but in truth it was a very example of the licence that was wont to drug his art the flesh held his fine imagination in thrall and laboured his first spiritual conceptions into parisian models he was divine only in his sketches impressions when he wrought to improve upon them he became transubstantiated so this was his repentance he had spent the brief period of it in painting me in verse since he was debarred my presence in actuality i smiled reading mignonette mignonette of all flowers the pet and indeed thought i tossing my head but not yours as yet sir while i studied to disentangle the scribble i heard breathing near me and started to find gogo regarding me with a cynical half diverted scowl the creature walked like a cat on carpet he had no creaking leather to betray him so ho growled he you can yet blush to be found out by your dog i laughed vexed and a little embarrassed o said he never mind i am honoured in even that little rose of shame you wont grow it long gogo i said how dare you why said he as dogs dare who love without respect and see no more harm to serve a thief than a prince i looked at him a moment between tears and defiance you are very unkind i said what is the good of my confessing anything to you if you so distrust me confessing said he the good why because i have no legs to run away and a mans better judgment is always in his legs my foolish heart is nearer the ground than most tread on it thou circe and prove me less than half ulysses confess to me confess and i will stay and smile and believe no i said recovering my confidence i swear not to unless you confess first i asked you the other day how how you came to lose them and you put my question by sir and were dreadfully rude into the bargain very well i am waiting to have you atone by answering it i dropped into a chair and he followed me and squatted himself on the floor a very abortion of passion yet moving somehow in his grotesqueness i kicked off my slippers and put my feet into his hands there i said they are tired gogo soothe them while you talk he caressed the weariness from them as gentle as a woman i am at odds he said in a low great voice full of emotion i am at odds with what remains of myself how can i reconcile this with my loyalty to the poor inspired ape i serve and love through serving how did you come to serve him i whispered half drugged by the creatures touch you are cleverer than he better educated and all that i love he groaned i have always loved to find romantic excuses for the material uglinesses of life to get a little salt out of its offences who are those who say the visible form is but an expression of the individual spirit an internal autocracy shaping itself on the surface poor atomists who cannot feel the pressure of all eternity moulding them from without amidst sordid functions they go groping for the essence turning blank faces to the sweet air the sun in the trees the far drawn winds the song of birds and scent of flowers all the spirit influences which really shape us the soul ceases at the portals of the senses the dross it carries with it alone goes on and in we are but so many obstructions in the vast harmony foreign bodies which it is for ever striving to penetrate and decompose it focuses its burning light upon us it takes the swimming heavens for its lens and we die and are dissolved into it only in rare instances does the process wring from us a fine frenzy or melt us into song and then we see genius genius which fools call self issuing but which is really spirit reflected like heat cast back from a wall you odd creature i murmured you may go on though i dont understand you a bit has mr de crespigny been half melted into song i shouldnt be surprised by his appearance nor do i understand he said i can find romance in everything external to man but i cant pursue it into his organic tissues can you be so penetrated by it and yet not perish or even show one scar i think you are immortal woman unless it is the genius of human beauty which you reflect and which will presently destroy and annihilate you why then i would give my own soul to keep you soulless you wretched adorable child gogo i protested too languid to be resentful ay he said his voice hoarse with miserable passion let me speak it is all the licence i ask i know my place if i have grown confused about my service what i dont know is why i a free spirit who have never before truckled to the flesh should suddenly find myself bound to it soul and honour he bent and kissed the foot he was caressing then quickly sat up and set his strong teeth you ask me how i came by my hurts he said well listen to the story of this most laughable butt of fortune it is soon told he passed his hand across his forehead it has been my doom to serve nature to worship her through those visible concentrations of her light upon individuals whom we call geniuses how i discovered too late that her preferences were arbitrary fanciful often unworthy that her signal gifts could be used to stultify her own creed of natural faith natural justice natural order let these witness and call me fool he jerked up his poor stumps so comically that i could not help laughing ay he said a tragic prolegomena to the history of a dutch tumbler isnt it well for the text it was at oxford that i met and worshipped my first genius he was a man of great family an inspired naturalist an unerring shot and rare sportsman in those early days we had already planned an expedition together to the unexplored north western rockies for the purpose of making such a collection of their flora and fauna as should bring us wealth and reputation though the world of nature seemed even too cramped a stage for my boundless lust of life the prospect of those unspeakable teeming solitudes inviting all that was most strenuous in me to conquer was a certain solace in itself my soul sought territory it seeks it still and though i be what i am the stars this poor earth once subdued still enter into my plan of campaign i was not rich when the time came i had to realise all my capital to sail with my friend we reached after considerable hardships the athabasca territory and thence started on our exploration westwards i soon found that my comrade though a genius in comparative analysis and definition lacked the physique necessary to the task we had set ourselves he was often ailing and querulous and the gathering of the specimens practically devolved upon me still we had garnered and classified a considerable harvest in one of the little settlements of the fur company before the accident befell which was to deprive me for ever of the fruits of my devotion we were one day duck shooting over a lake when the ice broke and my friend was plunged in frozen water to the knees his frantic cries brought me hurriedly to his assistance by the greatest good fortune a little gravelly shallow had received us but inasmuch as this shelved away acutely on every side our desperate scrambles to escape only let us into deeper water there was nothing for it but to stay where we were till rescue could reach us from the shore and so we set ourselves to endure not long on my companions part he soon complained that he must die unless relieved he was frail and spare and i only something less than a giant i took him first into my arms then upon my shoulders designing to hold him so until succour came it reached us in the shape of some indians from the shore who pushed a canoe towards us over the ice but by then i was stark frozen and my legs to the knees insensible by chance there was an ex medical student in the settlement who turned what rough knowledge of surgery was his to the best account he was able one of my legs was mortified beyond recovery and this he amputated the other after incredible suffering was saved to me for weeks however i was kept knocking at deaths door and when at length i could creep from under the shadow it was to the knowledge of an anguish more cruel than the other this man this genius whom i had given so much to save had deserted me while i lay stricken and carrying with him all the rare accumulations of our enterprise had gone south to vancouver there was no message left no consideration for me in all his vile philosophy of self interest it was just a case of treacherous abandonment when i was sufficiently recovered i pursued him by tedious heart breaking stages long months in their accomplishment i will not weary you you thing of thoughtless life with their particulars i was sustained and only sustained through all by the thought of wresting from this scientific egoist an acknowledgment of my share in the practical success of our expedition at last poor friendless crippled i ran him to earth in london i found him there his name writ famous in the annals of the royal society himself the honoured recipient of its gold medal his collection our collection already on view in the hallowed precincts of crane street i faced and upbraided him with his treachery he retorted coldly that he had never considered me but as the servant of his enterprise useless to it when once through my own folly disabled i found a friend and the affair made a little stir to my accusations he answered that he had employed but had been forced to discard me through the irregularity of my habits outraged beyond words i challenged him he accepted and we met at richmond his first shot aimed with diabolical ingenuity shattered the bones of my sound knee and in the result the limb had to be amputated above when i was discharged from the hospital it was to find the exhibition closed the town empty and myself thrust upon it a helpless destitute hulk the friend i have mentioned humorous and good natured came to my assistance he commanded some pale interest at court by means of it he procured me as an expert naturalist the post of royal ratcatcher in succession to a mr gower who had lately filled the office at a yearly salary of one hundred pounds the royal economy however docked me as only two thirds of a man of a third of the sum i wore a uniform of scarlet and yellow worsted with emblematic figures of rats destroying wheat sheaves embroidered on it and in this i stood the laughing stock of the maids of honour for three years at the end of that time having had the misfortune to overlook a rat which had made its nest in a pair of the duke of cumberlands state breeches i was dismissed without a character again i applied to my friend and was recommended by him for my scientific attainments to a french nobleman who was troubled by the croaking of frogs in his ponds and employed me to whip the water all night with a long wand of willow that his rest might be undisturbed but the constant immersion rotting my stumps and he refusing to supply me with others i was obliged to resign my post and returned to england in the meantime my friend had died of a humour and i was stranded entirely without resources for some time i earned a precarious livelihood in my naturalist character by worming dogs and again one still more precarious by cleansing ladies toupes of the vermin which long usage engendered in them it was here while serving my master a wig maker that chance brought me acquainted with my present manner of service during all this time i will say i had never ceased to regard soul as external to form or to scout that introspection which is the real unhappiness what did it concern me if i was destroying rats or picking fleas out of a poodle in any case i was helping nature to its freer manifestations on matter and in my constant communion with it prepared to welcome such rare accidents of genius as might come my way my masters business brought him into frequent relations with the theatre and it was thus that i first encountered de crespigny who was at the time acting scene painter to the new house at sadlers wells i had no sooner had the chance to see his work than i recognised genius glaring and manifest he did wonders in a few touches that he might idle for an hour my opportunity was come and i entreated him to employ me in however menial a capacity he was touched by my enthusiasm flattered perhaps by my admiration persuaded by my strength he engaged me first as his assistant soon as his nurse and mentor for years i have helped to direct his career have goaded his inspirations cossetted his weaknesses ah child he is my child made glorious by my faith in him do not seduce me from my allegiance to my child and for the first time make me out of love with nature he ended with a groan and flung himself prostrate on the floor beating i think his forehead against it poor gogo i said you have confessed and so will i now he is my child too i adore him and am so ravished by his art that i could not rest with thinking what he had made of the portrait do you know gogo i will tell you the truth i was hunting for the key of the press when you came in and caught me he lay without answering wont you lend it me gogo i coaxed softly thank god he muttered raising his head i am tied from the temptress it is not in my power thou circe he always carries it with him xi i add the last touch to a portrait that same night while undressing with my room door open for the heat i suddenly thought i distinguished an unwonted footstep on the landing below me from which pattys little chamber led i listened quite still for some moments then the stealthy sounds seeming to recede into the hall and thence die away descended cat footed to the landing and after hearkening an instant opened her door swiftly and noiselessly upon my friend instantly i knew that the amazed suspicion which had sprung upon my heart was justified the child stood before me terror in her startled eyes her dark hair falling upon her shoulders a brush in one hand a paper in the other diana she gasped in a whisper what do you want has he been with you i asked instantly leaving her no time to prevaricate with me she exclaimed so scandalised and incredulous that the worst of my qualm was laid on the spot without another word i held out my hand without a word she put the paper into it i took it and read mignonette mignonette of all flowers the pet o shameful i whispered and set my lips o beautiful beautiful sweet mignonette dear kind little blossom soft soft in the bosom who gives to thee takes from thee sweet mignonette was it thou at her ear that shed sweets passing by me is it thou in her shape or herself that doth fly me is it thou is it she mignonette mignonette that i follow must follow as the summer the spring who hides warm in the wing of its darling the swallow as love chases the swallow to the eaves and the leaves high up under the roof mignonette so i follow ah to whose little chamber sweetheart as i clamber i trow not i know not what dream flew before to the room high aloof but my heart pants delight in the thought half a fright half delirious sweetness that the spirit of the flower that the spirit of the hour shall reveal loves completeness she was as pale as death and trembling all over as i looked up for the moment my heart withered to her the shock the outrage was unendurable who wrote this i demanded in a hoarse whisper she did not answer speak i said how did it come to you i heard it slipped under the door she muttered by him o you little traitor and wanton she fell on her knees sobbing and clinging to me in a soft anguish of desperation o my dear dont look at me so im not untrue to you i never imagined it was me no not for one moment till to night and you are shocked no doubt to find your precious virtue at fault o you little serpent that i have trusted and warmed in my bosom diana she wept in a very frenzy of despair o what can i say or do i thought it was you it shall be you diana yes it shall be me i answered but no thanks to you dont think that this is anything but a passing mood of his played upon you for my delectation because i have been cold to him of late i think it is i know it is she said brightening and you hope it is i daresay i said scornfully yes indeed she answered there is no love in the world but yours that i care for diana love i exclaimed dont flatter this poor half breeched makeshift with the sentiment but i looked down on her more kindly with a vexed laugh my good humour was returning to me it seemed too comical the way we three pious spinsters were scrambling for the favour of a sheeps eyes a pair of small clothes flung into our nunnery had been worse than an apple of discord skirts were so de rigueur with us that i think even gogos wooden legs seemed a little outrs i do believe you were innocent in everything but your cuddlesome looks i said relenting o yes diana she answered eagerly and i cant help them would you if you could i questioned doubtfully i dont know there is a good deal of method in artlessness it can always plead itself in excuse for enjoying the pleasures which we sinners must take at the expense of our consciences she knelt at my feet silently fondling and kissing my hands are you sure you dont regret giving him up i asked quite sure she answered so faintly as to set me off laughing there patty mia i said you are not to be sacrificed to a self indulgent vapours you will see some day how kind i am being to you and you shall have a large family yet and with that i kissed and left her taking the paper with me i will admit that the shock to my vanity was for the moment acute until reflection came to convince me that this rickety light o love wearying of his one days abstinence and finding me inaccessible had only palmed off on my friend the reversion of sentiments inspired by me on further reflection too i was not the more angry upon realising that i had acquired a useful weapon for goading him to a definite decision upon an action long deferred our flight together that is to say and when once emancipated from the stunting influences of wellcot the union which it was understood was to be conditional on his satisfying me that his ambitions and mine were mutually accommodating partners but now if for no other reason i felt that i owed it to my affection for my poor little friend to precipitate this step lest she should be led through her natural incapacity for denying anyone to making herself miserable for life and so armed with my pice de conviction i ended by sleeping very soundly and comfortably i did not even hesitate the next morning but about noon singing very cheerfully to myself descended to mr de crespignys studio the door was locked open please i said go away he answered crossly im at work on the portrait yes i said but i want to come in perhaps there was something in my tone anyhow after a short interval during which i heard him wheeling his easel about he unlocked the door himself i marched straight in and quite radiant nodded to gogo who busy in a corner gazed at me with a sort of gloomy alarm maynt i look i said smiling no said de crespigny sharply i went and held the paper under his nose didnt you slip this under the wrong door last night i asked calmly there growled gogo and throwing down his tools faced about furiously de crespignys face went mottled and he began to shake all over then suddenly he rallied and flamed on me stuttering wha what right have you to ask i may address whom i like without requesting your leave my my lady shall be informed what spies shes got in her house you ass roared gogo from me yes i said im going straight to tell her gogo stumped fiercely and put himself between me and the door his master collapsed like a pricked bladder youll ruin yourself he gasped between tears and bullying if you ruin me you come down too dont forget that o in a noble cause i said mockingly to open the eyes of my mistress and my friend he stamped about in a little impotent frenzy then came and almost prostrated himself before me i i thought youd forsaken me he cried i swear i did di and and i was as miserable as a dog and wanted sympathy i did in this cursed strait laced nunnery dont tell on me dont and ill go on with your picture here and now in a fever of trepidation he hurried from me calling on me not to go and fetched the canvas from the press and brought it to me see he said you little injured innocent yes you was quite right to be hurt but but its you i love di it really is and the canvas fell from his hand he stood gaping as if in the first shock of a stroke and i turned and there was madam standing in our midst every atom of colour gone from her face there are some situations my alcide that can only be ended brutally i dont know what deadly instinct drove me to the portrait but to it i ran and turned it with the easel about then i declare i felt as if i had committed murder the wretch with what fatal purpose i could not tell had done nothing less than mutilate his own inspiration in place of the lovely roses of yesterday was the worn haggard woman of to day and the harp in her lap was a tangle of broken strings i felt for her looking in her face i almost repented my part there was a dreadful smile on it as she went very quiet and breathless and lifted the una from the ground it is very pretty she said but hardly proper to a child of the good shepherd then i hated her as i had never done before and rejoiced in her downfall i was looking for you diana she said in her straitened tones and heard your voice here will you come with me please and so she went out deigning not one look at that insult of her own face nor one word to the hangdog perpetrator of it she went out as cold as ice and i saw gogo standing by the door droop his head as she passed tingling with the joy of battle i followed her i knew that my long martyrdom was nearing its end outside in the hall she turned to me quite stiff i wondered how her limp corsets could support so much dignity and bade me retire to my room till she should send for me and if it is to find you on your knees she said why by so much will the duty i have to perform be made the easier well to do her justice i believe that her heart was as near broken as one can be thank you maam i answered do you want to flog me twould scarce improve your case i think with mr de crespigny i ran up lightly humming to myself i heard her give a little gasp and then go on her way to the parlour nobody came near me while i waited until in a little while a servant knocked to summon me i went down at once as jaunty as you please father pope was with her i saw as i entered the room i wonder how much of the truth she has told him i thought she was seated perfectly colourless while her companion stood lowering and uneasy by a table hard by she bent a little forward drawing her breath i fancied with difficulty and addressed me at once you have asked pardon of god i hope i tossed my head for what madam what have i done she appealed to the priest with a little momentary helpless gesture then bit her thin lips as if stung by his silent perversity to resolution for the deceit you have long practised on us she said o madam i answered do you refer to the gentlemans attentions to me i could hardly be so immodest as to confess of them to you when i did not even know to what end they were advanced she held up her hand dully i allude to your privately sitting to him for for that for his model she said why i had my respected example madam said i i didnt know but what we were expected to accommodate the gentleman seeing you yourself gave us the lead she rose quickly striking her hand on the table to make of yourself pledged to heaven a shame and a wanton in his eyes o twas infamous not that she checked herself hurriedly i blame him not altogether art is a strange creditor that makes demands scarce comprehensible to us upon those who practise it but you are you blaming me madam i cried because he has not paid you to your liking she turned away as if quite sick father pope took up the tale silence he roared you little dirty liar and trollop o no doubt i piped him back because i rejected your attentions he took a step forward his great fist clenched his glasses blazing i dont know how he might not have forgotten himself had not lady sophia come quickly between hush she said it is all to end here father she turned quietly on me father pope is i am sorry to say justified you have deceived us in more things than one diana it is not so long i must tell you since i heard from the sisters of les madelonnettes that your original story of your unhappy mothers death was false she having but a few months ago returned penitent and broken to die in the very convent she had so shamed and disgraced i gazed at her bewildered for an instant and then as the truth penetrated me with a horror and passion beyond control o i cried this is too much and i believed her long dead of grief and you never told me never let me see her and i think you are the wickedest woman in the world she stood staring at me silent as if stricken cave anguem sneered the priest with a brutal laugh i turned upon the pale woman with a furious stamp why did you never let me know how dared you keep it from me i will go to law about it and have you hanged if i could have thought she began in a whisper if i have by chance done wrong wrong i cried violently you have done me nothing but wrong since i came here you have always misunderstood and disbelieved in me and now it seems you had no right to adopt me at all i ended with a torrent of tears i want to leave you i sobbed i want to go away into the convent and be at peace where no one can hate and slander me ha said father pope moving and hunching his shoulders then there our wishes jump and no time like the present so go collect your duds diana whispered madam again in her stunned way and made a little movement towards me but i shrunk from her shivering no dont touch me please i said ill go to the sisters wholl be kind to me ill do anything you want only not stop here i saw her put her hand to her heart as i tottered from the room then i ran upstairs and hurried to put some little properties together i quite acquiesced in the movement was eager to hasten it in fact the truth is that of wellcot and the convent the latter appeared to me by far the less formidable as a present asylum any further meeting here between me and noel was rendered virtually impossible nor was it likely that the outraged spinster would prove so accommodating to our purposes as the artless little fatties across the valley one need have no fear of being buried alive in a dovecot while i was hastily collecting a few necessaries my sweet girl crept in and made a little sweet nuisance of herself distressing and impeding me there dearest i said as i wrought preoccupied you are the best of loving chickens and i shall have plenty of use for you by and by only at present there dont pout i am too jubilant in the prospect of escape to cling and kiss and cry with you im not going to lands end only across the way and mind no more communications from a certain gentleman miss unless on my behalf she promised with new floods of tears then i said pushing her playfully away find me my vinaigrette child father pope is going to convey me in the carriage xii i am infamously retaliated on i remember once dining in sorrento with the marquis de p a most exclusive sybarite and dilettante the table was spread with a flesh silk damask whose very touch was a caress before each of the company a small and appreciative one was placed one iridescent venetian goblet and a bunch of lavender in a floss silk napkin nothing else whatever the room vaulted into moorish arabesques and swimming with a slumberous half penetrable light in which the crusted gold of stalactites high in the groining alloyed and confused itself with the stain from purple windows gave upon a dusky pillared court where zithers and the plash of a fountain wedded in soft music and the breath of orange blossoms made us a dim impalpable barrier against the world the plates were served each ready charged and each with a golden spoon only for knives were not to be allowed to sever this dream of sensuous rumination there was but a single wine the chteau yquem which is reserved for the nobility of its district and which never goes beyond but in a few favoured directions we talked but little and idly with a mingling of delicious sighs and happy low laughter towards the end the zithers ceased the remote fountain tinkled alone and a girl a ghost of loveliness danced and wreathed herself without in a flood of moonlight it was all perfect satisfaction without surfeit of such is the kingdom of heaven and yet there are times when i wonder if my host has gone to join lazarus or dives mon ami i am often full of such wonders and then sometimes when perhaps i have not kept the perfect proportion and my head aches i think i will end my days in a convent and purify my wicked digestion on lentils and spring water only where is the convent i have seen some in my day and in not one have they cultivated their little paradise on cabbages i find myself standing aghast on that neutral ground between the world and the church and alas there are so many other nice people standing there to keep me company with such this desert itself becomes an eden and on either side i cannot escape from it but into another the convent of perpetual invocation received me with open arms from my morose jailer it conducted me in the person of its mother to the sunny parlour and there sleeked and patted me fondly you dear she said i am so glad we have got you at last her coif looked as if she had slept in it and her plump hands were by no means over clean she was a stumpy beaming little woman moist with good living her skin worked so freely and in such prosperous folds it might have made a dyspeptic sigh with envy i felt at home with her directly there dear she said you have brought us many good things in your time but none so good as yourself and now we take you in pledge of better it may have been meant as a little sly spiritual reflection but she smacked her ripe lips over it as if she already tasted in me as madams direct protge a very plethora of venison and larded fowls for many years i believe these good little women had been secretly looking forward to the term of my novitiate as their gastronomic millennium i could laugh i declare with remorse to think how the dear pink little pigs were defrauded i had been delivered without directions but with a surly intimation that madam would call on the morrow it was not my business to enlighten anyone and so i enjoyed the best of my present favour she trotted me out by and by to see her asparagus and strawberry beds fat in promise though tucked now and slumbering under their autumn blankets of manure her hives her mushroom pits her stewpond thick with fat carps stuffed up to the neck and something her own shape her pigeon cotes and rabbit hutches there was an odd family likeness a general assimilation to the neckless apoplectic type amongst them all sisters animals and vegetables perpetual invocation it was evident had an obliterating effect on the individual i shifted my own dimpled shoulders how long would they be rounding to the contour of these squat little vessels i thought with a certain terror of my admirable digestion and determined as long as i remained here to live sparely what if like the wolf in the fable i were to eat so many fat pancakes that i could not escape through the hole in the wall again that evening we had a refection of sweet bread and fruit and prayers and a delightful supper alas for my resolution and comfortable droning prayers again then we went each to her cosy cell which was like a crib for a fat baby and slept the round of the clock to prayers and breakfast my fellow sisters delighted me i never saw such a community of bow windows the most comfortable little parlours one could imagine for the spirit to be entertained in they had their scapulars made very large and of flannel so as to serve the double purpose of tokens and liver pads at meals we were forbidden to talk a most fattening proscription or prescription prayer at all seasons or out of them was the single ordinance of the society perpetual invocation on behalf of our unenlightened land we were safe perhaps in not considering the logical result of its efficacy or indeed the prospect of a second reformation might have frightened us into heresy for our point once gained our occupation would be gone and our creed of self content be called upon to vindicate itself very likely in self denial however england as yet was far from recanting its heresy of prosperity worship our very fatness was the best argument in the world to it of our right to survive so it showed no tendency to do other than keep us eternally praying for it madam drove over on the day following my arrival and was closeted for a considerable time with the mother i was not summoned to her presence but i think she did not dare to vent her full heart of spleen upon me in her report she could not very well without compromising herself she must have revealed or intimated however so much as give the poor woman a hopelessly bewildered impression of my personal contribution to art for the rest i think she was satisfied with having scotched her terrible little snake and did not doubt that having done so my own sense of final commitment to my calling would keep me immured out of harms way and hers to the end of time it must have been with a feeling of guilty relief that she drove back to conclusions with her inamorato the mother having sent for me on her withdrawal looked at me with the most cherubic doubt and dread and pressed my hand quite speechless dear she whispered all of a sudden so very dcollete and think of the draughts why more than the angels i said pouting they dont wear underclothes they are symbols she answered doubtfully besides we dont know o ma mre i cried whats the good of being an angel if one has to hush she said anyhow they may take liberties denied to us besides this young person was not an angel there you are wrong i cried she was an angel of purity is that so she asked a little curiously well it makes a difference of course but it would have been more becoming of her to be painted by a woman there is the respectable madame kauffmann for instance who i am told depicts religion and the virtues but there dear we will say no more about it only pray to the good father now the naughty little episodes over that we may be accepted meekly into his fold i heard no more from wellcot after this for a couple of days and was beginning already to torment myself with qualms of jealousy of my sweet little vicegerent there being at the last almost driven to break out and precipitate matters when i was saved by a call from the darling herself our meeting to which the mothers presence gave a conventual sanction though fond and cordial would have been barren of result had not my friend with a finesse which delighted me and the more because i had thought her incapable of it rid us of our incumbrance good lud said she after the first embrace twinkling through her tears if i havent left my little basket of cream cheeses for the sisters melting outside in the sun the bait took instant the mother with a little gentle reproof for her carelessness waddled out with such a benevolent glare as though she had heard the last trump wait dears and ill be with you again said she the moment she was gone patty threw herself upon me i hid it under some bushes she said just to keep her hunting and where it wouldnt melt really her second reason was characteristic enough she could never offer the tiniest hurt from one hand without its remedy from the other i foresaw shed whip her children by and by with a strap of healing plaister the poor little weak creature o you naughty little thing i giggled but was serious the next moment questioning and urging her quick i said whats he going to do have you a letter she shook her head hell have a postchaise outside in a night or two and will let you know but for the moment hes watched and darent move or commit himself to paper the hero hes still there then at wellcot if it had been me id have had my servants flog him out of the house o diana how can you say such a thing and you in love with him whom i love i chasten im in love like mrs sophia with myself through him hes going to make me great now tell me whats the state of things there she shook her head rather piteously i dont know its all very sad and lonely without you i think she wants to forgive him but hes proud and angry and holds aloof i turned up my nose with a sniff its nicer to be a healthy sinner her fulsomeness makes me sick and how did you get leave to come and see me i didnt get leave at all she said i darent even ask it feeling sure shed refuse i slipped out without telling hearing cook had something to send i expect shell be very angry when she hears if she hears i corrected her she looked at me with sad puzzled eyes the comical dear how shall i ever bear with it all after you are gone diana she said youll let me come and stay with you sometimes when youre married now patty i said tell me the truth is the creature still making eyes at you no she answered stoutly then added conscience stricken at least i dont know i never look at him but but o diana i wish hed go altogether and leave us you and me as we were thats perhaps not a very kind wish child said i but you shall come and stay with us when once ive got him under control never fear then as i heard the step of the mother returning hush i whispered tell him ive no idea of being buried alive here that he must arrange it very quickly or i shall return and give everything away she answered silently with a hug and a gush of tears she looked haggard and distraught poor little wretch yet i had no alternative but to use her i waited two days longer in an anxiety that rose to distraction still no message came from him and at last i made up my mind and sent him an upbraiding letter by a misbegotten old beldame with a leery eye who helped in the convent laundry she brought me back an answer that he would be waiting for me with a postchaise in the lane without at nine oclock that very night o my friend how dreadful is the first realisation of perfidy in those whom our inexperience trusts this cursed hecate was all the time in the pay of the authorities whom my innocence thought to hoodwink when the time came i wondered indeed to find fortune so blind in my interest so far seemed there from being the least suggestion of suspicion of uneasiness abroad chance appeared to invite me with open portals what sisters i encountered even the mother herself manuvred i could have thought to leave me my way unobstructed miserable parasites of power subordinating their consciences to the lusts of their abominable little stomachs to pamper those they were lending themselves without scruple to a deed of unutterable darkness the consigning of their innocent sister to a living death i found the chaise waiting in a dusk corner beneath trees a cloaked and sombre figure engaging me in the shadow hurried me within leapt after slammed the door and gave the word to proceed in a moment we were tearing through the night so great was the flurry of my nerves i had not until the lamp at the convent gate flashed upon us and was gone noticed that we were four in company then all at once i started the man who sat beside me had removed his hat and was wiping his brow two thick set motionless figures sat facing me easy done sir said one of these ha said my companion yes in a sudden terror i struggled to rise he restrained me mr de crespigny i exclaimed ha said my companion again you hear that willing i hear responded the second of the others gruffly my companion turned to me suavely mr de crespigny he said yes and what about him madam you are not he i cried wildly let me out he was to have met me with a sort of tacit understanding they all hemmed me in with their knees imprisoning and controlling me at once you make a mistake madam said my captor he was not to have met you but be reconciled time and judicious treatment i have not the least doubt will cure you of this delusion in an instant the whole horror of this snare of this most wicked scheme opened like a black gulf before my eyes the convent to anticipate an analogy had been my elba now my st helena was to be an asylum she had discovered or he the dastard had betrayed me and in the result she had not hesitated with the connivance of some sycophant doctor to stoop to this it was night the chaise drove on by back ways i sunk back sick and almost senseless and abandoned myself to despair xiii i am wooed to self destruction dr peels asylum was known generically as the house perhaps in cynical allusion to its licensed irresponsibility to any laws but its own it was conceived on the principle of an eel pot the easiest thing to slip or be driven into the hardest to escape from it was not so much an asylum as an oubliette never so much a house of correction as of annihilation there in addition to the constitutionally weak minded troublesome heirs irreclaimable prodigals jealous wives importunate creditors distinguished blackmailers chance recipients of deadly secrets all such in fact as threatened the peace of that grand seigniory which has a prescriptive monopoly in it could be immured by lettre de cachet it amounted to nothing less from any accommodating physician and afterwards treated or disposed of by private contract its methods were delicate tasteful and exceedingly sure with rib breaking starvation strait waistcoats all the vulgar apparatus of the ordinary mdecin de fous it had no commerce where the removal of undesirables was in question it rather killed with kindness suffocated like heliogabalus with roses persuaded to the happy despatch with a silken cord it drove its poor judases to suicide by putting by as useless their moral reparations and took care to have at hand the seductive means if one escaped a rare occurrence it possessed a kennel of highly trained bloodhounds whose belling warned the dark nights with menace it asked no questions and expected to be asked none its formula was a hint and a cheque the asylum mnage was perfectly refined and its cuisine lavish it entertained none but the nominees of the wealthy the extensive grounds of the house were a literal maze of beauty the shrubberies being so disposed as to preclude all thought of restraint it was only upon piercing them at any point that one found oneself opposed by a high boundary wall which contained between itself and the estate it enclosed a waste interval incessantly patrolled day and night by the asylum watch then indeed one realised the iron hand in the velvet glove and started back dismayed from the grin of the nearest sentry whom ones movements had called light footed to the spot a fine view mum he might say stepping up between ingratiatory and insolent was you looking for anything whereupon one would do best to retire and precipitately because there was no appeal from any brutality offered in his own domain by any servant of or partner in this lawless oligarchy rising from my little bed and mattresses full of fragrance and down on the morning first after my arrival rising fevered and exhausted to the full realisation of my awful position my eyes encountered the vision of a wholesome even luxurious little chamber and through an unbarred window a most heavenly prospect i could hardly believe in the reality of my fate this was no prison but an inn to escape from which it seemed only necessary to pay the score and have the landlord cry bon voyage i remembered him the night before a little tough square man drily courteous in manner with the head and depressed forehead of a burglar he had been already on the steps to receive me when we drove up standing in a patch of light with an expression on his face as if we had caught him in the act of breaking into his own premises those we had reached within two hours of my first kidnapping by dark and devious roads they stood remote from all other homesteads a little colony self contained some six miles south of shole on the way thither i had soon abandoned all thought of resistance or of appeal to my captors they may have heard my sobs and prayers with a certain emotion virtuous distress had no chance to prevail with cupidity i sunk into a sullen apathy my heart smouldering with rage principally against the craven who had either betrayed me to this living death or at least had weakly acquiesced in my doom the prospect of revenge though alternating with despair alone preserved me from a condition of the last prostration and in this state i was driven up to the house and to it consigned the sold slave of madness in the first terror with staring eyes a storm in my breast that would not rise and break dishevelled hair and it may be a look of the part i was called upon to play i shrunk into a corner of the room into which i was introduced and stood there panting dr peel went into a thin chuckle of laughter curiously small and inward from so thick set a frame brava said he very well observed madam but if you will look round you will see there are no bolts no bars no locks here save as the ordinary appurtenances of a domestic household there were not indeed to the common view to most doors as i came to discover the locks were inside and where it was otherwise it was mark this to insure from any chance insane attack especially at night the lives of those which it was particularly desired should be preserved to be given the full freedom of the house was always a significant privilege implying as it did one of two things either that the proprietor had accepted at the outset a round sum down for ones perpetual incarceration or a hint that ones accidental removal would be handsomely acknowledged by those interested now as i said waking on that first morning to free prospects my spirit experienced a rebound to the most delightful reassurance surely i thought no worse harm could be designed me than the punishment implied in my enforced temporary detention in this charming home where it seemed likely a nominal deprivation of ones liberty was used to convey a gentle moral or adorn a kindly tale of reproval i waxed jubilant if a meek acquiescence in my fate delayed to move my jailers to liberate me i was confident that my wits would soon find me a way to free myself from so indulgent a thraldom and in the meantime i would resign myself to the enjoyment of a very novel experience a loud bell summoned us all to breakfast la table dhte in a pleasant refectory dr peel took the head of the table and a plenty of attentive lackeys waited there was no restriction nor interference with ones individual tastes i accepted silently the place assigned me between a gaunt supernaturally solemn gentleman with mended clothes a wigless head and prominent fixed eyes and the tiniest most conceited looking creature with humped shoulders i have ever seen an uproarious gabble of conversation interspersed with occasional hoots and groans accompanied the meal throughout occasionally my solemn neighbour would turn to me and remark fiercely as though daring a contradiction enough is as good as a feast but more than enough is less than nothing on the third repetition of this formula the little man on my other side addressed me with an ill tempered chuckle bring him down maam bring him down or the creature will scorch his head in the moon while i was shrinking back in confusion dr peel bent to the solemnity captain says he with an ingratiatory grin youre drinking nothing i dont want anything said the other in a loud bullying voice nonsense answered the doctor you must keep up your character here john he spoke to a lackey who was ready on the moment with a decanter to my amazement the man filled up the gentlemans breakfast cup with raw brandy he shifted glared hesitated and caught up the pungent stuff enough is as good as a feast but more than enough is less than nothing howled he and swallowed the fire at a draught he had hardly consumed it when he cast the cup into splinters on the board staggered to his feet and moaning to himself left the room the conversation died down for a moment and was instantly resumed more recklessly than ever i felt suddenly sick he he sniggered my little companion hes been long taking his hint the fool and outstaying his welcome but peels done it at last i do believe i did not ask him what my spirit felt engulfed in deep waters of terror i sat dumb and shivering till the meal ended and the company broke up and dispersed itself about the grounds many rude curious fantastic came about me to inquire mockingly or fulsomely into my malady to all their solicitations my little companion who had appropriated me turned a rough shoulder and rougher tongue the lady has confided her case to me you pestilent cranks he screamed and succeeded in extricating and convoying me to a remoter part of the grounds on the way we encountered two men like gamekeepers carrying a ghastly sheet covered burden on a litter ho ho said my friend stopping it was arranged for the tower was it now lookee here jimmy said one of the carriers while the two paused for a moment youre too precious fond of poking your nose where you aint wanted you are you go along to your games and leave your elders to theirs till youre growed up grown up screeched my companion whose chin indeed was thick with a grey bristle grown up you puppy you calf you insolent lout crazy in a moment he danced in the path screaming and shaking his fists the men resumed their way laughing suddenly he caught himself to a sort of reason white and shaking they want to drive me to it he said they want me to break a blood vessel but i see through them and i wont be drawn he wiped his forehead and looked anxiously up in my face you see it dont you he said the fools are envious of my inches but you aint are you being a woman no no i said smiling in a sort of ghastly spasm in full understanding of his mania no no or should i select you for my champion in this let us go on please was that yes he answered the question that my fainting spirit shrunk from formulating yes it was the captain good riddance to a conceited ass he strutted along pluming himself on my praise all that i have stated the truth about this smiling damned gehenna i drew from him then or thereafter i cannot recall it now without a shudder like deaths once that morning we came in a retired corner upon the prettiest greenest graveyard the sweetest gods acre god pity it in all the sad world it was studded with quiet flowers screened with fragrant shrubs thick with graves each a nameless grassy barrow what depth of tragedy in it all i cannot i vow dwell any longer on the picture but must cover the details of it at a gallop i was nine weeks before i found release in this appalling hell a time the most stupendous of my life i will acquit the lady sophia of intending the worst i cannot acquit her of implying it whether from jealousy or a true conviction as to the unpardonable nature of my recreancy she failed at least to assure the instruments of her cruelty that my death sentence was not intimated in the bond it is possible she may have been totally ignorant of the real character of the place to which she condemned me she is none the less responsible for the conclusions the rhadamanthus of that inferno elected to draw from her dubiety anyhow i am convinced that my destruction was designed before i had been there many days in the meantime o my alcide pity thy diane what had she done to merit this fate the most awful that could befall a brilliant sanity very very soon that early buoyancy was like nothing but the memory of a bright star that had exploded and scattered as soon as realised a sickness a deadly apprehension took its place a sense of some creeping circumventing terror which hemmed me in stealthy and pitiless concentrating my thoughts on a single point in this cursed paradise i was inoculated with the disease of the morbid intellects about me my reason suffered deliberate contamination by the remorseless ghoul my keeper no fewer than three times during my short sojourn in his inferno did the corpse of a self destroyer witness to the success of his methods they went to swell the bloody tally of shrouds under the grass in the little graveyard and thinking of them there their awful waiting testimony i would look up to find the evil eye of their murderer fixed upon me in covert lustful speculation for long i remained incredulous that my wit could be utterly impotent to devise a means to escape gradually only the sinister watchfulness which guarded every outlet of this green prison and the fiendish incorruptibility of its warders was bitten into my brain pleas and graces were accepted for nothing but an encouragement to unwelcome attentions indeed it was not supposed that one could be insane and modest many sold their virtue for a little surcease from tyranny bartered their dearer than life for a poor extension of living at the same time and for the same reason a most rigid embargo was placed on all communications with the outside world worse than a russian censorship doomed these utter exiles from hope in the worst of my despair i had written to patty to de crespigny begging them to intercede for me with the cruel woman who yet could not be aware of the inhuman character of her revenge finally i wrote to madam herself an appeal that would have melted a heart of stone my cries were uttered into space they were never allowed in spite of all specious pretence to penetrate the boundaries of my doom they recoiled only upon my own fated head precipitating its calamity and the swifter because i was persistent in justifying my birth name to my hateful would be destroyer the little craze they called jimmy was my sole stay and buckler he attached himself to me vigorously and by his quickness and waspishness more than made up for his lack of inches i never knew who he was or immured at whose instigation there was warrant anyhow for his detention yet not sufficient it appeared for his removal his philosophy of madness was just a counterbuff to that of the deceased captain if in short more than enough was less than nothing then less than nothing was more than enough wherefore jimmy twitted with being less than nothing knew himself really to be greatly better than most though he could never get over the envy of smaller souls in refusing him the credit of his stature what is apparently little is relatively great he often assured me while bemoaning his inability to knock the truism into the thin asparagus heads that shot above his own sturdy one he spent the most of his time and i with him in what was known as the workshop a detached ivy grown shed buried amongst trees very private and with a deep well in it and furnished with all sorts of dangerous tools for cranks of a mechanical turn there he wrought incessantly for he was a capable carpenter and there watching and helping him i strove to forget something of my misery one morning entering this shed we found a little group of employs gathered about the well talking and laughing and fishing with a long grapnel a partition separated us from the obscene crew whose movements unobserved by them we crouched to watch a thousand to one its old star jelly whispered my companion twas plain from the first the creature was booked they hauled it to the surface while he muttered a sodden body caught by its waistband and doubled backwards and slopped their hideous burden on the floor the white sightless face settled backwards as if with a sigh of rest and i could hardly refrain from a scream of terror i had known this poor thing for the few days since he had been admitted a wreck so torn so noisome so straining the remnant of life through fretted lungs it should have seemed a mockery to precipitate its end i had known and never till now seeing it clothed in the white uniform of death had recognised it it was the mad incubus of ruperts folly caught somehow tripping at last and consigned to his doom the red earl had succeeded by long waiting in curing himself of this itch he was one of a deadly persistent family that night i could not even cry myself to sleep i dont know how it was that i was at last driven to visit the suicide tower i had caught glimpses remote in the grounds of a picturesque creeper hung pagoda set in flowering thickets but had always since that first morning of deadly association with it turned with loathing from the sight now somehow by degrees the thing began to impress itself with a certain fascination on me i felt drawn to it by a horrible curiosity none the less morbidly self indulgent because i knew that my jailer a proselyte of the subtle mesmer had long been practising to master my will and get me entirely under his influence snuffing here nibbling there as it were like a heifer approaching in pretended unconsciousness the stranger in the field i gradually lost my power of resistance the circumference of my orbit slowly lessened until behold one day the attraction found me helpless to oppose it and with a little cry to myself i yielded and went rapidly towards the tower as i approached the spot i could hardly feel my limbs my soul penetrated with a sort of exquisite nausea seemed already straining to leave the earth a mist luminous vaguely peopled eddied before my eyes perhaps a confidence derived from the possession of my duck stone which all this time i had been jealous to preserve using it even occasionally in moments of prostration for a drug to my nerves conduced to my undervaluing the force of temptations to which i owned such a counter charm in any case i made so little resistance in the end that the evil thing concealed amongst the thick bushes by the tower whence and whither he had drawn me by his spells must have chuckled to see me so easily netted the place was perfectly silent and beautiful a tinkle of water a twitter of birds reached my ears from some remote height the tower sprang from a circular platform of stone went up loftily and broke at near its top into two or three little tiled flounces under the lowest i could see an opening pierced through a rose trellis and right before me the unlatched door of the building was reached by a shallow flight of steps my heart was fluttering like a netted butterfly as i mounted them what sinister design could possibly obtain in this still and fragrant enclosure a flight of spiral stairs going up the interior was set in a very bower of plumy palms and ferns and clambering rich mosses made greener by the light which entered through green jalousies here and there tiny rills of water lowering themselves down miniature precipices were fretted into spray that hung in the twinkling emerald atmosphere and was showered on the leaves caged cunningly amidst the foliage birds of brilliant plumage chirped and flirted or red squirrels sprang and clung staring at me with glossy eyes or lizards liquid green as the sun through lime leaves raised their pulsing throats and whisked and were gone once a snake raising a gorgeous enamelled head lashed its thread of tongue on the glaze of its little prison seeming to taste my passing beauty in a wicked lust i felt quite secure and happy up and up i climbed and presently started singing softly irresistibly in response to the growing rapture of my flight new beauties were revealed with every step until in a moment passing at an angle through a very thicket of blossoms into white daylight i saw the meaning and tottered on the brink of it all i had emerged upon a little ledge a foot in width which ringed the outside of the tower just below the first roof i was standing there suddenly instantly with not so much as an inch of parapet between my feet and the edge behind was the wall of the tower below a reeling abyss and the bare merciless pavement dazzled irresistibly drawn forward i longed only to reach the stones and be at rest but in that terrible moment my talisman occurred to me swaying half fainting fighting for every movement i succeeded in drawing it from my pocket and lifting it to my nostrils and instantly my resistance was relaxed and i floated down on the wings of enchantment when i opened my eyes drugged and smiling it was to the vision of dr peel standing before me like an awed and baffled demon he dressed his twitching features and came and cringed are are you much hurt he stammered no sir i murmured not at all i thank you it was your skirts ballooned he said i could not have thought it possible i sat up reordering my hair do you now i said quietly such an escape could hardly come within your calculations i think what do you mean he began loudly and as instantly collapsed again you had no right to be there at all he said nor should i i replied but to show you that virtue may have a familiar as well as vice and one too capable of answering to a wicked challenge i got to my feet as i spoke he stared at me utterly disconcerted and as i withdrew followed me like a scourged dog from that time he sought rather to preserve than to destroy me and i found myself as one of the elect locked into my room at night he had realised i suppose that wickedness could over reach itself in the chance entertainment of spirits potent beyond the worst it could of itself evoke and though he still clung to me as a sort of hostage for his own miserable salvation made many abject efforts towards my conciliation amongst which i had great reason to reckon a relaxation in the watchfulness which had hitherto dogged my every movement xiv i am rescued by my monster have you not noticed my little friend how the wicked are always the superstitious it is because life is to them full of dark corners in which the unsuspected hides the atheist will still be for baiting a deity whose existence he denies he will wring a response from a vacuum which failing he fears to canvass emptiness for the reason dr peel knew well the impotence of virtue to conquer he saw it of such poor force in the world as to figure of no moment at all in a contest with vice he did not fear god but he feared that the devil was god and vindictive where the harming of his protges of whom he had no thought but that i must be one was concerned he had been eye witness of the to him unaccountable foiling of his project and it struck him as if he had fallen upon an ambush in one of those dark corners he shrunk back terrified and thenceforth exchanged his noisome attentions to me for an attitude of propitiation which was as unwelcome and even more stultifying in seeming to my hopes inasmuch as it included an increased jealous concern for my safeguarding but there in the end his service of his dark master was made to recoil upon his own head through his very scepticism of the more divinely cunning power which works for good he would lock me as i said into my room at night thereby securing me not only from prowling evils but an asylum in which i might ponder undisturbed what plans i could of escape and it was that security from interruption which enabled me presently to realise on an opportunity of which i was quite unexpectedly made the mistress it fell early very cold and wintry that november but the chill in my heart was colder than any hailstones presently such an apathy of despair found me that i would hardly leave my room all day but would sit in a sullen misery gazing gazing from my unbarred open window upon the fraction of stiffening world it commanded it was at a front angle of the house pretty high above the ground and under it the stony drive went round an elbow of lofty trees to the fatal unseen gates of the entrance beyond one morning after breakfast i was seated there when a chaise rolled up to the steps of the door below and a moment later dr peel entered and was driven rapidly away on some fresh marauding devilry i conjectured the vehicle sped by a heart whole curse from my lips had disappeared scarce a minute when round the bend of the shrubs it had taken came striding the oddest figure an interloper by way of the open portals it seemed such an event had never in my knowledge happened before i stared and roused myself elate even over this momentary grotesque vision from the world beyond it was just a stilt walker a monstrous pierrot with floured absurd face and conical cap his legs cased in linen trousers rising an immense height from the ground as he came on ridiculously gyrating he blew a pipe and rattled at a little tabor that hung from his neck in the same moment he saw me where i stood and danced up rolling and wallowing for he was an incomprehensibly great creature for such a trade and broke into a mad jerky little chaunt half french half english as he approached o ha mamselle je vous trouve je vous salue a la fin beold the mountaineer he sik for edelweiss i have found my dear very high and very nice he flicked off his cap with a grin that showed though against the flour a set of perfect teeth and in three strides was at the window his eyes and huge white face above the level of the sill even in the instant as if the former were a cypher momentarily isolated for my reading i understood and was stricken to stone the graveyard whispered the pierrot in that instant be at the wall over against it at ten oclock to night and reeled away to a pantomime of grins and pirouettes as the lodge keeper came raging round the corner in pursuit o que nenni d cried the intruder twisting and turning and affecting to bend with laughter o madame o fie i am very honourable zjentlemans wat i say i make you good proposals to marry i display my parts vl he contorted himself with absurd coquetry wat he protested pausing madame declines of the ravishment she does not move herself to fly with me vair well he pretended of a sudden to espy his pursuer and pressing his cap to his breast waltzed up to him hey my little fellow he cried the lodge keeper was at least as big as daniel lambert it is for you then you know the best wat is good i will not abduct madame i will not marry at all it is vair much satisfaction you see me dance hein come on jolly garon love miscarries heh when a man marries heh when a mans single he live at his is you spik french but yes the lodge keeper hawked up a glair of oaths and discharged them he swore by all his gods that he would cut off the intruder by the legs unless he went out and double quick the way he had come then ensued a comical scene the pierrot affecting to retreat after a brief altercation swerved suddenly and seated himself on the branch of a tree o ho he said as the other came lumbering up it is vair well but i make up my mind i refuse madame it is true you know to marry what it is listen then at the end of one year one baby that is jolly fun the lodge keeper cursing made a snatch at the mans stilts but incredibly strong he whipped them up out of reach and held them so horizontal at the end of two year two baby how it is a little serious he sang the lodge keeper swore and jumped till he was running wet for all the cold but he was too fat a fox for these grapes at the end of three year three baby but that is the very devil bawled the pierrot ferociously and clashed the stilts like great castanets then he settled himself firmly one asks for bread bellowed he and suddenly flourishing his right stilt caught the lodge keeper a stinging smack across the head with it another for soup he yelled and gave such a counter blow with his left that the lodge keeper fairly reeled and went rolling over laut qui demande tter et les seins sont tarie shouted the pierrot and was up and out of sight in a moment striding like talus the infuriate lodge keeper rose when he had recovered himself to pursue but he was too late the pierrot had got clean away not till all had been vanished many minutes did i awake from the stunned trance into which i had been thrown by those few whispered words then still by the window i sank upon the floor and simultaneously into a very reel and passion of ecstasy how had he traced me whence devised this strange method of procuring speech ah as to that there were no doubt experiences in his past life still unrelated and after all did he not always in a measure strictly in a measure walk on stilts this was only to extend his wooden legs indefinitely but after what secret practices and suspicions averted for i held him still the creature of his despicable master my gogo for it was he my gogo the great resourceful affectionate crippled giant it was inexpressibly touching to me to know myself the poor persecuted wistful dupe of fate still the cynosure of this burning soul not forgotten schemed for held the sacred object of its desire all the time i had thought myself abandoned he had been weaving a ladder for my despair good gogo dear kind honest caliban he would save me yet he would save me and the tears flowed from my eyes how was he such an actor it was true i had known hitherto only one side of him the saturnine the shadow of the great fallen rock ah he could show a lighter for my sake little roguish sparklets twinkling in the sun of his hot yearning i loved him at that moment and my tears fell for him and myself but stay what had he whispered i must remember at ten oclock the wall over against the graveyard why had he so chosen so nicely specified did he know nothing of the patrol yes likely but it was a desperate expedient calculated upon a possible superstition upon a presumptive avoidance of so haunted a spot i pressed my hands to my wet forehead and tangled hair he had dared and done all he could the rest was for me whom he knew and could trust i would not be unworthy i would answer to him wit for wit half an hour later serene and wicked as he could have wished i took my way singing into the grounds and unaccosted sought that remote quarter where the graveyard was situated still softly singing i pushed between the trees and came out into the waste interval against the boundary wall which was devoted to the watch stooping here to pick some chance berries i had not to wait a minute before the local sentinel as i had calculated was upon me i dropped my spray with an aspect of alarm that struggled into piteousness o i am so sorry i said the man he was personable enough to make my task the less nauseous eyed me insolent and masterful all right he said blow me if you aint done it now why dont you know as this heres prisoners base and youre out of bounds i went up to him fearlessly and taking his hands muffled in great hairy gloves looked up into his face i saw a spot of deeper colour come into his cheeks and he breathed fast shall i confess i said low and urgent and glancing quickly about me that i wanted to be caught ah he said and showed his teeth in a twitching grin hush i whispered i am in great despair you know perfectly well i am sane i shall die if i am detained here longer o will you he responded listen i said flushing and hanging my head i offer you no money which i have not got but there are things other things sold here which i tore my hands away and putting them to my face fell back from him hey he said in a thick whisper and pursued me why do you pick me out for your favours you little beauty i did not answer why he insisted if it has to be i muttered from my refuge you o dont ask me why he said well of twenty evils choose the best looking he gave a low chuckle come along where we can be private said he and put a hand on me but i started back affecting an agony of shame o what have i said what promised let me go dont think any more of it wont i he said and added threateningly youve given your promise remember i looked about me and again upon my twined fingers to night then at at ten oclock where in the workshop you can get out yes i have a way that you have he said coveting me with his eyes and a pretty one my darling i entreated him once more in a passion of emotion if if i consent youll hold to your part of the bargain eh he questioned help me to escape no fear o my forgetting he answered you may lay to that i knew he meant to betray me in the double sense and would have given more than i feigned to barter at that moment for the leave to beguile him to me and slip a knife into his lying throat but i tasted part of my revenge in the thought of his freezing alone there by and by in the rendezvous to which my wits had decoyed him while i went to my other undisturbed he was jealous of me and suspicious still of so light a surrender but the prize was worth the risking and in the end he let me go gloating over my stealthy retreat as a cruel schoolmaster might watch the slinking away of a delinquent whom he had ordered up for punishment later that night fell a harder frost with glittering stars but no moon early secured in my sanctum i awaited the great moment in such an indescribable agony of mind as i have never felt before or since every step near my door was a tread upon a nerve the stable clock when it rang out clear and sonorous the last quarter after nine seemed to brain me with its every stroke i stole to the open window took intent stock of the quiet seated myself poised to spring on the sill and passed my duck stone at a little distance under my nostrils the next instant i had alighted safely on my feet and reeling against the wall beneath stood a minute to recover the next i was round the angle of the house and sped into the dark shrubberies where were safety and concealment going very softly in my stockinged feet and careful of my knowledge not to penetrate the thicket until close upon the appointed place i reached my goal upon the stroke of the hour well whispered a voice from the starlight i could trust you he had been stretched recumbent on the wall top and now rose cautiously to my view no longer the whitened fool but the true gogo of my affections i looked up at him as from a well and he swung his long stilts over as he sat so that they rested on the ground beneath quick he muttered without a moment lost swarm i cant bend heaven knows how i did it with no better show of grace than lady sophia i fear but somehow i scrambled up until he could reach my hands and haul me with a mighty power beside him then once more swing went his legs and there was the ladder for my descent on the other side i clung to him convulsively i kissed his hands i could not refrain from sobbing o gogo i said what you have saved me from o gogo what his breath caught like a wounded lions not yet he whispered there is far to go first put me down then i answered alert in the stress of things no he said on my back quick you are going to carry me there are bloodhounds he replied there must be no tracks but the stilts no scent for them to follow then i understood the fulness of his plan but still i lingered amazed i am not a child what strength though yours could bear me so he showed me a long staff that leaned to him against the outer wall there is my third prop he said when i am driven i can still seat you upon a branch and save the scent the ground is iron and he struck his chest these ribs come and let me wear my heart upon my sleeve the next moment we were off the great creature swayed beneath me like a tree but he never staggered or faltered save periodically to rest himself and me the sweet night wind blew upon my face cold and colder i snuggled from it into the vast nape of his neck which was like a mat for warmth i had no idea or care whither he was taking me and the knowledge only that it was by roads deserted at this silent hour still he held on and when frost and weariness threatened to numb my brain could spare a strong hand to imprison both mine lest i fell and still the flight endured and i asked could ask no question not even when i grew penetrated by a dull consciousness of ascent of my comrade straining and toiling beneath me like a stricken sisyphus of the groaning of the giant spirit in him who would not be subdued then at last came a pause and darkness and release and i felt myself swung gently down to rest upon a mat of scented leaves whose warmth and fragrance wooed me to such a sleep as i had never known before xv i become an inmate of ruperts folly i awoke flushed and happy as a dormouse from its winter bed of leaves the world was good again with all its potentialities of love and freedom the sun was somewhere seeking me there was no ache but the sweet ache of memory in my whole heart and body locality i have said before has never influenced my temper i make the only reservation now of liberty to change it at my will i remained some time with my hands beneath my head taking stock motionlessly of my new surroundings they were odd enough i lay near the wall it seemed of a sort of circular ground chamber or cellar roofed in at an inexplicable height above me twice at intervals between projecting corbels appeared to show the one time existence of upper floors which having either rotted away or been removed had left the chamber of a height quite disproportionate with its ground dimensions in lieu of stairs a make shift ladder went up into the roof at a crazy angle and disappeared through a trap but it started from the ground so close to a rude fireplace in the wall that its butt was scorched and more than one of the lower rungs snapped in its socket over the floor itself were scattered tokens of some late or present occupation a common table a rush chair or two battered saucepans a greasy gridiron and hanging on the walls a frowzy account of clothes a line stretched across a segment of the room had once held suspended a litter of foul washed clouts but the string had broken and its filthy load been kicked aside or trodden into the floor half brick half muck which paved the apartment there were no windows but at irregular intervals narrow loops such as one sees in old castles and the single ground opening was a doorway which let in just such a smear of daylight as served to emphasise the uncleanness recognising in all this the reverse of familiar i let my wondering eyes travel round to the parts more contiguous to my bed and so gave a little pleased start and smile there like guardian posts to my slumber were the long stilts leaned against the wall their straps hanging loose and pendent from a nail close by was the very clowns dress of my memory i could have drawn it to me and kissed it but contenting myself with conceding to it a sigh of affection i sank back and closed my eyes lying thus deliciously half submerged in a very nest of dry fern and with a heavy cloak for blanket over me i would delay luxuriously the moment of revelation but it was very evident i thought that gogo had brought me to some wrecked and deserted mill suddenly unable to rest longer i peeped he was going softly about the hearth preparing something at a little fire whose every thicker waft of smoke he would jealously dissipate with his hands he still feared observation then watching him silently my heart welled up with a gush of love for the dear patient faithful monster gogo i said softly he started looked across and came to me at once stumping over the floor in a rapture of response he took a stool and sitting on it by me gazed eagerly into my face his own animal sinful and divine looking from a very burning bush of stubble smiling in a drowsy warmth i put out a hand and let him imprison it in his own ah foolish little bird so to commit thyself to the snare of the fowler i thought he would have killed it and tore it back fluttering and wounded o how could you i cried i was so happy and you have hurt me he leaned in a hoarse agony to me his breath groaned in his chest o come to me he implored while i make one mouthful of you then all in an instant he was sobbing and tearing at his short hair and crying incoherently what have i done to wound my dear ride me flog me use me but trust me no more bitter bitter are the gods who make a man stiff kneed for their sport not love or penance for me never never never to kneel to lie prone only for a show o child it seems a little thing not to kneel but ah to see others pray and love yourself forbidden what pity what pity i am the olympian fool i am the ass and clown behold my livery he pointed to the dress on the wall and hung his head and arms in a very grief of despondency but by now my hurt and little fright were gone and my heart touched again to softness gogo i said give it me down please and he looked up wondering and stirred and obeyed this and this and this i said in pledge of our one day contract before jove or jehovah when the maimed shall be made whole my tears dropped on it as i kissed it three times and gave it back to him he received it wonderingly first then sadly and held it drooping over his knees whole he muttered ay i dont question i shall find my legs in avalon but can even jove restore the rifled flower its honey suddenly he cast himself down beside me groaning like a bull o little maid little maid i am a beggar i am a beggar but i want no reversion of a used estate though my own goes lame i am proud give me new minted money that no man has worn in his pocket or none at all for a moment the great human urgency of the creature made me falter i owed him so much could the devotion of my life more than repay him but alas it needed but a little reflection to see the fond ridiculous picture the caricature it was had i the right even to risk a new generation of gogos i saw myself in imagination walking abroad the proud convoyer of an uncountable number of little shock headed dutch tumblers perhaps if our sovereign king had received that carpenters petition and brought wooden legs into fashion i might have been tempted but it was still the vogue to walk on ones own feet i sat up my lips twitching perilously near laughter dear gogo i said i am so thankful to you and so sorry and i would not have said or done what i did if i had known it would disturb you so wont you let me get up he scrambled to his feet ah fie upon the unmeant cruelty of the word and stood knotting his great hands while his breast heaved stormily well i think i was mad he roared suddenly strike me stamp on me bind me to a pillar and let the eternal remorse batten on my vitals whatever the spark at my tail it started me up like a rocket and behold me at the end a blackened and empty case he entreated me with his hands ah the pagan sight of you ah your wild hair growing from the fern or melting into it ah your face the very flowering of a hamadryad it wrought a frenzy in my brain forgive me forgive me and i will serve you seven times seven years for the promise only to be godfather to your last your benjamin he sank down on the stool and burying his face in his hands was silent i thought a practical rescue of the situation best and rising from my bed went to bestir myself over the fire which was burning redly moreover a delectable odour had already reached my nostrils from the little caldron he had hung there and whose contents were beginning to inspire me with a very lively curiosity i turned to the poor sufferer gogo please it is very sad but if i am to go on being a hamadryad i must be fed gogo what is in the pot he lifted his head with a sigh snipe he said most tragically ah what else a hare a partridge teal o onions potatoes carrots o o larks chestnuts be quiet lest i cry you are the best of creatures and i am the hungriest eat what you will it is my pot au feu nothing finished before the next is added i can wait no longer you are the hermit of hermits who is your commissariat general who but the child your little friend my miss grant patty he had arisen and come across to me she lays it in a hollow tree twice a week and twice a week i go down by night and fetch it i stood gaping staring at him gogo where are we in ruperts folly in i gave a little cry he seized me by the wrist and dragged me towards the opened door o gogo i choked struggling and resisting we shall be seen what does it matter if we are he said fiercely since you loathe me i wept and fondled him in an agony of fear i dont loathe you you are my one stay and comfort gogo will you give me back to that terror he fell squatting at my feet it was his substitute for kneeling and clasped his arms about my skirt beast he groaned i neither meant nor could help it to play upon your fears to taste love by deputy o forgive me forgive me yes i said quietly for the second time and always because of what you have done but i fear for myself now and shall go on fearing let me go o gogo let me escape into the woods and break my heart on frost and hunger rather than wrong still clutching at me with a look of horror as if he felt the shadow of his last hope eluding him he scrambled erect again hunger he said think of the snipe and teal listen to me diana before god i will not offend again base black coward that i am before god diana i gazed at him intently why have you brought me here gogo because he answered there was no nearer and surer refuge i dont understand ah child but you have not heard the story well i murmured reassured though still shy of him if you will keep your promise and be good you shall tell it me by and by he gave a great sigh and gently disengaging myself i stole to the door while he followed me with his agitated eyes and peered out it was shole indeed and the familiar village green that i saw beneath me looking down the long wintry slope quiet and deserted in the chill mists of dawn no view apparently less tragic less harmful could have greeted me i returned to my companion who received me with a pathetic relief he was quite pale and trembling if my arms had the reach of my heart he said well you have come back and so for breakfast pattys pot said i merrily the dear shall put new heart into me as her wont was he had bread and some bottles of wine a little of which i drank mixed with water it was the loveliest most intoxicating meal and when it was over full of a new grace i bid gogo to my side now said i tell me your story well first he said with a grunt for your safety here it was the astrologers and now is ours he was carried away in a thunderstorm on a red cloud what do you mean gogo please i repeat the common superstition anyhow he is gone and the place is haunted and avoided since not a clown but myself will come within a mile of it and as for me i have lived here for a month undisturbed already you but i know where the poor wretch was taken and where he died in the asylum eh it is what i supposed and the red earl comes to his own tell me about it by and by i want to know first what brought you here the wish to lose myself and be lost where i could devise a plan for your rescue you knew where i had been taken then no perspicacity of mine it was the common report you had lost your head over love unrequited and it had become necessary to confine you for a while o indeed go on i hear your little white teeth clicking rest content you are avenged he has married her i jumped to my feet he de crespigny yes i burst into a shriek of laughter they were reconciled then o the dear particular lady does he wipe his boots on her did he take his love potion very strong on the wedding night very strong no doubt said gogo and then suddenly he clasped my skirt and buried his face in it he would it was his way he muttered o girl spare me and my unhappiness my broken dreams did you not know i had always a struggle to keep him from it and now he will go down down yes i said while she clings to his legs as fools drown together would you not have had her try to save him yes indeed ah you are vindictive dont you hear me laughing yes like the devil is it i should be mad indeed if i could applaud her do you bear in mind what she has done to me she is of the sort who make cruelty their pander a frowsy garterless jezebel o how i hate prudery for five years i longed to open the windows on it and let the air in and whatever wholesome little devils beside i declare i loathe myself to be of her sex touch me gogo am i the same or different o to be sure i wish her joy of her bargain and him she will pay but for noel weak child of genius leave me the sorrow of my broken hopes diana and nothing else why did he not meet me he had not the courage at the last moment and so having cut the ground from under me he stepped back and instigated madam to her little coup de thetre i suppose and helped her to push me over the precipice and you you sympathised with and abetted him ay he said sorrowfully witness my long exile here gnawing my fingers in the hungry moonlight i sank upon the ground in a passion of tears and he mingled his grief with mine child i had loved him and i had but to learn how he had abandoned you to leave him i cursed him cursed de crespigny will jove forgive me what matter if i have saved you i lifted my drowned eyes and agonised arms take me to patty i cried and let me weep my soul out on her kind little heart he shook his head what i said you will not she must not even know he said i could not trust her anxious love she must rest as she is aware of my endless scheming but not of its fruits some day perhaps and in the meanwhile my lady is gone honeymooning there is no hope of appeal to her a breath would redeliver you to your fate and perhaps a worse come and tell me all you have suffered poor mistress i crept to his feet and in broken tones gave him the history of my misery to the day to the hour when he had appeared before me and you have not told me i said how that was once he answered after i had hidden and settled here i was spying through the telescope above ay he interrupted himself to my exclamation they could be bold to capture the dying sorcerer but to meddle with his tools was beyond their courage when i was witness of a characteristic little affaire on the green below there were a stilt walker and his wench a couple of the wandering tribe a long legged bird of passage and his little cocotte of bright plumage i could see her glitter where i stood could see her spangles and the ribbons float from her tambour as she danced and then suddenly my lord viscount was on the scene he had been sporting and carried his gun he had keepers with him they were his own not as might have seemed apter to his wits dr peels and his dogs pointed at the gipsy i suppose anyhow there was an altercation and the next i saw was the clown tipped up by his wooden heels and lying prone they carried off the girl willing or unwilling it would have needed a stronger telescope than the astrologers to discern and presently the poor stunned fool came to his senses and sat up i could see him try to gather his wits with his hand plucking at his brow he was alone who had been in company where were the rest his ravished mate and the mob for whom she had tripped and sung by and by i saw him with many starts and delays unbuckle his stilts and having shouldered them hobble with slow painful steps towards the village he disappeared and till night i sat thinking of him and of the contrat social which m rousseau wrote for the angels and which therefore you would not understand diana though for all my better sense i adore you about dark i descended into the woods at the back yonder and there i came upon my stilt walker seated dying against a tree yes he was dying his fall had shattered some ribs and driven one into his lung and death was already thawing the white snow on his face into patches of blue i carried him up to the tower and eased what i could of his agony and received his last message to the world it is a callous world this world of a world of serf and satan and christianity crushed between but i tell you i would rather give that message than receive it would rather be gogo the clown and pariah than the viscount salted with all his prospective acres well he died and i took a spade and buried him at the foot of the tree where he had rested pray god it bears wholesome acorns for why should he wish to poison the swine his brothers then i inherited his property and a thought an inspiration occurred to me how i might use it was i not wont to stump the country like a halting orator i could stump it to higher purpose now the purpose of your redemption sure the spirit of the dead clown would uphold me for was it not privilege i fought so with no great practice necessary i became a stilt walker and presently ventured afield starting by night reaping my little harvest of pence in the far villages by day and under cover of dark returning gradually i contracted my circuit hovering about your prison and so once upon a time peering over the wall in a wintry evening spied your figure come and go in the light of a high room it might be yours i must dare all and cast the die well fortune favours the fortunate he ended to a little silence poor gogo i said softly it is true i do believe that i am her spoilt doll and i he said her dutch tumbler xvi i put an end to one folly hanging and wiving go by destiny which must be my excuse for accepting the silken cord which was weaving for my neck all this time i knew no more than patient griselda about my impending fate yet destiny was not to be gainsaid because i seemed content to resolve upon gogo for my present welfare and protection he good monster never alluded again during all the days i was with him to his unhappy passion he was slavish in his loyalty to his word and in his attentions to the poor creature so utterly in his power and if i could not but understand the significance of his sighs and oglings and contortions my feigned ignorance of those hieroglyphics was undoubtedly the most merciful of all the tortures i might have inflicted on him thinking of this i find salve for certain bruises on my conscience which nevertheless were i am sure quite unnecessarily self inflicted i acted for the best and with great pain to myself he has admitted this since though confessing he was long in forgiving me i was in the tower in all but four days which nevertheless might have been as many weeks for their tediousness gogo was an incomparable slave and henchman only his devotion necessarily lacked the relish of publicity if i could have had but one other to whom to boast it i could have endured it longer but to be single hearts exclusive fetish immured in his wigwam and appropriated to his sole company was what never appealed to me nor do i believe that it does truthfully to any other we are omnivorous we cant live on spoon meat alone and there is an end of it gogo i said once why are you so attached to me why said he throwing up his hands after his fashion with a sort of protesting groan to the powers that be because i am a creature of surfaces and impressions because drawing my life from the great external of all it is my doom to worship externals we talk of our inheriting the world pooh we are just an itch on the skin of this monster whose dark internals are as remote from us as our own hated organs have we ever a thought of possessing our kingdom think with what terror we contemplate a living burial we are the dust of contact between earth and sky are bandied between space and matter the dross of one or the scum of the other love itself is but the measure of our penetration it is the propagation of superficies it probes no farther and all the time is breathing in the air like a swimmer are my eyes in my feet ask me why i hate the dark and am attached to the light to the brightest gnat of an hour flying within it thank you sir said i and that is me i suppose that is you he said dancing on a window pane and wondering what fate keeps you from the garden beyond and you i said are the spider lurking in the window corner nest ce pas and wondering what fate keeps you from devouring me well you are very complimentary but for my part i would rather have an hours dancing on the surface than possess all the world thats under ay he answered and thats why i covet you now was he not an inexplicable creature and it must be said a depressing moreover for all his advocacy of my cause i could never quite reconcile him to my view of madam remember the day of the picture he would say and how she rebuked us all by her attitude if i testify to your martyrdom diana i must testify to hers that preceded it she is welcome to the palm i cried and may she live long to flaunt her conquest he did not answer and so letting his dissent pass by default put a bar between us that was never quite surmounted in the meanwhile day followed day and the frost held and i was cold and ennuye and still he delayed our flight on the score of peril i had come but poorly clad for the test and i cried and shivered much in our dismal refuge where what fire we could afford must be kept low from dread of the smoke betraying us present food we had and some wine that helped a little to comfort our dejection and on the friday he was due tramping fourteen miles thither and back over the hills to claim his fresh dole of the tree above wellcot where faithful patty who was in his confidence as to his retreat and the means towards my salvation he hoped to make of it was wont to conceal it dear darling how i longed to convey her a message but he would not hear of it of all ephemera he said she is the very transparent bodied fly the secrets of whose own heart she cannot help but reveal so i had to submit and hold her sweet image in my arms o nights when the wind came in at the door and the stars crackled with cold but gogo was right i had to confess when once from the deep woods beyond shole we heard the clanging of bloodhounds and knew that my enemies were vainly seeking the trail which had no existence then i cowered low and felt a new gush of affection for the resourceful giant who was so wise in the singleness of his passion often by day i would climb up the ladder to the loft where the astrologers telescope yet remained commanding like a disused cannon the house and village he had fancied under its dominion and there spend hours spying hungrily for what tokens of life the bitter season afforded they were not many or inspiriting but they served at least to keep me in touch with that world of my fellows that seemed eternally lost to me on the friday i fell at gogos feet safe or unsafe i cried take me away i can stand this loneliness no longer his face was full of a sorrowful ecstasy and it was a garden to me he murmured blind that i am i shall die i cried terribly and you will lay me with the dead clown under the tree so would you be for ever mine he continued in a sort of dream i shrunk from him and seeing my look he cast himself down on his face before me command me as you will he cried only never never bid me from serving you you will go i sat back eagerly canvassing him why should i dream of parting with you are not our fortunes pledged together even if i did not owe you the best of all gratitude you are so wise and brave you will find a plan and a direction only i can stop here no longer o i cant gogo take me away to london anywhere he raised himself spare me this evening to forage he said so that to morrow we can at least start provided in deep night he left me to go to the tree it was the first time i had been abandoned to my sole self so long as i could discern his figure striding over the fields like some unearthly goblin on its high stilts i stood by the door gazing into the starlight then when i could see him no more i sat down just within my back to the vast emptiness and hugged and cried to myself against the long panic of waiting not many minutes had i sat thus when something a footstep a shadow seemed to fall upon my heart with a shock that stopped its beating too terrified for look or utterance i crouched low hoping the thing would pass and leave me unobserved i have come madam to invite you to a safer asylum said a low and musical voice i gave an irresistible cry suppressing it instinctively even in its emission lest it should call back my faithful squire from his long toil across the fields to a need which these gentle tones were far from justifying i struggled to my feet and made myself as small as possible against the wall who are you i whispered an outcast like yourself answered the shadow a fellow sufferer at the hands of the very family to which you owe your misfortunes who are you i could only whisper again i am george rowe it said do you remember me we have met once an ineffaceable impression to me i have followed your career since unknown to you have traced you by the flowers in your footsteps yes even to that wicked place and your flight from it i have watched you since from the woods below have stood at this door at night and listened to your breathing till i maddened have sorely bided my time seeking to speak to you i have tracked the honest tracker your good servant and saviour and while i applaud his devotion must warn you against the equivocal position in which your further acceptance of that devotion may place you i could not see his face but only the dusk of a comely form as it stood now before me well could i recall indeed the good humoured gentleman in the grey coat who had once so espoused my childish cause and earned thereby the hatred of his kinsmen my confidence was returning to me with my wits you are very considerate for us i said deridingly do you come as madam your sisters emissary since you are so particular for my character alas he said you do well to doubt me being so related but i am an outlaw from all that houses influence and consideration an outlaw you i murmured ay he answered ruined menaced and driven forth to nurse my wrongs in hiding why where i asked to the woods he answered like robin hood o an attractive asylum sir for distressed ladies i said he replied maid marian thought so perhaps she had an attachment there said i i miss the application to myself he laughed softly whether we fly from fear or fly to love we fly he said you may hold your enemies too cheap not knowing that my lord makes interest with his sister and for his own purposes to subsidise your dr peel for the sake of the secrets of the prison house he will not leave her solus to the hue and cry you have planted two dragon heads in place of the one you severed i shrunk before him what do you mean how do you know by the token he said that he destined me to your fate and i answered with the better part of valour which you will be wise to imitate to morrow i muttered we had already decided that is not all nor enough he urged you may be una with a rhinoceros and that is not enough my lord rides a thunder bolt it is not enough to flee him you must vanish be no more now all of a sudden i know not how his words seemed to wake me to the fond illusion of my state how indeed was i situated with a legless caliban to show me how to run i had been blinded by gogos devotion to the real nature of the presumption it had thought to justify what honest right had he to have undertaken so responsible a deed save he had provided for it to the last details i felt suddenly very naked and forlorn shiftless and crying like some poor exposed child in the night i clasped my fingers to the shadow entreating it in a broken voice what am i to do advise me help me it moved upon me soft and swift and irresistible i felt my hands imprisoned seized as out of the grave into an assurance of human warmth and sympathy for what else am i here demanded the fervent voice have i not the prior claim have you never thought of me in all these years of what you might be now save for my interference yes i whispered indeed indeed i am not one to forget well he said i am just a vagabond at last and desperate in romance and you your reason is forfeit if not your life be under no delusion about it nor about the real impotence of this good fellow to save you come with me then while there is time and be my little sister i am lonely in the deep woods i did not move or speak but i gazed up intently into the white bloom of his face the strangest thought was struggling for expression in me of some conscious gravitation through all these years towards an affinity which had been shadowed out to me at that first and only meeting i felt no shyness but only a restful confidence in his company was not that strange to be brother and sister one and indivisible in the candid sympathies of nature i recognised in a moment that it was that ideal relationship which had always appealed to me for the best and purest that i could never be happy again divorced from it suddenly the tears were in my eyes if i could truly be your little sister i said and keep house for you as gretel did for the gentle shepherd who had plucked her when a flower he heaved a long sigh full of rapture quick then let me pluck my flower says he and run but now at that for some reason a revulsion of feeling took me i sank down upon the ground away from him and hid my face in my hands no no i cried not yet not now o leave me please perhaps he was wise to understand and temporise anyhow he went though no farther than the door for a moment i hated myself for a moment i felt the basest thing on earth what use to reflect that reason and kindness were on my side that since i could not cure a poor fond fool it were no mercy but the contrary to submit him to the continued infection of my presence i said so to myself and saying it saw his face returning full of light and eagerness to learn the damning truth to be held accursed in that great heart i could not i could not poor gogo had he not given up everything for me i would not desert him why should he not come too but no i saw in the same instant that that was impossible since he himself had no thought no wish to be my brother and perhaps if i went i should never see him again well would not that be the best for him let me nurse my grief eternal so long as he found his cure in separation it were better i should go freed of this incubus he would have no longer need to crouch and starve the world had no reason so far as i knew to identify him with my flight and now every hour he remained with me was an added peril to his safety his very existence quite wild i rose to my feet and went panting to the shadow take me away i said before he breaks my heart returning he took my hand tight in his drew me under the starlight and together we fled down the hill and into the woods xvii i am consigned to a green grave to you my dear alcide conscience is i know a disease and virtue its relapse i do not then ask your sympathy but only your commiseration in that long struggle with my better self in which i was now to engage a struggle which found me child and left me woman a struggle through whose intermittent deliriums moved ever the sorrowful figure of my poor lost gogo yet i must own that the oasis in which this destiny was to be fulfilled figured for a period the greenest in all my desert career it was a dear time in truth a dear abandoned wonderful time until the inevitable disenchantment came alas to take profit of your own unselfishnesses is with a stern providence to convert them into the plainest of worldly transactions no word passed between me and my companion as we hurried deeper and deeper into the fathomless woods sure of foot and it seemed of destination he drew me unresisting by cloudy deeps of foliage by starlit alleys by ways so thronged and massed with trunks as to seem impenetrable often i shrunk before some imaginary charge of shadows often cried out in the silent rush of woodland things across our path there was no wind that could reach and buffet those packed desolations no frost save where in the clearings it could find space to bloom and these for precautions sake we avoided lest our footsteps should betray us on and on we sped till my heart was sick in my breast and i cried out to rest and die but he would not let me stop courage little sister he cried we are within a cast of home we mounted after that a long and gentle hill from whose sides the trees fell away till on the summit there was none but here sunk deep in the crest was as i could discern an ancient gravel pit whose slopes were rough with brake and brush to a giddy distance down come he whispered and clasped my hand secure we descended by a path that was no path to me and at the bottom stooped under a very thicket of bush and gained once more a sense of space and movement but so deadly close shut that for a little i dared not stir come whispered my companion again it is nothing but a cleft in the hill but so overgrown above that no mortal would guess it there still i dared not move when suddenly i felt his arm about me and his lips on mine then i started to myself with a shock of anger is this to be a brother i cried what else he murmured to give his little sister confidence the low laugh with which he said it made my blood fire i could have struck him in my fury go on i said in a repressed voice i have come so far i must follow i suppose will you not let me lead you no you may stumble in the dark not to the fall you think i am sorry very well go on he went before submissively the gully cut straight like a giant furrow through the hill it was narrow and pitch dark sodden here and there with dripping water and always smelling like a vault not once in its entire length so far as i could see did the dense mat of overgrowth thin to that texture that a star of all the hosts above was visible at last he stopped so suddenly that i near fell against him hush he whispered we are at the end can you see enough to follow me yes i said my eyes are opened now he had hard work i knew to suppress a chuckle over my tragic tone well keep them so said he and elbowing up a great pad of foliage beckoned to me to pass i obeyed holding my skirts from him and in a moment discovered myself in the open once more we had emerged it seemed high on the near perpendicular side of another pit or cutting right beneath us shouldering the very steep on which we were perched was the thatched roof of a cottage an open skylight in the midst gaping at us scarce ten feet below so close did it invite us in the bewildering starlight that i was near springing on the thought to gain its shelter but my companion restrained me wait he whispered drily a little of your discretion please doubtful of me he let go his hold reluctantly and stooping once more under the curtain of foliage dragged out a ladder which was concealed behind and which he now with infinite precaution lowered through the skylight till it rested now he said climb down while i hold it firm it was the rudest thing just slats nailed across a pole a ladder for bears not men but i was young and lithe and quickly was down and through and standing trembling over this finish to my adventure on the floor of a little dark invisible room and so before i had time to collect myself the other was descended in my footsteps and the ladder hauled in and laid along the wall and a little silence ensued well said his voice at length you are safe at last little sister then i dont know how it was the tears would come why dont you believe it he whispered groping a step nearer have you given me reason to i answered shrinking from his touch and gulping down my sobs he drew away at once the best reason in the world he said coldly since i have placed my life in your hands since i leave you here the means to escape if you will and curry favour by betraying me i could have cried out on his cruelty but dared not understand this is your sanctuary he went on prepared against your coming and which none in their turn will betray the path to it is sacred to me no one will disturb you you are secure as a bird in its nest there is a bed in a corner rushlight and holder and tinder box on a table by light and take possession i must go and reassure portlock i heard him move softly over the floor a trap opened somewhere letting in a momentary weak film of light and he was gone for a time i stood motionless hearing the murmur of voices somewhere below then suddenly panic struck groped for the table and tinder and shakily struck fire the wick caught flamed up and settled and i saw my possession it was the tiniest kindest little room under a sloping roof clean and friendly with a white bed i was dazed and weary beyond speculation leaving the light burning i crept under the coverlet as i was and fell into a profound sleep xviii i begin another folly i opened my eyes to a sense of utter restfulness and peace a feeling of green isolation of a quiet and guarded security such as not all gogos watchfulness could accomplish for me in the tower came instantly to comfort the first startled shock of my waking little demure clouds drifted over the skylight i heard a faint twitter of birds on the hillside there were woodland berries and flaming leaves in my room pictures too and a dozen pretty attentions to reassure me sure he must have made very certain of his capture before he decorated the cage so handsomely and for how long pray had he held his hand and aloof biding his opportunity he must have kept his secret well at least for i had never known a hint of his presence i smiled and closed my eyes again it was a most endearing thought the thought of that brotherly haunting while i had been bemoaning my abandonment by all the world there was still that in me then to attract admiration to ensure my affinity with the strong and shapely i was sick to death of malformations mental and bodily what had become of him i had not reached the end of my resentment but i did not wish him to think it insurmountable and i was certainly curious to learn how far my romantic memory of him was justified and in the meantime where was i in what remote eyrie of the green forest for all i could see i might be imprisoned in a well i rose and after making my toilette had paused undecided wondering what was to come next when i heard his voice very mock humble at the trap little sister will you come down to breakfast the blood thrilled in my temples but i hardened my heart and answered yes as frigid as a nun he flung up the hatch at once and for the first time i saw the ladder going down into candlelight whence a smell of warm dust and tallow rose to my nostrils he descended before me and i followed into the leanest of little cellars with a rough board on trestles in it and a stool or two the rafters were hung with cobwebs there were a couple of dismal dips in horn sconces on the walls a closed door showed dimly at the farther end and that was all i turned in amazement upon my companion to find him regarding me with a curious expression but it sobered at once before my gaze it was not indeed now i came to con him quite the expression of my memory the sweet humour of it had fallen i could have thought upon more mocking times there was a look in his face as if he had got to love himself the better the worse he had been depreciated by others as if injustice had somewhat crooked the old lines of chivalry but for the rest he was as bronzed and comely as ever as lithe and muscular and the common woodmans dress coarse grogram jacket and leggings to the hips which whether for convenience or disguise he had adopted showed off his fine figure to perfection where is it the breakfast i asked cooking by portlock said he im waiting to pull it through he stood stooping indeed and holding a string in his hand by what looked like a black gap at the foot of the wall beyond the table to pull it through i cried out are we to eat it here he turned his head as he leaned to scan me we can take it up under the skylight if you like said he my room a violent retort was on my lips but something in his face warned me and it died unuttered for all his affected humility there was a masterfulness here i had not guessed i realised on the instant that i did not know had never known him it was not altogether a disagreeable awakening i sat down silent on one of the stools and he addressed me again quietly from his place little sister you have committed yourself to my care very properly i think and very properly trustful of an elder brother do you know my age i am thirty four just double your seventeen and at least worldly wise enough to direct you that is all very well i said half stifled but why have you brought me here have i not told you he answered to save you from a wolf who would have set his teeth in my little white lamb no you have not told me i cried and i am no more lamb of yours than his and anyhow i had my shepherd already a poor shepherd he said witness his watchfulness i bit my lip and said no more for a moment i hated myself and him his specious reasonings which had led me to abandon my honest good comrade and saviour while i sat dumb a low whistle sounded through the wall and instantly he turned to me you do not like your dining parlour he said but believe me it has a thousand conveniences of privacy of which here is not the least and with the word drawing on the string he held in his hand he brought a tray into light it was packed with comestibles bread and honey and collops of venison that smelt royally but when he transferred these to the table i had no stomach for them and pushed away the plate he offered me what you wont eat he said i cant breakfast in a sewer very well he fell to himself without further delay and with plenty of appetite i watched him out of the corners of my eyes half maddened already by the abstinence i had imposed on myself he was dressed like a forester i have said and now i observed that he affected the manners of a forester consciously it would seem effacing in himself the more gentle observances it may have been an effort to him but anyhow he tore his bread and gnawed his bones with the air of one bred to the soil with a set of perfect white teeth too it must be conceded and while he despatched throwing his litter on the board he continued talking to me fitfully yes he said it is very convenient for such as we who desire not only to save our labour but our lives certainly and our self respect if possible you dont ask me where we are i shook my head in indifference well he said you must know some time when you might be more curious and short explanations suit me best we are immured child in a wall and so long as we dont betray ourselves nothing can betray us not even into an acknowledgment of what one of us may owe to the other i am grateful to you i said coldly and said no more the truth is i was hardly listening to him so intense had grown my desire that he would coax me at last into eating something he laughed and pushing his plate away settled his fists on his hips and began like a satisfied man to troll a soft little song i could stand it no longer give me a little piece i said and i will show you how collops should be eaten you mean he answered at once that you will show me how to behave but i have done with all that hypocrisy he rose with the words having finished and to my anger and astonishment cleared the board piecemeal and deliberately and piling all on the tray gave the signal for its withdrawal it disappeared instantly then he returned to his stool and pulling out pipe and tobacco began to smoke placidly fury overcame me have you not forgotten to ask my permission i cried punctilio in a sewer he answered puffing that is hardly to be expected i rose at once i wish to be by myself i said he took his pipe from his lips you know the way if you object to mine there is the ladder in your room and the skylight and all the forest to choose from and he began to smoke again i left him without another word and ascending to my closet dropped the trap with a slam it was an outrage beyond endurance i threw myself upon my bed and wept tears of rage what a fool i had been what a fool to commit my destinies to a savage i had thought romance had come to find me walking on two feet in the starlight and all the time it had been leaving me stumping sorrowfully away on its poor wooden legs my soul gushed out in fresh mourning for the dear monster i had wronged more than once i rose in the full determination to fly and rejoin him as often the hopelessness of my position cast me down again i had no idea where i was i dared not face the prospect of wandering lost and alone in those savage solitudes the wretch had played his part well and for what why for me the thought at last quieted my grief brought me to a little reason after all i had been cold with him something less than grateful what had brought him to repudiate the customs of his caste i fell into a fit of speculation perhaps it was in scorn of an order that had basely disinherited him his words had seemed to imply so perhaps he had meant no more than to read me a lesson in feeling i sighed i was wilful and imperious i knew i said to myself i had been spoilt a little perhaps by admiration and my better qualities obscured it was a wonder he could have seen anything to covet in me was it my part to convince him of his mistake i sighed again and then rose and walked about every detail of the tiny chamber was witness to the loving expectations he had formed of me what was i to do how climb down and keep my place in my own eyes he meant to leave me to resolve the question for myself it appeared all day i waited and hungered and not a sound of his footstep approaching did i hear at length when it was dark quite desperate i took my candle and softly opening the trap listened a moment and descended the cellar was empty only the board and stools and nothing else i went swiftly scanning it holding the light overhead i tried the door at the end it was fast locked unless he had gone out that way there was no accounting for his disappearance all at once i heard the thin mutter of voices his and anothers i was sure seeking to localise them i came upon the low hole in the wall through which he had dragged the breakfast tray i stooped and hearing i thought the whisper clearer sunk to my knees and looked through here was a passage i found to my surprise wide enough for a man to creep by and beyond it seemed a faintly lighted room as i bent i heard the chairs of the talkers drag as if the two were rising and fearful of discovery fled on tiptoe to my room once more and noiselessly closing the trap stood panting and rigid by it to what dark mystery was i being made the innocent and unconscious accessory i felt suddenly bewildered and terrified the light in my hand swayed and leaped evoking gusty phantoms on the wall a wind seemed to boom in my brain i was really light headed with hunger i think presently from sheer giddiness i threw myself on my bed once more and fell into a sort of waking stupor in the midst after how long i know not a voice reached me he was summoning me if i needed it to supper if i needed it what cruelty he would not give my pride a chance half in fear half fury i turned my face to the wall and did not answer he wasted no time on me i heard him withdraw in a moment whistling i had hoped he would think me escaped would venture in perhaps panic struck to encounter the full torrent of my indignation but he showed no concern whatever he felt secure of his wretched little trapped bird i supposed and he was justified was justified then i cried as i had never cried before he might have had some patience some consideration at last quite famished and exhausted i fell asleep i awoke in full day to find him standing over and regarding me i felt weak and too utterly subdued to resent his presence as it deserved there was no pity in his eyes even then i closed my own feeling my throat swell i thought you might be hungry he said are you at that for all my efforts the tears came dont you know i said but i suppose you think to starve me into submission submission to what said he you were offered food and refused it but i have brought you some bread he held out to me a dry crust i turned from it in anger o very well said he and was returning it to his pocket then physical need conquered me i could not face the thought of another days starvation i sat up and held out my hands if you will be so cruel i said let me have it please he gave it to me at once stood by with a sort of sombre smile on his face while i appeased my ravenous first hunger thats right he said are you better there was room for improvement i did not answer well are you quite good now said he my throat began to swell again you treat me like a child i cried yes he said because its only little girls who quarrel with their bread and butter havent you punished me enough already i said i dont know he answered but if mores wanted i hope it will be with less smart to myself i laughed through my tears o i mean nothing sentimental said he but only that my room being next to yours and the common ladder to both conducting through your room ive been forced by your wilfulness to sleep all night below in a chair but well remedy that somehow with a screen and so settle any question of precedence in going to bed i stared at him half fearfully why have you brought me here i whispered what again he said shaking a finger at me it seems for no reason but to humble and abuse me i was happy with poor gogo damn gogo he said in such a sudden heat that it brought a cry from me then all in an instant to my amazement and distress he had fallen on his knees beside the bed what is gogo to you or you to him he cried in a low intense voice has he ruined himself for you as i have done has he risked death destruction madness pined for you in dreams and plotted to gain you waking as i have ever since you a child took my reason by storm and bound it to you by golden chains his fervour and passion quite overwhelmed me i could only cower trembling before him what do you mean i whispered how have you ruined yourself for my sake he caught at my hands he was breathing fast and thick o child you dont know he cried the peril that has dogged you the love that has foreseen and provided not for a moment the truth of how my heart bled to hurt you now now o will you not come to me and hear no i whispered in a hurry of emotion for pitys sake leave me i will come to you presently i will indeed he rose to his feet at once commanding himself he was all changed softened and transfigured i felt swimming on the edge of a whirlpool fighting giddily against some helpless rapturous plunge to which i was being urged i longed only for breathing time some little space to be alone in he went and stood by the trap i will wait for you he said hoarsely and so descended closed it behind him and was gone when in an hour i rejoined him he was pacing the cellar like a caged wolf he uttered a glad exclamation upon seeing me and took my hand and led me to a stool he was himself again but with a new strange wistfulness in his gaiety you will not mind the sewer now said he and presently you will ask me everything and i will tell you he drew in our breakfast by the same method as before and i could at last enjoy my collops with a free conscience and appetite then our meal over he drew his stool beside me and without offering to smoke started upon his relation xix i am maid marian but first said he kindling ask me where you are short explanations suit me best i said immured in a wall is not that enough quite for me said he since you are here but whose wall now i shook my head why in ranger portlocks cottage said he buried out of all whooping in the forest would you like to be introduced to your host yes if you please i said will you call him in he laughed mahomet will have to go to the mountain you will understand why when you see it well for this cottage did you mark its position in the dark poor little bewildered brain poor little brain harkee he was fondly touching and smoothing the hair on my temples i loved this diana as a little girl what a phenomenal brother to be sure this cottage you are in child did you not observe lies snuggled in the shoulder of the hill warm as a baby in its mothers arm as warm and as safe too its back wall here he turned and tapped the plaster is just a windowless buttress built strong against any chance falling of the soil beyond this he pointed to the inner wall terminates the kitchen and not the house itself as a body entering the building is meant to suppose tis a blind as one might call it and not discernible from the outside to any but a conjurer and there i said pointing to the closed door at the end that madam said he with some momentary return to dryness is bluebeards chamber if you please and not at present in the articles of discussion i was surprised a little startled perhaps but said no more and he went on well now this same cottage is a half timbered structure very ancient and as full of odd little compartments as a bureau where we lie is its secret drawers diana a nest of em two below and two over and how to reach here miss ay theres the master stroke youd never guess no tis no way by the door yonder if you please sir says i if twas left to my innocence to decide i should een choose the way the tray went well come and look says he and made me go and stoop to the hole to my surprise it was closed and black twas not so i saw it last night i said rising what cried he you were prowling were you thank you kindly for the hint and he gave a great laugh but sobered in a moment did you listen then said he i was going to i answered but the moment i bent your chairs moved and i was frightened and ran away that sounds frank said he he sat musing a little youre a child tis true mutable and thoughtless but where could be the harm if the secret were mine only well study for my confidence and some day perhaps he broke off with a smile which i had a difficulty to return so there was a mystery in reality there and then i vowed a delilah oath to myself to get the better of it i dont know what you mean i said i had no thought to surprise any secrets is that the way through indeed yes he said fairly it is tis pierced under the big copper in the kitchen which has a detachable grate to be pulled all out in one piece god knows the original use of this contrivance this space in the wall unless twere always for the purpose that we he checked himself again anyhow tis utterly inaccessible else save by way of the skylight which your ladyship knows and now youre acquainted with your prison ask me further what you will ranger portlock did you say ay ranger once my brothers keeper not like cain unhappily and since promoted you seem to love your brother i have reason and this portlock is still in his service yes and in your confidence ay is he not i must tell you i am a proper sportsman madam and always more popular with hardroughs people than the noble verderer himself well i have taught them something here and there and put money in their pockets maybe have no fear not portlock nor any other will betray us i have my merry men of down who sink or swim with me and now i have my maid marian what more you shall see this portlock bear in mind he was once a thread paper of a man i have known him since i was a boy what else can you ask me i said low hanging my head the reason what you hinted up there why you are ruined and in hiding he ventured to put an arm about me how could i refuse him who was my bayard yet when he told me it was not all he never to the end acquainted me of what social dereliction of his had originally delivered him into the earl his brothers power and placed him and his remnant fortunes under the hand of that remorseless nobleman to use and crush at his will he never even admitted but indirectly that stain on his birth in which a high person was whispered to be implicated and which was at the root perhaps of all the trouble he always hated me he said of the lord herring and never more than when he foresaw my succession in the death of his promising limb my nephew what is he dead i asked astonished no he said but only rotten he will never come into the title believe me and you i said curiously interested how will he keep you out if the worst should happen to him why he said he would threaten an inquiry an exposure and there are those who rather than suffer it would countenance his quiet disposal of me have done so perhaps already and there you come in me i cried child he responded how can i speak it without offence you have long been marked down by this man my brother for his prey i have known it trust me and writhed under the knowledge but you were in proper hands and he must bide his opportunity believe me he was no privy to sophias schemes of husbandry had he guessed he would have anticipated the end so far as you was concerned by carrying you away by force when he learned the truth at last he was mad but he recovered his sanity on reflection it was no bad thing to let you ripen in that hell for his purposes to subdue you by that torture to his will then when reduced he would exchange your sweet person with dr peel for mine would sell me to your place in the madhouse so killing his two birds with one wicked stone but his plan miscarried i had a friend in the household someone a poor dancer whom he had used for a day and thrown aside she revealed all to me and i fled leaving him only my bitter curse for legacy and i came here into hiding to mature my plans for revenge came back to nature renouncing my kindred and all the vile social policies of a world i had got to loathe he had beggared me and i would fleece the plunderer he had thought to debauch my love and i would disappoint him of even that moiety of his bargain have i done so judge if he loved me before how he would spare me now who have baffled his schemes and stolen his dear a knowledge of but half the truth has already in these few weeks set him turning every stone to discover where i lie but i am well served by my friends he would burn the forest if he guessed the whole as you regard me as you value yourself child concede nothing to chance not so much as a peep over the roof ay i know your activity but you must lie close as a hare if you would be safe through these first days of peril at least later when the chase less presses you may venture out perhaps by the ladder but always with infinite caution as you love me little sister do you agree i buried my face in my hands my whole heart cried out on the cruel tyranny of a code that could let such monsters as this wreak their passions on the pure and innocent and yet find absolution o that i could find a way in the lawful junction of our fortunes to vindicate this dear oppressed creature and establish him in his rights before the world i leaned to him with wet eyes if you love me so brother i murmured what made you behave so cruel to me he gave a happy low laugh and tightened his hold why dear he said are not a womans extremes of love all for the man who will beat her or the man she can cherish and protect i vow i chose only my natural part well said i im glad you stopped short of the beating it would only have stiffened me like cream whipt cream is very good with cherries said he and bent to my lips but i started from him gaily and leapt to my feet come i said im waiting to be introduced to mr portlock he laughed and stretched himself and rising stooped to the hole in the wall and scratched with his finger like a rat gnawing on the iron stop therein in a little something was withdrawn and a weak wash of light flowed through now said he i will go first and do you follow little mouse he dropped on his hands and knees and crawled in and disappeared it was an attitude that lacked romance and i was glad there was none behind to witness my passing but the journey was so short that i was hardly in before my head was free on the farther side and in a moment george had helped me to my feet and i saw our host i saw nothing else indeed there were i believe the open range and herb hung rafters and settle and dresser of the ordinary cottagers kitchen the huge creature before me absorbed three fourths of the field of my vision i understood at once why mahomet must come to the mountain he had an enormous tallowy face had this person with an expression so excessively melting that it might have been said to be no expression at all he could have had no more intimacy with his own skeleton than a hippopotamus ages ago he must have left it buried within himself as useless and turned his wits to balancing on the twin globes of fat that were his legs his eyes were slits his nose a wart his mouth the mere orifice of a blow pipe if his neck by any possibility had been broken one might have stretched it till his head touched the ceiling i was conscious of george standing by watching me and instinctively i dropped a curtsey immediately the mountain rumbled and dusted a chair for my reception it swung in his vast hand like a signboard from an inn relatively i had some fear of sitting on it it looked for a moment so like a dolls mr portlock i murmured casting down my eyes i i am your humble servant sir he bowed bagged would be the better expression the whole weight of his chin was against his recovery but he managed it with an effort you you are very good to give me shelter said i im afraid we we shall crowd you dreadfully sir a low gale vibrated in him somewhere i seemed to be able to detach certain indistinct utterances from it of which welcome what can do maid marian were the clearest i made an effort to respond fitly struggled and was dumb then in a moment i saw george with his hand to his mouth the demon exploded in me were you were you always like that i shrieked and fell across my chair back half hysteric the poor fellow may have laughed himself there was no guessing what emotions that curtain of flesh concealed but he looked if anything more abashed than offended hush said george recovering himself or i must drag you back miss we shook facing one another with gleaming eyes and teeth didnt i tell you he gasped that he was a thread paper of a man once he went and clapped a hand on the mountains shoulder come johnny no offence said he none knows better than her ladyship that your hearts in the right place i subdued myself by a vast effort and rose and went to conciliate the poor creature havent i reason to i said and and i put my faith in you sir and and faith moves mountains and i was near off again he shifted and flushed faintly and delivered himself once more tis the wittles have done it he means said george that hes made up for lost time and opportunities since his promotion ay twas the nerves went on the oracle kep me down once shook i did hear thunder walk a mile round avoid row when the crows holload see funeral pass turned blood water twas lack ballast that was it of course said george that was it what a coward you was johnny in your thin time dyou remember the day we shot the home covers with a great person for company and the sky came raining cobwebs so that we were near stifled with em and you stuck your head in a bush till we gave you with our ramrods something better than cobwebs to roar about ay i do said the mountain and rumbled again not much cobweb bout me now well i told him that one couldnt have too much of a good thing and very soon we were fast friends but that morning george haled me back into shelter before much was said and afterwards our acquaintance ripened by fits and starts the very immobility of the creature was our and his salvation there was no conscious expression to betray itself on that vast desert of a countenance periodically he was visited by the steward fitfully by units of the hunt which his lordship sought to lay on his vanished brothers trail he was never so far as i knew suspected and with the deepening of winter the chase slackened and in the meantime what was i doing there buried alive like a recreant novice in the wall wilt thou believe alcide that i with all my free aspirations could have remained at peace in the little prison for a day well with rare excursions beyond and those not till i had been long immured i lived there for more than a year and was near all the time as happy as a swallow under the eaves it is love makes the dimensions of our estate xx i put an end to folly number two it was not till early in the second spring of my idyll that the clouds began to darken and my conscience to stir uneasily in those gloomy last hours before the final waking many things had contributed to this state some cardinal but most no doubt indifferent mere little tributary streams which had come to swell the volume of my disenchantment misunderstanding alas does not walk to challenge us on the highway it spies from behind hedges and listens at keyholes and when at length its tally of grievances is made we wonder at the weight of the evidence it has accumulated late in the previous year i had been very ill during the worst of my disorder an unconscionable old hag some withered afreet of the forest who was in the secret of our retreat had been brought in to attend me she disappeared soon thank god in a whisk of sulphur and thereafter george nursed me devotedly but strangely enough as i grew convalescent i developed an odd impatience of him which rose by degrees to a real intolerance and dislike that feeling abated as i grew strong but never to such degree as to make us again quite the friends we had been he made some study to propitiate me even to the extent of renouncing those ridiculous principles of nature which he had affected to exchange for the whole sum of social accommodations it was a relief though an aggravation to have him refine himself again out of a savage since i no longer could find the entertainment i once had in the dear poseur orson in truth was never so little attractive as when for the sake of tired loves favour he confessed his ruggedness a humbug his recantation though welcome enough in one way only disillusioned me in another so long as he had been consistent he was absolute now his weakness had made me so i remembered the times when i had pleaded with him and had found him only more covetable in his inaccessibility to my arguments we cant return to nature in the sense of rudeness i had often said to him any more than we can recover our childhood we have grown out of it and theres an end a man playing the child is only sorry make believe or if it isnt the mans an idiot nature herself you see isnt stationary shes always refining on her first conceptions what he would protest grumbling is all that hypocrisy of breeding that high got which is so fastidious in its appetite for crawling meats and rotten policies and bruised virtues nature yes to be sure i would answer tis human nature the fruits of her desire to hasten her social apotheosis by a union with the sons of god ay would growl my timon the fruits of incontinence i dont see it i would cry i cant see but that a knife and fork are in the right succession to a beak we may use our fingers you will say would you wish me sir to fondle my love with the same hands i tear my meat withal no you wouldnt except for the sake of argument and therefore i protest i am the truer child of that little liaison vive la nature say i the nature who is my mother and the god who is my father they have taught me between them to study in studying myself to make the gift of prettiness to my neighbours and i swear you are a dutiful child he would answer with the readiness that made me love him o believe me sir i would cry there is nothing artificial about the civilisation you have professed to renounce as if that were responsible for your downfall on its main lines it always makes for beauty which is truth i suppose he would interrupt with a sneer which is truth as much as anything is i would reply truth is only a cant word for what we dont understand and if we could get to there would be an end of all fun in the world o upon my word you are a very learned minx he would crow but i would continue not minding him if we had to start again from the beginning dont tell me but that we should develop the very same conventions as now or at least near em why sir not to lean our elbows on the table for instance while we sup our tea isnt a tyrannous edict of society tis a natural recognition of the unhandsome a natural effort to qualify ourselves for the better company we all look to some day dont we all feel that we are only rehearsing here for a greater piece well for my part i dont want to be damned in it but you you cry like a poor actor leave me alone to my pipe and beer i shall be all right on the night itself then he would laugh bravo and pulling out his tobacco silence me with a kiss but now well he had abdicated and i ruled that was the difference there had been a time when i would have consolidated the understanding between us by taking on the first dawn of liberty our friendship to church in those days indeed i even hinted as much to him touching upon the duty he owed me so to establish my innocence with the world then he would fall back upon his cant of nature of vows dishonoured in her sight of laws that crossed the plainest mandate that ever she had given to earth and i must be content at the time because we were helpless outcasts together because he was kind to me because he flattered me with a thousand attentions which made me forget the equivocalness of my position but now at the last it was he must sue and i be cold for under our altered relations i had come to recognise though late how wrong was this continued communion however platonic between us it was not that i loved my brother less but that i respected myself more i had been blinded by all the novelty and glamour he was pagan at heart i saw and i was at heart religious my thoughts turned with affection to the quiet nunnery at wellcot i longed to see my kind again to recover something of the world i had lost i had no real faith in his protestations no real belief that should it ever chance to him to recover his rights which in truth seemed impossible he would claim me to my legitimate share in them and i found no room in my world for a paradise of sinful loves he sighed much and was very pathetic poor fellow over my changed attitude and wearied me to death then he took to verse and depressed me more he had a strange faculty for a sort of big sounding line which he would invent and declaim in his odd moments while engaged over mending his snares or sewing buttons on his gaiters it was quite impressive in its place but was not exhilarating when applied to les amours this world he declared once is but the weed heap of the spheres whereon we rot and fester torn from the skies and are consumed in fire to manure and quicken old fields of heaven with new love o sweet wind with me on the damnd pile so of our mingled dust shall blossom heaven a romantic use to put your poor little diana to eh my friend but indeed i would have none of it i hate that fashion of decrying the flesh because your poet has a stomachache my body is the only certain god i know in the midst of these shadows i cling to it worshipping it with all the pretty gifts i can think when it goes where shall i be seeking and crying for it again through space i will not have it abused to such uses my sweet body that i love so well it had all vastly interested me once the fond comical incongruity the unexpected soul of my nimrod revealing itself through suffering he did not dear simpleton in the least understand his own inconsistency how loving all birds and beasts as he professed to do and so claiming affinity with nature he could use and approve the latest engines of civilisation for their slaughter he called the red deer the spirit of the antlered tree and went to shoot it with a gun he made me a pretty waistcoat of squirrel skins i went sweetly befurred indeed throughout the cold winters and dwelt lovingly on the primeval romance of woodlands meaning in fact that rapture of flight and pursuit of visible things which alone appeals to the unredeemed barbarian in the end to speak truth his mad rhapsodies came to remind me only too uncomfortably of the dead astrologer and i looked askance on what seemed a common derivation from a crazy stock but now lest it appear that i attach too much importance to these minor discords let me relate of the much darker and more formidable shadow which had arisen between us and which as the months but added to its density grew at last to be the insuperable barrier to our reconciliation it was the secret dividing us the secret which i had once half surprised and to the existence of which he had virtually confessed only it seemed to torture me by withholding it this much alone i knew that he went somehow practising in his banishment to be revenged on the society which he held responsible for it often at first i tried to coax the truth from him he was not for all his love to be beguiled there were others concerned he said who by no means shared his faith in my discretion with whom in fact he had come to open dispute on the subject of my continued sojourn in the cottage and whom in the end he had had to propitiate seeing his safety lay in their hands by a vow to reveal nothing to me i had no doubt in my heart but that these unknown were the merry men of his boasting woodmen verderers perhaps who treacherous to the earl their master were aiding and abetting the exile in those very malpractices he concealed from me i was right as to that it appeared but what i could never understand was the nature of my reputation with them how they had so learned to misapprehend my character for faith and loyalty however mistaken as they were they had nothing to complain of their leaders constancy to his oath a constancy alas which i can only not commend because of its miserable sequel if he had only had the strength to trust me neither would he have lost his liberty nor i been condemned to the torments of a quite unmerited remorse at this date of time i can insist with a clear but sorrowful conscience that the poor infatuated fool brought what happened upon his own head when i recognised at last that he was adamant to my pleadings i waived the subject but not by any means my private concern in it the secret i was naturally enough convinced lay to be revealed behind the locked door of that bluebeard chamber and one night after my friend had gone out i took a taper and my courage in hand and descended softly through the trap to investigate after he had gone out i say and therein lay the key to my growing apprehensions for not many days had i been in hiding before i discovered that my comrade was a night walker he would wait soft shut into his room until he fancied i was drowned in sleep then list footed creep out and by the screen which he had put up to protect me and either descend by way of the trap or less often mounting the ladder which communicated with the hidden gully disappear and pull his means of exit after him then i would wait shivering and wondering through the whole gamut of formless fears till stupor overtook me or perhaps by and by after long hours a terrified half consciousness of his stealthy return where did he thus nightly go to what dark business or witches frolic i tormented my brain for the solution and of my love and loyalty could find none but the poison of a yet unrealised fear was working in me early now on this night waking out of tormented dreams i was on the instant desperate to solve the mystery but hardly had i crossed the little cellar when a warning rumble from portlock seated in the room beyond told me that i was discovered so this vast creature was in the conspiracy quite panic struck i fled and mounting to my room found george there he had returned descending by the ladder during the minute of my absence he made no allusion whatever to my escapade but just laughed softly and took my cold hand in his as i stood trembling and aghast before him poor little maid he said she has been dreaming and he led me to my bed and tucked me in warm and left me with a kiss i never thought it necessary to confess but always after that as i came to learn he descended by the trap and bolted it behind him that did not assuage my fears though it was some comfort henceforth to be spared the pretence of blindness to his flittings a comfort i think to him as well as to me though his silence on the main point was not to be broken ah if he had only had the courage to set my mind at rest before its fears grew to a frenzy beyond my control now as time went on my hearing grew morbidly acute during the dark hours of his nightly absences when i was fastened lonely and frightened into my attic and sleep refused to come to me to certain shufflings and whisperings sounds scarce to be distinguished from the wind and the rain which filtered to me from the depths below sometimes it would seem a sough of blown voices sometimes a suggestion of dragging sometimes the low rumble of a cart on the turf which set my pulses knocking in my ears then when succeeding an ominous silence georges step would come mounting stealthily by the trap on tiptoe thence to his room i would shudder in the thought of dreadful footprints going by my screen and would feign the deep breathing of slumber lest he should be moved to stop and call to me softly in the voice i had not yet learned to resist and so at last out of all this torment of apprehension out of the sleepless waitings and breathless listenings had emerged a spectre real and present in the end to whose whispered hauntings i had long struggled to close my ears whose approach i had sought to stay beating my hands in air whose name i had not dared to breathe to myself and it was murder yes murder so only and only so was logically expounded that perverted creed of nature livid terrifying his hands stained with blood i saw him in its ghastly glair saw him savagely wreaking on the social order the wrongs he had suffered at its hands saw him reverted to the beast he worshipped tearing his kind a common robber and assassin i will not say that i was convinced and overwhelmed in a breath for long the hideous shadow of the phantom was poor proof against the sun of present love would thin attenuate to a mere gross mist in the light of kind embraces and honest laughter and a manly candour on all alas but the subject that most corroded only when that later spectre of our estrangement crept between did it assume a dreadful complexion glooming through the other and so at last the appalling confirmation it had been for weeks a terror to me to creep by the secret passage into portlocks kitchen on the rare occasions when my brief visits there for the sake of some small change and play of liberty were invited for the hole entered close by the locked door which had come to figure to me for the seal on all most nameless horrors and i could not pass it by but with averted head and nostrils held from breathing and a sickness like to the death i felt it contained rather would i strain a little the chance of capture without and often now when george was sleeping for he lay late after his night excursions i would put the ladder to the hill and climb and wander in the hidden furrow above sometimes as far as the gravel pit and there indulge my misery daring even at the worst a thought of escape for at length so far as we knew the chase of us had ceased altogether and portlock was no longer interrogated for possible information wandering thus greatly unhappy my thoughts would often recur for shelter to the peaceful nunnery to my little loving patty the dearest pleader of a sisters repentance most and with a self humbling remorse to the faithful unexacting soul whom i had deserted in the tower what if i had been misled by specious arguments to wound incurably where i had wrought to cure could i ever in that case forgive the false advocate o surely there was a greater nature than she in whose name were perpetrated deeds of violence and reprisal there was the human the humorous the tolerant large philosophy of being which gogo had revealed in his story of himself his misfortunes had but made him forswear the false goddess in whom weaker men sought to justify their passions i could never think of him but as the pan of these later days the poor limping pan of our era beguiled into a hospital and persuaded to an operation and shorn of his limp and his legs together one might meet him begging on a city bridge and look wondering down for the song of the water in the rushes that were not one might read his hairy breast into dreams of red dead bracken and see his eyes under their matted brows like little forest pools reflecting glimpses of the sky and not guess who he was for he would never whine of better days he always took fortune like a fallen god did gogo he always smelt sweet did my monster and he had not erred in love before he found me could that be said of another i was never quite able to forget that discarded favourite who had warned a threatened brother and assisted him to escape though i had never deigned to give the thought place in my mind the unacknowledged shadow of it of what had been her inducement to the act slept in me to rise presently and add its quota of darkness to the whole i was very unhappy very forlorn and tired and unhappy but on that morning as it blew bitter cold without and i longed for the fire that was never ours in that chill cellar but by proxy of the chimney back i brought myself to go down and scratch out the signal to portlock to let me pass if it were practicable he responded at once drawing away the grate and i crept in and through and stood up on the farther side instantly a grumpy exclamation from him as instantly clapped back with his great hand on his mouth took my eyes to my skirt whereto for a flash i had seen his directed and there smearing the pale folds of it was a long foul streak of blood where did this come from i cried in a dismayed voice for the moment too shocked to reflect i fancied he shook upon his great gelatinous calves that the little eyes set in the vast oyster of his face were blinking shiftily alert to my movements while he turned over the dull masses of his brain for an answer rabbits dinner at length he rumbled but i had realised it all while he stuck fast desperate in my heart sickness i made a hurried step to pass him and instantly he moved backwards and filled the doorway into the little front parlour by way of which i had hoped to escape into the forest let me pass i cried wildly i want air he pointed to the copper not safe that way i cant i cried it was there i picked this up you know it was then i quite lost my reason you are a murderer i shrieked you are all murderers here you rob and kill and drag the poor bodies through and hide them in the cellar behind the door let me pass i cant live here i can bear it no longer i raved and cried i beat helplessly on that huge drum of flesh it stood stolid insensible completely stopping the aperture go ask capen was all it said i fell back from him on the word the sense of an immediate necessity of self control was flashed upon my consciousness above or below either way my passage was guarded i was between the devil and the deep sea and in an irrepressible burst of frenzy i had confessed myself let slip my tortured demon and so perhaps spoken my own death sentence the terror of the thought drove out the lesser loathing i must temporise finesse yes i said i will i will not rest now till i know the return by that foul sewer the fearful issue by the closed door were experiences as horrible as any in my life what crawling thread might not be still drawing from the obscure reservoir beyond what hideous witness not fastening silent to me in the darkness that it might rise with my rising and shriek to the light for vengeance but i forced myself in my mortal fear to tread softly and on very panic tiptoe climbed from the hateful pit and crossed the room above i paused a moment on my shuddering way for assurance of his steady breathing and then with cold deft hands set the ladder in place and mounted it and drawing it after me into the thicket fled along the passage i had no thought of what i should do i only wanted to escape to put as long a distance as possible between myself and that spectre confessed in all its blood guiltiness at last half blinded torn by flint and briar i broke at length through the farther thicket and sank trembling and exhausted upon the bank of the gravel pit beyond i had sat there i know not how long my face in my hands the alarum in my heart deafening me to all outward sounds the storming trees above the cold sabre of the wind slashing into the bushes of my refuge as if it would lay me bare when suddenly i felt the clinch of a hand on my shoulder and screamed and looked up three fellows in a common livery had descended softly upon me from above and i was captured without an effort i rose staggering to my feet my face like ashes my poor hands clasped in entreaty but not a word could i force from my white lips you must come with us miss if you please said the man who held me civilly enough where i made out to whisper he pointed with a riding whip i followed the direction of his hand and there on the rim of the pit above silhouetted against the sky sat a single horseman i had no reason to doubt who it was even at that distance the lank red jaw of him was sign enough of the fox i was trapped at last and when i had thought myself securest now i do not know what desperate resignation came to me all in a moment as well this way out as another very well i said quietly i will go with you they were surprised i could see by my submission and all the more alert on its unexpected account to hover about my going but their strong arms were not the less considerate for that reason to support me overwrought as i was in my passage to the open daylight above and almost before i realised it i was standing before the earl of herring he sat as stiff and relentless in his saddle as an attila his red eyes staring a very wickedness of foretasted relish grinning in his hungry teeth a fourth servant in livery stood a little apart holding his own and the others horses so said the master whispering as out of a dream you are caught at last my lady i felt for the first time a little flush come to my cheeks and answered his gaze resolutely i dont know what you mean by caught my lord i said these are not the days of king john he rubbed his gloved hand across his chin no by god he said with a hoarse chuckle but they are the days of king hardrough by your leave i have done no wrong tell that to my lady said he jealousy has no ears he gave a hyna laugh misfortune has not chastened you i see crowed he it has not tried to i said till this moment now you have seen me will you let me go and ride back to tell mrs de crespigny that she has nothing more to fear from my rivalry he regarded me with a delighted humour when i go you come with me o no o yes straight back to dr peel and his whippings you will not you will not i clasped my hands upon his knee in a frenzy of terror i was quite broken in a moment dont send me back to that hell i implored he lusted over my fear he could not for long bring himself to ease it what have you got to offer me to stay my hand he said at last i was silent harkee he said i will help you out will you give me my bastard brother he is my brother too i swear it pish said he will you give up your paramour not if you call him by that name why there i knew said he you was in hiding together somewhere smoke the red earl if you can call him by what name you will and lead me to him i hung my head and burst into tears he has deceived me what did i say not that not that if i betray him tis only in the hope of his being persuaded to some reformation you will not work him evil that i swear tis only that i want to keep him out of harms way i looked up breathless this assurance was at least a comfort what will you do with him leave that to me the question is what has he done with you how could i not answer him to win my brother from this vileness was it not worth the sacrifice of myself with many tears and falterings i told him the story of my sojourn in the verderers cottage of the secret chambers and our life therein finally with bitter reluctance of the shadow that had risen to estrange us and the bloody confirmation of my fears that was to witness even now on my gown he grinned horribly over the revelation that portlock he rejoiced to himself that portlock a good throat for the hangman but for your murderings i warrant tis a fatter bone ive to pick with our gentleman he fell into a little musing scowling fit then suddenly dismounting bade me get into his saddle where are you going to take me i said where he answered but to your cottage o no i cried not back there what he said grinning is madam judas yet short of her price what price have i taken it is not to be judas to betray brother to brother for virtues sake he bent in a sawing laugh how apt the jade is let me tell you madam that virtue is an inner commodity and spoils when too much on the lips he forced me to mount signed to his fellows to follow and taking the bridle led me down the hill now for your price said he as he walked well i would have bid more for sound goods but what say ye you are happy on relations would you like to be my daughter i hung my head without replying it was true he was old enough to be my father this misery must cast me once more on the world a prey to all unimaginable evils what chance else remained to me to protect myself and make my fortune serve my honour while i was still quietly weeping we reached the cottage from the front and halted the earl motioned and his suite gathered round and knocked on the door in the silence that ensued we could hear the sound as of an unwieldy beast within shuffling to and fro the verderer had seen us through the window and knew himself for lost presently one put his knee to the panels whispering for orders curse it no hissed his master he may hear us if he does he cannot escape i murmured i pulled the ladder after me with that he raised his hand and the door crashed in i caught one glimpse of portlocks face it was a mere white slab of terror and turned away now said the earl in my ear but i shuddered from him i wont dont ask me it is not in the price he uttered an impatient oath bade one of his men hastily to my side and himself with the other three strode into the cottage i dont know how long passed it may have been minutes and seemed an hour all the time a low snuffling reached me from the interior the bitter wind had loosened my hair and i caught its strands to my ears to my eyes and rocked in my saddle trying to shut out everything presently a man came forth to join the other by my side garamighty job muttered he his honour be capen of the gang and no mistake you should see his larder ah whats in it asked the first ten fat bucks as im a saint answered the other we know now where the pick o the herds gone to eh i sat up listening what larder i asked faintly for indeed i knew of none the man touched his hat half deferential half impudent tis through the secret passage your ladyship so to speak opened to us a locked door in the little cellar beyant i shrunk from him you said what did you say was in it what but a show of venison miss piled to the roof one might say he must a made a ryle living out o deer stealing by your leave he had and that was the whole truth of the secret he had withheld from me all the time i had been torturing my fears into madness he had been abroad in the midnight woods murdering not men but deer in league with an ignoble crew for a paltry gain this romance of a social ostracism revenging itself on a social hypocrisy savage melancholy yielding to love only the troubled sweetness of its soul what did it confess itself at last o glorious to be first consul to a little republic of poachers to vindicate ones independence by picking the pockets of the king it was all explained now the whisperings the draggings the creaking carts in that butchers shambles the secret store of a gang of deer stealers he was no better than a cutpurse in my bitter mortification i could have wept tears of shame i am justified of my act i cried to myself better that he should think me a traitor now than live to curse me for withholding my hand when there was time and opportunity to save him nevertheless when they led him forth presently bound and quiet i could not face his eyes but cowered before the unspoken reproach and sorrow in them he came up quite close to me it was your own fault i muttered in my hair why would you never tell me i was wrong he said quite simply you must forgive me for what i have taken from you diana if it is any comfort to you to know the poor little unrealised bond between us reconciles me to this and all that is to come i felt as if my heart broke then and there i was conscious of the red earl watching us the other turned to him with a laugh like deaths take your reversion brother said he as for me i am for the madhouse i suppose at a grinding word two of the men helped him to mount and moved away with him i never saw him again the other two entered the cottage to fetch and escort mr portlock to his doom i was left alone with his lordship my heart was broken i left it scattered on the turf with all the fragments of the past now papa devil i said with a shriek of laughter what about your dutiful daughter xxi i am metamorphosed i had loved and lost and buried my dream of yesterday it lay fathoms deep in the green forest from the moment of my resurrection i knew myself for a changeling a fairy creature quite other than the soft emotional child who had cried herself to sleep on last nights hearth george was in his house of discipline portlock with others transported my past was broken for me beyond repair facing me instead were the battlements and pinnacles of a new dominion with what infinite potentialities behind its walls conscience makes no conquests with my rebirth had come the lust to supply the deficiencies of the old i laid my love in its grave with tears and kisses and turned intrepid to the assault memory my friend makes men good critics but bad romancers i was too indulgent of my kind to be the first beauty invited me i would forget remorse is indeed of all self indulgences the most useless it reconciles an offended heaven to us no more than do tearful sighs win a wife her husbands condonation of an ill cooked dinner an inch narrow of reformation is better than an ell broad of apology let our sweetness of to day rather be our experience of yesterday the gods find no entertainment in regrets they shower their benefits on the unminding and in the gifts of the present we are justified of our past actions it is only when we are rich that we can afford to put up tablets to our memories whence follows that we cannot more honour the dead than by taking our profit of the living well once i had lived for others now i would live on them a word of distinction and a world of difference his lordship took me straight to london and gave me a little suite of rooms in his fine house in berkeley square where i was to remain during the next three years until in fact i was come legally of age he had decided on reflection that i was to be his niece he was a very great man and this gift was only one of many in his disposal it was no business of mine how he accounted to the world for my title my interest was only to justify it with a view to my position in life when i was become marriageable wherefore i would consent to give him none of my duty until he had drawn up a settlement in my favour to date from my majority i had had enough of unprofitable bargains perhaps he would never have consented to this for like all covetous pluralists he was parsimonious had not the death of the young viscount about this time moved him to seek comfort in an artificial relationship for the real one he had lost in the hearts of the worst of us i suppose such vacancies yearn to be filled and so the poor childless wretch took his opportunity and adopted me i hope i acquitted myself properly for the favour but in truth i could never quite forgive him his treachery to his brother in the meantime i developed rapidly and had my little court quite exclusive of les convenances the ladies of course looked askance at me but what did i care i had only to curtsey to my glass to procure the reason and they made their modistes their deputies in paying me the sincerest flattery instead i experienced the high distinction of a whole entourage of carpet knights captains and parsons and diplomatists unending who came to ogle their own images in my blue eyes and losing their heads like narcissus from giddiness tumbled in by the score until i was stocked as full under each brow as an abbots pond it was a rare sport to throw crumbs of comfort to these gaping creatures and see them rise and jostle one another for the best pickings i assure you my friend i was a queen in my sphere and had as much need to practise diplomacy it was that first attached me to politics the knowledge of into what good coin for bribery and the traffic of state secrets those pretty orbs might be converted so soon sure as amongst my parliamentary followers i distinguished my favourites i began to sift my political opinions and to work for the handsomest i have traced my measures in both houses believe me my little monsieur i have pulled some strings sitting in my boudoir with results as far reaching as st stephens ah well they were days but i will be true to myself in not bewailing them memory in my philosophy is a very lean old pauper crumbling dried herbs into his broth i never could abide mint sauce unless plucked from the green chief among my favourites was a madcap young member whose wit was never so impertinent as when flitting here and there for an opportunity it could prick the sides of some great parliamentary bull and elicit a roar for its pains he was that mr roper who indeed went so far on somebodys instigation as to tease the great mr pitt himself on certain measures introduced for the betterment of the roman catholics and who in consequence redeemed himself a little it was whispered in the eyes of high personages with whom he had long been in disgrace his father was robert lord beltower that deplorable old nobleman who was reported early in life to have staked his honour on some trifling issue and lost and who always described himself as living a posthumous life since he had been carried off by a petticoat in the fifteenth year of his age father and second son the heir to the title lord roper of loftus was eminently respectable and pious were known as bob major and bob minor and indeed apart or together could ring the changes on some very pretty tunes but the minor who had been a scapegrace page at court and early dismissed was my enfant gt as well for his wit and information as for a daring that recked nothing of the deuce itself he owned to no party and as to his principles why said he i throw up my hat to the best shot and that isnt always to the heavenly marksman i have known the devil score some points in charity he never truckled to me which was perhaps one of the reasons of my favour but was like a licensed brother a relationship i had come to regard indeed he most offended me by his outrageous independence of my partialities hey come rogue rogue sniggered his father to him once on the occasion of some abominable impertinence you go too far what the devil means this disrespect to our goddess youll be pricked egad one of these days like that fellow atlas or acton or what the devil was his name that was tore for his impudence the son bowed to the sire quoting slenders words to shallow i will marry her sir at your request but if there be no great love in the beginning yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance when we are married and have more occasion to know one another i hope upon familiarity will grow more contempt but if you say marry her i will marry her that i am freely dissolved and dissolutely why you villain said his lordship with a grin if youre the devil quoting scripture im done with you nay sir said the other you flatter yourself i quote no better than my father no better you dog and how why sir wasnt it you taught me that the more one sees of a woman the less one respects her i twas propos the chudleigh sir you may remember whom you met at ranelagh in i think it was undressed as iphigenia she came clothed in little but her virtue and caught a bad cold a consequence you may have forgot the moral of your sermon sir but i as a dutiful son have stored it hang you bob what moral why sir that a woman dreads exposure in nothing but her weakness to stand the test of it if shes a peculiar fineness anywhere shell take some means to let you know then sir cried i with a flaming face i pride myself on nothing so much as my hand and i brought it down stingingly on his ear but i dont want your hand he cried stamping about while his father roared didnt i tell you as much nevertheless we were fast comrades and together in some captivating peccancies of which i only learned to rue the publicity when they led to my undoing mr roper as i have said found a particular delight in galling on somebodys instigation the sides of the promoters of the new pro papish bills well i will ask you what did i owe to that church was it likely that my treatment at its hands had left any love between us or that i should wish its disabilities removed who had suffered so much from it muzzled i had been educated under its shadow to a full understanding of its juggleries and impostures now was the time the country being still in a ferment over its heir apparents alleged marriage with the fitzherbert to relate my experiences there was at that date published in london a little fashionable scapegrace of a paper called the world the property of a major topham who made it the vehicle for such a chronique scandaleuse as the town had never yet known and in this paper i began by preconcert with my political ally to disclose over the signature anglique the true story and circumstances of a certain beautiful young lady who had been practised upon and in the very heart of protestant england by a worse than spanish inquisition the series cautiously as i began by handling it made an immediate sensation and was you may be sure deftly engineered in the house by mr roper for the opposition moreover anglique which delighted me as much gave her sweet and melancholy name to a mourning gauze which was so pretty that i had to kill an aunt to give me a title to wear it at the same time her instant popularity made me tremble for my incognito which nevertheless i knew to be the majors very best asset in a profitable bargain still not even his tact could altogether explain away the association of ideas implied in mr ropers common friendship with me and with that poor persecuted anonymity and that i had made myself by no means so secure as junius was a fact disagreeably impressed upon me on a certain evening i had been entertaining late that night when his lordship entered unexpected he came from st jamess and from playing backgammon with the king and wore his orders on a pearl silk coat and for contrast a mighty scowling face over i took no heed of him as he walked up the room towards me humping his shoulders and acknowledging wintrily the salutations of my little court but went on laughing and rallying a dear little ensign percy with whom i was in love just then pour faire passer le temps however the boy could not stand the inquisition of the red eyes and joked himself into other company with a blush and a bow to the ogre at which i laughed lolling back in my chair well madam said hardrough knuckling his snuff box softly when you can vouchsafe me a moment of your attention i recognised the compelling tone in his voice and rose with a little show of indolence o i said yawning what sin has found me out now i vow it can never be so ugly as it looks he gave me his arm mighty ceremonious and conducting me into an antechamber shut the door that is for you to prove he said taking snuff and stood glaring into my soul so madam he said you are for setting your little teeth into the hands that have warmed you i sat down fluttering my fan and pretty pale i daresay but i was not surprised my conscience had pricked me at the first sight of his face he pulled from his pocket a copy of the damning sheet and tell me says he if his majesty was justified in asking me if this did not refer to some member of my family i did not answer and he threw the paper on the floor well you are condemned he said drily and at that i found my wits condemned i cried by whom why my lord how can you being of the court party and in opposition condemn an anti papish tract that is all very well he said acridly but the stone once set rolling against a house who knows who may be included in the ruin i knew very well of course to what he referred for had he not been subsidised by his sister and during the time too when he had figured hottest against catholic emancipation into overlooking the establishment by her in the very heart of his estate of that community of sisters whose complicity in my abduction i was bent upon exposing and was i not aware too that the appointment he coveted to a vacant garter trembled at the moment in the balance of such revelations o i held some strings my friend you may believe though at present i had the opposite to any inducement to pull this particular one why nunky i cried is not this your succour and protection of madams poor victim the best proof of your orthodoxy he regarded me grimly but with some shadow of returning good humour thats true enough he said so long as you use me if at all for no worse than to point the moral of her damnation why should i not tis my interest to at least ha he said there you speak and stap me if i love you the less for it he took a turn or two and came back grinning theyre damn clever di there ill admit theyre damn clever but tis a perilous game you play my girl and youll do well to take care you play it to none but your own interests he went off again and returned harkee he said theres beltowers whelp and and i dont care a fig for your predilections work your oracle as you will only be faithful to me and you wont suffer fort in the end he finished in such spirits that he was moved to show me a letter he had received from his sister but a few days before in it she upbraided him for his treachery of which she only recently had certain information in converting his capture of me to such infamous account and called upon him as he valued his soul to turn his jezebel adrift again to her merited deserts enfin i said handing him back the effusion for a respectable lady she shows a vigorous vocabulary she writes in london i see he chuckled like a demon she writes in hell and bites the more viciously for her roasting tis that fellow has led her here dancing after some new fancy of his and by god shes paid for her stubbornness and must vent her spite on someone well i said tell her so from me and that for my part id rather be jezebel than what came to lap her blood at which he neighed vowing hed take me at my word xxii i run across an old friend it has always been my fate to suffer most at the hands of my best friends and now it was to be my dearest my little sister who was to shoot her arrow over the house and wound me in innocence heaven forgive her and in forgiving answer to itself for making me the unconscious instrument of its retribution it was in the third year of my minority and while in the full zest of my conspiracy with young roper that one night we made up a party for vauxhall gardens and crossed from whitehall stairs very merry with french horns and lanterns and a little roman boy ugolino who sang like an angel to witness the new picture of a tempest in the cascade house this we had seen and were gone for supper into one of the boxes which bob called the loose boxes in a retired corner of the grove when occurred the contretemps which was to change the whole face of my fortunes i had observed without marking them a couple enter the adjoining booth and was bawling my part in a catch while waiting for the chickens and cheesecakes when a fellow put his head round the partition and kissing his dirty hand with a leer beg pardon leddies says he but i can supplement that ere chaunt with a better and immediately disappearing from sight began to bang the table beyond and to roar out a filthy ballad roper leapt to his feet there was a crowd lingering by attracted by our merriment and ran round to the front stop you sot screamed he or ill nail your ears to the table the fellow ceased dead and in a moment came staggering out with a furious face he was a coarse blotched ruffian and as drunk as davids sow what the ell said he lurching up his words aint one song as good as another in this here bordel mister bob struck like harlequin and the wretch went down i had once before heard the smack of flesh on flesh and it made my blood jump there was a fine uproar we had all risen to our feet and in the midst i observed the girl we had forgot the creature had a companion slip out of the box and away taking advantage of the confusion to mix with the crowd i just saw her white face melt from me and gave one gasp and started in pursuit my companions called but i took no notice and was lost in a moment she was making for the druids walk unheeding my cries in her blindness but in a little she began to falter and then to sway and i came up with her and caught her into my arms patty i whispered frantic patty she looked at me quite dumb and bewildered the poor thing and then sighed and mechanically put her hair back from her temples patty i urged again dont you know me and at that all of a sudden she had burst into tears and was clinging to me is it you diana she sobbed really you at last o i have so longed since we came and i knew you was here in london take me away dont let me be carried back she was near choking me with her arms hush i said what have they been doing with you pish child that was never no no with all your softness you couldnt be such a fool who the deuce was it then now dont answer but come with me where we can talk we were already being accosted and offered genteel squiring the child held to me terrified while i laughed and convoyed her in safety to the open where we were lucky to encounter one of my party is it over i asked o faith he answered quizzing my friend the mansters floored and parseus refreshing himself on roman panch and here by my soul s andrameda come to give thanks to her presarver well i said andromedas in better hands for the present so you must een take us where we can talk private while you mount guard he looked mightily astonished but obeying conducted us to the farthest limits of the grounds where was little company but the keepers put to restrain interlopers from the fields beyond and there set us on a seat and withdrew and the moment we were alone i took the girl and held her at arms length she was the same as ever though her figure grown a thought too full for perfection perhaps but there were the soft bashful eyes and the nave face too white under its dark hair that i loved so well so i said nodding my head we meet again like the town and country mice and are you still under her dominion you little brown frump she could not have enough of wondering and fondling me and weeping but her inarticulateness filled me with a horrible foreboding what i cried giving her a little shake dont tell me miss that but no i wont hear it tis grotesque beyond reason what do you mean she whispered i looked searchingly into her eyes no i said reassured there are the same unborn babies there but who then was that brute you ran from she put her arms round my neck he he is a groom of madams and high in favour with her because a good catholic she bids me listen to him and and i dont know what she means diana or what he means he is a coarse and violent man sometimes but she forces me into his company and to see the town together and o diana i am almost sure he drinks too much i burst into a laugh you should be whipped for the slander child but i suspect the truth we dont run but from those we have a partiality for watch moll and meg at dragging time in the fairs she cried diana and looking up horrified into my face read its mockery and gasping out i am very unhappy fell away from me you poor little creature i cried fiercely moved by her distress if you dont know what madam means i do tis the way with the quality to pension off their discarded fancies on jack or molly she showed by her manner that she did not understand me but my indignation would not let me explain moreover i was too satisfied with my own solution to wish it contradicted never mind i said stamping my foot tell me everything every word then it all came out in a flood how since my removal madam had visited more and more upon her innocent head the trespasses of her poor little friend and sister how this habit vindictive at the best had grown into a very fury of spite which i laughed much to hear about when de crespignys wandering fancy had begun as it inevitably had to turn from the hop pole which had invited it to be wreathed about itself to the ripe little sapling growing so snug beside how in her jealousy my lady had driven her below stairs and at last made her altogether consort with the servants as her proper peers who had only been lifted by her generosity out of the gutter how not content with this literal debasement she had thought further to soil her by forcing upon her the reversion of her tipsy cavaliere servente as anyhow i chose to think him a tyranny which had at last driven the soft little creature to despair and rebellion so she told me all though with less force and conviction poor simplicity than i have chosen to put into her relation and you was gone and how did you escape diana and i hated mr de crespigny as much as i hate this one and it all makes no difference and i dont know how i can bear it longer she cried in a breath very well then i said and looked sternly at her you must find the courage to run away i had thought that the very suggestion would make her faint but instead to my surprise a rose of colour flew to her pale cheeks yes she whispered if i only knew where o fie on madam she must have been a cruel task mistress indeed there i said you naughty little thing but confess to me first what you have heard tell about your sister what does that matter she murmured hanging her head when nothing in the world can ever alter my love for you i took her in my arms and touched her little simple toilette into shape here and there you are very desperate in truth child what do you say will you risk all and come and be my duenna you are older than i sure and shall defend your little sister from slander i will get the earl to consent if you will say yes she seemed beyond answering but could only cling to me in a kind of frenzied rapture and i will make a fine bird of my jenny wren i said still busy with her for she has a thousand pretty little modest graces which will do me a vast credit in the dressing you shall keep your natural hair miss for powder since the tax is not la mode with the best but a gentlemans arm le cas chant would never go round this waist by three inches i peeped with a smile into her face o if i only dared she sighed sir benjamin i cried rising instantly escort us to the gates please and call a coach an hour later i broke upon his lordships privacy nunky i cried i want permission for a new toy please he looked up askew he was in the hands of his valet i have been taking thought for my reputation i said and desire a duenna he screwed out a laugh and an oath ill have no old hags about tis a young hag but a little older than myself will you let me no i wont it will please me no it will spite lady sophia to death curse it you viper ill think about it very well ill bring her to be introduced and before he could remonstrate i was gone we found him in demi toilette when i returned dragging my reluctant baggage with me like a lamb to the slaughter she was as terrified as if twere for him i coveted her and not for myself he started seeing her and came and put his hand on her shoulder well i vow said he tis a toy for a king whence come you child from my sister she was wise to dismiss you egad xxiii i am made fortunes mistress i have ruled myself all my life to be none but fortunes mistress let who will question it the gift of fine clothes has never bought my independence honesty as the little plant of that name tells us may go dressed in satin and as with me so would i have it with my sister i was not long in discovering that i had erred in bringing her to berkeley square though i will not for her sake detail the processes of my enlightenment let it suffice to say that the nobleman my guardian was not exactly intellectual he was one of those who like tony lumpkin reckon beauty by bulk and in that respect it is certain patty could more than fill my place with him she had no notion of course dear innocent that she was being invited to do so she was all blindness and affection but that made it none the less my duty to save her the consequences of her own simplicity seeing how it was i had unwittingly brought it imperilled the worldly may sneer and welcome that i did preserve her and at the last cost to myself is the only proof needed of that same disinterested honesty which in the beginning had welcomed her without a selfish second thought to its arms now the moment i realised my mistake i set myself to combat its results i think i may say i gave my lord some mauvais quarts dheure he for his part when i thought it time to throw off the mask did not spare me insult and brutality in very disdain i will not report the quarrel and all the while the silly child its subject trembled apart in an atmosphere she felt but could not understand while the shepherdess and the butcher disputed for her possession at length came the climax one day at the end of a furious scene he told me roundly that he had had enough of me and that it would be well for me to agree to commute my proposed settlement for for what a sum that was less than a valets pension i refused it i refused everything let that at least speak in my vindication he assured me that in that case i had nothing further to expect from him the dotard did he laugh when i told him perfectly quietly that i quite understood that the debt was mine and that i should pay it did he still count himself the better tactician when i affected to be terrified over my own rashness and to slink away from him to lament and reconsider i went straight to my bedroom where for an hour or two i sat writing at the end i despatched two letters one to the world one to mr roper who lived hard by and whose reply i set myself to await with what philosophy i could muster it came in a little and then singing i sought out patty in the pretty boudoir that was hers of late she flew to greet me and coaxed me to a couch the moment we were seated i hushed her head into my breast patty i whispered do you love the earl i could feel her breath stop then recover itself in wonder he is so good to us diana like a father and i had always lived in such terror of his mere name how easily we may be deceived yes child i answered how easily how easily her pulses answered to my tone i could feel again she slipped upon her knees before me and clasping her hands looked up dumbly questioning into my face you are so simple ma mignonette i hardly know how to tell you i began pitifully tell me o what diana i am frightened i wish you to be patty i took her two entreating hands into one of mine and with the other made a significant gesture all this these little costly gifts has it never occurred to you child that they are bribes i stopped to me she whispered with a whole heart of astonishment to your honour child to she gulped and turned as pale as death he has promised to show you his richmond cottage yes to night yes how did you know never mind i know you must not go how can i help it diana she sunk down before me quite helpless and unnerved patty i said you have never ceased to love and trust your sister never never you are before all the world to me diana you will find a way if you are strong yes i have been alert and watchful child while you never knew it but he did and he means to separate us to rid himself of the watch dog that he may seize the lamb he has but this moment told me i must go with what coarseness and insult i will not soil your ears by repeating if you love your honour as i love and have sacrificed myself to save it you must come with me i will come she rose hurriedly to her feet how can i ever repay you sister the old wicked man at once diana let us fly at once hush we must be circumspect you dont know there child i will die to save you she clung to me in a gush of silent tears hastily i instructed her it was necessary in escaping to leave no trail in my plan it was that in an hours time she should order out her barouche there was one put at her disposal and having driven to grosvenor gate alight and dismiss it as if with the intention to walk in the park thence she was to make her way on foot to mrs trixs toy shop in piccadilly and having asked very privately to be shown into the parlour await me there in whatever company she should find she obeyed heedful in her panic to the last details luckily my lord being gone abroad to his lawyers there were no prying eyes to criticise her no sooner was she driven off than having collected into a stocking all our jewels and whatever money i could lay hands on which i hung from my waist out of sight i stole forth by the back way into the stables and thence to the street where i found a hackney coach and drove after my friend i found her as i had hoped with mr roper he looked mighty serious over our escapade but informed me that he had loyally attended to my instructions and procured us a lodging as for two country ladies who had come up to view the sights in as distant a part of the town as he could compass on short notice we went out immediately by a side door and having all got into a coach that was in waiting were driven to holborn where we alighted and thence for precaution walked to a quiet house in great coram street near the foundlings where our handsome escort left us promising to call at discretion in a few days and recommending us in the meanwhile to lie as close as rabbits in a furrow he was as good as his word coming in a week later after dark with a face as long as a lawyers writ well madam he said you have cut the ground from under your own feet with a vengeance i laughed you have been reading angliques last testament pray the fates it may not be so indeed he said gravely and pulling a paper out of his pocket began to refer to it why do you not know said he that others besides our volpone are reported interested in that strange disappearance of a one time heir presumptive to volpones own title perfectly and yet you go and put your head into the lions mouth i would do more to expose a villain i would go all lengths to right an injured man he is no more mad than i am that seems probable he unfolded a second paper from the other and pointing silently to a paragraph handed it to me the king i read from the gazette has bestowed the vacant garter upon the newly created marquis of synge and a little lower down it is stated that the earl of herring has been relieved at his own request of all offices which he held under the crown his lordship is understood to have long contemplated a complete retirement from public life i shrieked with laughter i danced about the room waving the paper over my head the noise i made brought up one of two gentlemen who lived below he put his head in at the door with a leer and a grin o a thousand pardons said he i thought you was alone and that something had happened and he vanished he thought something had happened groaned bob dismally and taking the paper from me he read out elsewhere his majestys final decision is supposed not unconnected with the esclandres of a certain notorious lady which have exercised the public curiosity for some time past and which culminated on saturday sennight in an attack too obvious in its direction to be overlooked i heard glistening well i told him i recognised my debt and should pay him i said bob folded the papers and returned them to his pocket his mouth and eyes were set in a kind of suffering smile you may know best how to play your hand for yourself he said god preserve your partner thats all what have you to fear your prudence first of all not a very trustworthy asset if one may judge by your apparent confidence in your fellow lodgers o him that looked in i said i will answer there with my life he raised his eyebrows yes that is the point said he do you quite realise what you have done diana o quite well that is a comfort it gives me a sort of confidence in my future so long as i can be played as live bait for your capture i shall be spared no doubt he came up to me and spoke very earnestly do you understand he will try to trace you through me if he succeeds there is an end of both of us i said cheerfully well he answered with admiration you are a game little partlet but remember at least that revenge which evokes retribution misses the best half of itself for that reason if for no other i must keep away from you this visit to night even i only dared it after infinite precautions if you want me write i will risk some means to see you for the rest live close as death till some of this at least is blown over your friend the pretty simpleton where is she in bed and asleep keep her there make a dormouse of her my lady sophia is nosing for her tracks as my lord her brother for yours did you suppose she would acquiesce quietly in the abduction of her handmaid i tell you she has got wind of the truth and there has been tempest in the house of herring keep her close above everything cut all further communication with the world as you love yourself and me a little perhaps diana as i love the truth i said and went up and kissed him ah he sighed that is very pretty but believe me the truth as represented by his majesty wishes your love at the devil before it meddled in his family affairs xxiv i find a friend in need you know the truth mon ami that the face which looked in at my door was the face of my father o heavens the reunion so wonderful so pathetic and the sequel so interesting truly through our living fidelities do the gods chastise our worldliness we had not been a day in the house when i ran across him in a passage he was it appeared one of two gentlemen who lodged below he was plainly almost shabbily dressed bloated a little prematurely aged but i knew him instantly though eleven years had gone since my childish eyes had last acknowledged and adored him the instinct of nature was too sure to be deceived i gasped i trembled as he stood ogling me finally i threw myself into his arms papa i cried papa hey he responded is that all do you not remember your little diana i implored in an ecstasy of emotion wait he said and put a hand to his forehead it may be on my notes ive a damned bad memory the door of a room hard by stood open he led me in closed it and seated himself officially at a table now he said what mother the shock my friend i had remembered him so strong and gallant wicked if you will but then i had always pictured myself the cherished pledge of his wickedness and now it appeared i was only one of a large family without a word i turned my back upon him dont go he said disturbed at that what name did you say i confronted him once more sorrow and disdain battling in my face i said diana of course he answered beating his forehead the child of after all it was a long lapse of time i told him my mothers name she was my one real love he said shedding tears i recall her among the peats of killarney as if it were to day when she died she is dead isnt she i buried my heart in her grave i have never known a moments happiness since speak to me of her dinorah he followed me up a little later when patty was sitting with me and peeped round the door may i daughter di he said i believe he had really in the interval been looking among his notes or letters and with such benefit to his memory that he felt secure at least in that monosyllabic compromise blame my fond heart thou fripon i was softened even in my desperate disillusionment by this half recognition with a father fashionable and well connected possibly rich to safeguard my interests i need no longer fear the light receiving no answer he sidled himself into the room and to a sofa on which he sat down patty dropping her work looked at him with all her might of astonishment and is this dear child your sister he asked yes i answered from the very first twins he exclaimed i am very sure there is no such entry he sat frowning at the carpet for a little then wait he said it is my misfortune to serve small beer and with these enigmatic words laid himself down and fell asleep with his first snore patty flew over to me who is it she whispered frantic it is a wise father that knows his own child father she said hush i answered yes and would say no more till he woke he came to himself presently in a properer sense of the word during the interval i had been curiously observing his condition it was very different in seeming from that of the spark of eleven years since it showed an assumption of finery it is true but the trappings were tawdry and soiled and the materials cheap he sat up with a prodigious yawn his face in the midst lapsing into a watery paternal smile but it was evident at once that something of the thread of memory was restored in him and he began questioning me much more shrewdly and to the point why ecod said he presently was it a fact that the sweep had stole you if id only learnt the truth before charlie buckster put a bullet in himself id a double pony on it with the man then we got on famously he cried much over his poor lost love and was so tender with me that he completely won me from my reserve and i ended by recounting to him the whole tale of my fortunes even up to the present moment that herring he said a fine guardian to my girl i knew the stoat well in my time let him beware now that she has found her natural protector he swelled with indignation as i with pleasure you have gifts presents from him no doubt he said fiercely what do you say to my taking them all back and throwing them in his face i say certainly not i answered ah well he said you have got them anyhow and the thought will wring his covetous soul at this moment a great voice roared johnson you devil down below somewhere my father got quickly to his feet ay he answered to my look tis me di the pseudonym i go by fact is child im temporarily under a financial cloud and forced to eke out a living while awaiting the moment of my complete restoration to fortune by service that is to say by taking it hem by taking service exactly a sort of elegant cicerone and social introducer to a damned old parvenu curmudgeon who wants to learn at what lowest outlay to himself he can pose as a gentleman tis tiresome though in its way amusing but i really think i shall have to cut the old rascal on his taste in liquor for a palate like mine you know small beer and blue ruin faugh you havent change for a guinea my angelic johnson roared the voice again coming sir coming cried my papa and seeing me unresponsive skipped out of the room he was with us continually during the fortnight after our arrival and i had no least idea of the consequences awaiting me when one afternoon a hastily scribbled note dated en route for the continent was delivered at the house door by a porter and sent up to me i read it shrieked and sank half fainting into a chair i have taken dear daughter it said the entire responsibility for our monetary affairs upon my own shoulders to live on ones capital is like the self eating pelican to devour the substance of the unborn generations seeing how you appeared quite unaccountably callous to the natural claims of your prospective family for with your attractions you cannot hope to escape one i as its prospective grandfather have asserted my prerogative by appropriating our principal to its properest uses of investment the stocking you will find still reposing in its secret cache behind the hangings of your dressing table but you will find it empty do not blame me but console yourself with the conviction that in a few weeks i shall be in a position to return you your principal at least trebled in the meanwhile accept the assurances of my love and protection half dazed with the shock i tottered with pattys assistance into our bedroom it was too true the desperate wretch seizing his opportunity by night while we slept had robbed us of everything he had left us not a sixpence we were ruined i tore my hair i uttered cries and imprecations i cursed heaven my own fond gullibility the cruelty of the fate that would not let me live and be honest patty poor fool tried to calm me i drove her away with blows and in a reaction to fury rushed downstairs and into the room of the remaining lodger where is my money where are my jewels i shrieked you are his accomplice i will swear an information against you unless you tell he was a gross coarse man of a violent complexion ho ho he bellowed blackmail is it wait while i call a witness he pulled the bell down summoning our landlady when she came there was an outrageous scene quite cowed in the end i retreated to our apartments where however i was not to be left in peace within an hour the harridan appeared with her bill an extravagant one which of course i was unable to settle the next morning driven forth with contumely we were arrested at her suit and carried to a sponging house thence quite self collected now in my desperation i despatched a note to mr roper who without delay good creature waited upon us i told him the whole unreserved truth very well he said i will quit you of this child and for the rest find accommodation for you in humbler quarters till you can help yourself with your genius that should not be long you know my circumstances and that i cannot afford luxuries i will work my fingers to the bone i said with tears in my eyes not quite so bad as that he answered bones aint negotiable assets have you ever thought on the stage now for a living i believe without much study i could make an actress i said with none at all said he confidently i have a friend in westley of drury lane and will see if he can put you in the way to a part i should fear the publicity i faith but that my lord has taken his grievances to the continent for an airing and in the interval we are safe to act good loyal friend he found us pretty snug quarters over a little shop in long acre where keeping to our pseudonym of the misses rush we bided while he negotiated terms for me he was successful when once i had been interviewed by the management and to cut short this melancholy story i made my first appearance on the boards as the fairy primrose in the christmas masque of the dragon of wantley i had a little song to sing about a butterfly which never failed to bring down the house and altogether i was growing not unhappy in the novelty of the venture when that with almost my life was ended at a blow but first i must relate of the most surprising contretemps that ever i was to experience and which had the strangest and most immediate bearing on my destinies i had noticed frequently that the hind legs of the dragon would linger unaccountably when the absurd monster on his way off the stage happened to pass me standing in the wings this would lead to much muffled recrimination from the forequarters which exhausted by their antics aimed only at getting to their beer the consequence being that one eventful night what between the haulings and contortions the back seam of the creature split and out there rolled before my eyes gogo he picked himself up immediately and stood regarding me silently with a most doleful visage my dear i cannot describe what emotions swept my soul in a little storm of laughter the astonishment the pity the bewilderment in the midst too confounded to arrange my thoughts i turned away affecting not to recognise him seeing which he uttered one enormous sigh and stumped off to face the battery of the stage managers indignation i must have put a world of feeling that night into my little song about the poor butterfly that was stripped of its wings by a cruel boy and so prevented from keeping its assignation with the rose insomuch that it moved a very beautiful lady who was present in a private box to send for me that she might thank me in person we had all of us of course heard of and some of us remembered perhaps chucking under the chin the ravishing mrs hart who from pulling mugs of beer to the pinks of drury lane had risen to be chre amie to his excellency the british ambassador at naples and quite recently his lady she had lately come to london travers tous les obstacles to be made an honest woman of and it was she who craved the introduction to which you may be sure i responded with as much alacrity as curiosity i could have no doubt of her the moment i entered the box and made with becoming navet my little curtsey she was certainly very handsome in spite of her twenty seven years and her large feet though i thought lacking in grace but her face was beautifully formed with a complexion of apple blossoms and red lips a little swollen with kissing and to crown everything a great glory of chestnut hair there were tears in her fine eyes as she turned impulsively to address me la you little darling youve made me cry with your butterflies and things come here while i buss you there was a gentleman sitting by her foremost of two or three that were in the box and he made room for me with an indulgent smile he was a genial precise looking person with a star on his right breast and the queue of his wig reaching down his back in long curls that were gathered into a ribbon i took him rightly to be sir william the husband and made him my demure bow as i passed his lady gave me a great kiss in full view of the house and taking a little jewel from her bosom pinned it into mine there she said wear this for lady hamilton in token of the only reel feeling she has come across in your beastly city sir william put his hand on her arm my dear he said she fanned herself boisterously she had been disappointed everyone knew in her designs to be received at court and was to leave england in a few days missing the coveted honour somehow she reminded me of the bouncing chit that our gentlemen call a champagne bottle she so gushed and sparkled and was a little large and loud i made my acknowledgments quite prettily and left the box and once got outside leaned for a moment against the wall with a feeling of mortal sickness come over me for as i retreated i had come face to face with those seated at the back and one of them was the earl of herring had he recognised me he had not appeared to lift his eyes even as he sat at discussion with his neighbour and that might be the most deadly sign of all i dont know how i got through the rest of my part but that night i clung to patty as if she were my only support in a failing world morning brought some reassurance and so for a further evening or two finding myself still unmolested i struggled to convince myself that he had not seen or that i was forgotten and my fault passed over but all the time the terror lay at my heart on the third evening as i was entering the theatre i encountered a poor creature standing by the stage door i went to him i almost fell upon his breast in my agitation gogo i said gogo and stood dumb and shame stricken before him he threw up his hands with that odd familiar gesture with that tempestuous sigh which found such an immediate response in my soul are you not coming in i faltered he shook his head you are dismissed i spoiled their dragon for them i burst into tears it was for me dear do you see to what i have come forgive me gogo i cant help myself he groaned you are my destiny gogo i am frightened i am in danger help me gogo the poor fellow smiled in everything but running away diana and that is just where i want your help come to me come and see me to morrow gogo will you o gogo will you dont be foolish diana at what time you know my address of course i do as early as early then the moment i am out of bed strangely comforted and looking to see if we were alone i dropped a tiny kiss on his rough cheek and ran in gaily wiping my eyes as i went that night i sang my little song with renewed feeling and ended to a burst of applause as i was standing at the wings flushed and radiant a note was put into my hand i opened it and read you are in danger dont go home i never learned who had sent it some one probably from amongst the few friends i could still number in that wicked household it had been handed in at the stage door by a messenger and that was all i could discover the lights of my triumph were darkened i knew myself at last hunted and alone why had i not bid my monster wait for me but it were idle now to moan despair gave me readiness i finished my part quite brilliantly without a stumble and chatted gaily while disrobing with the poor pretty little coryphe who was my chief friend in the dressing rooms by one pretext or another i detained her until we were alone then fanny i said keep mum but i think it unlikely i shall come here again she looked at me with her large grey eyes we were much of a figure and not unlike in features o miss rush she whispered and id oped always to ave you for a friend so you shall fanny i said but there are contingencies you understand her lip was trembling i think she wanted to tell me to keep good and so i said hastily as i have liked you so i want to exchange little presents with you as a remembrance if you will the poor child had often cast admiring eyes on a calash which it was my habit to wear to the theatre and which was indeed a very becoming thing of crimson velvet and cherry coloured lining with a frame of costly fur to the face it had been given me by bob and certainly nothing short of my present desperation would have brought me to part with it but it was more than anything i wore of late associated with me and necessity has no conscience fannys eyes sparkled against her will as i held the thing out to her o no miss she entreated its too good for me and i cant give you nothing the same in exchange you shall give me your neckerchief i said and cutting the discussion short drove her away at length with her pretty face in the hood and tears in her eyes i gave her five minutes start then followed her out with a brain as hot as my heart was shivering they must discover their mistake very soon i thought and will be returning on their tracks however i reached home running by byways in safety and there quite unnerved now the terror was passed threw myself into pattys arms and told her everything she was the sweet simple counsel and consoler she always was to grief and distressed me only by some concern she could not help showing for the fate of fanny you try to make me out a devil i cried passionately they will let her alone of course when they find she isnt who they want we slept in one anothers arms that night fearful of every sound in the street but morning brought the sun and gogo though the latter inexcusably late to his appointment and both were a heavenly joy to me i saw at once by his expression that he carried news but he did not speak gogo i whispered he uttered a strange sound like a wounded beast and turned his face from me did you exchange head dresses with her last night he muttered what do you mean my heart seemed to stop they said it was your hood she was jostled by ruffians in the street it seems and thrown under the traffic and killed i fell on my knees before him shuddering and hiding my face you didnt mean that diana before god no i thought they would leave her when they found out he gave a heart breaking sigh and looked at me for the first time i wouldnt go near the theatre again if i was you theyll not judge you as as favourably as i perhaps ive done with the theatre fate is very cruel no one understands me or believes in me at least dont tell patty anything of this i think you will break my heart among you how did you even know i was threatened didnt you tell me you were in danger i cried out to him in a sudden agony i am in danger o gogo for gods sake tell me what i am to do then the great human love of the creature went down before me he fondled me with tears and broken exclamations he swore himself once more through all eternity through sin and sorrow my bondman presently without extenuation i had confessed all to him and he had forgiven me had admitted even that i had had the reason of a better regard on my side but as to what had happened to himself during the long interval he would tell me nothing as yet i am the ex hind legs of a dragon he said that was conquered by the chevalire primrose and turned into two thirds of a prince i date myself from the translation the curtains down on all that was before now when we came to discussing the ways and means for my escape from a desperate situation my dear resourceful monster was ready with a suggestion at once the hamilton said he sails from england in a day or two she is disposed by the tokens to make a pet of you why not go to her relate everything throw yourself upon her charity and ask to be conveyed abroad in her suite gogo when i cried it was an inspiration no moment like the present i will go but you must come too to protect me of course and patty all three of us together pack your box pay your bill and be ready while i wait at the worst tis something gained to shift your quarters and cover your trail i demurred only at the bill for indeed we needed every penny of our ready money but he settled the matter by paying it himself i have become of a saving disposition he said and whatever trifle there be you are its heir this is only drawing on your reversion and indeed he valued money at nothing at all if he could have picked a living from the earth he would never have been to the trouble of putting a penny in his pocket in a little all being prepared we took a coach and drove to the ambassadors hotel my lady was fortunately at her toilette and sent down a surprised message that whatever the deuce i wanted i was to be shown up i found her tumbled a little abroad in the hands of her perruquier whom she dismissed while she talked to me why child she said what a face tis as white i vow as the wings of your butterfly out with your trouble now i threw myself at her feet i made a clean breast of my story of the inhuman cruelty of which i was the destined victim and i ended by imploring her to let me and my friends enjoy the bounty of her protection she fired magnificently as i had hoped she would over the recital she embraced my cause impulsively and without a thought for possible consequences to herself the infamous old fox she cried of my lord i was flattered by his attentions hang him until i found they was of the worst consequence to me as a lady of position to think of the old beast wanting to murder you because of a lampoon pasquinades we call em in italy la child if i answered so to every dig thats made at me id better turn public executioner at once lets keep our own characters clean against the light being turned on em say i and if we dont theres only ourselves to thank its too late to talk of bein a lady when the crowner comes to sit on our dirty stockins she made me repeat my little song to her and cried over it again trot up your friends she said wiping her eyes theres room for you all here till we start for france or naples if you will let me see the old devil dare to follow you into this sancshery well be even with him gnashin his yellow teeth left behind go and fetch em i want to see what theyre like and she gave me a tempest of a kiss and pushed me out at the door it is here we encounter that considerable lacuna in the reminiscences to which reference was made in the introductory an examination of the ms shows that the large section of more than a hundred pages which related to mrs pleases experiences during the terrific period of the revolution and afterwards so far as the year when the narrative is resumed was at some time bodily removed whether with a view to separate publication of which however no proof can be found or through one of those intermittent panics of conscience to which the lady was subject there is no evidence to show while this breach is to be regretted from her editors point of view at least it must be said that innumerable contemporary references to madame se plaire enable us in some measure not only to follow the career of that redoubtable adventuress pace m le comte de c but to supply to ourselves at least one presumptive reason for her shyness on reflection of perpetuating certain of its incidents however not to confuse matters we will take our stepping stones in the order of their placing it appears then that mrs please and her friends were conveyed safely in the ambassadors entourage to paris where madame the ambassadors wife received during the few days of her stay in the french capital on her way to italy some salve to her hurt vanity in the reception accorded her at the tuileries by the queen who took the opportunity to intrust her with a letter to her sister of naples whether elated indirectly by the royal condescension or electrified by the state of the national atmosphere or for whatever reason diana it appears decided to remain where she was she even there is some reason for believing sought in the character of a very loyal little moucharde to ingratiate herself with the queen going so far as to imply that lady hamilton had taken this delicate means of placing in her majestys hands a counter buff to mr pitt whom miss diana had often seen in my lord of herrings house in berkeley square and whose sinister designs against france she was quite ready to quote or invent however this may be it seems certain that her majesty was inexplicably so far from being prepossessed by her fair visitors fair protge that assuming even that she gave her her countenance at the first she did not hesitate long in turning upon her the coldest of cold shoulders we know at least that within a month of her arrival in paris diana which always equals be it understood diana plus her two inseparables had established herself far from the precincts of the court in very good rooms in a house in the rue st jacques where with characteristic suddenness and thoroughness she announced her complete conversion to the principles of ultra republicanism it must have been about this time moreover that she found interest to return to the stage for in addition to the inclusion of her name in the bill of that stirring melodrama les victimes clotres which set all fermenting paris overflowing there exists that reference to her in the rather spiteful reminiscences of adrienne lavasse which i think is worth transcribing mademoiselle please says the actress was for a little our ingnue at the franais she was imported from england but it must be confessed had a pretty gift une belle facilit for our tongue one night after a mle in the green room she lifts her voice in a furious outcry about her having been ravished of a neckerchief which had been given her by a fellow comdienne in london and which she declares she would not have parted with for a louis dor but i never observed adds the little spitfire that she took the trouble to replace it with another from which it is evident that it was not her modesty that she valued at so high a figure how long mrs please continued on the stage at this time she returned to it again later is not certain probably her engagement was terminated by that famous split in the company when democratic talma and vestris migrated to the rue de richelieu bequeathing the remnant honours of the old house in the faubourg st germain to the royalist fleury dazincourt and company what we do know is that about this critical period a lucky coup in a state lottery established our heroine on her feet and that thenceforth she flourished she kept a little salon in those same historic rooms through which a regular progression of nationalists passed and vanished there in their time were to be seen brissot guadet gensonn the roman roland the handsome barbaroux ption vergniaud the sweet and indolent in his ragged coat desmoulins barrre billaud varennes barras the order is significant of our ladys political or politic evolution the life of the state she came to think was only to be saved by ruthless amputation and unfortunately the disease was in the head as the atmosphere thickens our glimpses of her become rarer and more lurid she appears once as the proprietress of a sort of mont de pit very private and exclusive in which she amassed good quantity of property pledged by the proscribed who never returned to redeem it among these curiously seems to have been her father whom as characteristically as possible she forgave and attempted to shelter though without avail for he was guillotined it was probably to propitiate the government for this filial dereliction that she reappeared on the boards in in that grotesque monument to the dulness of the sovereign people the last judgment of kings and there so far as we can trace ended her connection with the stage during all this period it is only fair to her to say she seems to have played the inflexible duenna to her little friend and adoratrice miss patty grant protecting the child from outside evil and her own kind pliability and when she was called away from her side committing her to the care of that faithful and incorruptible monster the cripple towards the end of she appears to have been so far in favour with the powers that she was despatched on a secret propagandist mission to the neapolitan states a portentous departure she was not back in paris again until the spring of when she returned to find the terror overthrown its tail in process of being docked by sanson and the jeunesse dore patrolling the streets not much record of this journey remains beyond the single weighty fact that it brought her acquainted with the young revolutionary enthusiast nicola pissani who accompanied her home by way of tuscany and piedmont propagating their gospel of liberty on the road we may perhaps be pardoned for thinking it probable that mrs please on her return to paris would have recanted her extremist views had it not been for this romantic exalt to whom no doubt she at the time was sincerely attached it is possible indeed that she did persuade him of the necessity of an open recantation in order that she might consort with him the more safely in those measures which he and for his sake she had at heart the violent establishment of a republic at naples to wit for for the moment sanscullotism was out of fashion and propagandists at a discount it made no difference to her apparently that her former patroness and saviour was heart and soul with the court of ferdinand she was of the roman mettle and would have sacrificed her own child to liberty with pissani i swear my heart bleeds for her for the truth has to be uttered that passionate young zealot was no sooner made free of the house in the rue st jacques than he fell hopelessly entangled in the unconscious meshes of poor blameless lovable little patty grant and worse miss grant without a thought of disloyalty to her friend and sister who indeed persistently and perhaps justifiably posed for no more than the neapolitans pious fellow missionary yielded her whole sweet soul to him nothing was declared or came of this at the time pissani went back to naples the two he and diana not he and another you may be sure unless by stealth corresponded regularly the march of events proceeded our heroine managed no doubt to console herself provisionally for the separation perhaps she may have been conscious of an alteration in her friend a hint of some sad preoccupation the bright eyes dulling the white face growing ever a little more white and drawn if she did she chose while biding her time of enlightenment to attach any but the right reason to the change she seems to confess indeed that she had the suspicion like enough in that case she indulged it for a perpetual stimulant to her romance which might have withered without she was not one to bear tamely her supplanting by another least of all by the little humble slave of her passions and caprices of her kisses and disdains and in the meantime the years went over them while she was studying to ingratiate herself with the directory so that presently her house knew again its succession of ministers and deputies men who came to lighten their leisure with a little interlude of love or wit and so we reach the crisis naples about the middle of was in a last state of ferment jacobinism threatened it within and without the former but awaiting the advance of the french under championnet to arise and hand over the city to its sympathisers in september nelson came sweeping to its sea gates in his vanguard in october general mack posted from vienna to take command of its rabble army of resistance in november its king led another army to rome nominally to restore the pope his kingdom and having done some ineffective mischief returned ingloriously to find his capital in a state of anarchy finally in december the whole royal family sneaked on board the vanguard and transferred itself pro tempore to palermo where it remained until the danger was laid when it returned to exact a bloody vengeance therewithin lies the whole tragedy of pissani and a little english maid early in the february of that year the man had written hurried and agitated to mrs please to announce that the moment was ripe the tree of despotism tottering to its fall to be replaced by the more fruitful one of liberty and to urge her to come at once if she would see consummated the glorious work for which they had both laboured so long and so self sacrificially no doubt that he believed in her single heartedness as she in another way in his he assured her that she might be if she would a second pucelle he fired her vanity he rekindled her passion with characteristic impetuosity she broke up her household and here figures either her blindness or her imperious self confidence prepared to transport it stock and block to the scene of her anticipated triumphs she had no difficulty in procuring passports indeed there is reason to suppose that she was intrusted with despatches for general berthier then occupying rome at any rate she in company with mademoiselle grant and her inseparable gogo embarked at marseilles for civita vecchia were in the eternal city before the end of the month and had thence travelling again by sea reached naples without accident by the middle of march here by preconcerted arrangement as regarded only herself and the neapolitan however they were met by pissani who conducted them in the first instance to a little cabaret in the dark quarters near the arsenal and here from the glooms of that dingy rendezvous mrs please is pleased to enter again upon her own story b c note to the curious in matters of personal appearance the following extract from the roper correspondence hicks beach london may be of interest the passage occurs in a letter dated paris january from the hon robert roper to his cousin lord carillon and runs as follows i have renewed my acquaintance with the please who is twenty seven and nothing if not the ripe fruit of her promise dost remember dick how she was your long legged hebe i tell you sir she is by jove out of leda a very helen she moults her years like the swan her father its feathers and is always ready with a virgin bosom of down for the next quilt the same sprightly insolence the same perfect irregularity of feature and conduct the same zeal in making the interests of others her own and the profits thereof her face retains its pretty moue her hair has only ripened a little like corn she is still slender as we remember her in everything now but the essentials still as pale with the flawless eyebrows and bob cherry lips i would be sentimental but alack she tells me our past is put away in a little bag like lavender would you wish the gift of it sir she says to lay among your bed linen tis grown too scentless for my use il ny a si bonne compagnie quon ne quitte o dick to be rebuked for ones years and by an immortal o dick for the time when wheat is green and hawthorn buds appear why may not our feet continue to dance with our hearts i have a dbutante always within my breast and because i am forty she must be a wallflower forsooth she has realised at last la grande passion she tells me she is perfectly frank he is gone elsewhere and she only waits for his whistle to follow this to me she has her little salon as pretty as a bonbon box and a dozen of powdered ministers at her feet the morning after our meeting i breakfasted with her and her friend you recall the little soft brunette with the motherly eyes and the caressing bashfulness she is still with her the foil as of old to her ladyship and virgin soil to this day i believe madam took her tea laced with a little eau de vie there was a curious legless monster in waiting something between a dumb waiter and a covent garden porter she defers to him in everything and he growls xxv i declare for the king we were landed upon the mole not far from the castel nuovo a vast sullen pile like the bastille on whose ruins i had danced it was a dark and rainy night pissani who had been squatted amongst some boats down by the water rose came forward in two or three swift strides and exclaimed in an eager agitated undertone mother of god you are accompanied i could not see his face but my heart responded unerringly to the dear remembered tones i went quickly to him and put up my hands to his breast nicola mio my brother my comrade i whispered by all that next to you i hold most dear what whom he asked in a low voice of amazement not yes i said by my servant and my sister you called and i came nicola bringing my sheaves with me he was breathing fast but he did not answer are you not pleased i said that i give up everything for you and to you that i devote my best to the cause our cause nicola that at the bidding of my brother i have moved my tent into the wilderness are you not pleased with me there is danger in the wilderness he muttered no i am not pleased i fell back with a little shiver no more for her than for me i answered it is not the same he said it is not the same thing at all in an instant he had gripped my wrist send her back into safety she shall not risk her life here by god she shall not and then i think i understood i was calm as death and as cold it had needed but these few words to turn me into stone my god all my fervour and self sacrifice and this for their reward i laughed out quite gaily o mon chri in the rain and the dark are you mad please to convey us to some shelter he hesitated a moment then beckoned to patty who came running like a dog to the whistle pissani turned his back as she approached tell your servant to await your orders here he muttered and for you follow me patty stole by my side dumb over her reception the fool the little adorable traitress how would she have chattered teeth and heart had she seen my nails hid under my cloak dug into the soft palms they were clinched on yet i had an admiration for her even while i crouched to spring that she self obliterating undemonstrative with men could all the time have been softly insinuating herself between me and my love i had not credited her with so much cleverness our sombre patriot led us to a little osteria in a sewer hard by where the rain beat on a lurid scrap of window and a mutter of voices from within seemed to mingle in a throaty discussion with a gurgling water pipe at our feet there were two or three wine drinkers revealed as he pushed open the door strangely respectable folk in these incongruous surroundings they but glanced up as we entered and passed on by a stone passage to a little remote room where were a bare table and a single taper glimmering sickly on the wall pissani shut the door and faced us he was very pale and grim grown sterner than my memory of him but still the melancholy romantic brigand of my heart for a moment he seemed unable to speak and in that moment i could see my little sisters hand shake on the table on which she had leaned it for support the truth was confessed amongst us all in that silence and i i knew it suddenly instantly for what i had long suspected but struggled to conceal from myself knew it for the real solution of this my conscious unconscious caprice in bringing patty with me it had been to force it to satisfy myself of the best or the worst that i had acted as i had done that i recognised now and after all i was the first to speak well m pissani i said it seems that one of us at least is de trop his mouth twitched with nervousness she cannot help the cause he said she will only be in the way what is her use in this pass patty i said turning on the child m pissani does not want you you can go back she looked at me the helpless fool her lip trembled and her eyes filled with tears but pissani by that was smiling i do not want you child i he said in a sick voice and held out his hands fondly to her across the table ah but we know better the truth of our hearts when the battle is won then o gentle my love that betakest thyself to love as the lark to heaven come to me as you promised but not now not now when the storm is in the air and this so dear shrine of my hopes might be struck and violated you have not changed you could not change it is enough i have seen you come now with me pattia and i will take you back to the boat to my friends that they may see you secured in rome until i can send to you and say it is time most dear wife it is time return to me and give thyself to be the mother of patriots she moved and gave a little sob her response was not to him but to me to the stunned questioning of my eyes she had no wit but to utter her whole self condemnation in it diana i did not know i have not been untrue to you i struck her on the mouth and she staggered back with that red lie printed on it for the delectation of her paramour she clutched at the table reeled and sank down beside it moaning it was too much my fury had flashed to an explosion in that wicked falsehood pissani with a sudden and terrible cry at the sight of his mistresss disgrace drew a knife from his hip and leapt like a goat across the table stumbling as he alighted she caught him frantic round the knees and held him raging and snarling while he stabbed at the air in his frenzy i stood fallen back a little white and scornful but with not a thrill of fear at my heart and so standing saw how in the thick blindness of his rage he was yet tender of her in his struggles to free himself and then in a moment he had fallen upon his knees the blade yet in his hand and was kissing and caressing her moaning inarticulate love into her ear she tried feebly to repulse him to drag herself away and towards me i had always known that she was of the fools who caress the hands that scourge them but i sprang back loathing her neighbourhood dont come near me i cried he had kissed the blood from her mouth to his own he struck the spot there with a furious hand as he turned on me by this he said your death or mine i laughed scornfully so brutes revenge themselves on the innocence they have despoiled it is a lie he raged and on the word put a fierce arm about his wife believe it is a lie thou but she was still struggling to reach me diana not this end to all our love not this end to the high hopes with which we came it is not ourselves but liberty sister see he will be good he will not hurt you she was groping eagerly for the knife which he ended by letting her secure i did not know she cried i did not guess until this moment i did not i will never see him again if you wish i will be no mans wife to your hurt diana it is the truth i let her rave i never took my eyes from his devils face so i said deeper now and with my hands upon my storming bosom you would make your sacrifice to reason monsieur in me me my mission was to be the pucelles and her glorious fate with which i suppose you were to assure your little after paradise of loves o a grateful use for this poor heart to be a stepping stone to the respectable amours of monsieur and madame pissani only i renounce the honour as i renounce the cause of the paragon of taste who could prefer that for this i tore at my dress you have made your choice i cried it is all said only think monsieur think sometimes of what you have lost before you talk of the battle being won i hurried from the room even as my false friend called to me again in agony diana believe me listen to me o what shall i do but even in my frenzy i had the wit to pause the other side of the door listening for his response thou shalt go back to rome my dearest my heart he said hearken to me my pattia but she only sobbed dreadfully not like this not in this disgrace i must follow her even if she kills me by my soul no he said for your life is mine i could hear them wrestling together till in a moment he prevailed even before i had guessed he would hush my bird he panted softly there is one other way if it must be so indeed there followed a pause i could have laughed in the mad joy of my revenge he was an upstart this patriot a son of the people he would commit her to his own wive her i most fervently prayed and deposit his jewel this little pet of luxury in the squalid cabin at camaldoli where he was born he had often told me of it of his early experiences of the joys of life in a place where the peasant could not fasten his coat against cold or take refuge from the sun under a tree or borrow a stone from the hill for his paths or renew his starved patch with manure of leaves or set a water butt to catch the showers or be buried decently when he dropped at the plough tail and died because buttons and the shade of trees and stones and dead leaves and rain water and a dead peasant were all taxed alike items in a hundred other feudal impositions which left existence hardly its own shadow to prevail by and now these joys would be hers for i knew that she had not the strength to oppose him though enough to damn her own fool fortune by insisting on the churchs sanction to her possession of an estate of mud and wattles i listened eagerly for the next if thou wilt be my mothers daughter he said i could have clapped my hands i hurried down the passage and out into the night fierce burning but with an exultation in my rage the sight of men risen scared and listening as i passed through the wineshop served to recall me to myself and to my danger i was outcast from these conspirators if only they had known with an effort i composed myself and turned to them with a smile messieurs but the door is between me and the street one of them at that stepped forward opened it and gravely bowed me forth as gravely i stepped into the rain and made without hurry for the beach so this was the end to all my exaltation to my dreams of love and sacrifice i stamped in the puddles vive la tyrannie vive les bourbons i cried to myself as i sped on so shamed so wronged so spurned was not the worst justified to me i saw the shadow of my loved monster standing solemn sentinel over the single trunk we had brought with us our heavy baggage we had left in rome o mon fidle how at that moment i could have stormed my wounded heart out on thy breast canst thou lift it and follow me i said only he answered the dear caliban by obeying whither he growled i looked desperately about me near at hand it was all a tangle of spars and sheds and the rain driving between but inland the night went up in glistening terraces scattered constellations all shaken in the thunder of a great city far south what looked like the red light of a forge alternately glared and faded and grew again battling it seemed with drowning flaws of tempest it was the glimmering bonfires of vesuvius those hot ashes of a consumed empire from which according to pissani the phnix liberty was to arise i laughed not yet my poet my friend since thou choosest another than pucelle to breed thee thy patriots i turned to the north there upon a huddle of tall buildings looming near and enormous in the dark the stars of the hills seemed to have drifted down clinging thickly over all like primroses under a bank it is the royal palace said gogo it is our way then i panted on fire follow me and quickly we are not safe here along wharfs and causeways plashing over the filthy stones by squalid alley and reeking wall i fled and he pursued i had no lodestar save my hate but it served the growing scream and thunder of the town drove towards us as we advanced but few people in that bitter night until skirting the massed buildings of the arsenal and palace we emerged suddenly through a little lane into the strada di st lucia and paused a moment undecided and amazed it was as if the devil had taken his glowing pencil and ruled off this quarter of the city for his own a noisome ravine of houses it was with life like a fiery torrent brawling along its bed song and tumult and mad licence fingers quick to stab or to snap like castanets to a dancing child doorways that were the mouths of tributary sewers vomiting filth and tatters into the main fishermen at their flaring stalls bawling crabs and oysters frutti di mare my god what fruit and from what a sea that drained a shambles women out in the rain and the open making their shameless toilettes and screaming the while such damnation by the calendar on their sister doxies for a word a retort a mere flea bite the commonest experience after all as to leave themselves one would have thought no vocabulary for the more strenuous encounters of fists and claws children swarming everywhere in the double sense and scattering shrill oaths like vermin rags and nakedness and insolence a loafing melodrama an epitome of the worst squalor and viciousness in all naples such was the district upon which we had alighted the mid ward of the lazzaroni as we stood a ruffian swaggering past swerved and approached a handsome impudent face gogo without a word heaved his shoulder between but i had no fear these lazzari were the kings friends and mine i pushed aside my henchman pour le roi i cried and pointed towards the palace he understood and whipped off his greasy hat viva il re he answered enthusiastically showing his white teeth and motioned us to a street going eastwards up the hill i saw and recognised the same fellow once or twice afterwards he was a michele di laudo mad michael they called him who as chief of his vagabonds was to take a prominent part in the defence of the suburbs against the french we crossed the street under his protection and on its farther side before waving us on he bent and snatched a kiss the rank sweet touch of his lips was like a vis on my passport into hell it seemed to bring the blaze the colour the stench of the reeling streets clashing to a focus in my brain and it sent me speeding on half drunk and half sick loathing and hugging myself i was an angel in sodom running blindly for the refuge of gods wing in a dazzle of roaring lights and confused by the glare knowing not whether i turned to the self i had left or to the self that was awaiting me gogo straining in my wake panted as i hurried before him for every dog but the watch dog a bone i turned on him with a stamp a bone i am meat for your masters i tell you i serve no pissani he said sullenly i shook him in my anger never breathe his name to me again or we part very well he said i thought as much he has got his deserts has he i glared at him one moment then turned and sped on up the street of the giant passing the north flank of the palace where sentries stood on guard and so into an open piazza the largho s ferdinando into which the palace itself stuck a shoulder and where were churches and the flaring portico of a theatre and other buildings strangely fine in their contiguity to the slums we had left and here amidst the wild drift and gabble of a throng less foul but as aimless we plunged and were absorbed and stood together again to breathe all naples it seemed was bent on shouting down its brother what next bawled gogo in my ear a handsome inn the orient stood comparatively quiet and isolated in an odd corner of the place rooms there i answered its exclusiveness makes it prominent boomed gogo with as much dryness as he could put into a roar i beckoned him on imperiously on na jamais bon march de mauvaise marchandise in a little we were installed in comfortable rooms now order wine i said and we will drink i sipped while he sat on a stool at my feet soothing the weariness from them with a touch that was only my monsters the chianti and the sorcery of his hand began to drug me drink you too i murmured he reached for his glass to whom he said what are we now it makes no difference only i must know death to all republics i cried and long life to the king of naples ah he said between a groan and a sigh well the poor child you have cast her off i suppose and he drained his glass i stared at him a moment then fell sobbing upon his shoulder you pity everyone but me i cried and my heart is broken what in the old place said he but i was too miserable to retort and half the night afterwards he held me fallen fast asleep in his arms xxvi i renew an old acquaintance for three days i remained shut into my rooms at the orient not daring to go out a prey to the utmost nervousness and agitation do not suppose that on that account i was the less determined in my plans for vengeance but revenge that lays itself open to retribution misses the better half of itself i remembered my old friend mr ropers dictum and beat my brains only for the means to strike with impunity i was not from the first without a design the difficulty was to give it practical effect because for the moment i could not use gogo for myself under my assumed name i might lie secure in this hiding to make him my carrier to the english embassy would be to mark a sure track to my retreat with every punch of his wooden legs i dared not let him out i dared not even temporarily part with him in my peril i dared not come to a decision while knowing that my life depended on a wise one for i was a renegade revolutionary i could not blink the fact though i had never hitherto actually set foot in naples itself there must be many to know me by report for that apostle of the new creed of equality who but a few years before had stumped their country winning converts and now the safety of many men and women too was in my hands and not pissani nor those others when they came to learn would have forgotten the nature of my secession or the significance of the threats which had accompanied it if passion had given me away caution must redeem me i had no faith in pattys power to protect me the occasion was too desperate the interests involved were too many pissani was a reformer before he was a lover i must be sacrificed if possible to the cause i had the means to betray all day peeping from behind the curtains of our windows we saw the piazza below like a seething cauldron of unrest as significant of that as anything were the out at elbows letter writers under the arcades of the old theatre of san carlo who at a time when every man feared to commit his simplest thoughts to paper did less than enough business to keep themselves in macaroni they served to exhibit the popular bankruptcy as well as the briefless advocates who from thriving on the countless abuses of the law found themselves abandoned to the lawlessness they had created as well as the journalists who having been brought under a strict moral censorship starved as vampires might on a diet of milk as well as the professors and savants who were hampered it must be confessed by a thousand childish restrictions in their efforts to make life beautiful by turning it inside out and to teach men to follow in themselves while eating an omelet the whole process of absorption and digestion as well as the bolder demagogues who mounted on steps or tubs screamed denunciations of their misgoverning sovereigns under the transparent veil of claudius and messalina and called upon their hearers by many classical examples to strike for liberty and political cleanliness at which the lazzari laughed understanding just so much that if they were to be no longer flea bitten they would be deprived of the traditional luxury of scratching and shaking their heads over that new idea of equality which was in fact so old an idea as to be embodied in a popular proverb tu rubbi a me io rubbo a te which one might expound if taffy robs me i rob taffy so what the devils all this fuss about naples was rich in charitable institutions for the encouragement of indolent beggary and what sort of a reform was it that sought to deprive an honest loafer of his soup and so to a man they held out for dirt moral and material and for the king who assured them a continuance in both a condition of things which made revolution a very different affair from what it had been in starving paris since the date of my first visit in this ferment had been rising in spite of all efforts of the authorities to check it as well try to stop the decomposition of a dead body for such was the national credit the foolish vile queen panic sick that she was destined to the fate of her better meaning but as foolish sister in paris persuaded her weak common husband into a counter blast to the terror with as much effect as king james the firsts against smoking it is bad policy to try to suppress an evil by advertising it self martyrdom is the most popular of all notorieties they inaugurated a system of espionage which in itself was an education to conspirators they read jacobinism across the forehead of all learning and so alienated the intelligence which might have saved the land they crammed the filthy prisons with suspects and broke the hearts and fortunes of those who were the best leaven to corruption they made it criminal to wear scarlet waistcoats and long trousers finally for some such dereliction or one less momentous they hung up two or three respectable boys in a public square varying the entertainment by shooting down some scores of spectators who had fallen into a panic at the noise of a distant musket shot and then having thrown their sacrifice on the flames of discontent and so lowered them they settled down with an affectation of the strong arm and a blindness to the embers smouldering underneath these had not ceased to smoulder nevertheless feeding on their new fuel and by and by the blaze was to come eh bien la voix du peuple est la voix de dieu so they say only unfortunately here the lazzari were the crack in it it was a pretty naples i had come to one afternoon while looking out of the window i saw a magnificent equipage cross the square and turning the corner towards the palace disappear i had been waiting during these long days for some such vision the nature of which now if indeed the plaudits of the loafers had not confirmed it in my mind was established in the glimpse of a bold beautiful face which i obtained in its passing on the instant my resolution was made and i ran to the table and hastily scribbled off a note one whom you formerly befriended seeks your help and protection she is in possession of important secrets which you cannot afford to discard ask for her under the name of madame lavasse at the orient i called gogo and hurriedly instructed him lady hamilton has just passed driving to the palace her coach is gilt with four dapple greys go secretly out by the back make your way there circumspectly wait for her reappearance and throw this in at the window of her carriage then return here but by a roundabout way and not till after dark be swift and sure everything our safety our lives depends on this opportunity he groaned out a little sigh and our honour diana think of the time when we shall be damned together before you betray the child i walked up and down in terrible agitation when he was gone betray who had been the traitor of us two not a drop of water for her though i were to lie in abrahams bosom night came but no gogo tortured with doubts and apprehensions i could neither eat nor rest had he too repented at last of his loyalty and abandoned me in my need they all fell from me those i had succoured and most trusted sometimes in my agony of mind i upbraided his selfishness cursed my own irreclaimable fondness in putting faith in man i believed he had sold himself whether to cupidity or an emotion what did it matter at length quite exhausted by my passions i fell asleep on my bed dressed as i was i slept far into the morning and awoke to a consciousness of a presence in the next room was it he returned at last dazed and sick with excitement i rose and ran to meet him a lady only was there cloaked and mysterious she lifted her veil and showed me the face i had desired it had not indeed so much altered in these years as her persons amplitude conceive my dear friend the head of a circe on the body of a hippopotamus now i perceived natures forethought in the gift of those immense feet they were disproportionate no longer she had grown colossal the mountain had come to mahomet it was wonderful how in spite of all she could have retained the general fine contour of her features one would have thought she could hardly have kept her countenance seeing the changes below i certainly found it difficult to keep mine as i fell on my knees before her and catching at her hands hung my head she stepped back from me shaking the room i understood then in a moment that the old glamour was only to be recovered if at all with discretion now madam she said being come at your request i must ask you for your reason and as short as youll please to make it my messenger i began your messenger she interrupted me promptly is put under lock and key till we know more about him and you he got a cut on the cheek before he was took by the guards but that wasnt my fault i buried my face in my hands i thank you madam i said with emotion he lies at least in better security than i well i wont answer for that she replied till i come to hear what youre after i looked up o madam my benefactress i cried it is much to expect perhaps but do you not know me o perfectly madam she said with a curtsey that made her balloon we make it our pains to know all about our visitors believe me you was under surveillance from the moment you stepped ashore at the mole it was not very likely was it that we should overlook the arrival of her as seemed wishin to reap the discord she had sowed among us a while back be sure we know you madam well enough and the reputation you built for yourself in paris too startled as i was i had a difficulty to refrain from retorting that my reputation would bear comparison with hers but i bit my lip on the temptation and for the moment took refuge from everything in tears to which however she listened silent i did not refer to that i cried looking up with clasped hands and swimming eyes but to the goodness of a great and beautiful lady who once succoured a poor girl in distress and i include that too in my knowledge said she and much gratitude youve shown to the class as befriended you gratitude i cried o believe me that until i reached here i never even guessed that in conspiring against royalty i was conspiring against you my saviour she sat down on a chair near breaking it didnt you she said gathering the folds of her cloak about her well supposing you didnt what then you aint goin to forego your principles for a sentiment like that dont tell me if you wont believe me i murmured despairingly why look here madame lavasse or please or whatever your damned name is she said shaking a hectoring finger at me one may help a girl but a woman helps herself which i make no bones of guessing youve managed to do pretty free the question with you is whether jacobinism or royalty is going to pay best and if youre proposin to change about and turn informer no better moral than profit is at the bottom of your little game ill vow well i dont say but in that case were open to treat only ill ask you to drop the artless girl which dont sit well on you at your age and talk with me like one woman of the world to another i rose to my feet with a burning face go i said with an imperious gesture insult me no more have i not suffered wrong and outrage enough but my heart must be made the sport of every common highty tighty miss she rose in astonishment for a moment she stood conning me my quivering lips and heaving bosom then of a sudden she smiled well perhaps she said there ive a way of letting my tongue run away with me but its no example for you to follow i should have remembered the glass houses in the sayin before i twitted you with your past only for sure diana please it can never be said against me that i betrayed my love that betrayed me my rage was all gone i dropped my head with a sad little cry the sound of it brought her to my side was he not your love she whispered him that came with you and i answered he was my love was was she repeated well i see they take other fancies you was sold yourself is it not true i muttered ay she answered and sighed but it was for gold you can forgive then and forget i said but not i no never you would ruin him yes and her bring him to the gallows that is why i sent for you you can trust me and in the meantime you fear for yourself i struck her he tried to stab me i cried vive le roi you know what that means cry vive la reine for the future tis the sweet saint who suffers most well it seems the truth at last and you have your provocation by god you have only for me having one different to help myself by you it goes against my stomach somehow i wish it was your principles instead of your jealousy help me in nothing but to some place of safety where i can inform and direct the court it will not be troubled with your ladyships scruples how do you know tis so you have been taught to regard my sweet queen i suppose o madam i cried you know what made me an ardent pupil she stood musing upon me long and earnestly yes perhaps she said at length and sighed what a fool preacher is love not to be able to keep his own faith to drive woman for refuge on woman tis like banishing your physician to the enemys camp well she took my hands i thought she was going to kiss me but she made no offer for myself i dont want to hear none of your inculpations but ill put you in train to satisfy your passions on others that may will that suit you she turned before i could answer and was going it must be soon i urged hoarsely following her o madam dont you understand that it must be soon within an hour or two she said over her shoulder have no fear you are already protected and watched i set myself with what self control i could to await her return for after our emotional confidences i expected nothing less than that she would come for me presently in person but in that i was mistaken as was made evident in the ushering up to me by and by of a very courtly young gentleman of a shrewd sallow visage who informed me with a bow that he was loves emissary his majesty sir i said with a faint smile and some intentional ambiguity is well represented do we go to the palace we go he said to the palace will madam be pleased to accept my escort i took the arm he offered me in view of some such contingency i had spent the interval in making my toilette agreeably to it he conducted me out by the back way to the stables where in a little court we found an ordinary post chaise with two horses awaiting us faire comme on le juge propos murmured my companion and seeing my trunk pregnant with damning evidence well secured in front he handed me in followed himself pulled down the blinds and gave the word in an instant we were rolling over the stones it was a very roundabout way it seemed to me that we took to the palace yet for long so potent was my trust in myself as an emissary of vengeance and so engaging the chatter of my comrade i suspected no treachery but at length losing conscious sense through the thunder of the wheels of a roar and racket which had once accompanied it i started as it were awake and in an immediate panic peeped from behind the blind nearest me and then i saw that we had already left the town and were tearing along country roads i half rose with a cry the palace this is not the way to it my companion seized my wrist in a grip of steel forcing me to reseat myself the very nearest i can assure you madam you are taking me to prison my faith a prison that some would like he said showing his teeth i struggled with him let me out i will raise the country else he released me at once as madam wills madam will claim protection of her friends the jacobins for me i consult only her safety what i panted at him sinking back tell me who are you luigi de medici at madams service he said with a bow a name at least that should be a guarantee of some worth no doubt sir but as a stranger at your mercy i have the honour to be madam the chief of the police the word awoke new frenzy in me my god i am betrayed for pitys sake sir tell me where we go i answered madam to the palace i am a man of my word what palace ah at length madam talks reason to the palace of caserta ten leagues away i stared at him aghast to be immured there truly he said to be immured in a paradise amongst fountains and flowers it is not like the inside of a wall you are pleased to mock me sir but why am i brought so far madam shall ask of her mirror he said with a charming grin shall i so abuse my office as to admit that his majesty is susceptible and that madame the english ambassadress who nevertheless is of a perfect honour is jealous for her friend the queen and perhaps for her own pre eminence in beauty certainly not it is quite enough to say that madame lavasse being in some danger of assassination in naples is removed to a distance for her own security to a place in short whence she can direct the lightning without exciting suspicion of collusion with jupiter he bent and looked into my face i vow madam he said that the last frost of discretion must melt in the fire of such beauty take my word for it that the queen of olympus never of her will would have admitted venus to be of her court this was very disarming to be sure and already before we reached caserta signor de medici was in possession of some preliminary information that proved useful to him xxvii i know how to wait caserta palace was a sort of versailles to the palazzo reale it was a fine long rectangular building lofty and imposing in the eighteenth century style of grand architecture with marble colonnades and innumerable windows the town it dominated being a royal town par excellence was comparatively clean and reposeful and the palace gardens were as extensive and as beautiful as any in the world it was not however to a corner of this stately pile that i found myself committed but to rooms in the casino of st lucius which stood in the park some two miles north of the main building and commanded a noble view not only of the surrounding country but of the dark pruned alleys beset with white statues and the terraces and fountains and cascades of the gardens themselves a lovely spot and here for the moment secure and at peace i resolved upon a life of placid enchantment treated like a queens hostage and biding the development of events i had my little sleepy soft footed household an old groom a pretty maid or two and a quite delectable cook no restrictions were placed upon me i was free to wander as i listed and indeed had no inducement to venture without the cordon of sentries who were my best protection the month was april the most lovely in all naples and save when capri showing near and blue gave indications of the scirocco i spent all my days out of doors so tranquil was it so remote from the centres of ferment i could have thought myself in avalon though all the while and around the clouds of a coming tempest were gathering to burst as i loitered by those empty corridors of green smiling back the smiles of the unruffled statues listening to the drowsy thunder of the waters seeing only for all tokens of human life the little marionnettes of place swarming quite distant and minute about the steps of the palace france was preparing to launch her legions on naples both by land and sea scared refugee cardinals were trotting by the dozen into the city nelson off toulon was shaping his course by way of aboukir to the arms of mrs hart ferdinand was tremblingly fastening his warlike greaves on his fat shins and finally maria carolina was making her bloody tally for the hangman and only of the last was i actively cognisant seeing that it was there alone lay my concern with the outer world from time to time m de medici would visit me in this connection coming ingratiatory and quite lover like to refresh his portfolio with new names from my list or to examine my correspondence which was entirely at his service i had taken no half measures the spared assassin comes to strike again was my motto have i not proved myself a sincere convert i said to him once assuredly most beautiful he answered and fell to counting on his fingers you have given us already certain proof of the guilty complicity of one signor domenico cirillo professor of botany arborist edenist pupil of jean jacques too delicate a flower for this climate two francesco conforti court theologian a priest and ambitious nothing singular but he will be beaten in the race for power by a neck three carlo muscari four his excellency the marquis of polvica a lamentable case five pasquale baffi professor of dead languages for which he will soon be literally qualified six gennaro serra di cassano a very pretty young gentleman late released from confinement but it is sometimes policy to spare the cub if one would learn the way to the dam seven but tis enough madam those six will vindicate you you are welcome to them monsieur i said if only you would exchange against them all my dear indispensable gogo at which as usual he shook his head tightening his lips a bond of sentiment you are better apart at least you might acquaint me where he is as to that he is very safe and well cared for in prison nominally nominally ma belle but observe so are you you know what then there are prisons and prisons well if he is as well off as i i sighed and indeed the assurance was a wonderful comfort to me as a matter of course he kept me constantly informed though i never questioned him as to the career of the pissanis the head and front of all offending signor nicola is our bell wether he would say we have hung a little invisible cymbal about his neck which has the strange quality of sounding only to us o we police are the latter day fairies believe me all unconsciously to himself he calls the flock about him and we we have nothing to do but keep count of them till the season of the butcher arrives then we shall see i shall want perhaps all the fingers of my own hands and of yours too my god a dainty tally and madam you ask though your lips do not move it is very laughable take my word at once since her marriage the dear little frog emulates the bull o fie fie madam misreads me such a scandal i would say only that it has inoculated her with her husbands ambition that she is become an enthusiast in the cause attending meetings distributing tracts haranguing multitudes in her sweet round voice that is like pelting giants with sugar plums yes as madam implies it is marvellous what will not love do but for me i am susceptible i adore all beauty i could wish the poor child another embrace than the hangmans well sir i answered you will have occasion perhaps to offer her the alternative o fie he said is not my heart engaged immutably otherwise who knows it is a sad world it was a very dark and bitter one to me from the moment of his revelations so she could be independent of me and happy in her independence what a world of hypocrisy and double dealing was exposed in this her easy repudiation of my claims upon her during all these years that i had counted her my slave she had been nursing her schemes of treachery been manuvring probably to make me the instrument of her conveyance to her lovers arms and now no doubt they were laughing over their outwitting of me well who laughs last laughs best one day i had a notable visit two ladies walking through the grounds came upon me where i was seated in a grove of myrtle one was lady hamilton very great and gorgeous in a shell shaped hat de sparterie trimmed with butterflies and a violet ribbon knotted under one ear while the other whom i did not know a dowdy ignoble old figure with watery eyes wore a plain fichu chemise and an immense bonnet with a veil thrown back over it they both stopped upon seeing me and lady hamilton beckoned i rose advanced and curtsied here your majesty said my friend is the very person herself her majesty i paled and trembled then ventured a glance from under my lashes sure i was not to blame for my remissness i vow i could have thought my lady had brought her monthly nurse with her for an airing in the country the poor woman looked steeped in caudle flocky with child beds and no wonder in some two dozen years out of her forty five or so she had borne near as many children she had prayed for an heir and heaven had sent her a tempest the eternal lyings in had soured her temper which was not further improved by neuralgia and opium nursing as she did outside her litter a perpetual ambition to wear the breeches of government it had been characteristically mean of her husband to adopt this method to correct it yet in spite of all she had borne both from and to her lord her vigour remained unquenchable indeed in a kingdom which annually abandoned some twenty five thousand babies to the foundlings a child was the cheapest present one could make to ones favourite of the moment yet as i saw her now she was the farthest from imposing or attractive her legs were short and her upper lip so long that her nose stood nearer her forehead than her chin on the former of which she wore a single fat curl like a clock spring she put a hand to it two or three times before she addressed me very quick and hoarse in french maria mais elle fait une bonne mine mauvais jeu come hither child so this is our redoubtable little moucharde we have need of her in these days of the devils advocacy her eyes looked injected her flabby face puckered at the temples like yellow milk skin as i approached she turned away in evident pain lady hamilton was all effusive attentions at once she waved me to stop and supported her friend to the seat i had just occupied commiserating explaining and fondling in one o my darling queen it is the neuralgia that worries my sweet like a dog lean on your emma have you nothing child no salts no drops i fetched a certain vinaigrette from my pocket and bending before the royal knees snapped the stopper once or twice under the royal nose the effect was instantaneous an expression of maudlin relief succeeded to the strain she lay breathing peacefully with a smile on her lips until after some minutes she aroused herself with a sigh what was it then it is a circe with her witchs face and her potions but this was to trespass on the others domain give it to me if you please said mrs hart coldly her majesty would prefer to take it from my hand i returned it quietly to my pocket nay madam i said it is a remedy that must not be repeated she looked at me astounded then broke into a forced laugh hey day we are pretty absolute are we not but the queen grown suddenly very affable and communicative put her aside with a hand which she laid upon my arm we will not quarrel with our physician she knows what she knows moreover for all her long exile and the little errors which she has redeemed she is of the great nation which we love is it not so child and hast thou heard what are the best and latest news none other than that thy glorious captain the supreme nelson has within the last few days annihilated the french fleet at aboukir ah that rose is from thy heart it speaks the proud blood the red rose of england mantling above all foolish sophistries thou canst not but rejoice with us in the destruction of the enemies of thy race of all the world and then she and the other began a little litany of excommunication dogs and assassins despoilers of churches and women hordes of anti christ vomited from hell scum and rabble of an infamous democracy monsters of sacrilege cowards curst of god whom to slay is righteousness to whom to give quarter is deadly sin subverters of all order and decency the devil hang the lot said lady hamilton the queen rose quite refreshed and reinvigorated suddenly she was holding me with a piercing look craft and villainy peeped out of her little inflamed eyes i come to put a question to you madam she said there is a lady of our retinue the signora de fonseca pimentel your correspondence contains no proof of her disloyalty to us no madam or i should have informed m de medici i answered in a faint terror but rallied immediately i know only that she is in communication with the signor carafa since his escape ha the red eyes of the ferret closed a moment then reopened to an ineffable smile she held out her hand to me to kiss we find you an invaluable physician madame lavasse to have eased a poor queen it is something but to cure this land of its headache ah madam i said there i yield to the hangman both ladies burst out laughing as they moved away the queen turned and waved her hand you shall not be forgotten she cried and i curtsied a few days later m de medici called upon me he read out a little indictment he had prepared for my behoof eleonora de fonseca pimentel wife to pasquale tria de solis neapolitan officer noble now deceased emotional authoress of some panegyrical sonnets to royalty and the age of gold since suspect of schemes for the education of the populace shows a partiality for red advocates an appropriation of the punch and judy shows to the lessons of national virtue claims the liberty of the press to print her halting rhapsodies monstrous imputed sympathiser with ettore carafa son to the duke of andria the kings major domo and to the duchess her majestys mistress of the robes in said ettores late conspiracy to print and distribute an italian version of the rights of man which conspiracy resulted in the execution of some companion malignants and the escape from naples of said ettore finally convicted of corresponding with said fugitive to the end of his majestys overthrow and the subversion of his government not convicted m de medici that is all one most beautiful said the chief of police folding his paper madame lavasses word is as good as her bond within a week the pimentel was lodged in the prison of the vicaria that was in october and thenceforward things moved fast though scarce quick enough for me who was beginning to beat my wings against the gilded bars of my cage for what was all the national excitement to me but a means to my personal vengeance and i feared feared that while i lay aside for others use my prey would find a means to escape me on the nd of september i had heard the guns of the citadels down below in the bay welcoming nelsons arrival the sound shook every nerve in my restless heart so that i could hardly eat or sleep that night and i laughed myself into hysterics over my little maid martitas description of how madame lambassadrice dangleterre had flown up the side of the vanguard and cast herself upon the breast of her hero who was a very little man and quite unable to support so much emotion still thereafter as day by day drums beat and recruits were gathered and men hanged themselves to avoid serving and the english admiral was urging upon the poor fat wind blown king one of three alternatives to advance upon the french and conquer to die sword in hand or to remain and be kicked out while all naples was seething and roaring in a vortex about my garden the garden itself remained silent and empty an island in the midst of a whirlpool but at last his majesty did set out and reaching actually as far as rome while the republican general championnet was falling back for a spring blustered naughtily for a little killing a few jews threatening the wounded enemy in the hospitals committing to sack and pillage the very sacred city he had come to relieve and finally upon the approach of the concentrated french deserting his demoralised army and pelting back with all the might of his perspiring legs to where why to caserta it was evening of the th of december and a thunderstorm to terrify one to death in that desolate park had broken over the town all the imprisoned electricity of months past seemed to me as i stood fascinated at an upper window of the casino to have torn itself free and to be hunting in and out of the trees for fugitives from its fury far away and below the thousand eyes of the palace shut sickly to each blaze and blinked and were staring frightened again in the crash that followed the hand of an incensed god bent the proud necks of the trees and his wrath drove a roar of leaves and twigs criss cross about the alleys it was the anarchy beginning in the midst i saw two figures cloaked and dusk butt their way to the door below and a moment later martita summoned me to receive messengers from the palace i went down and found two officers pale and glaring awaiting me in the parlour the rain dripped from their unbonneted locks their hands were restless with their hats and sword hilts i curtsied in wonder and the elder with a shaky conciliatory smile addressed me you will pardon this intrusion madam the occasion is our excuse you have in your possession some charm some restorative by which her majesty the queen has already greatly benefited assuredly monsieur it is in my pocket now it is much needed at the moment you will vouchsafe us the loan you must forgive me monsieur its virtue is incommunicable save by the possessor that is so then will madam perhaps administer it in person to whom monsieur monsieur will consider the night alas madam but to assure that this night shall not be endless that the sun of our hopes be not extinguished for ever pray sir have mercy on me to whom do you allude to his majesty no less the king he has but now ridden been driven would be truer from albano for the moment everything seems lost ferdinand is at the last extreme of exhaustion and agitation madam will come to quiet him i will come monsieur ah dio merc questo benefizio una grande grazia we set out without delay my companions took each an arm of me laughing very gallant scorn of the lightning and my fright thereat between them however they bruised my poor shoulders horribly in their instinctive efforts to come together and clutch one another whenever the thunder slammed i was so dazed with the rain and uproar that i had little wit left me to note my surroundings as they hurried me blown and breathless up a flight of steps into a great hall blazing with lights thronged with confusion courtiers nobles mud stained soldiers weeping women frightened maids here they stood in gabbling gesticulating groups which were constantly detaching and discharging units into other groups the whole contributing to a sum of frenzy which swayed the candle flames and throughout threading the frantic maze went scared pages and lackeys all from captain to scullion looking for orders and receiving none there were a few whispers a few who observed and remarked upon me as my conductors forced me through the press crying a passage to the royal closet it is the beautiful english witch o quanti vezzi they are going to try to cure him like king david the opening and swinging to of a door as instant a muffling of the tumult the peace of a lofty anteroom padded with thick carpets a muttered challenge a muttered answer the passage of a further portal and i was in the royal presence now all my life i have had to battle with a fatal sense of humour i will simply undertake to relate the test to which it was here put the room shut away from all disturbance was brilliantly lighted in the midst at a gorgeous escritoire sat a secretary in black biting a pen hard by stood a staff officer in a glittering uniform but sopped and mud splashed who incessantly with a white nervous hand turned down and bit at his moustache making a motion with his lips as if he were talking to himself the two all the time followed with their eyes the movements of a third figure the only other in the room which went to and fro up and down in a sort of tripping dance gabbling an eternal accompaniment the while to its own chass and at odd moments ringing a little gilt bell which it carried in its hand this in itself to be sure was sufficiently remarkable but o my friend for the appearance of this eccentric who indeed was no other than the monarch himself cocked on the top of his large head was a little tie wig which for the last touch to disguise he had borrowed during his flight from the duke of ascoli after exchanging clothes with that peer who was a much smaller man the effect may be imagined his majestys breeches ends were half way up his thighs his waistcoat was a mere rope under his arm pits his coat tails stuck apart from the small of his back like ill fitting wing cases add to this that he was pinned all over with holy pictures and hung with reliquaries and medals like a mountebank at a fair and the picture is complete the lightning penetrated the ruddy blinds with no more than the silent flicker of a ghost but no glass could muffle the shattering reports of the thunder at every clap of which his majesty whinnied and crossed himself o lord spare thine anointed beloved saints be particular to point out to him where i am ring this you must know is not my usual cabinet but i will withdraw to my own if you desire it though it is in the hands of the decorators there o san gennaro protect me caution our master of the risk of striking among the chimneys lest the levin brand following a wrong course enter this room instead of another and destroy me in mistake for a lesser man ring dio non vglia o saints i believe i am struck no it is my breeches splitting but they are ascolis make no mistake lord i am not ascoli take the breeches but spare the king he shut his ears distracted to a louder boom and immediately was off again at a tangent o lady of loretto plead for thy servant crash mea maxima culpa i will confess if your majesty will condescend to keep it to yourself i am really a stupid man loud ring well meaning holy mother well meaning san gennaro but dull as kings go and surrounded by greater fools than myself i have been seventeen times a father ring at least loud ring and only once a husband groan fool though i be i have propagated my race for the glory of holy mother church and the confusion of the learned her enemies for the sake of my family madonna succour me he chattered so loud racing up and down all the time that i could hear his every word where i stood awaiting events by the door once in a lull of the storm he swooped round my way and suddenly becoming aware of me stopped as if petrified then rattled out in a thick gulping voice do you know who i am madam do you know who i am i curtsied profoundly sire i murmured such a little cloud to hide the sun of majesty he stared at me and down at himself i am the king he muttered is it not so the officer hurried to him and whispered in his ear eh he exclaimed my wifes physician you find me very distraught madam very overtasked i am so constituted i never could abide thunder and he was off again monsieur i whispered if we could get him prostrated on a sofa ah replied the officer for myself it would be madness but you you are beautiful you may dare i did not hesitate but stealing catlike to a couch took the opportunity of his majestys passing to seize him by his wing cases and with such effect that in a moment he was sprawling on his back on the cushions with his legs in the air then before he could protest or avoid me i had clapped the duck stone to his nostrils instantly the convulsion of his limbs relaxed and a great sigh heaved itself out of his depths his wig had tumbled off his brows were dark over goggle eyes he had a long aquiline nose falling to a slack jaw imagine all this revealing itself in an expression of the most perfect contentment and idiocy the soldier tiptoed across and looked down scared god in heaven madam he whispered what have you done to his majesty he is not himself pardon me monsieur i said never so much so he came round in about ten minutes and gazed at me in a sort of affectionate beatitude dio merc he murmured i dreamt i was in purgatory and awake to find myself in paradise another dose one more i shook my head enough is as good as a feast i will give thee a fortune for thy talisman its virtue lies in myself ah then the casket must be mine too he sat up suddenly all rumpled and bellowed out in a thick slurred voice away dolts and rapscallions what are you prying and listening the secretary hurried to the door and disappeared the officer lingered only to protest affairs of urgency sire pooh said the king i am attending to them i drew away pardon me sire i began when a clap of thunder rattled the glass his majesty ran at me whimpering you think to leave me no no madam i am but half recovered yet i must be watched or i shall die for yourself you are as safe as in a convent he drew himself up and endeavoured to thrust his hand into the breast of his waistcoat but not finding any caught at his braces instead though all else be lost to ferdinand honour remains xxviii i return to naples what a business i had with that father of babies himself the greatest baby of all he would not let me leave him but took my wits to physic his irresolution as my duck stone his nerves as the night sped darker and wilder bringing distracted generals and ministers who desperate to gather some clew out of chaos would not be denied he clung ever closer to my presence beside him goggling at me mutely when faced by a poser and laughing and applauding hysterically when i supplied an answer to it at last a cry rose in the palace that the french were got between rome and naples with only general mack at capua a little north of us to oppose them he is not to be trusted cried poor ferdinand wringing his hands he will sit down there and do nothing besides i am not at war with france he is not everything i answered ignoring the other fatuous pretence quick now and light a fire between a fire said he aghast to be sure said i the fire of a crusade call upon the whole population north of us to fly to arms and exterminate the impious invaders declare you are coming to their help and bid them strive their utmost in the meantime it may be in such a war of bigotry your peasants will do your chief work for you leaving you no task but to come presently and kill the wounded but cried the king disconsolately they must know too well already that i have run a that i have thought it best to retire date your manifesto from rome sire and it will give the lie to ahem the truth quick we will compose it together and within an hour you can have it flying north east and west he liked the idea that thought of being reserved to give the unhazardous coup de grce tickled him sensibly but though we acted upon it with all despatch it was helpless to still the rumour of coming disaster the report of the kings flight and of the armys demoralisation were too well confirmed hordes of robbers and cut throats rose it is true at the word swarms that committed woeful deeds of plunder and outrage and massacre making the smiling campagna a hell but these were without concentration or discipline and as ready when the lust had bitten in to torture italians as french and in the meanwhile courier after courier racing to the palace with distorted legends finished the last self control of the king and drove him near morning to order out his carriage for naples even then as he went thundering by the dark fields and long glimmerings of the dawn i was beside him he would not part with me with his councillor his dear little nurse but lavished upon me the wildest eulogies the most reckless promises while entreating me all the time to sit tight against him for his better sense of security in the event of his dosing and when he did dose and fell upon me good lord it was a nightmare like having a mattress for a quilt and with a voice if his nod had failed to shake olympus his snore might have uprooted it long before we reached the capital the signs of a coming anarchy were increasing about us most wild and threatening swarms of excited countryfolk strings of hard driven carts loaded with household furniture shedding a tithe of their contents to be crashed over or spun aside by other pursuing wheels haggard soldiers sobbing children cries threats vivas furious banter all went sweeping in one flurry of uproar and motion towards the gates sometimes when we were recognised it would be to a shout of jubilation ohi o me beato it is our king our father come to tell us the devils are singed and scattered sometimes it was to a vision of black menace that surged up and showed a moment at the windows and dropped behind in a wake of curses more often it was to evoke a scattering volley of laughter that broke into a regular sing song refrain venne vide e fugg venne vide e fugg he came he saw he fled way for csar way for csar who marches for rome hind first the frightened sweating postilions scourged their sweating cattle struggling to escape these gadflies who nevertheless only clung and stung and sung the thicker but at last we won through and were in the city and whipping for the royal palace through denser agitated crowds which still through a prescriptive respect offered no effective bar to our progress i will not say but that throughout this ordeal my blood did not come and go the quicker i will swear at the same time that i was always more exhilarated than terrified to be quit of my weary exile to find myself in the thick of events once more best to know that i had won to active co operation in my revenge the most powerful instrument of all these at least were a sufficient offset to the perils i must encounter in my race to realise them and it ended to our credit when all had been said and sung we reached in safety the palazzo reale where were being enacted in a more massed and vehement form the scenes of caserta the king holding to my hand drove a way for us with kicks and curses through the throng her majesty he yelled she was in her apartments to which he hurried me scattering maids of honour like fowls he shut the door upon her and me and himself alone my love he said she was in like pass with himself she was going up and down muttering entreaties to the saints her stays stuck full of prayers and pious ejaculations writ on scraps of paper every now and again she would pluck out one of these in a spasm dip it in a plate of broth that stood on a table and swallow it my soul murmured the king she noticed us all in a moment and stopped dead who are you she demanded witheringly angel of my heart dont you know your lord she advanced quickly and whipped him this way and that he was still in ascolis clothes is this all they have left of you you poor rag of royalty he tried a little bluster how now madam i adopted it for a disguise what she said by revealing yourself i should have thought that one exposure had been enough hush he said perspiring there is a witness one she cried the whole nation and she left him for me what do you do here she demanded the king put in a word i bring you your physician madam our physician if it had not been for her your ferdinando would have lost his mind better that than his kingdom she answered bitterly and stood scowling on me i understand madam i understand i called you circe and not it seems without excellent reason i was persuaded madam i said raising my head my honour is as precious to me as your majestys if you have no further use for me i beg your permission to withdraw at which if you will believe me this stormy queen ran to a chair and flinging herself down on it began to weep violently i am deserted of all she cried in the hour of my tribulation they all forsake and disown me the king skipped to her and fell on his knees before my soul he wept all is not yet lost general mack general post she snapped what do you know of your own city or of the anarchy that reigns in it it only needed this spark to the mine all is lost i tell you they are clamouring for a republic we shall be sacrificed like the king of france and my sister to the fury of the jacobins i feel the knife at my neck o o she rose in a frenzy of horror shuffling her billets like cards to find a trump gennaro valentino jeromio she whispered tearfully and ended by making a sippet of the hermit he was old and a misogynist it was evident for some moments that he disagreed with her nothing remains to us she said at last with a wry gulp but flight we have foreseen it for days for days while you have been playing with tin trumpets we have been transferring our royal effects to the ships pictures plate jewels the specie from the banks the last soldi from the treasury we have seen to everything i and my sweet darling emma my only truest and best of friends nelson but awaits our signal to take us on board you must give it him at once for this night do you hear i will send a message by ferreri said the king rising with a face as scared now as her own i will send ferreri at once and he skipped to leave the room stay she cried in agitation be sure to bind him to the last privacy o poor me said the king with a spasm of a smile must i then cheat my excise by smuggling my own orders through it is no time for fooling cried his angry spouse my god do you not understand whether our plan should be suspected by lazzari or jacobins the result would be the same to the one it would mean desertion to the other escape they would combine at least to frustrate it he stared nodded sagely and this time stole away on tiptoe so that the lazzari in the square should not hear him i suppose i was following when the queen stopped me her expression in the act had fallen a little piteous like that of a smiling saint sitting on spikes has circe then no ministrations for the anguished of her own sex she asked i hurried to her o madam i cried if i might serve you alone nevertheless the whole present prospect dismayed me whither was it their scheme to remove the court and for how long and in the meantime what government was to represent it i had immutably ranged myself against my former party burning my boats behind me what now if that party were to triumph as i had already seen it triumph wholly and tragically elsewhere the tables of vengeance would be a trifle turned i thought however i gained some reassurance on this point from de medici upon whom in the midst of a distracted rush and scurry i stumbled in the course of the afternoon hush he replied to my question whisper it not in gath you are indiscreet most beautiful listen if we go it will be but as a fowler withdraws from his nets that the foolish birds may fly more confident into the lure if we go an event which happened in the morning resolved that question for ever ferreri the poor courier was hardly sent on his message luckily a verbal one when the suspecting mob fell upon him dragged him all torn and bleeding to the palace square and there with savage cries a spy a jacobin spy despatched him with their knives before the very eyes of the king whom they had insisted should be witness to this proof of their loyalty the poor monarch tottered back aghast into our midst and from that moment the end was sure as the day waned the confusion in the palace waxed indescribable tendency no doubt there was in the seeming chaos i as a stranger could do no more than commit myself blindly to the stream resolved in one matter alone that i would not remain stranded and left behind all questions of precedence but in flight of etiquette of privacy even were blown to the winds we were become a mere commonwealth of terror great ladies issued puffing and lumbering from their apartments their arms loaded with goods and dresses which they tripped over like clowns as they ran nervous warriors got entangled in their swords and lay gasping on their backs like dying fish i never laughed so much or so hysterically in my life with all but the almighty family itself it was sauve qui peut and i was beginning to formulate my own desperate plans when de medici whispered quick in my ear follow me without seeming to it had been impossible in that frantic crowd had not my wits already noted his every trick and mannerism fortunate in being utterly unencumbered i pursued the shadow it led me by intricate ways out of the light into darkness out of the tumult into silence by a back passage through the arsenal and so down to the waterside where a little boat with dusk figures was waiting without ceremony we tumbled in and sat panting any more said a voice in my own good english tongue de medici answered in the negative give way men cried the officer sharply in an instant we were speeding for the bay the lights quivered and shrunk behind us the uproar attenuated and was drawn out to a murmur yard by yard there swelled up before our eyes vast ribbon girded bulks that rocked lazily on the tide tracing intricate patterns with their masts among the stars to one of these the greatest we galloped and came round with a surge and hollow lap of water under its quarter the next moment we were aboard the vanguard xxix i still know how to wait i sing palermo la felice the languorous the sunny the lotus island to all shipwrecked mariners o those five days in the gulf a hundred hours in which to think of nothing but ones crimes and ones mistake saving the sinfulness in not having been born a mermaid i declare i was not ill myself except in the illness of others but to hear the groaning of the ships ribs mimicked a hundredfold by the straining ribs of my companions was an eternal bone in my throat as a canary sings the louder the more we talk so as the ship talked the more fervent rose all round the chaunt of suffering o san gennaro grant it passage o santa maria i can give no more you have it all father of pity i am like a squeezed wineskin then perhaps from lady hamilton mistaking in her prostration the steward for the admiral o my dear lord though i cannot rise to thank you believe me that for all you have done my heart goes out to you to which the honest sailor would respond give it went mum and take the basin in truth it seemed the stars fought against us with the sea the vanguard itself was none too big a vessel she was what they call i believe a seventy four with two tiers of guns not a first rater i saw her commander sometimes in the glimpses of the moon he was not utterly impervious himself to the calls of the deep his right arm was gone and the sleeve pinned to his breast he had a gentle sober face blind of one eye and the scar of a late healed wound on his forehead casually met i should have taken him for a little mild professor who had once said bo to a goose and been well pecked for his pains we had weighed anchor on the nd and at once run into baffling winds the day before the king had received on board a deputation mixed of the marine the city and representatives of the lazzari who were all aghast to learn that his majesty projected a withdrawal to his sicilian capital he was very short with them when facts should reassure him of their loyalty he said he would return in the meantime he left general pignatelli a poor bemused creature as his regent to restore order he said nothing of his wholesale plunder of the public funds and was only in a perspiration to escape before it should be discovered then he went below having lighted and flung ashore the brand which was to set the city blazing and the following day we sailed for palermo in a vessel as full of royal livestock as if it had been a training ship for kings besides their majesties and as many of their progeny as they could recollect at the moment there were on board the ineffable hamiltons english acton their minister and the queens lover princes of the blood castelcicala and belmonte and a few others of condition amongst us all from the first there was little affectation of state and none of stateliness it was just a scurry and tumble an encumbering mass of royalty in the thick of which the unhappy crew were hard put to it to find quarters one of the poor children even died of sickness and the queen screamed lamentations over it whenever she could recall its name at length more dead than alive we were all pitchforked ashore out of a battered hulk and carried piecemeal through the city to the old fortified palace at its southernmost end where for the next seven months was to be enacted the royal intermezzo in the tragedy of naples those months passed livelily enough for me the king what time he could spare from his hunting and fishing and the building of a new country lodge was quite my devoted servant paying my gambling debts when it sometimes grew beyond my own power to liquidate them and assigning me the new post fruit of his own incomparable invention of stillroom maid to his royal person he was not really a bad hearted man and if he could only have accomplished his eternal wish to be left alone and not bothered while others were arranging his affairs for him would probably have resumed his neapolitan dominions without vindictive bloodshed when the way was once paved and swept level for him we heeded little i except in one main question myself the volcanic throes which were wrenching that doomed town across the water while we feasted and played while lazzaro and jacobin each dominant in his turn were flushing the kennels with blood while imperious nelson now promoted to his foudroyant was circling and swooping on and off issuing edicts arrogating to himself the lead in infatuated touch all the time with his substantial mistress while the french were planting the tree of liberty in the palace square and giving birth amidst song and jubilation to the new republic while following their withdrawal cardinal ruffo was descending with his brutish swarms upon the fated walls which he was destined to retake in the kings name the king himself was absorbed in ombre or lansquenet chuckling over charades playing practical jokes upon the most reverend spanish seors of the place guzzling and drinking and in every lazy way luxuriating in an utter self abandonment to pleasure and indeed in that wine soft climate there were many temptations to him as to us all we were like boccaccios company forgathered out of range of the plague and telling stories to pass the time the similarity of our condition in fact gave me an idea i set my wits to work and became a public raconteuse i invented and told in those days more tales than i can remember but a selection from which the curious may find included in my des royauts depouilles first published in paris in the series became so popular that poor mrs hart found her nose quite put out of joint in the matter of her own contributions to the fund of gaiety she might flop and pose like the most enormous of greek goddesses she might assail our ears with her voice for she had still the remains of a very handsome one or our hearts with her faculty for mimicry which being ill natured went deeper once my dbut was made she must be content to play second fiddle and that did not suit her at all the result was a coldness towards me which by inevitable process led to my disgrace with herself and her royal mistress and my dependence as much for my interests as my safety upon the favour of the king the court in fact became divided into the party of diana and the party of emma and was much more concerned over our rivalry than over the ultimate destinies of the kingdom it mattered little to me so long as i could keep the interest alive until the moment when my vengeance on a certain couple should be a fait accompli that once executed the two sicilies for all i cared might disappear under the sea o believe me that nicola pissani did an ill thing when he loosed an insulted mistress on his track it is not to be supposed that throughout those idle months i had once lost sight of my purpose or had failed to inform myself through de medici of the real progress of events and when at last the end came and ruffo with his bloody calabrians was master of the city and the republic had collapsed like a rotten hoarding i prepared my hands for their share of the price to be exacted and laughed to think how great a fool he had been who claimed to represent reason by yielding his soul to the passion of a foolish face now at this end naples had become a shambles shot and fire and sharp steel butchery and festering wounds and starvation had left of the patriot hosts but a little mean swarm that rotted out its remnant life in the prisons awaiting the holocaust pissani and all his high hopes were scattered the gods had no desire to be worshipped by reason missing their perquisites as this long legged hebe might well at the first have assured libertys apostles if they had not been at the pains to discard her she had been in paris had seen reason sit in the churches had heard the millennium proclaimed and olympus echo laughter and what had been the result not till the temples of superstition were razed in all the lands not till reason sat in the fields would the first glimmer of that golden dawn appear this she knew from the table talk whispers of the new race which had decreed the old titan nature a vulgarity and having overthrown it in the common hearts of men dreaded nothing but the destruction of the countless schools of sophistry on which its own lease of dominion depended and i who had preached who had been ardent again to preach their crusade against a detestable lie had been insulted by these wise reformers and been driven back to pour headstrong wine to the gods of rank desire and help them to hold the world a market to their passions o pissani had done well indeed and yet he was not among the captured one day near the finish de medici accosted me alone in the palace gardens it was mid june and the scent of roses was thick in the air i looked in his face and for all the warmth and fragrance my heart was winter he still baffles you monsieur most beautiful the man is a fox or perhaps already a ghost go on you have something else to say a stealthy smile creased his mouth keen as thou art fair know then that his wife is in our hands again go on i whispered i could hardly breathe we found her like a little torn rat in a sewer ragged half starved he gulped and looked up with a pallid grin have i not deserved it is the better half of the bargain vouchsafe me my reward in advance i paid no heed to his question asking him only where is she in the carmine and a hostage he shivered and hung his head i understand you madam he muttered but she is dumb to all our questions to all our threats i turned away with a laugh and you are a humane man monsieur and a susceptible well it is not for me to teach the inquisitor his trade understand i said facing round once more that i cannot rest or live or love while this remains unaccomplished he did not answer but standing irresolute a moment shrugged his shoulders and left me but i knew at last that the moment was near on the nd of that same month the penalties of rivalry were ended for lady hamilton by the arrival in the foudroyant of the lord admiral who came to transport his mistress to naples as her majestys deputy in the latest reign of terror inaugurated in that capital a fortnight later the king himself taking me with him as his simpler and nerve doctor and leaving the amiable english ambassador behind to play dry nurse to his queen in palermo followed in the sea horse which after a short fair passage anchored in the bay thence rather to my annoyance we were transhipped no farther than to the foudroyant his mightiness being timid for the moment of venturing into his distracted city and there were scarcely on board before my services were called into requisition in an odd enough connection the king nelson and his cara sposa being gone ashore was looking idly out seawards over the taffrail of the quarter deck and chattering desultorily with members of his suite behind him when he broke off abruptly to stare under his palm at some object in the water which first seen at a distance grew rapidly nearer drifting with the tide upon the ship then in an instant he gave a hoarse scream and seeing him pointing and articulating confusedly we all ran to the side and followed with our eyes the direction of his hand vtene he shrieked caracciolo and he shuddered down so that nothing but his nose and goggle eyes were peeping over the railing i held my breath staring fascinated while the others echoed his cry caracciolo caracciolo o me miserbile caracciolo in a dozen accents of terror i had heard of the poor scapegoat admiral whom nelson always bearing a grudge against him for his better seamanship had caused ten days before to be hanged with every refinement of savagery and afterwards flung into the water now risen it seemed from its first sleep on the floor of the bay the sopt and dreary spectre was come riding to sear the eyeballs of the master whom it had failed to serve only through being deeper pledged to humanity fouling our hawser the body swung upright bobbing and reeling as if it were treading water its hair and long beard swayed on its cheeks its dead stiff eyes stared unwinking in the spray its arms were flung wide as if inviting its destroyer to a mocking embrace turning a moment it drifted loose and went dancing towards the shore where the poor fishermen of santa lucia who had loved the man were to find and give it christian burial the king staggered back mother of saints he sobbed what does the creature want sire whispered a voice he asks for a consecrated grave give it him give it him gasped his majesty and signed to me to follow him below where however i was not long in laying his horrors enfin mon pre i said the man by his appearance was only asking your forgiveness magnificent he answered with a shaky laugh he was certainly in need of it and he turned to me gratefully but with a rather scared look little agent of providence if thou hast ever a poor friend thou wouldst save in the dark time coming ask of my majestys mercy and it will listen there may be some who err through the minds nobility of that i know nothing only only i would have something to balance my possible mistakes it was true enough though the blood lust was not long in mastering him when once without risk to himself he could taste the spice of vengeance even while he spoke the depleting of the gaols and prison ships was begun and the hurried trials and the false testimony and the hangings and the wail of the thousand doomed was already mingling itself in the streets with the roar of a grand state lottery when at last we could venture ashore and to safe quarters in the reconsecrated palace we were all triumphant then or about to be i remember the last night we spent on the foudroyant it was a full moon and seated under an awning on the upper deck lady hamilton sang rule britannia with a cockney fervour which must have pierced reassuringly to the ears of the poor wretches imprisoned behind the floating walls that surrounded us she was always so much more than equal to the occasion was emma xxx i am justified in my policy it was a dark and gusty night when i issued forth with de medici from a side door of the palace she is condemned he had whispered to me a minute earlier a needle of ice had seemed to enter my heart the question my lips could not ask had flown to my eyes comprehending it he had caught at his throat and lolled out his tongue grotesquely to the same dumb inquisitors he had answered as confidently as if i had spoken to morrow then i had found my voice as if after a fit of choking and she has not spoken and she has not spoken he had hesitated before suggesting deprecatingly there remains only to make your appeal to her in person i had struck my hands together hearing that you might have forced her had you chosen now leaving it to me our bargain is dissolved madonna you will not so requite my faithful services i will answer nothing till i have seen her then what time like now he had replied desperately when she sits buried alive in the darkness with the spectre of to morrow whispering in her ear it is well spoken then i will go the town was so full of reek and passion that most in the low quarters it was necessary for us to traverse i doubt if i could have survived without him but he was too well known and feared to leave my safety much in question then the lazzari and their allies of the conquering army were such sworn blood brothers that it needed never more than the smallest bone of dispute to set either tearing at the others throat whereby a flying petticoat circumnavigating both was able to avoid shipwreck between indeed we had committed more than one red scrimmage to our wake by the time we were arrived breathless but whole at the door of the carmine a roar and drift of torches surged upon us from a side alley at the moment that we reached our goal here was a wave of passion broken from the main wastes and bearing forward on its crest a single victim to its fury whom it seemed about to fling against the sullen walls of the prison he was a mere boy and his face as white as wax by the door stood a calabrese sentry armed with a musket and a great sabre and a rose in his hand the gift thorn and all of some amorous contadina as the boy was hurled up the steps smell to this poor lad said he art faint and he thrust the rose violently against the victims nostrils the poor wretch staggered back uttering a horrible scream his face bathed in blood there had been a long pin concealed among the petals which had stung him almost to the brain i am not sentimental but i shall hope some day to be to that calabrese in the relation of lazarus to dives the mob however roared laughter over the jest clapping their victim with a certain good humour on the back as we were all carried together in a confused struggle up the steps and into a vaulted stone hall beyond this stronghold massive and medival had only lately been the scene of the treacherous massacre of a patriot garrison and its stones were yet mapped and mottled with the story of the deed and since being made a state butchery without regard to accommodation or cleanliness from every carrion jacobin it seemed had emerged a living swarm predestined children of the grave who haunted the corridors with unclean cries and showed ghastly visions of wounds and suffering at the grates as we hurried by it was a catacomb in whose rotting lanes of stone walked a hundred vampires gloating over their huddled pens of victims typical of the worst was the gaoler who at de medicis summons had risen to attend us this was a creature like an obscene lank bird who hopped before us chuckling and pecking forward with his long nose as if as he went he sought the corners for offal at his waist jingled a bunch of keys and often he cracked after the italian habit a thong of leather with a lash which he carried in one hand his other being occupied in holding aloft a flaring taper he led us by a descending passage so narrow and so low that the flame of his torch made sooty blotches on the roof as he advanced into a murmuring drain at whose termination he at length paused before a door sunk in the wall gui a lei messer de medici he chuckled as groping for the lock he leered round at us wait till having opened i can block the passage there is another here besides our little bird another courage most excellent tis but half a man when alls said he was a state prisoner in the vicaria until the mob released him with the rest then he disappeared god knew whither but he was retaken with a few more in the prisoner pissanis company well then his day will come no doubt and in the meantime waiting orders we keep them caged together de medici grunted rubbing his chin i should have been told but hurry friend the man waved him back let me entreat messer in case of an attempt the chief withdrew a little open and come thou too said he madam would speak alone with the condemned the key grated in the lock the creature flung wide the door pissani cried he on a sharp note and that was all even as he retreated having uttered his cry she stood in the opening a dank and mortal odour came with her a reel of filthy darkness unbroken but by the dim splotch of a tiny grating which set in the wall opposite made an aureole behind her head as she stood god of mercy it was a spectre from which i shrunk in instinctive loathing had it ever been one with beauty and with me its very tattered gown seemed fallen into harsh lean folds love must have trodden not sat in those hollow eyes so to discolour and bury them it was a just retribution the more providential in that so squalid a vision sickened my heart from sympathy yet to break this withered reed it seemed a despicable task for my strong hands they must withhold a little caress a little first with whatever reluctance to themselves nevertheless i could not but be conscious how forced and artificial rung the tenderness i sought to convey into my voice patty patty grant i have come to offer you life and liberty the tiny smile that broke then from her lips was my first earnest of her reality the sigh she gave was such as a dead sleeper might yield to the dawn of judgment yet she did not move or come to me or show one sign of the collapse i had expected and calculated on and as the light of the flaring taper fell upon her figure a new hate and loathing surged in me so that the persuasiveness with which i sought to dress my tones shivered into a mockery of itself did you not expect me did you not know that i hold your life in my hands else why should you have left me to come to this diana i shrunk back what new knowledge of herself or me was implied in the chords of that wasted voice yet she smiled still like one waking out of a frightful dream is it not strange diana this end to all we have known and experienced together do you remember the sundial and the old green garden and the nuns in the sleepy village we are englishwomen after all diana i should like to rest in england it lies with yourself i answered half choking you have but to speak i tell you it needs but a word from you and all this false sacrifice is passed by and forgotten her eyes had been fixed on some vision beyond me now in a moment they were scorching my soul yes she said and the word the shame of its utterance should be mine she meant if i had shrunk from the challenge it would have been to discredit my claim to the greater wrong where your husband lies hidden i said with a cold fury at my heart god forgive you she answered only and fell back her assumption of the holier strength of the worser grievance stung me to madness i leapt and clutched her by the wrist fool i shrieked do you know what you are bringing on yourself do you know how they will kill you it is not as in paris a shock and a sob and forgetfulness they will push you from a ladder and one will spring and swing himself by your feet and another leap upon your shoulders and squat there like a hideous toad making sport for the crowd and you will be minutes choking and dying and not one to pity or relieve you her eyes had a smile of agony in them but still it was a smile and i could have torn myself in my impotence to change it ah yes one she said my little unborn baby i sprang back wretch your obstinacy murders it it gives its life for its father without sound or warning she sank at my feet and lay motionless her white face turned upward a harsh jest was uttered at my shoulder bravo it is so they always think to sport with our feelings but we have an infallible medicine and the gaoler coming from behind me cut across the senseless face with his whip with a roar a figure bounded out of the darkness of the cell and whirling long arms about the beast fell with and upon him and battered out his brains upon the stone floor it all passed in a moment and in that moment i knew my lost monster again gaunt and foul and tattered yet even in his wasted strength a god and glorious then against a coming tumult and scurry of feet i flung my body back i shrieked the king gives me a life i claim his do you hear if by a hair it is injured the bitter worse for you all sobbing burning in a flurry of passion i threw myself an hour later in the palace at the kings knees sire i cried i claim your royal promise i ask mercy for a friend taken off his guard bewitched perhaps it is granted he said then he recovered himself and laughed and patted my shoulder enfin he said what has he done he has killed a gaoler who was ill treating a prisoner he startled frowned then laughed again but less easily o well he said a gaoler is no great matter but i must know his name first sire it is my own servant gogo that you have robbed me of this long time o him he said relieved well perhaps after all we owe him a gaoler or two xxxi i know my own heart i had hardly got into the street before a hand touched my arm i turned and saw gogo it was you he said won my deliverance this morning yes from the king from the king he said not a word more i questioned him in my turn i sent you a message by the courier why did you not come direct to me i had business first i answered if you will tell her that i will witness for her and bring my report this evening she will understand i understood nothing but that you were in no hurry to thank me he made no reply it is only after a struggle with my pride sir i continued that i am here to keep your appointment i think perhaps your business might have kept better do you well perhaps after all you have a shallow wit i looked at him in dumb amaze we were loitering on to me aimlessly though i knew presently how all the time he had been rigidly enforcing our direction the city was in its hottest night fever of excitement over the executions that had taken place that day in a mood already too monstrous to take much heed of the shock and tattered prodigy that stumped by my side once passing a group i caught a name and startled and was hurrying on but he snatched my wrist and forced me to linger absorbing horror to the dregs i knew his temper by that and to what i had delivered myself but i never feared him so much as when he would not speak gogo i whispered suddenly you will give me credit for having known nothing of your state all this time whenever i asked m de medici he assured me of your comfort and prosperity i am not to blame if he is a cursed liar he did not answer the moment i could i said trembling i begged your life it is the dearest of all i know to me are you going to punish me for that still no answer o i said with a little rally to anger if you will not thank me at least you might say whether or not you received my enclosure this morning the money he muttered yes i received it i was moved to a little agitated laughter is everything poisonous that comes from my hands if you had spent a little of it on food and clothes my obligation to you would not have been the less i thought you sent it to me to pay your debts what debts again that grim silence i feared him more than i can tell feared him so much that no thought of the conquering guile by which i had once been wont to sway him occurred to me to use i shivered and drew my cloak faster about me and hurried by his side without another word whither was he bent by the roaring quays it seemed towards the dark prison from which only a few hours earlier she had gone to her self elected doom not there i sobbed struggling not there what good can it do now but he turned short of reaching it to his left into a street leading to the great square adjoining where the gallows was erected and here under the shadow of the fortress stood a church with a lofty tower stopping at a door which opened into the base of this last he tapped three times and in a moment it yawned and engulfed us and the tumult of the living town was become in our ears like the murmur of the sea in a dead cavern our guide taper in hand went on before us the sound of our footsteps reeled and laughed behind echoing up to unknown altitudes ward of that little star of radiance i had no terror so great as that of its flashing away and committing me to the shadows that seemed always dancing and clutching for me outside its circumference and then suddenly we were come to a narrow iron gate set in the stone and to the cowled motionless figure of a monk who stood thereby without a word uttered by this spectre the folds of its robe contracted and a long white hand was thrust forth palm upwards gogo put a purse into it bear witness diana he said in a low voice that boomed and clanged among the stones that i deliver the account of my stewardship to the last penny i was sobbing dreadfully moved by some terror that had in it nevertheless no thought of evil intended by him to myself you will take nothing from me i gasped he addressed the monk it is enough the cowled head bent then let us through father and alone the grate clanked he gripped my arm and seizing the taper from the sacristan led me down a long flight of steps through a low doorway into a crypt and there on the damp ground full in our view was something lying and a sheet over no no i screamed you have tortured me enough already never releasing my arm he set the taper in a crevice and dragged me to the dreadful bed what he said are you afraid to look on your work and pinning me forcibly he bent and drew the cloth away and side by side with the other i saw the dead face of pissani without a word i sank down where i stood and he fell back from me o woman he cried in a terrible voice that you could talk of your pride with this lying at your heart he clasped his hands and unclasped them and struck his forehead and again writhed them together as if his grief baffled him from speech dragging my body towards him i huddled cowering at his feet what he cried no word no word i moaned and moved my head in negative grant he stabbed himself under the gallows he said since he found he could not look on her agony and live are you the more guiltless of his death again i shook my head at least they are together he cried by so much you did them service sending her first but the price woman the price i rose blind staggering to my feet it was my honour i will go and pay it and die he caught at and held me to whom to de medici let me go only you could have saved me and you will not and it is right never quitting his hold he turned from me with a wild gesture of his free arm it was her life or yours i said make it my curse if you will that i chose the dearer to me with a mad groan he snatched me from my feet and holding me fiercely against his breast carried me out and to the foot of the steps the end notes diana please born circa scapegoat admiral the unhappy patriot caracciolo whose hurried execution at the yardarm
