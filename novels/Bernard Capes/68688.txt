childish knucklesand i went to see who it was a queer little figure stood outside in the twilighta dainty compendium of skirt and cape and frothy white frillsand a small elfish face looked up into mine through shimmering of hair like love in a mist if you please she said zyps dead and will you take care of poor zyps child then at that moment the hard agony of my life broke its walls in a blessed convulsion of weeping and i caught the little wanderer to my heart and carried her within doors and so poor zyp is dead said i yes answered the elfin and please will you give me back to her some day before gods throne i whispered i will deliver up my trust and that in such wise that from his mercy some little of the light of love may perhaps shine upon me also that night i put my signature to the last page of the narrative here unfolded chapter i the inmates of the mill my story begins like a fairy tale once upon a time there was a miller who had three sons here however the resemblance ceases at this late date i the last stricken inmate of the mill of silence set it down for a warning and a menace not entirely in despair perhaps but with a fitful flickering of hope that at the last moment my soul may be rent from me into a light it has never yet foreseen we were three brothers sons of a gray old man whose father and his father before him had owned and run a flour mill in the ancient city of winton in hampshire this mill stood a little back from the north side of the east and more deserted end of the high street and faced a little bridgewooden in those days but stone nowthrough which raced the first of the mill fall that came thundering out from under the old timber building as though it had burst at a push some ancient dam and were hurrying off to make up for lost ages of restraint the house a broad single redtiled gable as seen from the bridge stood crushed in between other buildings and in all my memory of it was a crazy affair in appearance and ever in two minds about slipping into the boisterous water below and so flushing all that quarter of the town with an overflow as it were of its own ancient dropsy it was built right across the stream with the mill wheel buried in its heart and i can recall a certain childish speculation as to the results which would follow a possible relaxing of the house pressure on either side in which case i hopefully assumed the wheel would slip out of its socket and carrying the frail bridge before it roll cheerfully down stream on its own axle to the huge delight of all adventurous spirits our reputation in winton was not i am sorry to say good there was a whispered legend of uncanniness about the mill itself which might mean little or nothing and a notoriety with regard to its inmates which did mean a good deal the truth is not to mince matters that my father was a terrible drunkard and that his three sonsnot the eldest of whom retained more than a shadowy remembrance of a longdeparted mothers influencewere from early years fostered in an atmosphere that reeked with that one form of moral depravity a quite youthful recollection of mine is the sight of my father thin bent gray bearded and with a fierce not uncomely face jerking himself to sudden stoppages at points in the high street to apostrophize with menacing fury the devils born of his disease to the world about us my father was nothing but a worthless inebriate who had early abandoned himself to profligate courses content to live upon the little fortune left him by his predecessors and to leave his children to run to seed as they listed in the stagnant atmosphere of vice what the world did not know was the secret side of my fathers characterthe wild fierce imagination of the man the creative spirit of his healthier moods and the passionate reverence of beauty which was as habitual to him as the craze for strong waters he exercised a despotic influence over us and we subscribed admiringly to his rule with the snarling submissiveness of young tiger cubs i think the fragmentary divinity that nests in odd neglected corners of each and every frame of life took some recognition of a higher type from which it had inherited mentally at his best my father was as much above us as by some cantrip of fate he was superior to the sullen plodding stock of which he was born three days out of the week he was drunk visionhaunted almost unapproachable and this had been so from time that was immemorial to us the period of compulsory education had not yet agitated the community at large and our intellects he permitted to run to grass with our bodies on our pursuits pastoral urban and always mischievous if occasion offered he put no restraint whatever yet encouraged a sort of halfsavage clannishness among us that held the mill for fortress and the world for besiegers perhaps it was not until i was rising that any speculation as to the raison dtre of our manner of life began to stir in my brain my eldest brother jason was then a tall handsome fellow of with a crisp devil in his corncolored hair and a silent one in his eyes that were shot with changing blue modred the youngest some eighteen months my junior was a contrast to jason in every way he was a heavy pasty boy with an aggravating droop in his lids and a large unspeculative face he was entirely selfcontained armored against satire and unmoved of the spirit of tears a sounding smack on the cheek delivered in the onesided heat of argument brought his face like a stolid phantasm projected toward the strikers in a wooden impassivity that was infinitely more maddening than abuse it showed no more resentment than a battered aunt sallys but rather assumed a mockery of curiosity as to the bullying methods of the strong against the weak speaking of him i have no object but to present a portrait unprejudiced alike of regard or disfavor this i entreat may be borne in mind one afternoon in late april weather jason and i were loitering and idling about some meadows within rifle shot of the old city outskirts we lay upon our faces in the long grass beside a clear shallow burn intent upon sport less lawful than exciting the country about winton is laced with innumerable streams and freshets and therein without exception are trout in great quantity though mostly shy to come at from the little depth and extreme transparency of the water that the fishing is everywhere preserved goes without saying and it follows in order that poaching is pretty general we were poaching in truth and extremely enjoying it as usual jason held in his hand a willow wand fitted with a line which was baited with a brandling fat from the manure heap this it was essential to swing gently ourselves crouching hidden as far as possible into the liveliest streaks of the current where it ran cleanly over pebbles and to let it swim naturally downstream the length of the rods tether occasionally if not so often as one could wish the plump bait would lure some youngling imperfect in guile from security of the stones and a sudden jerking of the tough willow would communicate a galvanic thrill of excitement to our every fiber the experience did not stale by a toofrequent repetition and was scarcely marred in our eyes by the everpresent necessity of keeping a vigilant lookout for baleful intruders on our privacy our worst foe in this respect was a great bosom of chalk and turf known as st catherines hill which rose directly in front of us some short distance on the further side of the stream and from which it was easy for any casual enemy to detect our every movement however as fortune would have it the hill was but comparatively little favored of the townsfolk ware said i suddenly jason drew his line swiftly and horizontally from the water and dropped it and the rod deftly under the fringe of the bank we turned on our backs lazily blinking at the sky a figure was sauntering along by the side of the little river toward us it was that of an illdressed man of or so balljointed and cadaverous with a wet wandering blue eye and light brickcolored hair brushed back into rattails his mouth was one pencil mark twitched up at the corners and his ears large and shapeless stood up prominently like a bats he carried his hands behind his back and rolled his head from side to side as he walked he espied us a long way off and stopped presently looking down upon us sinews of whipcord he said in a voice thin as his lips and hearts of cats what tomfoolery now my brother raised his head yawning lazily tom fool hisself said he i am not said the newcomer near such a fool as i look i can tell the likeliest place for tickling trouts now anywhere jason grunted and thats the itchen went on the other with an enjoying chuckle we vouchsafed him a patronizing laughter too good he said too good for lob worms and sandhoppers wheres the best place to find trouts nowthe little speckled trouts where said i caught he cried and pounced upon jason there was a short bitter struggle between them and the man leaving the boy sitting panting on the grass leaped apart with a speckled trophy held aloft in his hand give it back cried my brother rising white and furious or ill brain you he seized up a great lump of chalk as he spoke and balanced it in his hand softly said the other very coolly slipping the trout into the wide pocket of his coat jason watched him with glittering eyes give it back to him dr crackenthorpe i cried or hell do you a hurt in one moment the doctor dropped on his knees at the instant that the missile spun over him and splashed among the marigolds far in the meadow beyond in the next jason was down on his back again with the tall mans knuckles at his throat and his bony knee planted on his chest puppy of satan he hissed in grim fury dye dare to pursue me with murderous hate tooth and nail i fell upon the victor like a wild cat and tore at him his strength was marvelous holding my brother down with his left hand he swung his right behind his back clutched me over and rolled us both together in a struggling heap now said he jumping to his feet and daring us move a muscle to rise and ill hold your mouths under water for the frogs to dive in it was the only sort of argument that appealed to usthe argument of resourceful strength that could strike and baffle at once when he had recovered his breath sufficiently to laugh jason tittered from the first the fateful charm of my brother was the pleasant music of his voice and the pliant adaptability of his moods keep the fish doctor he said we give in he always answered for both of us well said dr crackenthorpe thats wise he stepped back as he spoke to signify that we might get on our feet which we did i keep the trout he said grandly in evidence and shall cast over in my mind the pros and cons of my duty to the authorities in the matter at this despite our discomfiture we laughed like young hyenas the trout we knew was destined for the doctors own table he was a notorious skinflint to whom sixpence saved from the cooking pot was a coin redoubled of its face value he made as if to continue his way but paused again and shot a question at jason dad had any more finds no said jason and if he had you wouldnt get em dr crackenthorpe looked at the boy a minute shrugged his shoulders and moved off and here at this point his question calls for some explanation one day some twelve months or so earlier than the incident just described we of the mill being all collected together for dinner and my father just coming out of one of his drunken fits a coin tinkled on the floor and rolled into the empty fireplace where it lay shining yellow my father who had somehow jerked it out of his pocket from the trembling of his hand walked unsteadily across the room and stood looking down upon it vacantly there he remained for a minute or two we watching him and from time to time shot a stealthy glance round at one or other of us twice or thrice he made as if to pick it up but his heart apparently failed him for he desisted suddenly however he had it in his hand and stood fingering it still watchful of us well he said at last there it is for all the world to see and placed it on the mantelpiece then he turned round to us expectant that coin he said slowly was given me by a man who dug it up in his garden hereabouts when he was forking potatoes its ancient and a curiosity there it remains for ornament now whether this was only some caprice of the moment or that he dreaded that had he then and there pouched it some boyish spirit of curiosity might tempt one or other of us to turn out his pockets in search of the treasure when he was in one of his liquorish trances and so make further discoveries we could never know anyhow on the mantelpiece the coin lay for some weeks a contemptible little disk to view with an odd figure of an illformed mannikin stamped on one side of it and no one of us offered to touch it until one day dr crackenthorpe paid us a visit this worthy had only recently come to winton tempted hither i think more by lure of antiquities than by any set determination to establish a practice in the town indeed in the result as i have heard his fees for any given year would never have quarter filled a wineglass unless paid in pence he had a small private income and two weaknessesone a craze for coin collecting the other a feverish palate which brought him acquainted with my father in this wisethat he encountered the old man one night when the latter was complacently swerving into the itchen at a point known as the weirs where the water is deep and conducted him graciously home the next day he called and it becoming apparent that fees were not his object a rough queer acquaintance was struck up between the two men which brought the doctor occasionally to our mill at night for a pipe and a glass he was the only outsider ever admitted to our slightest intimacy with the single exception of a baneful old woman known as peg rottengoose who came in every day to do the cooking and housework and to steal what scraps she could now on one of these visits the doctors eye was casually caught by the glint of the coin on the mantelpiece he clawed it at once and as he examined it the mans long gaunt face lighted from inward with enthusiasm where did you get this he cried his hands shaking with excitement a neighbor dug it up in his garden and gave it me let it be cant you said my father roughly pooh man such things are not given without reason what was the reason staytell me the name of the man i thought my father paled a little and shifted uneasily in his chair i tell you he said hoarsely he gave it me and i dont believe it cried the other you found it yourself and where this came from more may be my father sprung to his feet get out of my house he shouted and take your may bes to the foul fiend dr crackenthorpe placed his pipe and the coin very gently on the table and walked stiffly to the door he had almost reached it when my fathers voice quite changed and soft stopped him dont take offense man come and talk it over dr crackenthorpe retraced his steps resumed his chair and sat staring stonily at my father its true said the latter dropping his eyes every word its true sir i tell you the doctor never spoke and my father stole an anxious glance up at him well he said with an effort anyhow its a small matter to separate cronies i dont know the value of these gimcracks but as you take pleasure in collecting em illillcome now ill make you a present of it the doctor became human once more and for a second time clutched the coin radiantly my father heaved a profound sigh but he never moved well he said now youve got it perhaps youll state the particular value of that old piece of metal its a gold doric cried the doctor as rare a he checked himself suddenly and went on with a ludicrous affectation of indifferencerare enough just to make it interesting no intrinsic valuenone whatever a little wicked smile twitched up my fathers bearded cheeks each man sat forward for some minutes pulling at his pipe but it was evident the effort of social commonplace was too much for dr crackenthorpe presently he rose and said he must be going he was obviously on thorns until he could secure his treasure in a safe place for a quarter of an hour after the door had closed behind him my father sat on gloomily smoking and muttering to himself then suddenly he woke to consciousness of our presence and ordered us savagely almost madly off to bed this explains the doctors question of jason and is a necessary digression now to the meadows once more and a little experience that befell there after the intruders departure chapter ii a nixie my brother tired of his fishing for the nonce and for an hour we lay on our backs in the grass chatting desultorily jason said i suddenly what do we live on what we can get said my brother sleepily but i meanwhere does it come from who provides it oh dont bother renny we have enough to eat and drink and do as we like what more do you want i dont know i want to know thats all i cant tell why where does the money come from tom tiddler he was our grandfather dont be a fool dad never worked the mill that we remember but tom tiddler did before him not to the tune that would keep four loafers in idleness for sixteen years well i dont care perhaps dads a highwayman i kicked at the grass impatiently it must end some day you know jason tilted his cap from his eyes and blinked at me what dye mean piggy suppose dad died or went mad wed sell the mill and have a rare time of it oh you great clown sell it for what driftwood and how long would the rare time last youre mighty particular today i hate answering questions let me alone i wont i said viciously i want your opinion well its that youre a precious fool what for to bother your head with what you cant answer when the suns shining i cant help bothering my head i said ive been bothering it i think ever since dad gave old crackenthorpe that medal last year jason sat up so you noticed it too he said renny theres depths in the old man that we shant plumb well ive taken to thinking of things a bit said i jasonso named at any period i never saw a register of the christening of any one of us because of his golden fleece shook it and set to whistling softly his namemodreds toomine was renalt and more localwere evidence of my fathers superior culture as compared with most of his class they were odd if you like but having a little knowledge and fancifulness to back them gave proof of a certain sum of desultory reading on his part the spirit of which was transmitted to his children i was throwing myself back with a dissatisfied grunt when of a sudden a shrill screech came toward us from a point apparently on the river path fifty yards lower down we jumped to our feet and raced headlong in the direction of the sound nothing was to be seen it was not until the cry was repeated almost from under our very feet that we realized the reason of it all about winton the banks of the main streams are pierced at intervals to admit runlets of clear water into the meadows below such a boring there was of a goodish caliber at the point where we stopped and here the water breaking through in a little fall tumbled into a stone basin some three feet square and five deep that was sunk to its rim in a rough trench of the meadow soil into this brimming trough a young girl had slipped and would drown in time for though she clung on to the edge with frantic hands her efforts to escape had evidently exhausted her to such an extent that she could now do no more than look up to us as we stood on the bank above with wild beseeching eyes i was going to jump to her help when jason stayed me with his hand hist renny he whispered ive never seen a body drown nor shall said i hoping he jested let me shove her hands off he said in the same wondering tone one moment with a shock i saw the horrible meaning in his face the next with a quick movement i had flung him down and jumped he rose at once with a slight cut on his lips but before he could recover himself i had the girl out by the hands and had stretched her limp and prostrate on the grass then i paused embarrassed and he stood above looking down upon us youll have to pay for that renny he said sooner or laterand of course i knew i should turn the creature on her face you dolt he continued and let the water run out of her pipes i endeavored to comply but the girl always keeping her eyes shut resisted feebly i dropped upon my knees and smoothed away the sodden tresses from her face thus revealed it seemed an oddly pretty one the skin half transparent like rice paper the forehead rounding from the nose like a kittens but she never opened her eyes so that i could not see what was their color though the lashes were black presently a horror seized me that she was dead and i shook her pretty roughly by the shoulder oh she cried with a whimper dont i was so rejoiced at this evidence of life that i gave a whoop then i bent over her its all right girl i said youre safe i saved you her lips were moving again and i stopped to listen what did he want to drown me for she whispered she was thinking of my brother not of me for a flash her eyes opened violet like lightning and glanced up at him standing above then they closed again come i said roughly if you can talk you can get up the girl struggled into a sitting posture and then rose to her feet she was tall almost as tall as i was and about my age i should think her dress so far as one could judge it being sopped with water was a poor patched affair and rough country shoes were on her feet take me somewhere where i can dry she said imperiously dont let him comehe neednt follow hes my brother i said i dont care he wanted to drown me he didnt know i cant die by water cant you i said of course not im a changeling she said it with a childish seriousness that confounded me what made you one i asked the fairies she said and thats why im here i was too bewildered to pursue the subject further how did you fall in there i asked i saw some little fish like klinkents of rainbow and wanted to catch them then i slipped and soused well i said where are you going now with you she answered i offered no resistance i gave no thought to results or to what my father would say when this grotesque young figure should break into his presence mechanically i started for home and she walked by my side chatting jason strode in our rear whistling what a brute he must be she said once jerking her head backward leave him alone i said or we shall quarrel whats a girl like you to him i think she hardly heard me for the whistle had dropped to a very mellow note to my surprise i noticed that she was crying i thought changelings couldnt cry i said i tell you water does not affect me she answered sharply what a mean spy you arefor a boy i was very angry at that and strode on with black looks whereupon she edged up to me and said softly dont be sore with me dont i shrugged my shoulders lets kiss and be friends she whispered for the first time in my life i blushed furiously you beast i said to think that men would kiss she gave me a sounding smack on the shoulder and i turned on her furiously oh yes she cried hit out at me do its like you i wont touch you i said but i wont have anything more to do with you and i strode on fuming she followed after me and presently i heard her crying again at this my anger evaporated and i turned round once more come on i said if you want to and keep a civil tongue in your head presently we were walking together again whats your home renny she asked by and by a mill i answered but nothing is ground there now she stopped and so did i and she looked at me curiously with her red lips parted so that her teeth twinkled whats the matter said i nothing she said only i remember an old old saying that the woman told me what woman i asked in wonder but she took no notice of my question only repeated some queer doggerel that ran somewhat as follows where the mill race is come and go faces once deeds of violence now dust and silence thither thy destiny answer what speaks to thee chapter iii the mill and the changeling the outer appearance of the old mill in which we lived and grew up i have touched upon and now i take up my pen to paint in black and white the old moldering interior of the shell the building stood upon a triple arch of red brick that spanned the stream and extended from shore to shore where on each side a house of later date stood cheek to jowl with it it looked but an indifferent affair as viewed from the little bridge aforesaid which was dedicated to st swithun of watery memory but in reality extended further backward than one might have suspected moreover to the east side a longish wing with a ridged roof of tiles ran off at right angles and added considerably to the general dimensions to the west stood a covered yard where once the mill wagons were packed or unloaded but this in all my memory of it yawned only a dusty spave given over to the echoes and a couple of ancient cart wheels whose rusty tires and wormpierced hubs were mute evidence of an inglorious decay these were for all to seebut behind the walls was the old mill uncanny from the first or is it only the ghosts with which our generation of passions has peopled it that have made it so this i can say that i never remember a time when jason or i or even zyp dared to be in the room of silence aloneand in company never for more than a few minutes modred had not the same awe of it but modreds imagination was a swaddled infant for my father i will not speak maybe he was too accustomed to specters to dread them this room was one on the floor above the water and the fact that it harbored the mill wheel whose booming when in motion shook the stagnant air with discordant sounds may have served as some explanation of its eeriness it stood against the east wing and away from the yard and was a dismal dull place like a loft with black beams above going off into darkness its only light came from a square little window in front that was bleared with dust and stopped outside with a lacework of wire against its western wall was reared a huge box or cage of wood which was made to contain the upper half of the wheel with its ratchet and shaft that went up to the great stones on the floor above for the mill race thundered below and when the great paddles were revolving the water slapped and rent at the woodwork now it behooves me to mention a strange fancy of my fatherswhich was this that though no grain or husk in our day ever crumbled between the stones the wheel was forever kept in motion as if our fortunes lay in grinding against impalpable time the custom was in itself ghostly and its regularity was interrupted only at odd moments and those generally in the night when lying abed upstairs we boys would become conscious of a temporary cessation of the humming vibrating noise that was so habitual to the place to this fancy was added a strange solicitude on the part of my father for the wellbeing of the wheel itself he would disappear into the room of silence twice or thrice a day to oil and examine it and if rarely any tinkering was called for we knew it by the sound of the closing of the sluice and of the water rush swerving round by another channel now for the time i have said enough and with a sigh return to that may afternoon and little zyp the changeling she followed me into the mill so quietly that i hardly heard her step behind me when i looked back her eyes were full of a strange speculation and her hands crossed on her breast as if she prayed she motioned me forward and i obeyed marveling at my own submission i had no slightest idea what i was to say to my father or what propose we found him seated by the table in the living room upstairs a bottle and glass before him the weekly demon was beginning to work but had not yet obtained the mastery he stared at us as we entered but said nothing then to my wonder zyp walked straight up to the old man pulled his arms down sat upon his knee and kissed his rutted cheek i gave a gasp that was echoed by jason who had followed and was leaning against the lintel of the open door still my father said nothing and i trembled at the ominous silence at last in desperation i stammered and all the time zyp was caressing the passive face dad the girl fell into the water and i pulled her out and here she is then at length my father said in a harsh deep voice you pulled her out what was jason there doing waiting for her to drown my brother answered for himself defiantly forestalling conviction my father put the girl from him strode furiously across the room seized jason by one arm and gave him several cruel heavy blows across his shoulders and the back of his head the boy was half stunned but uttered no cry and at every stroke zyp laughed and clapped her hands then flinging his victim to the floor from which he immediately rose again and resumed his former posture by the door pale but unsubdued my father returned to his seat and held the girl at arms length before him who are you he said she answered a changeling in a voice soft as flowers whats your name zyp your other name never mind zyps enough is it where do you come from what brings you here renny brought me here because i love him love him have you ever met before no but he pulled me out of the water comethis wont do i must know more about you she laughed and put out her hand coaxingly shall i tell you a little perhaps i am from a big forest out west there where wheels drone like hornets among the trees and black men rise out of the ground i have no father or mother for i come of the fairies those who stood for them married late and had a baby and they delayed to christen it one day the baby was gone and i was there they knew me for a changeling from the first and didnt love me but i lived with them for all that and they got to hate me more and more not a cow died or a gammer was wryed wi the rheumatics but i had done it bit by bit the old man lost all his trade and loved me none the more i can tell you he was a beast leech and where was the use of the forest folk sending for him to mend their sick kine when he kept a changeling to undo it all at last they could stand no more of it and the woman brought me away and lost me lost you echoed my father oh said zyp with a little cluck i knew all along how the tramp was to end there was an old one a woman lived in the forest and she told me a deal of things she knew me better than them all and i loved her because she was evil so they said she told me some rhymes and plenty of other things well said my father we walked east by the sun for days and days then we came to the top of a big soft hill where little beetles were hopping among the grass and below us was a great town like stones in a green old quarry and the woman said run down and ask the name of it while i rest here and i ran with the wind in my face and was joyful for i knew that she would escape when i was gone and i should never see her again and then you tumbled into the water said my father zyp nodded and now she said i belong to nobody and will you have me my father shook his head and in a moment sobs most piteous were shaking the girls throat so forlorn and pretty a sight i have never seen before or since well he said if nobody comes to claim you you may stop and stop zyp did surely was never an odder coming yet from that day she was one of us what was truthful and what imaginative in her story i have never known for from first to last this was the most we heard of it one thing was certain zyp was by nature a child of the open air and the sun flowers that were wild she lovednot those that were cultivated however beautiful of which she was indifferentand she had an unspeakable imagination in reading their fanciful histories and a strange faculty for fondling them as it were into sentient beings i can hardly claim belief when i say that i have seen a rough nettle fade when she scolded it for stinging her finger or a little yellow rock rose turn from the sun to her when she talked to it zyp never plucked a flower or allowed us to do so if she could prevent it i well remember the first walk i took with her after her establishment in the mill when i was attracted by a rare little blossom the water chickweed which sprouted from a grassy trench and pulled it for her behoof she beat me savagely with her soft hands then fell to kissing and weeping over the torn little weed which actually appeared to revive a moment under her caresses i had to promise with humility never to gather another wild flower so long as i lived and i have been faithful to my trust the afternoon of her coming old peg rigged her up some description of sleeping accommodation in a little room in the attic and this became her sanctuary whenever she wished to escape us and be alone to my father she was uniformly sweet and coaxing and he for his part took a strange fancy to her and abated somewhat of his demoniacal moodiness from the date of her arrival yet it must not be imagined from this description of her softer side that zyp was all tender pliability on the contrary in her general relations with us and others as impure human beings she was the veritable soul of impishness and played a thousand pranks to prove her title to her parentage at first she made a feint of distributing her smiles willfully by turn between modred and me so that neither of us might claim precedence but jason was admitted to no pretense of rivalry though to do him justice he at once took the upper hand by meeting scorn with indifference in my heart however i claimed her as my especial property a demand justified i felt no doubt by her manner toward me which was marked by a peculiar rebellious tenderness she showed to no other the day after her arrival she asked me to take her over the mill and show her everything i complied when the place was empty of all save us we explored room by room with a single exception the ancient building of course zyp said theres a room you havent shown me renny yes said i the room of silence why didnt we go there never mind theres something wicked in it what do tell me oh i should love to see theres nothing to see let it alone cant you youre a coward ill get the sleepy boy to show me come along then i said and seizing her hand dragged her roughly indoors we crossed a dark passage and pushing back a heavy door of ancient timber stood on the threshold of the room of silence it was not in natures meaning that the name was bestowed for entering the full voice of the wheel broke upon one with a grinding fury that shook the moldering boards of the floor well i whispered have you seen enough i see nothing she cried with a shrill defiant laugh i am going inand before i could stop her she had run into the middle of the room and was standing still in the bar of sunlight with her arms outspread like wings and her face the lips apart lifted with an expression on it of eager inquiry what happened i can find an image only in the poison bottle of the entomologist as some shining flowerstained butterfly slipped into this glass coffin quivers droops its wings and fades as it were in a moment before its capturers eyes so zyp faded before mine her arms dropped to her sides her figure seemed as if its whole buoyancy were gone at a touch her face fell to a waxen color and oh take me away she wailed in a thin strangled voice i conquered my terror rushed to her and dragging her stumbling and tripping from the room banged to the door behind us and made for the little platform once more and the open air she revived in a wonderfully short space of time and lifting up her head looked into my eyes with her own wide with dismay it was hideous she whispered why didnt you stop me zyp it will be seen was not all elf she had something in common with her sex i warned you i said and i know what you felt it was as if a question was being asked of me she said in a low voice and yet no one spoke and there was no question i dont know what it wanted or what were the words for there were none but i feel as if i shall have to go on thinking of the answer and struggling to find it forever and ever yes i whispered in the same tone that is what everybody says she begged me not to follow her and crept away quite humbled and subdued and we none of us saw more of her that day but just as she left me she turned and whispered in awestricken tone answer what speaks to thee and i could not remember when and where i had heard these words before chapter iv zyp bewitches in the evening dr crackenthorpe paid us a visit he found my father out but elected to sit with us and smoke his pipe expectant of the others return he always treated us boys as if we were so much dirt and we respected his strength just sufficiently to try no pranks on him in the absence of the ruling power but nevertheless we resented his presumption of authority and whenever he sat with us alone made an exaggerated affectation of being thick in whispered confidences among ourselves zyp was still upstairs and the doctor had not as yet seen her but he was conscious i think in some telepathic way of an alien presence in the house for he kept shifting his position uneasily and looking toward the door a screech from his lips suddenly startled us and we turned round to see the long man standing bolt upright with his face gone the color of a meal sack and his bold eyes staring prominent whats the matter said jason gradually the doctors face assumed a dark look of rage which of you was it he cried in a broken voice tell me or ill crack all your fingers up like fire sticks whats the matter said jason again you see for yourself weve been sitting by the table all the time youve been there something spokesomebody i tell you as i sat here in the chimney corner he was beside himself with fury and had great ado to crush his emotion under but he succeeded and sat down again trembling all over a curse is on the house he muttered then aloud ive had enough of your games you black vermin i wont stand it dye hear let there be an end we stared dropped into our seats and were beginning our confidences once more when the doctor started up a second time with a loud oath and leaped into the middle of the room great thunder he shouted dye dare this time we had all heard ita wailing whisper that seemed to come from the neighborhood of the chimney and to utter the words beware the demon that sits in the bottle and of the whole company only i was not confounded as to the doctor he suddenly turned very white again and muttered shakingly can it be i dont exceed as others do i swear i have taken less this month than ever before with the terror in his soul he stumbled toward the door and was moving out his hand to reach it when it opened from the other side and zyp as meek and pure looking as a young saint met him on the threshold now i had that morning in the course of conversation with the changeling touched upon dr crackenthorpe and his weaknesses and that ghostly mention of the bottle convinced me on the moment that only she could be responsible for the mysterya revelation of impishness which i need not say delighted me the method of her prank i may as well describe here the embrasure for a fireplace in her room had never been fitted with a grate and the hearthstone itself was cracked and dislocated in a dozen places by removing some of these fragments she had actually discovered a broken way into the chimney of the sitting room below down which it was easy to slip a hollow rail of iron which with other lumber lay in the attic this she had done listened for her opportunity and thereupon spoken the ominous words i think her appearance was the consummation of the doctors terror for a shuddering oh shook from his lips and he seemed about to drop and indeed she was somewhat like a spirit with her wild white face looking from a tangle of pheasantbrown hair and her solemn eyes like water glints in little wells of shadow she walked past the stricken man all stately and then modred and i jumped up and greeted her at this the doctors jaw dropped but his trembling ceased and he watched us with injected eyes holding my two hands zyp looked coyly round leaning backward i love a tall man she whispered he has more in him than a short one the doctor pulled himself together and came straggling across to the table who the pestilence is this he said in a voice not yet quite under his command zyp let go my hands and curtsied like a wild flower zyp the orphan good gentleman she said shall i fill your pipe for you it had fallen on the floor by the chimney and she picked it up and went to him with a winning expression where is your tobacco please mechanically he brought a round tin box from his pocket and handed it to her then it was a study in elfin coquetry to see the way in which she daintily coaxed the weed into the bowl and afterward sucking at the pipe stem with her determined little red lips to see if it drew properly this done she presented the mouthpiece to the doctors consideration as if it were a babys comforter now she said sit down and ill bring you your glass but at this the four of us including dr crackenthorpe drew back my father was no man to allow his pleasures to be encroached upon unbidden and we three at least knew it as much as our skins were worth to offer practical hospitality in his absence zyp looked at our faces and stamped her foot lively with a toss of disdain where is the strong drink she said modred tittered in that cupboard over the mantel shelf if you must know he said zyp had the bottle out in a twinkling and a glass with it she poured out a stiff rummer added water from a stone bottle on a corner shelf and presented the grateful offering to the visitor who had reseated himself by the table his scruples of conscience and discretion grew faint in the near neighborhood of the happy cordial he seized the glass and impulsively took half the grog at a breath zyp clapped her hands joyfully whereupon he clumped down the glass on the table with a dismayed look well he said youre an odd little witch upon my word what robin goodfellow fathered you i should like to know hes no father said zyp hes too full of tricks for a family man i could tell you things of him tell us some then said the doctor what zyp would have answered i dont know for at that moment my father walked into the room if he had had what is vulgarly called a skinful he was not drunk for he moved steadily up to the little group at the table with a scowl contracting his forehead the halfemptied tumbler had caught his eye immediately and he pointed to it i was conscious that the doctor quaked a little pray make yourself at home said my father and caught up the glass and flung its contents in the others face in a moment the two men were locked in a savage furious embrace till crashing over a chair they were flung sprawling on the floor and apart before they could come together again zyp alone of us had placed herself between them fearless and beautiful and had broken into a quaint little song smooth down her fur rub sleep over her eyes sweet never stir kiss down the coat of her there where she lies on the bluebells she sung and whether it was the music or the strangeness of the interruption i shall never know only the wonderful fact remains that with the sound of her voice the great passion seemed to die out of the two foes and to give place to a pleasant conceit comical in its way that they had only been rollicking together well said my father without closer allusion to his brutality the liquor was choice schiedam and its gone he sat down called for another glass helped himself to a noggin and pushed the bottle roughly across to dr crackenthorpe who had already reseated himself opposite sing again girl said my father but zyp shook her head i never do anything to order she said but the fairies move me to dance she blew out the lamp as she spoke and glided to a patch of light that fell from the high may moon through the window on to the rough boards of the room into this light she dipped her hands and then passed them over her hair and face as though she were washing herself in the mystic fountain of the night and all the time her murmuring voice accompanied the action in little trills of laughter and words not understandable presently she fell to dancing slowly at first and dividing her presence between glow and gloom but gradually the supple motion of her body increased step by step until she was footing it as wildly as a young hamadryad to her own leaping shadow on the floor suddenly she sprung from the moonlit square danced over to dr crackenthorpe and whispering awfully in his ear beware the demon that sits in the bottle ran from the room my father burst into a fit of laughter but i think from that day the doctor fully hated her chapter v a terrible interview zyp had been with us a month and surely never did changeling happen into a more congenial household jason she still held at arms length which despite my admiration of my brother i secretly congratulated my heart on forlet me get over it at the outsetfrom first to last i have never wavered in my passion of love for this wild beautiful creature the unexpectedness of her coming alone was a romance the delight of which has never palled upon me with the deadening years therefore it was that i early made acquaintance with the demon of jealousy than whom none in truth is more irresistible in his unclean strength and hideousness zyp and i were one day wandering under the shadow of the mighty old cathedral of winton i dont like it renny she said pressing up close to me its awful and its grand but there are always faces at the windows when i look up at them whose i said with a laugh i dont know she said but think of the thousands of old monks and things whose home it was once and whose ghosts are shut up among the stones there she cried pointing i looked at the old leaded window she indicated but could see nothing his face is like stone and hes beckoning she whispered oh come along rennyand she dragged me out of the grassy yard and never stopped hurrying me on till we reached the meadows here her gayety returned to her and she felt at home among the flowers at once presently we wandered into a grassy covert against a hedge on the further side of which a road ran and threw ourselves among the sauce alone and wild parsley that grew there zyp was in one of her softest moods and my young heart fluttered within me she leaned over me as i sat and talked to me in a low voice with her fair young brow gone into wrinkles of thoughtfulness renny whats love that they talk about i laughed and no doubt blushed i mean she said is it blue eyes and golden hair or brown eyes and brown hair dont be silly little boy till you know what i mean well what do you mean zyp i want to know thats all renny do you remember my asking to kiss and be friends that day we first met and your refusing yes zyp i stammered you may kiss me now if you like and she let herself drop into my arms as i sat there and turned up her pretty cheek to my mouth my blood surged in my ears i was halffrightened but all with a delicious guilt upon me i bent hastily and touched the soft pink curve with my trembling lips she lay quite still a moment then sat up and gently drew away from me no she said that isnt it shall i ever know i wonder know what zyp never mind for i shant tell you there i didnt mean to be rude and she stroked the sleeve of my jacket caressingly by and by she said i wonder if you will suffer renny poor boy i would save you all if i could for youre the best of them i believe her very words were so inexplicable to me that i could only sit and stare at her i have construed them since with a knife through my heart for every letter as we were sitting silent a little space steps sounded down the road and voices with them they were of two men who stopped suddenly as they came over against us hidden behind the hedge as if to clinch some argument but we had already recognized the contrary tones of my father and dr crackenthorpe now harkee the doctor was saying thats well and good but im not to be baffled forever and a day mr ralph trender what does it all amount to youve got something hidden up your sleeve and i want to know what it is is that all my father spoke in a set deep manner thats all and enough then look up my sleeve dr crackenthorpeif you can i dont propose to look i suggest that you just shake it when no doubt the youknowwhats will come tumbling out and if i refuse there are laws my friend lawsiniquitous if you like but for what they are they dont recognize the purse on the highway as the property of him that picks it up and how are you going to set these laws in motion well insert the end of the wedge firstsay in some public print now how would this look we have it on good authority that mr trender our esteemed fellowtownsman is the lucky discoverer of be silent you my father spoke fiercely then added in a low tone dye wish all the world to know not by any means said the other quietly and they shant if you fall in with my mood if i only once had your head in the mill wheel groaned my father with a curse now harken i dont put much value on your threat but this ill allow that i court no interference with my manner of life take the concession for what it is worth come to me by and by and you shall have another a couple said the doctor very wellno more though i rot for itand take my blessing with them when shall i come said the doctor ignoring the very equivocal benediction come tonightno tomorrow said my father and turning on his heel strode heavily off toward the town i heard the doctor chuckling softly with a malignant triumph in his note i clenched my teeth and fists and would have risen had not zyp noiselessly prevented me it was wormwood to me the revelation that for some secret cause my father the strong irresistible and independent was under the thumb of an alien but the doctor walked off and i fell silent on our homeward way we came across jason lying on his back under a tree but he took no notice of us nor answered my call and zyp stamped her foot when i offered to delay and speak to him nevertheless i noticed that more than once she looked back as long as he was in view to see if he was moved to any curiosity as to our movements which he never appeared to be in the least great clouds had been gathering all the afternoon and now the first swollen drops of an advancing thunderstorm spattered in the dust outside the yard inside it was as dark as pitch and i had almost to grope my way along the familiar passages zyp ran away to her own den suddenly with a leap of the blood i saw that some faintly pallid object stood against the door of the room of silence as i neared it it was only with an effort i could proceed and then the thing detached itself and was resolved into the white face of my brother modred is that you renny he said in a loud tremulous voice yes i answered very shakily myself what in the name of mystery are you doing there i feel queer he said lets get to the light somewhere we made our way to the back opened the door leading on to the little platform and stood looking at the stringed rain modreds face was ghastly and his eyes were awakened to an expression that i had never thought them capable of youve been in there i said yes he whispered more fool you if you like to tempt the devil you should have the brass to outface him why youve got it i cried for he suddenly let fall from his trembling hand a little round glittering object whose nature i could not determine in the stormy twilight he had it in his clutch again in a moment though i pounced for it and then he backed through the open doorway its naught that concerns you he said keep off you beast what is it i cried waterparings said he and clapped to the door in my face as i rushed at him and i heard him scuttle upstairs the latch caught me in the chest and knocked my breath out for a bit so that i was unable to follow and probably he ran and bolted himself into his bedroom in any case i had no mind for pursuit my heart being busy with other affairs and there i remained and thought them out presently being well braced to the ordeal i went indoors and upstairs to the living room where i was persuaded i should find my father and there he sat pretty hot with drink and with a comfortless glowering devil in his eyes well he thundered what do you want i managed to get out with some firmness a word with you dad though his eyes disquieted me make it one then and a quick one zyp and i were sitting behind a hedge this afternoon when you and dr crackenthorpe were at words on the other side his eyes shriveled me but the motion of his lips seemed to signify to me that i was to go on dad if he has any hold over you let me share the bother and help if i can he had sat with his right hand on the neck of the bottle from which he had been drinking and he now flung the latter at me with a snarl like that of a mad dog fortunately for me in the very act some flash of impulse unnerved him so that the bottle spun up to the ceiling and crashed down again to the floor from which the scattered liquor sent up a pungent sickening odor then he leaped to his feet and yelled at me i could make nothing of his words save that they clashed into one another in a torrent of furious invective but in the midst his voice stopped with a vibrating snap he put his hand to his forehead which i saw with horror was suddenly streaked with purple and down he sunk to the floor in a heap i was terribly frightened and running to him endeavored in a frantic manner to pull him into a sitting posture i had half succeeded when lying propped up against the leg of the table he gave a groan and bade me in a weak voice to let him be and presently to my joy i saw the natural color come back to his face by slow degrees by and by he was able to slide into the chair he had left where he lay panting and exhausted but recovering renalt my lad he said in a dragging voice what was that you said just now lets have it again i hesitated but he smiled at me and bade me not to fear thus encouraged i repeated my statement ah he said and the girldid she hear she couldnt help it dad but she cant have noticed much for she never even referred to it afterward which looks bad and so much for your profound knowledge of the sex he looked at me keenly for some moments from under his matted eyebrows then muttered as if to himself heres a growing lad and loyal i believe what if i took him a yard into my confidence oh yes dad i said eagerly you can trust me indeed you can i only want to be of some use he slightly shook his head then seemed to wake up all of a sudden there he said be off like a good boy and dont worry me a second time you meant well and im not offended yes dad i said a little sadly and was turning to go when he spoke to me again and if the girl should mention this matteryou know whatto you say what i tell you nowthat dr crackenthorpe thinks your father can tell him where more coins are to be found like the one i gave him that night but that your father cant and is under no obligation to dr crackenthorpenone whatever so i left him puzzled a little depressed but proud to be the recipient of even this crumb of confidence on the part of so reserved and terrible a man still i could not but feel that there was something inconsistent in his words to me and those i had heard him address to the doctor without a doubt his utterances on the road had pointed to a certain recognition of the necessity of bribing the other to silence chapter vi the night before full of dissatisfaction i wandered into the shed and loitered aimlessly about as i stood there jason came clattering homeward his coat collar turned up and his curly head bowed to the deluge so you got home before me he said shaking himself and squeezing his cap out as he spoke yes we came straight it was lovely in the meads wasnt it said he with an odd glance at me its been lovely all this may said i and that means a fat churchyard old rottengoose says a cold may and windy makes a full barn and findy a queer one old peg is shed die if she cast a woolen before the first of june i wonder what shed think of sitting under a hedge in a northeaster i started a little and shot a look askance at my brother could he have seen us but his next words reassured me or of falling asleep in the shade as i did till the rain on my face woke me up then you didnt see us pass i began and stopped see what i saw nothing but my eyelids and the sky through em i gave a sigh of relief my feelings toward zyp were boyish and bashful and innocent enough heaven knows but in the shadow of my rough past they were beginning to glimmer out so strange and sweet that the merest suspicion of their incurring publicity filled me with a shamefaced terror of ridicule that was agony freed from this dread i fell into an extreme of garrulity that landed me in a quagmire of discomfiture after i had thus talked for a while rather disconnectedly he interrupted me renny he said youre pretty fond of the girl arent you i heard him with a little shock of surprise not that i care he went on airily except for your sake old boy what do you mean i said were up to a thing or two arent we said he but shes fifty tricks to our one she has her good points jason oh yes lots of them so many that it hardly seems worth while noticing her setting you up against me shes never done anything of the sort i cried hotly hasnt she well thats all right and we can be chums again i only wanted to warn you against putting faith in a chit that can wear a new face easier than her dress to you or modred oror any one modred i cried in astonishment oh dont suppose he said that youre sole lord of her heart i never did suppose it i answered thickly why should i shes free to fancy whom she likesbut my heart sunk within me yes thats the way to look at it he said you wouldnt think she could find much to admire in that fatty now would you how do you know she does i do knowthats enough well isnt he a sort of brother to her i saidwith a courageous effortas we all are of course thats it and i dont know what you mean by any one else dont you he laughed and flung away a stone he had been idly playing with well i meant modred oror any one else who else dad sayor dr crackenthorpe oh youre an idiot i cried i wont talk to youand i left him and ran indoors but he had driven the sting home and the poison already worked furiously in me how can i explain why it was true what he had said every word of it she had set me against him jasonnot in words but by a tacit conviction of him as one who had of his own act bared his soul momentarily and revealed a sinister brand across it hitherto unguessed at well this was the first waking from the boyish dream and should i ever dream it again i had said we were all in a manner her brothers and that she was free to smile on whom she chose what a pitiful handful of dust for all eyes but my own i felt the passion of longing for her single love surge in me as i spoke i had never till that moment dreamed of combating another for possession of it she had seemed mine by right of fortunes gift from the first nor had she by her behavior appeared to question the right we had confidences discussions little secrets together which none but we might share in we walked and talked and leaned toward one another with a sense of mutual understanding that was pathetic i am sureat least as to my share in itin gods eyes and now to find that all the time she was on like secret terms with modredwith jason too perhaps judging by his sidelong innuendoes though it made my heart sick to think that she could play so double faced a game between me and one whom she professed to hate and despise what a drama of dolls it was and how soon the drama was to turn into a tragedy i went indoors and upstairs to the room which jason and i shared and flung myself on the bed then i was properly shocked and horrified to find that my cheeks were suddenly wet with tearsa humiliating discovery for a toughsinewed young barbarian to make what an admirable sight indeed renalt trender sniffing and snuffling for a girls favor pride however is everywhere indigenous and this came to my assistance if the minx played sham with me i would meet her with her own tactics and affect indifference what a triumphant picture this zypwhy have you been different to me of late renny arent you fond of me now rennymy good little zyp the fact is i have tired a bit of the novelty it has been my first experience of the society of a girl you know and very pleasant while it lasted but i confess to a little longing for a resumption of the old independence and freedom perhaps some day again we will walk and converse together as of old atop of this imaginary question and answer rose a smugly anguishing picture of zyp flushed and in tears my imagination insisted on these in bucketsful to outflood my own temporary weakness of zyp hurt and sorrowing but always striving by every means in her power to win back my lost favor alas poor little clown i fear it is just those who have the fancy to conjure up such pictures who suffer most cruelly from the nonrealization of the hopes of youth braced to the test however and not knowing myself in weak armor i came down to supper that evening prickling all through with resolve jason was in the room alone as i entered and was walking feverishly up and down hist he said softly seizing me by the arm come here and look for yourself he dragged me to the little square window which was open it looked out at the back and beneath was the railed platform before mentioned i knew that i was urged to act the spy and yetso demoralizing is jealousylike a dog i went softly we craned our necks through the opening and looked down trees all about here bordered the river banks so as to make the rear of our mill quite secret and secluded she zyp was standing on the platform with her arm round modreds neck she seemed trying to coax something from him which he was reluctant to part with as he evaded her efforts i saw what it wasthe little round yellow object i had noticed in his hand earlier in the afternoon darling she said in a subdued voice do let me have it he laughed and looked at her loutishly you know the condition zyp i have let you kiss me over and over again but you havent kissed me yet she stamped her foot nor ever shall she cried then here goes he said and slipped it into his pocket at that she rushed at him and wound her arms about him like a young panther shall i tear you with my teeth she said but instead she smoothed his face with one hand disengaged and murmured to him modred dear you got it for me you know you said so and precious frightened i was zyp well it is mine isnt it if you give me the kiss my fathers step on the stairs brought our heads in with a clatter we heard them scuttle into the house and a moment later they appeared in the room modreds face was flushed and bore a heavy embarrassed expression but zyp looked quite cool and selfpossessed i took no notice of her during the meal but talked daring in my misery to my father who condescended to answer me now and again and i could see that she wondered at me supper over i hurried to my room and shutting myself in went and sat by the window and gave my tormented soul to the night had i never met zyp i doubt if i should ever in my manhood have realized what the grownup i think seldom do the amount of torture and wrong the young heart may endure without burstingwith no hope of sympathy moreover except that halfamused tolerant form of it which the old think it sufficient to extend to youths elastic grievances by and by jason stole in for some little time he sat upon his bed silent then he said in a soft voice lets cry quits renny i think ive paid you out for that little accident of the meads i hate you i said quietly and indeed it seemed to me that his cruelty deserved no better a reward he laughed and was silent again and presently began to undress for bed whistling softly all the time i took no notice of him but long after when he was breathing peacefully asleep i laid my own aching head tired with misery on the pillow and tried to follow his example i was not to succeed until faint daylight came through the casement and the birds were twittering outsidewas never indeed to know sleep in its innocence again chapter vii the pool of death morning brought a pitcher of comfort with it on its gossamer wings who at can wake from restoring sleep to find the june sun on his face and elect to breakfast on bitter wormwood with the appetizing fry of good country bacon caressing his nostrils through every chink of the boards indeed i was not born to hate or to any decided vice or virtue but was of those who taking a middle course are kicked to the wall or into the gutter as the fates have a fancy i was friendly with myself with jasonalmost with zyp who had so bedeviled me after all i thought the measure of her regard for me might be more in a winning friendliness than in embraces such as she had bestowed upon modred therefore i dressed in good heart chatting amiably with jason who i could not help noticing was at some pains to study me curiously such reactionary spirits are the heritage of youth they decline with the day my particular relapse happened maybe ungenerously early for it was at breakfast i noticed the first tremulous vibrations of zyps war trumpet clearly she had guessed the reason of the change in my manner toward her yesterday evening and was bent upon disabusing my mind of the presumptuous supposition that i held any monopoly whatsoever of her better regard to this end she showered exaggerated attentions upon modred and my fathereven jason coming in for his share she had little digs at my silence and boorishness that hugely delighted the others she slipped a corner of fat bacon into my tea and spilled salt over my bread and jam and all the time i had to bear my suffering with a stoic heart and echo the merriment which i did in such sardonic fashion as to call down fresh banter for my confusion at our worst it must be confessed we were not a circle with a refined sense of humor but when we rose and zyp brushed rudely by me with a pert toss of her head i felt indeed as if life no longer held anything worth the striving after i walked out into the yard to be alone but jason followed me some tenderness for old comradeship sake stirred in him momentarily i think for his blue eyes were good as they met mine what an ass you are renny he said to make such a todo about the rubbish i dont know what you mean i said in miserable resentment im making no todo about anything my chest felt like a stone and i could have struck him or any one oh i can see said he see what you like i replied furiously but dont bother me with it ive nothing to do with your fancies oh very well he said coolly i dont want to interfere im sure i bounced past him and strode out of the yard my blood was humming in my veins the sunny street looked all glazed with a shining gray i walked on and on scarcely knowing whither i went presently i climbed st catherines hill and flung myself down on the summit below me a quarter of a mile away the old city lay in the hollow cup of its down who of all its souls could ever stir my pulses as the little stranger from the distant shadowy forest could we had no forests round winton perhaps if we had the spirit of the trees would have colored my life too so that i might have scorned the blind bowgods butt shaft no doubt i was young to make such capital out of a little boyish disappointment do you think so then to you i must not appeal oh my friend we are not all jackolanterns at and the fire of unrequited affection may burn fiercer in the pure air of youth than in the vitiated atmosphere of manhood anyhow believe me that to me my misery was very real and dreadful think only you who have plucked the fruit and found it bitteryou whose disenchantment of life did not begin till life itself was waningwhat it must be to feel hopeless at that tender age all day long i lay on the hill or wandered about the neighboring downs and it was not till the shadows of the trees were stretching that i made up my mind to return and face out the inevitable i was parched and feverish and the prospect of a plunge in the river on my way home came to me with a little lonely thrill as of solace to my unhappiness there was a deep pool at a bend of the stream not far from where zyp and i had sat yesterday afternoon was it only yesterday which we three were much in the habit of frequenting on warm evenings and thither i bent my steps this part of the water lay very private and solitary and was only to be reached by trespassing from the road through a pretty thickset blackthorn hedgea necessity to its enjoyment which i need not say was an attraction to us as i wriggled through our individual run in the hedge and emerging on the other side raised my face i saw that a naked figure was already seated by the side of the running pool which i was not long in identifying as modreds i hesitated what reason had i for hobnobbing with mine enemy as in the bitterness of my heart i called him i could not as yet speak to him naturally i felt or meet him without resentment where was the object in complicating matters i turned on the thought to go and again hesitated should he see me before i had made my escape would he not attribute it to embarrassment on my part and crow triumphant over my discomfiture ah why did i not act on my first impulse why why the deeps of perdition must resound with that forlorn little word when a second time the good resolve came to me it was too late he rose and saw me and under his shading hand even at that distance i could mark the silent grin of mockery on his face i walked deliberately toward him my hands in my pockets my cap shading my eyes arent you coming to bathe he said when i drew near itll cool your temper i could have struck him but i answered nothing and only began to undress where have you been all day we were wondering zyp and i as we lay in the meadow out there still i answered nothing but i knew that my hands trembled as i pulled off my coat and waistcoat he stood watching me a little while in silence then said you seem to have lost your tongue old renny has it followed your heart because zyp talks for two i sprung up but he eluded me and with a hateful laugh leaped on the moment into the deep center of the pool a horrible tightness came round my throat halfundressed as i was i plunged after him all mad with passion he rose near me and seeing the fury of my face dived again and i followed it took but an instant and my life was wrecked we met among the weeds at the bottom and he jumped from me as he rose i clutched him by one foot and swiftly passed a great sinew of weed three or four times around his ankle it held like a grapnel and would hold for though he was a fair swimmer he was always frighted and nervous in the face of little difficulties then swerving away i rose again with laboring lungs to the surface barely had my drenched eyes found the daylight again when the hideous enormity of my crime broke into my brain like the toll of a death bell the water near me was heaving slightly and some welling bubbles swayed to the surface they were the drowning gasps of my brothermy own brother whom i was murdering i gave a thin wretched scream and sunk again into the deep hole beneath me he was jerking convulsively and his hands clutched vainly at his feet and slipped away in a dying manner i tore at the weed to unwind itonly to twist it into new fetters i pulled frantically at its roots i felt that i should go mad if it did not yield in a moment it came away in my hands and i shot upward struggling but the other poor body followed me sluggishly and i seized it by the hair with all my heart gone crazy and towed it ashore his face i thought looked fallen away already and was no longer loutish or malicious it seemed just a white pathetic thing freed from sufferingand i would have given my lifeay and my loveten times over to see the same expression come back to it it had worn as it turned to me before he dived i fell on my knees beside him and broke into a passion of tears i kissed with no shame but a murderers the wet forehead and beat and pressed in a futile agony too terrible for words the limp unresisting hand against my breast it seemed that he must wake if i implored him so frantically but he lay quiet with closed eyes and the water ran from his white skin in trickling jerks and pauses in the midst of my useless anguish some words of jasons recurred to me and seizing my coat for a pillow to his forehead i turned him with a shuddering horror of his limpness upon his face a great gush of water came with a rumble from his mouth but he did not stir and there i stood looking down upon him my hand to my forehead my mad eyes staring as cains must have stared when he wrought the deed of terror and i was caini who yesterday was a boy of loving impulses i think whose blackest crime might be some petty rebellion against the lesser proprieties who had even hugged himself upon living on a loftier plane than this poor silenced victim of his brutality as the deadly earnest of my deed came home to my stunned mind i had no thought of escape i would face it out confess and die my fathers agonyfor he loved us in his way i believe jasons condemnation zyps hatred my own shame and torturei put them all on one side to get full view of that black crossbeam and rope that i felt to be the only medicine for my sick and haunted soul as i stood the sound of wheels on the road beyond woke me to some necessity of action stumbling as in a nightmare not feeling my feet but only the mechanical spring of motion i hurried to the hedge side and looked over a carter with a tilt wagon was urging his tired team homeward help i cried oh come and help me and my voice seemed to me to issue from under the tilt of the wagon he woad up his horses raised his hat from his forehead wrinkled with hot weariness and came toward me his whip over his shoulder whats toward said he my brother i gasped we were bathing together and hes drowned the mans boorish face lighted up like a farthing rushlight here was something horribly sordid enough for all the excitement he was worth it would sweeten many a pot of swipes for the week to come wheer be the body said he eagerly over yonder on the grass oh wont you help me to carry it home he looked at the hedge critically go you he said and drag en hither well gat en over hedge together i ran back to where it lay it had collapsed a little to one side and for an instant my breath caught in a wild thrill of hope that he had moved of himself but the waxen hue of the face in the gathering dusk killed my emotion on its very issuing a strange loathing of the thing lying so unresponsive had in my race backward and forward sprung upon me but before it could gain the mastery i had seized it under the armpits and was halfdragging halfcarrying it toward the road i was at the hedge before i knew it and the red face of the carter was peering curiously down at the white heap beneath harned en up he said my but its cold easy now take the toes of en tharts itwoa and he had it in his strong arms and shuffling heavily to the rear of his wagon jerked back the flap of the tilt with his elbow and slid the body like a package into the interior get your coat man he cried and coom away i had forgotten in the terror of it all my own halfdressed state for i had stripped only to my underclothes and my boots were still on my feet mechanically i returned to the riverside and hastily donning my coat and trousers snatched up the others tumbled garments and ran back to the road chapter viii the waking the carter was holding the curtain back and critically apostrophizing the thing within ay he be sound enough reckon nought but the last trumpll waken yon now youngster where may you live i told him sure he said the old crazed mill then i thought he muttered well tis one vermin the less but i was not sure and nothing matterednothing he asked me if i would like to ride with it inside the mere suggestion was terror to me and i stammered out that i would rather walk for i had tried my best already and had given up hope so we set off slowly through the dumb haunted twilight thoughts would not come to me in any definite form i imagined the cathedral bells were ringing till i found it was only a jangling in my brain discordant and unearthly people came toward us who on nearing were resolved into distorted rags of mist voices croaked with laughter and they were only the swung branches of trees suddenly i heard an exclamationreal enough this timeand saw the carter run to the head of his team and stop them woa then he cried in a frightened voice and then with terrified impatience coom hither marn i tell ee dont ee stand theer gawking at the air dang it the ghost walks he stamped his heavy foot seeing me motionless then cried again take thee foul burden out o the wain and dang me for a fool ever to have meddled wit a gush of wondrous hope flooded my breast i tore to the rear of the wagon dashed back the curtainand there was modred sitting up and swaying feebly from side to side i leaped i caught him in my arms my breath came in laughter and sobs oh modred modred i cried i didnt mean itit wasnt meim not like that and then i broke down and wept long and convulsively though i would never let him out of my clutch where am i he said faintly oh it hurts so every vein in my body is bursting with pain at this i beat under my hysterical outburst and set to rubbing him all over in frantic eagerness it seemed to ease him a little and i blessed him that he lay passively against me and did not offer to push me away poor fellow he was far too weak as yet for any resistance presently i heard the carter bawl in tremulous tones art gone the two of ee come here i called back with a tearful laugh hes better hes recovered the fellow came round gingerly and stood a little distance off eh he said dubiously see for yourself i cried he wasnt drowned after all hes come round the man spat viciously in the road and came sullenly forward he was defrauded of an excitement and he felt the injury grievously you young varmint he growled thems your tricks for to get a free lift nonsense i said buoyantly you yourself thought him dead carry us on to the mill and ill promise you a proper skinful of liquor he was crabbed and undecided but presently he went forward and whipped up his horses with a surly oath as the wagon pitched modred opened his eyes which he had shut and looked up at me are you feeling better old boy i said tenderly the pain isnt so bad but im tired to death said he rest and dont talk youll be stronger in a bit he closed his eyes again and i tried to shield him as much as i could from the jolting i had already wrapped him up warm in some old sacks that were heaped in a corner of the wagon so all the way home i held him counting his every breath loving him as i had never done before it was dark when we reached the mill and i laid him gently back and leaped down dad dad i shouted running down the yard and into the house but he was already standing at the head of the stairs with a candle in his hand modreds had an accident i cried in a subdued voicei could not keep the lie back it seemed so dreadful at the outset to confess and stand aside condemnedwhile others helped jason and zyp came out on the landing and my father ran down the stairs hurriedly whats that he saidmodred he got caught in the weeds and was nearly drowned but hes getting better where is he he seized me by the arm as he spoke and dragged me to the mill door i could feel the pulses in his finger tips through my coat hes in a wain outside and i promised the man a long drink for bringing us home theres a full bottle in the cupboardbring it down shouted my father to jason then he hurried to the wagon and lifted out the breathing figure and looked into its face after all it was his youngest not much harm perhaps said he run and tell them to heat some water and the blankets while i was finding old peg and explaining and giving the order they carried him upstairs i did not dare follow them but the reaction over leaned feeling sick and faint in the passage outside the little kitchen perhaps even now he was telling them and i dreaded more than i can describe the sentence which a first look at any one of their faces might confirm presently old peg came out to me with a can of boiling water and flung an armful of warm blankets over my shoulder theres for you renalt she cried in her thin rusty voice then muttered clawing her hips like a monkey tis flying in the lords face o providence to me a old woman like as restoring a froze snake on the hearth i had no heart for retort but sped from the sinister old witch with my burden i saw zyp and jason in the livingroom as i passed but though they called to me i ran on and upstairs to the door of modreds room which was next ours my father came out to my knock and took the things from me now said he i want nobody here but myself and dr crackenthorpe go you and fetch him if hes to be found happy to be employed in any useful service i hurried away on my errand the door of the sittingroom was shut at which i was glad very little respite gave me fresh lease of hope the doctors home was close by in a straggling street of old buildings that ran off our end of the high street and the doctor himself was i was told within i found him seated in a musty little parlor with some ugly casts of murderers heads facing him from the top of a varnished bookcase ah my friend he screeched cracking his knuckles those interest you eh well perhaps i shall have the pleasure of adding your picture to them some day an irrepressible shudder took me and he laughed not knowing the reason of it now whats your business said he i told him eh he said and bent forward and looked at me narrowly near drowned eh why what were you doing you young limb i went after him i answered faintly but i couldnt get the weeds loose dressed too he said for the sop of my underclothes had come through the upper and nothing escaped his hawks eye why youre a hero upon my word he bade me begone after that and he would follow immediately and i returned to the mill and softly climbing the stairs shut myself into my room and sat upon the edge of the bed listeninglistening for every breath and sound in the old eerie house i heard the doctor come up the stairs and enter the room next door i heard the low murmur of voices and strained my ears to gather what was said but could not make out a word and the darkness grew into my soul and shut out all the old light of happy reason should i ever feel innocent again and would modred satisfied with his knowledge of the dreadful heritage of remorse i had laid up for myself forego his right to denounce me and to forever make me an outcast and alone i hardly dared to hope it yet clung with a strenuous longing to thought of his mercy it may have been hours i sat there i do not know i had heard footsteps go up and down the stairs many times and then a silence fell what was the meaning of it was it possible that life had only rallied in him momentarily like the flame of a dying candle and had suddenly sunk for good and all into endless darkness had he told why did no one come near me i could stand it no longer as i sprung to my feet i heard a footstep again on the stairs and jason walked into the room and shut the door he took no notice of me but began to undress jason i cried and the agony in my voice i could not repress how is he has he spoken oh dont keep me in this torture what torture said my brother looking at me with a cold unresponsive eye why should you be upset more than the rest of us hes asleep all right and not to be bothered with any questions thank god oh thank god i took no notice of his looks or tone for i was absorbed in great gratitude to heaven that my worst fears were idle ones wheres dad i said drinking downstairs with the doctor theyll make high revel of it i expect he was already in bed but i sat on and on in the darkness i had only one thoughtone longing to wait till jason was fast in slumber and then to creep to modreds side and implore his forgiveness presently the deep regular breathing of my brother announced to me the termination of my vigil with my heart beating in a suffocating manner i stole to the door opened it and stood outside that of modreds room i listened a moment a humming noise of garrulous voices below was the only sound that broke the silence of the house softly i turned the handle and softly crept into the room there was light in it for on the washhand stand a rush candle burned dimly in an old lanthorn he gave a start for he was lying awake in his bed then halfrose on his elbow and looked at me with frightened eyes dont come near he whispered what do you want you arent going to try to kill me again i gave a little strangled agonized cry and dropping on my knees where i stood stretched out my arms to him imploringly oh modred dont dont you cant think i meant it it was only a horrible impulse i was mad and i nearly drowned myself directly afterward in saving you the fright went from his face and something like its familiar look returned to it are you sorry he said sorry oh i will do anything you like if you will only believe me come here renny he said and stand by me i want to see you better i obeyed humblylovingly you want me to forgive you if you could modredif you only could and not to peach i hung my head in shame and the tears were in my eyes again well ill agree on one condition make any you like modred ill swear to keep it ill never forget it zyps it he said looking away from me yes i said gently with a prescience of what was coming youll have to give her up for good and allkeep out of her way let her know somehow youre sick of her and keep jason out of the way you and he were chums enough before she came i swear for myself and to do what i can with jason i said dully what did it matter one way or another the buoyant light of existence was shut to me for good and all its the only way said modred and he gave me a look that i dare not call crafty after all it isnt much he said considering what you did to me and she seems to be getting tired of younow doesnt she yes i said in a low voice then thats settled and now let me be for i feel as if i can sleep hand me my breeches first though theres something in the pocket i want shall i get it out for you old boy no no he answered hurriedly give them to me cant you i did as he wanted and crept from the room what did it matter zyp had already cast me off but for the evil deed i was respited a moment ago the girl had seemed as nothing set in the scale against my brothers forgiveness could it be the true loving spirit of forgiveness that could make such a condition hush i must not think that thought what did it matter i did not go back to my room but sat on a stair at the head of the downward flight with a strange stunned feeling below the voices went on spasmodicallynow a long murmurnow a snatch of songnow an angry phrase by and by i think i must have fallen into a sort of stupor for i seemed to wake all at once to a thunderous uproar i started to my feet magnified as all sounds are in the moment of recovered consciousness there was yet noise enough below to convince me that a violent quarrel between the two men was toward i heard my fathers voice in bitter denunciation youve been hawking over my quarry this long while ill tear the truth out of your long throat give me back my cameowhere is it a fig for your cameo cried the other in a shrill voice and i tell you this is the first ive heard of it youve been watching me you fiend you dogging mehaunting me ill have no more ot im not to be bribed or threatened or coaxed any more least of all thieved from where is it you arent arent you screeched the doctor you leave me here and i fall asleep youre away and you come storming back that ive robbed you its a trap by thunder but you wont catch me in it i believe youre lying cried my father his voice seemed strained with passion but the other answered him now much more coolly believe what you like my friend its beneath my dignity to contradict you again but take this for certainif you slander me in public ill ruin you then silence fell and i waited to hear no more i stole to my room and crept to bed i had never changed my drenched clothes and the deadly chill of my limbs was beginning to overcome the frost in my heart it seemed hours before the horrible coldness relaxed and then straightway a parching fever scorched me as if i lay against a furnace i heard sounds and dull footsteps and the ghostly creaking of stairs but did not know if they were real or only incidents in my halfdelirium at last as day was breaking i fell into a heavy exhausted sleep it merged into a dream of my younger brother we walked together as we had done as little children my arm around his neck zenny he said like a baby paraphrasing zyps words whats ove dat ey talk about i could have told him in the gushing of my heart but in a moment he ran from me and faded i gave a cry and woke and jason was standing over me with a white scared face get up he whispered modreds dead chapter ix the face on the pillow often the first shock of some unexpected mental blow shakes from the soul not its corresponding emotion but that emotions exact antithesis thus when jason spoke i laughed i could not on the moment believe that such hideous retribution was demanded of my already writhed and repentant conscience and it seemed to me that he must be jesting in very ugly fashion perhaps he looked astonished anyhow he said you neednt make a joke of it are you awake modreds dead i tell you i sprung from the bed i clutched him and pulled him to and fro tell me you lieyou lieyou lie i cried he did not i could see it in his face there and then the drought of tophet withered and constricted my life i was branded and doomed forevermore a thing to shudder at and avoid i will dress and come i said relaxing from my hold on him and turned away and began to hurry on my clothes i had not felt so set in quietness since the morning of two days past i could even think calmly and balance the pros and cons of my future behavior each man must be his own judge his own plaintiff his own defendantan atom of selfcontained equity by his own ruling in matters of right and wrong he must abide suffer his own punishments enjoy his own rewards he is a lonely organism in whom only himself took an interest and as such he must be content to endure with calmness the misinterpretations of aliens modred had forgiven me whatever was the condition whatever the deed it was too late now to convince me that no justification existed for my rebellion against fate my elder my only brother now watched me in silence as i dressed where is he i said when i had finished in bed as he was left said jason i went in this morning while you were asleep and found himah he looks horrible he cried and broke off with a shudder i did not shrink i felt braced up to any ordeal they were all in the room when we entered it my father dr crackenthorpe zypeven old peggy who was busying herself with the vulture relish of her kind over the little artificial decencies of dress and posture that seem such an outrage on the solemn unresistance of the dead directly we came in zyp ran to jason and clung to him sobbing i noticed it with a sort of dull resignation and that was all for peggy who had drawn a sheet over the lifeless face pulled it down that i might look then for all my stoicism i gave a cry i had left my brother the night before tired needing rest but save for the extra pallor of his complexion that never boasted a great deal of color much like his usual self now the dead face lying back on the pillows was awful to look upon spots and bars of livid purple disfigured its waxen whitenesson the cheeks the ears the throat where a deep patch was it was greatly swollen too and the mouth so rigidly open that it had defied all effort to bind it close a couple of pennies like a hideous pair of glasses lay one over each eye where they could only be kept in position by means of a filament drawn tightly round the head the hands stiffly crossed with the fingers crooked like talons lay over the breast fastened into position with a ligature i turned away feeling sick and faint i think i reeled for presently i found that dr crackenthorpe was supporting me against his arm oh why is he like that i whispered tis a common afterclap in deaths by drowning said he speaking in a loud insistent voice as if not for the first time a stoppagea relapse during the weak small hours when the patients strength is at its lowest the overwrought lungs refuse to workcollapse and he dies of suffocation he looked at my father as he spoke but elicited no response it was palpable that the heavy potations of the night had so deadened the latters faculties as to make him incapable for the moment of realizing the full enormity of the sight before him mark me said the doctor its a plain case i say nothing out of the way no complications the wretched boy to all intents and purposes has been drowned who drowned him said my father he spoke thickly stupidly but i started with a dreadful feeling that the locked jaws must relax and denounce me before them all seeing his hopeless state the doctor took my fathers arm and led him from the room zyp still clung to my brother cover it up whispered jason he isnt a pretty sight he wasnt a pretty boy muttered peggy reluctantly hiding the dreadful face to a old womans view it speaks of more than his deserts nobodyll come to look at me i expect you heard what the doctor said asked jason looking across at me yes drownedyou understand drowned renny drowned i repeated mechanically come zyp he said this isnt the place for you any longer they passed out of the room she still clinging to him so that her face was hidden i did not measure his words at that time i had no thought for nice discriminations of tone what did i care for anything any longer presently i heard old peg muttering again she thought the room was emptied of us and she softly removed the face cloth once more ay there ye lies modredsafe never to spy on poor old rottengoose again ye were a bad lot ye were but pegs been moren enough for you she has my lad suddenly she saw me out of the tail of her eye and turned upon me livid with fury what are ye listening to renalt a black curse on spies renalt i say then her manner changed and she came fawning at me fulsomely what a good lad to stay wi his brother but pegll do the tending renalt she be a crass old body and apt to reviling in her speech but she dont mean it bless you its the tic doldrums in her head i repelled the horrible old creature and fled from the room what she meant i neither knew nor cared for we had always looked upon her as a feckless body with a big worm in her brain all the long morning i wandered about the house scarcely knowing what i did or whither i went once i found myself in the room of silence not remembering when i had come there or for what reason the fact merely was impressed upon me by a gradual change in the nature of my sensations something seemed to be asking a question of me which i was striving and striving to answer it didnt distress me at first for a nearer misery overwhelmed everything but by and by its insistence pierced a passage through all dull obstacles and the something took up its abode in me and reigned and grew i felt myself yielding yielding and strove now to beat off the inevitable horror of the answer that was rising in me i did not know what it was or the question to which it was a responseonly i saw that if i yielded to it and spoke it i should die then and there of the black terror of its revelation i sprung to my feet with a cry and saw or thought i saw modred standing by the water wheel and beckoning to me if i had strength to escape it was enough for that and no more for everything seemed to go from me till i found myself sitting at the foot of the stairs with jason looking oddly down upon me i neednt get up i said modred isnt dead after all i think i heard him shout out anyhow i felt myself lifted up and carried somewhere and put down if they had thought to restrain me however they should have managed things better for i was up in a moment and out at the window i had often thought one wanted only the will to forget gravity and float through the air and here i was doing it what a glorious sensation it was i laughed to think how long i had remained like a reptile bound to the plodding miserable earth when all the time i had power to escape from myself and float on and on far away from all those heartbreaking troubles if i only went very swiftly at first i should soon be too distant for them to track me and then i should be free i felt a little anxious for there was a faint noise behind me i strove to put on pace if my limbs had responded to my efforts no bird could have outstripped me but i saw with agony that the harder i fought the less way i made i struggled and sobbed and clutched myself blindly onward and all the time the noise behind grew deeper if i pushed myself off with a foot to the ground i only floated a very little way now then i saw a railing and pulled myself along with it toilsomely but some great pressure was in front of me and my feet slipped into holes at every step panting straining slipping as if on bloodwhy it was blood i had to yield at last my passion of hope was done with i lay in a white set horror not daring to move or look how deadly quiet the room was but not for long for a little stealthy rustle of the sheet beside me prickled through my whole being with its ghastly stirring then i knew it had secretly risen on its elbow and was leaning over and looking down upon me if i could only perspire i thought my bonds would loosen and i could escape from it but it was cunning and knew that too and it sealed all the surface of my skin with its acrid exhalations suddenly it clutched me in its crooked arms and bore me down down to the room of silence there was a sickening odor there and the covering of the wheel was open then with a shudder as of death i thought i found the answer for now it was plain that the great wheel was driven by blood not water as i looked aghast straining over it gave me a stealthy push and with a shriek i splashed among the paddles and was whirled down for ages i was spun and beaten round and round mashed mangled gasping for breath and choked with the horrible crimson broth that fed the insane and furious grinding of the wheel at the end glutted with torture it flung me forth into a parching desert of sand and spinning from me became far away a revolving disk of red that made the lowdown sun of that waste corner of the world i was alone nowalways alone no footsteps had ever trod that trackless level nor would i knew till time was ended i had no hope no green memory for oasis no power of speech even then i knew i was dead had been dead so long that my body had crackled and fallen to decay leaving my soul only like the stone of a fruit quick with wretched impulse to shoot upward but dreadfully imprisoned from doing so sometimes in the world the massive columns of the cathedral had suggested to me a like sensation a moral impress of weight and stoniness that had driven me to bow my head and creep sweating away from their inexorable stolidity now i was built into such a bodymore was an integral part of it yet could my pinioned nerves never assimilate its passionless obduracy but jerked and struggled in agony to be free oh how divine is the instinct that paints heaven all light and airiness and innocent forevermore of the sense of weight suddenly i heard zyps voice singing outside in the world and in a moment tears most blessed blessed tears sprung from my eyes and i was free the stone cracked and fell asunder and i leaped out madly shrieking at my release she was sitting under a tree in a beautiful meadow and her young voice rose sweetly as she prinked her hat with daisies and yellow kingcups she called me to her and gave me tender names and smoothed away the pain from my forehead with kisses and the cunning of her elfish brown hand come drink she said and you will be better i woke to life and looked up she was standing by my bed holding a cup toward my lips and at the foot jason leaned looking on have i been ill i said in a voice so odd to me that i almost laughed yes yesa little but you have come out of the black pit now into the forest chapter x jason speaks for some three weeks i had lain racked and shriveled in a nervous delirious fever it left me at last the ghost of my old self to face once more the problems of a ruined life for many days these gave me no concern or only in a fitful indifferent manner i was content to sip the dew of convalescence to slumber and to cherish my exhaustion and the others disturbed me but little my recovery once assured they left me generally to myself scarce visiting me more often than was necessary for the administering of food or medicine sometimes one or other of them would come and sit by my bedside awhile and exchange with me a few desultory remarks but this was seldom and grew with my strength more so for the earth was brilliant with summer outside and naturally fuller of attractions than a sickroom their neglect troubled me little at first but by and by when the first idle ecstasy of convalescence was beginning to deepen into a sense of responsibilities that i should soon have to gather up and adjust it woke day by day an increasing uneasiness in my soul as yet it is true the immediate past i could only call up before my mental vision as a blurred picture of certain events the significance of which was suggestive only gradually however detail by detail the whole composition of it concentrated on the blank sheet of my mind and stood straight before me terribly uncompromising in its sternness of outline had i any reason to suppose in short that my share in modreds death was known to or guessed at by my father jason or zyp on that pivot turned the whole prospect of my future for as to myself were the secret to remain mine alone i yet felt that i could make out life with a tolerable degree of resignation in the certain knowledge that modred had forgiven me before he died for a momentary mad impulse the provocation to which had been so bitterthe reaction from which had been so immediate and so equally impulsive of my father i may say at once i had little fear his manner toward me when as he did occasionally he came and sat by me for a halfhour or so was marked by a gentleness and affection i had never known him to exhibit before pathetic as it was i could sometimes almost have wished it replaced by a sterner mood a more dubious attitude for my remorse at having so bereaved him became a barbed sting in presence of his new condescension to me that dated from the afternoon of my appeal to him and was intensified by our common loss of zyp i hardly dared to think or dared to do more than tremulously hover round the thought that modreds death had absolved me from my promise to him to avoid her still the thought was there and perhaps i only played with selfdeception when i affected to fly from it out of a morbid loyalty to him that was gone i could not live with and not long for her with all the passion i was capable of therefore it was that i dreaded any possible disclosure of a suspicion on her partdreaded it with a fever of the mind so fierce that it must truly have retarded my recovery indefinitely had not a counterirritant occurred to me in certain moods in the form of a thought that perhaps after all my deed might not so affright one who on her own showing found a charm in the contemplation of evil but it was jason i feared most somethingi can hardly give it a namehad come to me within the last few weeks that seemed to be the preface to an awakening of the moral right on my part in the unfolding of this new faculty i was startled and distressed to observe deformities in my brother where i had before seen nothing but manly beauty and a breezy recklessness that i delighted in beautiful bodily i and all must still think him though it had worried me lately to often observe an expression in his blue eyes that was only new to my new sense this i can but describe with despair of the melodramatic sound of it as poisonous the pupils were as full and purple as berries of the deadly nightshade it was not however his eyes only that baffled me i saw that he coveted any novelty of sensation greedily and that sooner than forego enjoyment of it he would ruthlessly stamp down whatever obstacle to its attainment crossed his path now i knew in my heart that his hitherto indifference to zyp was an affectation born only of wounded vanity and that such as he could never voluntarily yield so piquant a prize to homelier rivals i recalled with a brooding apprehension certain words of his on that fatal morning that seemed intended to convey at least a dark suspicion as to the manner of modreds death probably they were bolts shot at random with a sinister objectfor i could conceive no shadow of direct evidence against me in that connection they might mean much or little in one other i had small doubt that they meant a good dealthis in fact that if i got in his way with zyp down i should go daily probing and analyzing such darkly dismal problems as these i slowly crawled through convalescence to recovery it was a sweltering morning in early july that i first crept out of doors with zyp for my companion it was happiness to me to have her by my side though as yet my weak and watery veins could prickle to no ghost of passion i had thought that life could hold nothing for me ever again but present pain and agonized retrospects it was not so the very smell of the freshly watered roads woke a shadowy delight in me as we stepped over the threshold the buoyant thunder of the river as it leaped under the old street bridge seemed to gush over my heart with a cleansing joyousness that left it white and innocent again we crossed the road and wandered by a zigzag path to the ancient close where soft stretches and paddocks of green lawn immemorial elms and scattered buildings antique and embowered wrought such an harmonious picture as filled my tired soul with peace here we sat down on an empty bench i had much to question zyp aboutmuch to reflect on and put into wordsbut my neglected speech moved as yet on rusty hinges zyp i said presently in a low voice tell mewhere is he buried in the churchyardst johns under the hill renny not once until now had i touched upon this subject or mentioned modreds name to any one of them and a great longing was upon me to get it over and done with who went dad and jason and dr crackenthorpe zyp nobody has asked me anything about it dont you all want to know howhow it happened he was caught in the weedsyou said so yourself renny vainly i strove to get under her words intuition was for the time being a sluggish quantity in me yes but i began when she took me up softly dad said it was all clear and that we were never to bother you about it at all a sigh of gratitude to heaven escaped me and i for one said zyp dont intend to something in her words jarred unaccountably on my sick nerves at first she said just glancing at me dad thought there ought to be an inquest but dr crackenthorpe was so set against it that he gave in dr crackenthorpe why was he said that juries took such an idiotic view of a fathers responsibilities that dad might be censured for letting the boy run wild that in any case the familys habits of life would be raked over and cause a scandal that might make things very uncomfortable that it was a perfectly plain case of drowning and that he was quite willing to give a certificate that death was due to a rupture of some blood vessel in the brain following exhaustion from exposureor something of that sort and he did yes at last after a deal of talk and he was buried quietly and there was an end of it not quite an end zypnot quite an end she was very gentle and patient with me all the morning and my poor soul brimmed over with gratitude my pulses began even to flicker a little with hope that things might be as they were before the catastrophe after all she was a very independent changeling and if there existed in her heart any bias in my favor jason might find himself quite baffled in his efforts to control her inclinations presently i turned to the same overclouding subject what happened the day i was taken bad zyp jason found you on the stairs talking rubbish they carried you to bed and you hardly left off talking rubbish for weeks dont you remember anything of it nothing afterafter i saw him lying there so dreadful ah it was ugly wasnt it well you must have wandered off somewhereanywhere and the rest of us to the parlor there dad and the doctor fell to words they had spent all the night over that stupid drink sleeping and quarreling by fits and couldnt remember much about it they had not heard any noise upstairs either of them but suddenly the doctor pointed to something hanging out of dads pocket why you must have gone to the boys room some time he said look there dad took it out and it was modreds braces all twisted up and stuffed into his pocket modreds braces yes they all knew them for they were blue you knowthe color he liked dad afterward thought he must have put them there to be out of the way while he was carrying modred upstairs but at the time he was furious dye dare to imply i had a hand in my sons death he shrieked i imply nothing i mean no offense they are plain for every one to see said the doctor going back a little i thought he was frightened and that dad would jump at his throat like a weasel and i clapped my hands waiting for the battle but it never came for dad turned pale and called for brandy and there was an end of it this story of the doctors horrible suggestion wrought only one comfort in meit warmed my heart with a great heat of loyalty to one who i knew for all his faults could never be guilty of so inhuman a wickedness i should like to kill that doctor i said fiercely and proudly so should i said zyp i believe he would bleed soot like a chimney zyp was my companion during the greater part of that day and the next her manner toward me was uniformly gentle and attentive sometimes during meals i would become conscious of jasons eyes fixed upon one or other of us in a curious stare that was watchful and introspective at once as if he were summing up the voiceless arguments of counsels invisible while never losing sight of the fact that we he sat in judgment on were already convicted in his mind this for the time being did not much disturb me i was lulled to a sense of false security by the gracious championship i thought i now could rely upon it was the evening of the second day and we three were in the livingroom together jason reading at the window zyp had been so kind to me that my heart was very full indeed and now she sat by me one hand slipped into mine the other supporting her little pointed chin while her sweet flowerstained eyes communed with other it seemed than affairs of earth a strange wistful tenderness had marked her late treatment of me a pathetic solicitude that was inexpressibly touching to one so forlorn suddenly she rose and i heard jasons book rustle in his hand now little boy she said tis time you were in bed then she leaned toward me and whispered is he so unhappy what has he done for zyps sake in a moment she bent and kissed me with a soft kiss on the forehead and shooting a parthian glance of defiance at jason who never spoke or moved ran from the room all my soul thrilled with a delicious joy zyp who had refused to kiss him had kissed me the ecstasy of her lips touch blotted out all significance her words might carry halfstunned with triumphant happiness i climbed the stairs and getting into bed fell into a luminous dream of thought in which for the moment was no place for apprehension i did not even hear jason enter or shut the door and it was only when he shook me roughly by the shoulder that i became conscious of his presence in the room he was standing over me and the windows of his soul were down and through them wickedness grinned like a skull ive had enough of this he said in a terrible low voice dyou want to drive me to telling that i know it was you who killed modred chapter xi convict but not sentenced so the blow had fallen yet a single despairing effort i made to beat off or at least postpone the inevitable i sat up in bed and answered my brother back with i could feel ashen and quivering lips what do you mean i said how dare you say such a thing i dare anything he said where i have a particular object in view he never took his eyes off me and the cold devil in them froze my blood that had only now run so hotly for yourself he went on i dont care much whether you hang or live you can come to terms with your own conscience i dare say and a fat brother more or less may be a pure question of fit survival thats as it may bebut the girl here is another matter i didnt kill him i could only say dully still keeping his eyes on me he sought for and drew from his jacket pocket a twist of dry and shrunken water weed a horrible shudder seized me as i looked upon it you didnt think to see that again he said do you recognize it of course you do it was the rope you twisted round his foot and that i found round his foot still after dad had carried him upstairs bundled round with those sacks and i was left alone in the room with him a minute my heart died within me i dropped my sick strained eyes and could only listen in agonized silence and he went on quite pitilessly you shouldnt have left such evidence you knowleast of all for me to see i had not forgotten the murder in your eyes when i spoke to you that morning and the evening before he struck the weed lightly with his right hand this stuff he said i know it of coursegrows up straight enough of itself it wanted something humanor inhumanto twist it round a leg in that fashion i broke out with a choking cry i did it i said but it wasnt murderoh jason it wasnt murder as you mean it he gave a little cold laugh no doubt we have different standards of morality he said we wont split hairs say it was murder as a judge and jury would view it it wasnt will you believe me if i tell you the truth that depends upon the form it takes ill tell you it is the truthbefore god it is the truth i wont favor myself i had been mad with him i own but had nearly got over it i was out all day on the hills and thought i should like a bathe on my way home i went through the run and saw he was there at first i thought i would leave him to himself but just as i was going he saw me and a grin came over his face andjason you know that if i had gone away then he would have thought me afraid to meet him you can leave me renalt out of the question if you please i meant no harmindeed i didntbut when i got there he taunted and mocked at me i didnt know what i was doing and when he jumped for the water i followed him and twisted that round then in a single moment i saw what i had doneand was mad to unfasten it it would not come away at first and when at last i got him free and to the shore he was insensible if you could only know what i suffered then you would pity me jasonyou would you could not help it i stole a despairing look at his face and there was no atom of softness in it he came to on the way home and i was wild with joy and at night jason when you were in bed and asleep i crept into his room and begged for his forgiveness and he forgave me without any condition that wasnt like modred what did he ask for in return i was silent come he persisted what did he want you may as well tell me all you dont fancy that i believe he forgave you without getting something substantial in exchange i was to give up all claim to zyp i said in a low suffering voice jason laughed aloud oh modred he cried you were a pretty bantling upon my word who would have thought the dear fatty had such cunning in him his callous merriment struck me with a dumb horror as of sacrilege but he subdued it directly and returned to me and my misery in the same repressed tone as before well he said i have heard it all i suppose it makes little difference you know of course you are morally responsible for his death just the same as if you had stuck a knife into his heart i could only hide my face in the bedclothes writhed all through with agony there was a little spell of silence then my brother bespoke my attention with a gentle push renny do you want all this known to the others i raised my head in a sudden gust of passion do what you like i cried i know you now and you cant make it much worse oh yes he said coolly i can make it a good deal worse nobody but i knows at present dont you see i looked at him with a sudden gleam of hope dont you intend to tell jason he laughed again lightly that depends i must borrow my cue from modred and make conditions i had no need to ask what they were in whatever direction i looked now i saw nothing but a blank and deadly waste i want the girlyou understand i need not go into particulars she interests me and thats enough yes i said quietly there must be no more of that sentimental foolery between you and her i bore it as long as you were ill but now youre strong again it must stop if it doesnt you know whatll happen with that he turned abruptly on his heel and began to undress i listened for the deep breathing that announced him to be asleep with a strained fever of impatience i felt that i could not think cleanly or collectedly with that monstrous consciousness of his awake in the room perhaps in all my wretchedness the full discovery of his baseness of soul was as bitter a wound as any i had received i had so looked up to him as a superior being so sunned myself in the pride of relationship to him so lovingly submitted to his boyish patronage and condescension the grief of my discovery was very real and terrible and would in itself i think have gone far to blight my existence had no fearfuller blast descended to wither it well it was all one now whatever immunity from disaster i was to enjoy henceforth must be on sufferance only had i been older and sinfuller i might have grasped in my despair at the cowards resource of selfdestruction as it was i thought of flight by and by perhaps when vigor should return to me and with it resolution i should be able to face firmly the problem of my future and take my own destinies in hand little sleep came to me that night and that only of a haunted kind i felt haggard and old as i struggled into my clothes the next morning and all unfit to cope with the gigantic possibilities of the day jason had gone early to the fatal pool for a bathe at breakfast in the beginning zyps manner to me was prettily sympathetic and a little shy it was the first of my great misery that i must repel her on the threshold of our better understanding and see her fall away from me for lack of the least expression of that passionate devotion and gratitude that filled my heart to bursting i could see at once that she was startledhurt perhaps and that she shrunk from me immediately jason talked airily to my father all through the meal but i knew his senses to be as keenly on the alert as if he had sat in silence with his eyes fixed upon my face i choked over my bread and bacon i could not swallow more than a mouthful of the coffee in my cup and zyp sat back in her chair never addressing me after that first rebuff but pondering on me angrily with her eyes full of a sort of wonder she stopped me peremptorily as breakfast over i was hastening out with all the speed i could muster and asked me if i didnt want her company that morning no i answered i am well enough to get about by myself now very well she said then you must do without me altogether for the future she turned on her heel and i could only look after her in dumb agony then i crept down into the yard and confided my grief to the old cart wheels presently raising my head i saw her standing before me her hands under her apron her face grave with an expression half of concern half of defiance now if you please she said i want to know the meaning of this of what i asked with wretched evasiveness you knowyour manner toward me this morning i have done nothing i muttered you have insulted me sir is it because i kissed you last night oh zyp i cried aloud in great pain you know it isntyou know it isnt i couldnt help this one cry it was forced from me then whats the reason i cant give iti have none i want to be alone thats all she stood looking at me a moment in silence and the line of her mouth hardened very well she said at last then understand ive done with you i thought at first it was a mistake or that you were ill again ive been kind to you you cant say i havent given you a chance and i pitied you because you were alone and unhappy jason i will tell you hinted an evil thing of you to me but even if it was true which i didnt believe i forgave you thinking perhaps it was done for my sake well if it was i tell you now it was useless for you will be nothing to me ever again and with these cruel words she left me the proud child of the woods could brook no insult to her condescension and from my comrade she had become my enemy i suppose i should have been relieved that the inevitable rupture had occurred so swiftly and effectually judge you you poor outcasts who sanctifying a love in your tumultuous breasts have had to step aside and yield to another the fruit you so coveted once pledged to antagonism zyp it will be no matter for wonder adopted anything but halfmeasures had it only been her vanity that was hurt she would have made me pay dearly for the blow as it was her ingenuity in devising plans for my torture and discomfiture verged upon the very bounds of reason at first she contented herself with mere verbal pleasantries and disdainful snubbings as however the days went on and my old strength and health obstinately returned to me despite the irony of the shattered soul within her animosity grew to be an active agent so persistent in its methods that i verily thought my brain would give way under the load i cannot indeed recall a tithe of the pucklike devices she resorted to for my moral undoing and which after all i might have endured to the end had it not been for one threading torment that accompanied all her whimsies like a strain of diabolical music this was an ostentatious show of affection for jason which i truly believe from being more or less put on in exaggerated style for my edification became at length such a habit with her as may be considered in certain dispositions one form of love the two now were seldom apart once conscious of my presence she kissed jason on the lips because he had brought her a little flowering root of some plant she desired i saw his face fire up darkly and he looked across at me with a triumph that made me almost hate him and the worst of it was that i knew that my punishment was not more than commensurate with the offense that my sin had been grievous and its retribution not out of proportion how could full atonement and zyp have been mine together still capable of acknowledging the fitness of things in my sadder hours of loneliness my nature once restored to strength could not but strive occasionally to throw off the incubus that it felt it could not bear much longer without breaking down for good and all i had done wrong on the spur of a single wicked impulse but i was no fiend to have earned such bitter reprisal by slow degrees rebellion woke in my heart against the persistent cruelty of my two torturers had i fled at this juncture the wild scene that took place might have been averted and the exile which became mine nevertheless have borne perhaps less evil fruit than in the result it did chapter xii the denunciation one november morningmy suffering had endured all these monthsmy father and dr crackenthorpe stood before the sittingroom fire talking while i sat with a book at the table vainly trying to concentrate my attention on the printed lines since my recovery i had seen the doctor frequently but he had taken little apparent notice of me now i had racked my puzzled mind many a time for recollection of the conversation i had been witness of on the night preceding my seizure but still the details of it had eluded me though its gist remained in a certain impression of uneasiness that troubled me when i thought of it suddenly on this morning a few words of the doctors brought the whole matter vividly before me again by the bye trender he said drawlingly and sat down and began to poke the fireby the bye have you ever found that thing you accused me of losing for you on a certain nightyou know when no said my father curtly was it of any value now maybemaybe not said my father that dont seem much of answer perhaps now it came from the same place those others did thats nothing to you dr crackenthorpe well you say its lost anyhow supposing i found it would you agree to my keeping it treasuretrove you knowand he looked up with a grin balancing the poker perpendicularly in his hand treasuretrove my friend he repeated with emphasis and gave the other a keen look something in the tone of his speech woke light in my brain and i remembered at a flash i stole an anxious glance at my father his face was pale and set with anger but there was an expression in his eyes that looked like fear you dont mean to tell me you have found it he said in a forced voice oh by no means answered the doctor we havent all your good luck only you are so full of the unexpected in producing valuables from secret places like a conjurer that i thought perhaps you wouldnt mind my keeping this particular one if i should chance to pick it up keep it certainly if you can find it said my father i could have thought almost with a faint groan thanks for the permission my friend ill make a point of keeping my eyes open when did he not they were pretty observant now on zyp and jason who as he spoke walked into the room hullo said my brother goodmorning to you doctor and a sixpence to toss for your next threppenny fee hold your tongue cried my father angrily i would give a guinea to get half for attending on your inquest said the doctor sourly keep your wit for your wench my good lad and see then that she dont go begging i could give you better muttered jason cowed by my fathers presence but it shall keep and mature then he turned boisterously on me why dont you go out renny instead of moping at home all day his manner was aggressive his tone calculated to exasperate moved by discretion i rose from my chair and made for the door but he barred my way cant you answer me he said with an ugly scowl noi dont want to let me pass my father had turned his back upon us and was staring gloomily down at the fire i heard zyp give a little scornful laugh and she breathed the word coward at me i stopped as if i had struck against a wall all my blood surged back on my heart and seemed to leave my veins filled with a tingling ichor in its place perhaps i have been i said in a low voice but heres an end of it jason tittered were mighty stiltish this morning he said with a sneer what a pity its november so that we cant have a plunge for the sake of coolnessexcept that they say the pools haunted now i looked at him with blazing eyes then made another effort to get past him but he repelled me violently you dont know your place he said and gave an insolent laugh stand back till i choose to let you go i heard the doctor snigger and zyp gave a second little cluck my father was still absorbedlost in his own dark reflections the loaded reel of endurance was spinning to its end you might have given all your morning to one of your susans yonder said my brother mockingly now shes gone i expect with her apron to her eyes shell enjoy her pease pudding none the less i dare say and perhaps look out for a more accommodating clown it wont be the first time youve had to take second place i struck him full between the eyes and he went down like a polled ox all the pentup agony of months was in my blow as i stepped back in the recoil madly straining even then to beat under the more furious devil that yelled in me for release i was conscious of a hurried breath at my eara swift whisper kill him stamp on his mouth dont let him get up again and knew that it was zyp who spoke i put her back fiercely jason had sprung to his feethalfblinded halfstunned his face was inhuman with passion and was working like a madmans but before he could gather himself for a rush my father had him in his powerful arms it all happened in a moment whats all this roared my father knock under you whelp or ill strangle you in your collar let me go cried my brother look at himlook what he did he was choking and struggling to that degree that he could hardly articulate i think foam was on his lips and in his eyes the ravenous thirst for blood he struck me he panteddo you hear let me golet me kill him as he killed modred there was a moments silence dr crackenthorpe who had sat passively back in his chair during the fray with his lips set in an acrid smile made as if to rise leaning forward with quick attention then my father shook jason till he reeled and clutched at him have a mind what you say you mad cur he cried in a terrible voice its true let me go he confessed it all to meto me i say i stood up among them alone stricken and i was not afraid i was a better man than my accuser a better brother despite my sin and his dagger plunged in to destroy had only released the longaccumulating agony of my poor inflamed and swollen heart father i said let him alone it is true what he says he flung jason from him with violence move a step he thundered daring him and ill send you after modred he came to me and took me gently by the shoulder renalt my lad he said i am waiting to hear i did not falter or condone my offense or make any appeal to them whatsoever the kind touch on my arm moved me so that i could have broken into tears but my task was before me and i could afford no atom of selfindulgence did i wish to get through it bravely as i had told my story to jason i told it now and when i had finished i waited in a dead silence the verdict i could hear my brother breathing thicklyexpectantly his fury had passed in the triumph of his own abasement suddenly my father put the hand he had held on my shoulder before his face and a great sob coming from him broke down the stone walls of my pride daddad i cried in agony he recovered himself in a moment and moved away then faced round and addressed me but his eyes looked down and would not meet mine before god he said i think you are forgiven for a single impulse we all might suffer and not all of us recoil from the instant after but i think that this can be no place for you any longer then he turned upon dr crackenthorpe you he cried you man who have heard it all thanks to that dirty reptile yonder do you intend to peach the doctor pinched his wiry chin between finger and thumb with his cheeks lifted in a contemplative fashion the boy he said is safe from any ones malice no jury would convict on such evidence still i agree with you its best for him to go you hear renalt said my father ill not drive you in any way or deny you harbor here if you think you can face it out you shall judge for yourself i have judged i answered i will go i walked past them all with head erect and up to my room where i sat down for a brief space to collect my thoughts and face the future hardly had i got hold of the first end of the tangle when there came a knock at the door i opened it and zyp was outside you fool she whispered you should have done as i told you its too late now here take this dad told me to give it youand she thrust a canvas bag of money into my hand looking up at me with her unfathomable eyes as i took it suddenly she flung her arms about my neck and kissed me passionately once twice thrice on the lips and so pushed me from her and was gone and as i stood there came to my ears a faint wail from above and i said to myself doggedly it is a gull flying over the house taking nothing with me but cap stick and the simple suit of clothes i had on i descended the stairs with a firm tread and passed the open door of the sittingroom there was silence there and in silence i walked by it without a glance in its direction it held but bitter memories for me now and was scarce less haunted in its way than the other and so to me would it always behaunted by the beautiful wild memory of a changeling whose coming had wrought the great evil of my life to whom i going attributed no blame but loved her then as i had loved her from the first the booming of the wheel shook like a voice of mockery at me as i passed the room of silence its paddles i thought seemed reeling with wicked merriment and its creaking thunder to spin monotonously the burden of one chant i let you go but not to escapei let you go but not to escape the fancy haunted my mind for weeks to come in the darkness of the passage a hand seized mine and wrung it fiercely you dont mean to let the grass grow on your resolve then renalt said my fathers voice rough and subdued no dad i can do no good by delaying im sore to let you go my boy but its for the bestits for the best dont think hardly of me and be a fine lad and strike out a path for yourself god bless you dad i said and so left him as i stepped into the frosty air the cathedral bells rung out like iron on an anvil the city roofs and towers sparkled with white the sun looked through a shining mist giving earnest of gracious hours to come it was a happy omen i turned my back on the old decaying past and set my face toward london chapter xiii my friend the cripple in the year of which i now write so much of prejudice against railways still existed among many people of a pious or superstitious turn of mind that i can quote much immediate precedent in support of my resolve to walk to london rather than further tempt a providence i had already put to so severe a strain it must be borne in mind of course that we trenders were little more than barbarians of an unusual order who had been nourished on a scorn of progress and redeemed only by a natural leaning toward picturesqueness of a pagan kind moreover the sense of mystery which was an integral part of our daily experience had ingrained in us all a general antagonism toward unconstructed agencies lastly not one of us had ever as yet been in a train still it was with no feeling of inability to carve a road for myself through the barriers to existence that i drew on the evening of my third days tramp toward the overlapping pall that was the roof of the city of dreadful night i had slept on my road respectively at farnham and guildford where in either case cheap accommodation was easily procurable and foresaw a difficulty only greater in proportion in finding reasonable lodging in london during the time i was seeking work indifferently i pictured this city to myself as only an elongated high street with ramifications more numerous and extended than those of the old burgh that was my native town i was startled overwhelmed dazed with the black aimless scurrying of those interwoven strings of human ants that ran by their thronging brick heaps eager in search for what they never seemed to find or shot and vanished into tunnels and alleys of darkness or were attracted to and scorched up by apparently the broad sheets of flame that were the shop windows of their vanity fair moving amid the swarm from vision to visionalways an inconsiderable atom there without meaning or individualityalways stunned and stupefied by the threatening masses of masonry that hemmed me in and accompanied me and broke upon me in new dark forms through every vista and gap that the rank growth of ages had failed to blockthe inevitable sense grew upon me as it grows upon all who pace its interminable streets friendless of walking in a world to which i was by heavenly birthright an alien near midnight i turned into a gaunt and lonely square where comparative quiet reigned i had entered london by way of waterloo bridge as the wintry dusk was falling over house and river and all these hours since had i been pacing its crashing thoroughfares alive only to wonder and the cruel sense of personal insignificance as to a lodging and bed for my weary limbssooner had childe roland dared the dark tower than i the burrows that night of the unknown pandemonium around me i had slept in the open of the fields before now here though winter it hardly seemed that there was an outofdoors but that the buildings were only so many sleeping closets in a dark hall all round the square inside was a great inclosure encompassed by a frouzy hoarding of wood and set in the middle of the inclosure was some dim object that looked like a ruined statue such by day indeed i found it to be and of no less a person than his late majesty king george the first when my waking eyes first lighted on him i saw him to be halfsunk into his horse as if seeking to shield himself therein from the shafts of his persecutors who nothing discomposed had daubed what remained of the crippled charger himself with blotches of red and white paint i walked once or twice round the square seeking vainly at first to still the tumult of my brain the oppressive night of lockedup london laden like a thunder cloud with store of slumbering passions was lowering now and settling down like a fog the theaters were closed the streets echoing to the last footfalls seeing a hole in the hoarding i squeezed through it and withdrew into the rank grass and weeds that choked the interior of the inclosure i had bought and brought some food with me and this i fell to munching as i sat on a hummock of rubbish and was presently much comforted thereby so that nothing but sleep seemed desirable to me in all the world therefore i lay down where i was and buttoning my coat about me was despite the frosty air soon lost in delicious forgetfulness at first my slumber was broken by reason of the fitful rumble of wheels or pierced by voices and dim cries that yet resounded phantomly here and there as if i lay in some stricken city where only the dying yet lived and wailed but gradually these all passed from me i awoke with the gray of dawn on my face and sat up my limbs were cramped and stiff with the cold and a light rime lay upon my clothes otherwise no bitterer result had followed my rather untoward experiment then i looked about me and saw for the first time that i was not alone certain haggard and unclean creatures were my bedfellows in that desolate oasis they lay huddled here and there like mere scarecrows blown over by the wind and lying where they fell there were women among them and more than one pinched and tattered urchin with drawn white face resolved by sleep into nothing but pathos and starvation there they lay at intervals as if on a battlefield where the crows had been busy and each one seemed to lie flattened into the earth as dead bodies lie i could not but be thankful that i had stumbled over no one of them when i had enteredan accident which would very possibly have lost me my little store of money if it had indeed led to nothing worse as it was i prepared for a hasty exit and was about to rise when i became conscious that my movements were under observation by one who lay not twenty feet from me he was so hidden by the rank grass that at first i could make out nothing but a long largeboned face peering at me above the stems through eyes as black and glinting as boot buttons a thatch of dark hair fell about his ears and forehead and his eyebrows also black were sleek and pointed like ermine tips the face was so full and fine that i was startled when its owner rose which he did on the instant to see that he was a thickset and stunted cripple he shambled toward me with a winning smile on his lips and before i could summon resolution to retreat had come and sat down beside me we seem the cocks of this company he said in a deep musical voice among the blind the oneeyedeh he was warmly and decently clad and i could only wonder at his choice of bedroom he read me in a look ive a craving for experiences he said these arent my usual quarters no i said i suppose not nor yours he went on with a keen glance at me to give my confidence to a stranger was an unwise proceeding but i was guileless as to the craft of great cities and in this case my innocence was in a manner my good fortune i told him that i was only yesterday from the country after a three days tramp and how i was benighted ah he said up after work i suppose yes i answered well said he lets understand your capacities guess my age first forty said i at a venture for indeed he might have been that or anything else im he said dont i look it we mature early in london here what do you thinks my business oh youre a gentleman arent you i asked with some stir of shyness im a printers hand that means something very different to you dont it maybe youll develop in time where are you from i told him ah he said youve a proverb down your way manners makeyth man so they may as they construe ita fork for the fingers and a pretty trick of speech but its the manners of the soul make the gentleman do you believe in afterlife of course i do where do the ghosts come from otherwise he laughed pleasantly rubbing his chin in a perplexed manner and then i noticed that his fingers were stunted like a mechanics and stained with printers ink old ripley would fancy you he said whos he my governorprinter binder and pamphleteer an opponent of all governments but his own hes an anarchist whod like to transfer himself and his personal belongings to some desert satellite after laying a train to blow up the earth with nitroglycerin and then hed want to overturn the heavenly system he doesnt sound hopeful no he isnt but hes fairly original for a fanatic i wonder if hed give you work oh thanks i exclaimed nonsense you neednt mind him hes only gas unmixed with his native air he wouldnt be explosive you know i can imagine him a very unprogressive angel its notoriety he wants nothing satisfies his sort in the end like a scaffold outside of newgate with eyes looking on and guineas paid for a window in the magpie and stump are you i began when he took me up with his kind not a bit of it im an idealista dreamer asking the way to utopia i look about for the fingerposts in places like this one must learn and suffer to dream properly you can do that and yet have ugly enough dreams i said with subdued emphasis that oughtnt to be so he said looking curiously at me nightmare comes from selfindulgence cosset your grievances and theyll control you you must be an ascetic in the art of sensation and starve on a pillar like that old saint mr tennyson wrote of i answered go and hang yourself he cried pushing at me with a laugh hullo whos here a couple of the scarecrows evillooking men both had risen and stood over us to one side listening toff kenners i heard one of them mutter and good for jink by the looks tap the cady the other murmured and both creatures shuffled round to the front of us good for a midjick matey asked the more ruffianly looking of the two in a menacing tone i started bewildered by their jargon my companion looked up at them smiling and drumming out a tune on his knee stow it said the smaller man to the other ive tried the griffin and it dont take then he bent his body and whined in a fulsome voice overtaken with a drop good gentlemen and wont you pay a trifle for your lodgings now i was about to rise but a gesture on the part of both fellows showed me that they intended to keep us at our disadvantage a blowzed and noisome woman was advancing to join the group be alert whispered my companion we must get out of this the words were for me but the men gathered their import and assumed a threatening manner no doubt seeing but a boy and a cripple they valued us beneath our muscular worth come said the big man we dont stand on ceremony we want the price of a drink he advanced upon us as he spoke with an ugly look and in a moment my companion had seized him by the ankles and whirled him over against his friend so that the two crashed down together the woman set up a screech as we jumped to our feet and we saw wild heads start up here and there like snakes from the grass but before any one could follow us we had gained the rent in the hoarding and slipped through glancing back after i had made my exit i saw one of the men strike the woman full in the face and fell her to the ground it was his gentle corrective to her for not having stopped us and the sight made my blood so boil that i was on the point of tearing back had not my companion seized and fairly carried me off as in many cripples his strength of arm was prodigious now he said when he had quieted me well go home to breakfast where said i home my friend oh i have one you know for all my sleeping out there that was a test for experience my first one of the kind but valuable in its way but i began yes you will he cried youll be my guest ive taken a bit of a fancy to you whats your name when i had told him duke straws mine he said though im not of strawberryleaf descent but its a good name for a dreamer isnt it have you ever read feathertop by hawthorne no i said never mind then when you do youll recognize my portraita poor creature of straw that moves by smoke what smoke i asked bewildered perhaps youll find out some dayif ripley takes a fancy to you you dont want me to go to him certainly i do im going to take you with me when i tramp to work at oclock he was so cool and masterful that i could only laugh and walk on with him chapter xiv i obtain employment it was broad day when we emerged from the inclosure and sound was awakening along the wintry streets london stood before me rosy and refreshed so that she looked no longer formidably unapproachable as she had in her garb of black and many jewels i might have entered her yesterday with the proverbial halfcrown so easily was my lot to fall in accommodating places duke straw whom i was henceforth to call my friend conducted me by a township of intricate streets to the shop of a law stationer in a petty way of business which stood close by clare market and abutted on lincolns inn fields here he had a little bedroom furnished with a cheap oilcooking stove whereon he heated his coffee and grilled his bacon simon cringle the proprietor of the shop was taking his shutters down as we walked up he was a little spare man with a vanity of insignificance his irongray hair fell in short wellgreased ringlets and his thin beard in a couple more that hung loose like dangled wood shavings his coiled mustaches reminded one of watch springs his very eyebrows like bees legs were humped in the middle and twisted up into fine claws at the tips duke in his search for lodging and experience had no sooner seen this curiosity than he closed with him he gave my companion a grandiloquent goodmorning up with the lark mr straw said he and i hope sir with success in the matter of getting the first worm here he looked hard at me he found me too much of a mouthful said i so he brought me home for breakfast duke laughed come and be grilled said he anyhow they roast maltworms in a place spoken of by falstaff we had a good merry meal i should not have thought it possible my heart could have lightened so but there was a fascinating individuality about my companion that i am afraid i have but poorly suggested he gave me glimmerings of life in a higher plane than that which had been habitual to me no doubt his code of morals was eccentric and here and there faulty his manner of looking at things was however so healthy his breezy philosophy so infectious that i could not help but catch some of his complaintwhich was like that of the nightingale musical perhaps had i met him by chance six months ago my undeveloped soul would have resented his easy familiarity with a cubbish snarl or two now my receptives were awakened my armor of selfsufficiency eaten to rags with rust my heart plaintive for communion with some larger influence that would recognize and not abhor at he haled me off to the office which stood a brief distance away in a thoroughfare called great queen street here he left me awhile bidding me walk up and down and observe life until his chief should arrive which he was due to do at the halfhour i thought it a dull street after some i had seen but there were many old book and curiosity shops in it that aroused my interest while i was looking into one of them i heard duke call here he said when i reached him answer out and i think ripley will give you work im rather a favorite with himthats the truth he led me into a lowbrowed room with a counter great bales of print and paper went up to the ceiling at the back and the floor rumbled with the clank of subterranean machinery one or two clerks were about and wedged into a corner of the room was a sort of glazed and wooden crate of comfortable proportions which was in fact the chapel of ease of the minister of the place into this den duke conducted me with ceremony and retreating himself left me almost tumbling over a baldheaded man with a matted black beard on which a protruding red upper lip lay like a splash of blood who sat at a desk writing shut the door he said without looking up it is shut sir he trailed a glance at me as if in scrutiny but i soon saw he could only have been balancing some phrase for he dived again and went on writing presently he said very politely indeed and still intent on his paper are you a cadet of the noble family of kinsale sir no sir i answered in surprise you havent the right to remain covered in the presence of the king no sir well im king here what the blazes do you mean by standing in a private room with your hat on i plucked it off tingling im sorry i said mr straw brought me in so suddenly i lost my head and my cap went with it i suppose but i see its not the only thing one may lose here including tempers and with that i turned on my heel and was about to beat a retreat fuming come back shouted mr ripley if you go now you go for good i hesitated the memory of my late comrade restored my equilibrium i didnt mean to be rude sir i said i shall be grateful to you if you will give me work he had condescended to turn now and was looking full at me with frowning eyes but with no sign of anger on his face well you can speak out he said how do you come to know straw i met him by chance and we got talking together how long have you been in london since yesterday evening why did you leave winton to get work have you brought a character with you here was a question to ask a trender but i answered no i never thought of it with perfect truth what can you do anything im told sir thats a compromising statement my friend can you read and write yes of course anything else nothing nothing dont you know anything now about the habits of birds and beasts and fishes oh yes i could tell you a heap about that could you very well ill give you a trial i take you on straws recommendation his opinion i tell you i value more than a score of written characters in a case like this youve to make yourself useful in fifty different ways i assented with a light heart and he took me at my word and the further bargain was completed my wages were small at first of course but with what i had in hand they would keep me going no doubt till i could prove myself worth more to my employer in this manner i became one of ripleys hands and later on myself a pamphleteer in a small way i wrote to my father that evening and briefly acquainted him of my good fortune for some months my work was of a heterogeneous description ripley was legitimately a job printer on rather a large scale and a bookbinder to these however he added a little venturesomeness in publishing on his own account as also a considerable itch for scribbling becoming at a hint a virulent partisan in any extremist cause whatsoever it will be no matter for wonder that his private room was much the resort of levelers progressives and abolitionists of every creed and complexion there furious malcontents against systems they were the first to profit by met to talk and never to listen there fanatical propagandists eager to fly on the rudimentary wing stumps of first principles fluttered into print and came flapping to the ground at the third line there i verily believe plots were laid that would presently have leveled powers and potentates to the ground at a nod had any of the conspirators ever possessed the patience to sit on them till hatched this however they never did all their fiery periphrastics smoked off into the soot of print and in due course lumbered the office with piles of unmarketable drivel mr ripley had however other strings to his bow or he would not have prospered he did a good business in bookselling and was even now and again successful in the more conventional publishing line in this connection i chanced to be of some service to him to which circumstance i owed a considerable improvement in my position after i had been with him getting on a year he had long contemplated and at length begun to work upon a series of handbooks on british birds and insects dealt with county by county in the compilation of these much research was necessary wherein i proved myself a useful and painstaking coadjutor in addition however my own knowledge of the subject was fairly extensive as regarded hampshire which county and especially that part of it about winton is rich in lepidoptera of a rare order i may say i fairly earned the praise he bestowed upon me which was tinged perhaps with a trifle of jealousy on his part due to the fact that the section i touched proved to be undoubtedly the most popular of the series as judged subsequently by returns not to push on too fast however i must hark back to the day of my engagement which was marked by my introduction to one who eventually exercised a considerable influence over my destinies during the course of that first morning mr ripley sent me for some copies of a pamphlet that were in order of sewing down below by his direction i descended a spiral staircase of iron and found myself in the composingroom at a heavy ironsheeted table stood my newfound friend who was despite his youth the valued foreman of this department he hailed me with glee and asked what success all right thanks to you i said and where may the bookbinding place be and dolly mellison oh youre for there are you he said with i thought a rather curious look at me and he pointed to a side door passing through this i found myself in a long room flanked to the left with many machines and to the right with a row of girls who were classifying folding or sewing the sheets of print recent from the press im to ask for dolly mellison i said addressing the girl at my end of the row well you wont have far to go she said im her she was a pretty slim lily of a thing lithe and pale with large gray eyes and coiled hair like a rope of sunburned barleystraw and her fingers petted her task as if that were so much hattrimming im sent by mr ripley for copies of a pamphlet on the supineness of theologicians i said im at work on it she answered wait a bit till ive finished the dozen she glanced at me now and again without pausing in her work youre from the country arent you yes how do you know a little bird told me what gave you those red cheeks the sight of you i said i was growing up im nothing to be ashamed of am i she asked with a pert laugh you ought to be of yourself i said for taking my heart by storm in that fashion go along she cried with a jerk of her elbow none of your gammon im not to be caught by chaff it wasnt chaff dolly though i may be a man of straw is that what you meant youre pretty free upon my word who told you you might call me by my name why you wouldnt have me call you by any one elses its pretty enough even for you oh go away with you she cried i wont listen at that moment duke put his head in at the door the governors calling for you he said hurry up well theyre ready said the girlhere and she thrust the packet into my hands with a little blushing halfimpudent look at me i forgot all about her in a few minutes my heart was too full of one only other girlish figure to find room in itself for a rival what was zyp doing nowthe wonderful fairy child whose phantom presence haunted all my dreams for good and evil as i walked from the office with duke straw that afternoonfor as it was saturday we left earlya silence fell between us till we neared cringles shop then standing outside he suddenly stayed me and looked in my face shall i hate or love you he said with his mouth set grimly he made a gesture toward his deformed lower limbs with his hands and shrugged his shoulders no he said what must be must ill love you there was a curious defiant sadness in his tone but it was gone directly i could only stare at him in wonder youre to be my housefellow and chum he said no dont protest ive settled it well arrange the rest with cringle and so i slept in a bed in london for the first time but the noise of a water wheel roared in my ears all night chapter xv sweet poor dolly trender said duke unexpectedly after a silence the next morning as we loitered over breakfast pay attention to one thing i dont ask you for a fragment of your past history and dont want to hear anything about it youll say as yet you havent offered me your confidence and quite right too on the top of our short acquaintance but dont ever offer it to me you understand our friendship starts from sunrise morning by morning and lasts the day i dont mean it shall be the less true for that i have a theory thats all what is it straw sufficient for the day its called providence has elected to give us not one existence but so many or few each linked to the next by an insensibility and intercalated as a whole between appropriate limits i dont quite understand wait a bit each of these existences has its birth and death and should be judged apart from the others each is pronounced upon in succession by ones familiar spirit and its minutes pigeonholed and docketed above there when the chain of evidence for or against is complete up these links are gathered in a heap and weighed in both sides of the balance it sounds more plausible than it is i think said i with frank discourtesy the acts of one day may influence those of the nextor interminably thats your lookout but they neednt necessarily with each new birth comes a new capacity for looking at things in their right proportions how far do you push your theory as far as you like id have all the world over a daily revival of systems governmentlaw certainly of everything then justice injustice vindictiveness must all revive too no theyre recalled they dont revive but must a criminal for instance be allowed to escape because they have failed to catch him the day he did the deed thats exactly it it makes no difference he couldnt atone here for an act committed by him during another existence but that particular minute goes pretty red into its pigeonhole you may be sure oh its wild nonsense i laughed you cant possibly be consistent cant i look here you are my friend yesterday and today and always i hope i judge you daily on your merits yet for all i know you may have committed murder in one of your past existences the blood went back upon my heart then a great longing awoke in me to tell all to this selfreliant soul and gain comfort of my sorrow but where was the good in the broad face of his theory well i said with a sigh ive done things at least i bitterly repent of thats the conventional way of looking at it repentance in this wont avail a former existence past days of mine have had their troubles no doubt but this day i have before me unclouded and to do what i like with well what shall we do with it said i i hand it over to you to make it a happiness for me i dare say we shall find plenty of sorrows between sunrise and evening to give it a melancholy charm rubbish cried my friend cant cant cant ever to suppose that sorrow is necessary to happiness we mortals i tell you have an infinite capacity for delight given health spiritual and bodily we could dance in the sunbeams for eternity and never reach a surfeit of pleasure duke said imay i call you duke of course it puzzles me where you goti dont mean offenseonly i cant help wondering how i came to have original thoughts and a grammatical manner of speech look here he held up his stained fingersarent these the hands of a man of letters and a man of action i said with a laugh but its no use renny i cant look further back than this morning you can recall you know you dont deny each existence that capacity perhaps i could but to what advantage to shovel up a whole graveyard of sleeping remembrances to find the seed of one dead nettle that thrusts its head through no thank you besides if it comes to that i might put the same question to you oh i can easily answer it i get all my way of speaking from my father first and secondly because i love books he looked at me oddly youre a modest chicken he said but i should like to meet your father i could not echo his wish still he went on i will tell you there was a little inexperience of mankind in your wonder i thinki dont refer to myself of coursethat no man in the world is more interesting to talk with than the skilled mechanic who has an individuality and a power of expressing it in words he is necessarily a man of cultivation and an h more or less in his vocabulary is purely an accident of his surroundings at this moment mr cringle tapped at the door and walked into the room i hope i see you robust gentlemen and how do you like this village of ours mr trender its dirty after winton said i ah he said condescendingly the centers of such enormous forces must naturally rise some dust its a proud thing sir to contribit ones peck to the total i feel it in my little corner here why said i you surprise me mr cringle im only an ignorant country lad of course but it seems to me you are quite a remarkable figure he gave an extra twist to his mustache and sniggered comfortably well he said it is not for me to contradict youeh mr straw certainly not said duke why you are famous for your deeds very good mr straw and perhaps as you kindly mean it in the double sense you mightnt think it but it wants some knowledge of the laws mazes to turn a rough draft into a holdfast agreement or indenture and you can do that i flatter myself mr trender that itll want a microscoptic eye to find flaws in my phraseology he thrust back his head and expanded his chest but im overlooking my errand said he the young lady as has called before mr straw rung me down just now for a message to you oh what was it she wanted to know if you was game for a walk and shed be waiting under the market till half after nine very well and mr cringle took himself off its dolly mellison said duke to me we often go for a sunday tramp together well dont stop for me if you want to go well both gowhy not oh not for anything fancy my intruding myself on her ill answer shell not object said my companion and again i was half conscious of something unusual in his tone but you might said i not a bit of it why should i were not betrothed you know he answered with a laugh and pointed or seemed to point at his twisted lower limbs you wouldnt believe me would you if i told you she expects you he added oh very well said i if you put it in that way we found dolly standing under the piazza of covent garden market she made no movement toward us until we were close upon her and then she greeted us with a shy wriggle and a little blush she was very daintily dressed with a fur tippet about her throat and looked as pretty as a young hebe oh she said i didnt suppose you would come too mr trender there i cried to duke with perfect good nature i told you i should be in the way nonsense he said miss mellison didnt mean it like that did you dolly didnt i you see how he answers for me mr trender and she turned half from him with a rosy pout come i cried gayly ill risk it i do not believe youve the heart to be cruel miss mellison thank you for the surname and also for telling me im heartless you cant be that as long as mine goes abegging i said impudently she peeped up at me roguishly from under her long lashes and shook her head come said duke impatiently what are we going to do dont lets stand chattering here all day ill tell you i cried in a sudden reckless flush of extravagance arent there pretty places on the thames one can get to from here oh plenty said duke dryly if one goes by train then lets go and make a pleasant water party of it he shook his head with a set of the lips those are rare treats he said our sort cant afford such jinks except after a deal of saving i dont want you to said i its my business and youre to come as my guests oh nonsense he said sharply we cant do that please speak for yourself mr straw said dolly i had noticed her eyes shine at the mere prospect if mr trender is so kind as to offer and can afford it im sure i for one dont intend to disappoint him can he afford it said duke doggedly i shouldnt propose it if i couldnt said i very much on the high horse of course you wouldnt said dolly i wonder at you mr straw for being so insulting very well said duke i meant it for the best but lets be off im for a shallop in arcady with pleasure in a porkpie hat its very pretty dolly at the helm we went down to richmond by train and dukegood fellow that he wasmade a merry company of us if he felt any soreness over his rebuff he hid it out of sight most effectually it was early in novembera beautiful sparkling morning and the river bore a fairish sprinkling of pleasure craft on its silvery stretches we were neither of us great oarsmen and at first made but poor way owing to a tendency duke of the iron sinews showed to pulling me completely round but presently we got into a more presentable swing and forereached even upon a skiff or two whose occupants had treated us to some goodhumored chaff upon our starting woa cried duke this pulling is harder than pulling proofs renny lets stop by the bank and rest a bit we ran the boats nose aground fastened her painter to a stump and settled down for a talk enjoying yourself dolly asked duke mopping his forehead yes of coursethanks to mr trender this is a fine variety on our walks isnt it oh theyre jolly enough when youre in a good temper am i not always oh i dont know sometimes you say things i dont understand see there renny cried duke if i express myself badly she calls me cross it isnt that said the girl i know im ignorant and youre clever but you seem to read me and then say things out of yourself that have nothing to do with mejust as if i was a book and you awhat do they call itcricket or something we both laughed aloud oh dolly said duke what pretty imp taught you satire are you a book to mr trender oh no he talks what i can understand better and better but take comfort renny youre downed in sweet company hush said dolly its sunday she dabbled her slender hand in the water and drew it out quickly oh she cried its cold i hope we shant be upset can you swim mr trender yes like a duck thats a comfort if i fall in mr straw here cant im built topheavy said duke but id try to save you dolly the girls eyes shone with a momentary remorseful pity i know you would she said softly you arent one to think about yourself duke how i wish i could swim i dont believe there can be anything in the world like getting that medal they give you for saving people from drowning have you ever saved any one mr trender oh gentle hand to deal so cruel a stroke for a moment my smoldering sense of guilt flamed up bloodred no no i said with a forced laugh im not like duke i do think of myself im afraid we lapsed into silence out of which came dollys voice presently murmuring a queer little doggerel song that seemed apt to her childish nature who owns that house on yonder hill said the false black knight to the pretty little child on the road its my fathers and mine said the pretty little child scarce seven years old will you let me in said the false black knight to the pretty little child on the road oh no not a step said the pretty little child scarce seven years old then i wish you deaf and dumb said the false black knight to the pretty little child on the road and i wish you the same with a blister on your tongue said the pretty little child scarce seven years old where on earth did you learn that said duke with a laugh as dolly ceased her eyes dreaming out upon the shining river i dont know mother used to sing it i think when i was a little girl we must question her said i mothers dead said dolly i could have bitten out my tongue duke again exerted himself to put matters on a comfortable footing dolly and i are both orphans said he babes in old ripleys wood and i am the remorseless ruffian i broke in all right you didnt know of course look at that girl on the bank with the crinoline she might be riding a hobbyhorse aint she a beauty said dolly enviously her own subscribing to the outrageous fashion then fortunately in its decay was limited to her slender means and the necessities of her work you dont mean to say you admire her said i dont i mr trender just as shed admire me if i was dressed like that heaven forbid dolly i wont call you dolly if you call me mr trender wont you now upon my word youve got the impudence of twenty look here said duke im for paddling on i dont know your views as to dinner mr renalt but mine are getting pretty vociferous my idea is to pull on till we sight a likely place mr duke straw we rowed up past kingston a cockney town we all fought shy of and on by grassy reaches as far as hampton bridge where we disembarked here was a pleasant waterside inn with a lawn sloping down to the embankment and sitting in its long coffeeroom we made a hearty dinner and a merry company dolly was flushed and happy as a young naiad when we returned to our boat and she rippled with laughter and sweetness chapter xvi a fateful accident we loitered on the river till the short day was threatening dusk and then we were still no further on our homeward way than a halfmile short of kingston a little cold wind moreover was beginning to whine and scratch over the surface of the water and dolly pulled her tippet closer about her bosom feeling chilled and inclined to silence come said duke we must put our shoulders to it or we shant get into the lock before dark oh cried the girl with a halfwhimper i had forgotten that horrible lock with its hideous weedy doors must we go through it im afraid so said duke but he added cheerily dont you be nervous well run you down and through before you have time to count a hundredif you count slowly she sunk back in her seat with a frightened look and grasped the rudder lines as if by them only could she hold on to safety the dusk dropped about us as we pulled on strain as we might and presently we both started upon hearing a strangled sob break from the girl oh said duke pausing for a moment this will never do dolly why you cant be afraid with two such knights to protect you i cant help it said the poor child fairly crying now you dont know anything about the river either of you andand maynt i get out and walk very well one of us will go with you while the other pulls the boat down only we must get across first steady now renny and cheer up doll and put her nose to the shore opposite we had drifted some little distance since we first easyd and a dull booming that was in our ears at the time had increased to a considerable roar give way cried duke turn her dolly the girl tugged at the right line gave a gasp dropped everything scrambled to her feet and screamed in a dreadful voice we are going over the weir sit down shouted duke pull renny like a madman he shipped his oar forced the girl into a sitting posture and clutched the inner line all in a moment his promptitude saved us i fought at the water with my teeth set the boats nose plunged into the bank with a shock that sent us two sprawling and the boats stern swung round dizzily but before she could cast adrift again i was on my knees and had seized at a projecting root with a grasp like quasimodos hold on cried duke till i come to you its all right dolly youre quite safe now he crawled to me and grasped the root in his more powerful hands now he said you take the painter and get out and drag us higher out of the pull of the water ill help you the best i can i complied and presently the boat was drawn to a point so far above as to leave a wide margin for safety we took our seats to pull across with a look at one another of conscious guilt dolly sat quite silent and pale though she shivered a little we didnt know the river and thats a fact whispered duke to me of course we ought to have remembered the locks the other side we pulled straight across then duke said heres the shore dolly now you and trender get out and ill take the boat on by yourself no i wont i feel safe with you very well he answered gently well all go on together theres really no danger now we know what were about she cried no duke in a poor little quaking voice we pulled into the lock cutting without further mishap though the girl shrunk and blenched as we slid past at a safe distance the oblique comb of the weir it was some minutes before the lockkeeper answered to our ringing calls and then the sluices had to be raised and the lock filled from our side the clash and thunder of the hidden water as it fell into the pit below sounded dismal enough in the darkness and must i knew be dinning fresh terror into the heart of our already stricken naiad but the hollow noise died off in due course the creaking gate lumbered open and we floated with a sigh of relief into the weltering pool beyond the sluices rattled down behind us the keeper walked round to the further gate and his figure appeared standing out against the sky toiling with bent back at the levers suddenly i who had been pulling bow felt myself tilting over in a curious manner hullo i cried whats up with the boat in one moment i heard a loud shout come from the man at the gates and saw dolly despite her warning stand hurriedly up and duke make a wild clutch at her the next the skiff reeled under me and i was spun kicking and struggling into the water an accident common enough and bad enough to those who know little of thames craft had befallen us we had got the boats stern jammed upon a side beam of the lock so that her nose only dropped with the sinking water i rose at once in a black swirl the skiff jerked free by our unceremonious exit floated unharmed in the lock but she floated empty risen to the surface however almost with me dukes dark head emerged close by her so that with one frantic leap upward he was able to reach her thwarts to which he clung dolly he gaspeddolly i had seen her before he could cry out again had seized and was struggling with her dont hold me i cried let me go dolly and ill save you she was quite beyond reason deaf to anything but the despairing call of life in another instant i knew we should both go under and be dragged into the rush of the sluices seeing the uselessness of trying to unclasp her hands i fought to throw myself and her toward the side of the lock nearest the water was bubbling in my mouth when i felt a great iron hook whipped into the collar of my coat and we were both hauled to the side hold on there mate cried the lockkeeper while i get your boat under i had caught at a dangling loop of chain but even so the weight of my almost senseless burden threatened to drag me down be quick i gasped im pretty near spent with the same grapnel he caught and towed the boat duke still hanging to it to where i clung and leaped down himself into it now he said get a leg over and youre right it was a struggle even then for dolly would not let me out of her agonized clutchnot till we could lay her white as a stormbeaten lily on the bottom boards then we turned and seized duke over the thwarts and he tumbled in and lay in a heap quite exhausted his mind relieved our preserver took off his cap scratched his forehead and spat into the water ive known a many wanting your luck he said gruffly what made you do it now judging our ignorance to be by no means common property i said ah what in the tone that suggests acquiescence or wonder and asked him if he had a fire handy theres a bright one burning inside he said youre welcome to it he punted the boat to a shallow flight of steps oozy with slime that led to the bank above where his cottage was well carry the gal to it said he see if she can move herself i bent down over the prostrate figure it looked curiously youthful and slender in its soaked and clinging garments dolly i whispered theres a fire above will you let me carry you to it i thought my voice might not penetrate to her dulled senses but to my wonder she put her arms round my neck immediately yes she moaned im so cold take me to the warmth or i shall die we lifted her out between us and carried her into the house kitchen there a goodly blaze went coiling up the chimney and the sight was reviving in itself shall we leave you here alone a bit said i to rest and recover theres to be no more of the river for us well walk the distance that remains she gave me a quick glance full of a pathetic gratitude and whispered yes id better be alone and if you take my advice said our host youll strip off them drownded petticuts and wrap yourself in a blanket ill bring you while theyre adrying wait while i fetch it as he went out dolly beckoned me quickly to her i heard you tell me to leave go she said hurriedly in a low voice but i couldntrenny i couldnt and you saved my life her lips were trembling and her eyes full of tears she clasped her hands and held them entreatingly toward me a gust of some strange feelingsome yearning sense of protection toward this pretty lovable childflooded my heart you poor little thing i whispered in a pitying voice and taking her two hands in one of mine i passed my other arm around her then she lifted her face eagerly and i bent and softly dropped a kiss on her warm wet lips the moment i had done it i felt the shame of my action there dear forgive me i said like you dolly i couldnt let go at once and our friend returning just then with the blanket we left the girl to herself and stepped outside a queer exultant feeling was on mea sense as of the lightening of some overburdening oppression a life for a life why should the words ring stilly triumphantly in my brain i might earn for my breast a cuirass of medals such as dolly had desired and what would their weight be as set in the scale against the one existence i had terminated perhaps it was not that perhaps it was that i felt myself for the first time in close touch with a yearning human sympathy that its tender neighborhood taught me at a breath to respect and stand by what was noble in myself the shadow that must of course remain with me always i would not have away but would only that it ceased to dominate my souls birthright of independence there was in my heart no love for dollyno passion of that affinity that draws atom to atom in the destiny that is human there was only the pitying protective sense that came to man through the angels and in its sensual surrender marked their fall from divinity for to the end without one thought of wavering zyp must shine the mirage of my barren waste of love suddenly i remembered with a remorseful pang that all this time i had forgotten duke i hurried down to the steps calling him he was sitting in the boat his elbows on his knees his face buried in his hands duke i cried come out and lets see what we can do for a dry youll get the frost in your lungs sitting there he rose at once staggering a little i had to run down the steps to help him ashore where he stood shaken all through with violent shiverings whisky said our host laconically watchful of the poor fellow and enough of it to make your hair curl between us we got him into the house where he was made to swallow at a gulp three fingerbreadths in a tumbler of the raw spirit then after a time the color came back to his cheeks the restored nerves to his limbs at that our kindly host made us strip and providing us with what coverings he could produce set us and our soaked belongings before a second fire in his little parlor and only left us when summoned outside to his business as the door closed behind him duke turned to me a sort of patient sorrow was on his facean expression as of renunciation of some favored child of his fancyi cannot express it better you carried her in he said quietly dolly yes where is she baking before the kitchen fire shell be ready before we are welli had no right what a chapter of mishaps then he turned upon me with a sudden clap of fierceness why did you ever propose this trip i tried to dissuade you and you might have known i was an idiot on the water my good duke i answered with a coolness that covered a fine glow of heat that dont sound very gracious i meant it for a pleasure party of course accidents arent matters under human control you know he struck his knee savagely no he muttered or i shouldnt have these then in a moment the sweetness came back to his face and he cried with a smile halfhumorous and all pathetic heres the value of my philosophy im no more consistent than a ripley pamphlet and not a quarter so amusing butoh if i had only learned to swim chapter xvii a touching revelation for nearly four years did i work persistently striving to redeem my past at the offices in great queen street at this period my position was greatly improved my services estimated at a value that was as honorable to my employer as it was advantageous to me i had grown to be fairly at peace with myself and more hopeful for the future than i had once deemed it possible that i could ever be not all so however the phantom light that had danced before my youthful eyes danced before them still no whit subdued in brilliancy with the change to wider and manlier sentiments that i was conscious of in my own development i fostered secret hope of a similar growth in zyp at i thought she could hardly remain the irresponsible bewitching changeling she had been at womanliness must have blossomed in her and with it a sense of the right relationship of soul to body perhaps even the glamour of mystery that must surround my manner of life had operated as a growing charm with her and had made me in her eyes something of the fascinating figure she always was and would be in mine sometimes now in thinking of him i had fear of jason but more often not zyps parting words to methat were ever in my earsseemed weighted with the meaning at least that had i fought my battle well i should have won to think of itto recall italways gave me a strange troubled comfort in my best moments it returned upon me cryingcrying the assurance that no selfish suit pressed by my brother could ever prevail over the inwarder preference her heart knew for me in my worst it did no more than trouble me with a teasing mock at my human passion so persistent in its faith to a willothewisp i think that all this time i never dared to put bravely to myself the thoughtas much part of my being as my eyesightthat not for one true moment had i yielded my hope of zyp to circumstances all my diligence all my labor all my ambition were directed to this solitary endthat some day i might lay them at her feet as bribes to her favor therefore till selfconvinced of their finished worthiness i toiled on with dogged perseverance studying observing perfecting denying myself much rest and pleasure till my heart should assure me that the moment was come and what of them at the old haunted mill news was rare and scanty yet at intervals it came to link me with their destinies the first year of my banishment my father wrote to me three timesshort rugged notes void of information and negatively satisfactory only in the sense that had anything of importance taken place he would i concluded have acquainted me of it these little letters were answered by me in epistles of ample length wherein i touched upon my manner of life and the nature of my successes the second year however the desultory correspondence was taken up by jason who wrote as he talked in a spirit of boisterous banter and under cover of familiar gossip told me less if possible than my father had dad he said in his first had tired of the effort and had handed the task over to him therefore he acquitted himself of it in long leaps over gaps that covered months and it was now more than four or five since i had received any sort of communication from him this did not greatly trouble me there was that between us which it always seemed to me he sought to give expression to in his lettersa hint secretly conveyed that i must never forget i lived and prospered on sufferance only now my own knowledge of the methods of justice no less than the words dr crackenthorpe had once applied to my case had long been sufficient to assure me that i had little or nothing to fear from the processes of the law no less peremptory however was the conviction that jason had it in his power to socially ruin me at a word and the longer that word was delayedthat is to say so long as my immunity did not clash with his intereststhe better chance i had of testing and retesting my armor of defense yet for all my care he found out a weak place presently in the meantime i lived my life such as it was and found a certain manner of pleasure in it duke and i still good friends changed our lodgings toward the last quarter of the fourth year and moved into more commodious ones over an ironmongers shop in holborn here we had a sittingroom as well as a bedroom common to both of us and tasted the joys of independence with a double zest since our river experience it had become a usual thing for me to join my friend and dolly in their frequent sunday walks together this at first i deprecated but duke would have it so and finally it lapsed into an institution indeed upon many occasions i was left to escort the girl alone duke pleading disinclination or the counterattraction of some book he professed to be absorbed in was i quite so blind as i appeared to be i can hardly say myself that the other entertained a most affectionate regard for the girl was patent he was always to me however such a quaint medley of philosophical resignation and human susceptibility that i truly believe i was more than half inclined to doubt the existence in him of any strong bias toward the attractions of the other sex his behavior to dolly was generally much more that of an elder brother toward a much younger halfsister born into the next generation than of a lover who seeks no greater favor from a woman than that she shall keep the best secrets of her womanhood for him he petted indulged and playfully analyzed her all in one now thinking of him in the stern knowledge of years i often marvel over the bitter incapacity of the other sex to choose aright the fathers of its children how could the frailest prettiest soul among them turn from such luminous depths as his to the meretricious foppery of emptier parises but then i was greatly to blame the winning ways of the girl no less than dukes persistent deprecation of any affectation of proprietorship in her are my one excuse a poor one even then for how may i cry out on simplehearted dolly when i failed to read the little history of sorrow that was daily before my eyes it was after events only that interpreted to me the pride that would not let the cripple kneel a suitor to pity as to my own feelings toward the pretty soul i had once so basely linked to my own with an impulsive kissthey were a compound of indulgence and a tenderness that fell altogether short of love i desired to be on brotherly terms of intimacy with her indeed but only in such manner as to preclude thought of any closer tie when she was shy with me upon our first meeting after that untoward contact in the lockhouse i laughed her into playfulness and would have no sentimental glamour attaching to our bond of sympathy alas i was to learn how reckless a thing it is to seek to extinguish with laughter the fire of a womans heart one sunday afternoon in the early autumn of that fourth year dolly and i were loitering together about the slopes and byways of epping forest there is no season more attuned to the pathetic sympathies of young hearts than that in which the quiet relaxing of green life from its hold on existence speaks only to grayer breasts of premature decay and the vulgar ceremonial of the grave youth however recognizes none of this morbid aspect to it the yellowing leaf if it speaks of desolation speaks from that passion of the past the poets strove to explore it stands but twothirds of the way up to the hill of years and flowering stretches are beneath it to the rear and above before its eyes the fathomless sky and the great clouds nozzling the mountain crests like flocks of sheep all that afternoon as we wandered we came across lizards sprawling stupefiedas they will in octoberon buskets of gorse too exhausted apparently to feel the prick of thorn or fear and butterflies sitting on blades of grass with folded wings motionless as those that are wired to bonnets the air was full of a damp refreshing sweetness and the long grass about every bush and hedge side began to stir with the movement of secret things as though preparations for mystic revel were toward and invitations passing i could almost see the fairy rings forming noiseless on the turf when the lonely moon should hang her lantern out by and by chapter xviii a voice from the crowd dolly had been unusually silent during the afternoon and now as we turned to retrace our steps in the direction of the station from which we were to take train for london she walked beside me without uttering a word suddenly however she put her hand upon my arm and stayed me renny she said will you stop a little while i want to speak to you all right i said speak away not herenot here come off the path theres a seat out there seeing with surprise that her face was pale and drawn with nervousness and fancying our tramp might have overtired her i led her to the place she indicateda bench set in the deep shadow of a chestnut treeand we both sat down now doll i said gayly whats the tremendous confidence renny she said quietly william reid has asked me to marry him no william reidthe young fellow over at hansards well i can only tell you dolly that i know nothing but whats good of him for a steady and promising chap whos sure to make as fine a husband as he is a workman do you advise me to take him then do you want me to you might do much worseindeed you might dolly why to my knowledge hes drawing a week already of course i shall be very very sorry to lose my little chum and companion but i always foresaw that this would have to be the end of our comradeship some day she sat looking at the ground a little while and adjusting a fallen twig with the point of her parasol then she rose and said in the same quiet tone very well and moved a step away i rose also and was about to resume the subject when in a moment to my horror she threw herself back on the bench and flinging her hands up to her face burst into a passion of tears i was so startled and shocked that for the instant i could think of nothing to do or say then i bent down and cried dolly what is it whats the matter have i hurt you in any way she struggled with her sobs but made a brave effort to command herself oh dont look dont listen i shall be all right in a minute i moved away a little space and stood anxiously waiting when i turned again her face was still buried in her arm but the keenness of the outburst was subdued i approached and leaned over her tenderly putting a kind hand on her shoulder now little woman i said wont you tell me what it is i might comfort and counsel you at least dolly dear she answered so low that i had to stoop further to hear her i only thought perhapsperhaps you might care more and not want me to what a simple little sentence yet how fierce a vision it sprung upon my blindness i rose and stepped back almost with a cry then dolly sat up and saw my face renny she cried i never meant to tell onlyonly i am so miserable i went to her and took her hand and helped her to her feet dolly i said in a low hoarse voice i have been a selfish brute i never thought what i was doing when i should have thought now you must give me time to think you didnt know rennyher pretty eyes were struggling with tears again and her poor face looked up into mine entreating me not to take base advantage of her surrenderif i kissed you as you kissed me once do you think it would come it isnt right for us to try dear thank heaven my manhood stood the testthe inference so pathetic in its childish simplicity come i said we will go back now i want time to think it all over by myself you mustnt refer to it again dolly in any waynot till i can see you by and by alone she said yes renny humbly her very manner toward me was marked by a touching obedience we caught our train and sped back to london in a crowded compartment so that the present embarrassment of teteatete was spared us at the terminus we parted gently and gravely on both sides and went each of us home duke was in bed when i reached our lodgings and for that i was grateful for i felt far too upset and confused to relish the idea of a talk with him indeed since the moment dolly had confessed to me he had hung strangely in the background of my thoughts i felt a comfortless dawning of apprehension that all along he had been keen witness of the silent little drama in which unconsciously i was an actorhad sat in the pit and sorrowfully gauged the purport of the part i played i went to bed but never to sleep all night long i tossed struggling to unravel the disorder in my brain i could think out nothing collectivelywarp and woof were inextricably confused at length in despair i rose redressed and went outside the church clocks clanged six as i stepped onto the pavement there was a freshblown coolness in the dusky air the streets stretched emptily to the dawn in the very contact with space the tumult in my head settled down into some manner of order and i was able to face after a fashion the problem before me here to one side would i place zyp to the other dolly let me plead to each counseled by heart and conscience to zyp you have and have ever had that of mine to which i can give no name but which men call love as an expression of what is inexpressible i know that this gift this sixth sense that like the soul embraces all the others once acquired is indestructible for joy or evil i am doomed to it spiritually to profit or be debased by it you may scorn but you cannot kill it and exiled in material form from you here it will make to you in the hereafter as surely as a stone flung from a crater returns to the earth of which it is kin say that the accidents of existence are to keep us here apart that your heart desires to mate with another more picturesque than mine it may be so during these long four years you have never once directly by word or sign given proof that my being holds any interest for you you banished me i must remember for all my efforts to torture hope out of them with words designed to be final what if i accept the sentence and say i yield my material form to one who desires its affections who will be made most happy by the bestowal of them upon her who yearns to me perhaps as i to you i may do so and none the less be sure of you some day to dolly i have done you a bitter wrong but one i think not irremediable perhaps i never thought but that friendship apart from love was possible between man and woman in any case i have given far too much consideration to myself and far too little to you you love me by your own confession and in this world of bitter troubles it is very sweet to be loved and loved by such as you i am pledged it seems to a hopeless quest what if i give it up what if we taste joy in this worldthe joy of a partnership that is graced by strong affection and cemented by a respect that shall be mutual i can atone for my error to you here my wilder love that is not to be controlled by moral reasoning i consign to futurity thinking these thoughts a picture rose before me of a restful haven wherein my stormbeaten life might rock at anchor to the end of dolly as my wife in all the fascination of her pretty winning personalityher love her playfulness her wistful eyes and rosy mouth so responsive to laughter or tears i felt very tender toward the child who was glorified into woman by her very succumbing to the passion she had so long concealed why should i struggle any longer i cried in my heart when an earthly paradise opens its gates to me when selfsacrifice means peace and content and to indulge my imagination means misery it was broad daylight by the time i had touched some clew to the problem that so bewildered me and suddenly i became aware that i was moving in the midst of a great press of people they were all going in one direction and were generally of the lowest and most degraded classes in london there was a boisterous and unclean mirth rampant among them there was a ravenous eagerness of haste too that one seemed to associate instinctively with the hideous form of vampire that crouches over fields of slain and often completes what the bullet has but half done women were among them in numbers some carrying infants in their gaunt ragged arms some plumed and decked as if for a gala sight i was weary with thought weary with the monotony of introspection evidently there was some excitement toward and to follow it up would take me out of myself toiling up ludgate hill we went an army of tramping feet then like a sewer diverted we wheeled and poured into the noisome alley of the old bailey in a moment the truth burst upon me with a shock there was a man to be hanged that morning i twisted hurriedly about and strove to force my way out again i might as easily have stayed the thames with a finger i was beaten back with oaths and coarse ribaldrygathered up and carried ruthlessly in the rush for placehemmed in planted like a maggot in one great trunk of bestial and frouzy human flesh had i striven again i should have been smashed and pounded underfoot all semblance of life stamped from me i looked about me in agony before and around was one huge sea of faces from the level of which rose a jangling patter of talk and cries like bubbles bursting on the surface of a seething tank of corruption and under the grim shadow of newgate there stood in full view a hideous machine barriers were about it and a spruce cordon of officials who stood out humanly in that garden of squalid refuse it was black with a black crossbeam and from the beam a loop hung motionless like a collar for death to grin through and the crowd were already betting on the expression of his face when he should first see it i do not know how long or short a time my anguish lasted it may have been half an hour when the deep tolling of a bell wrought sudden silence in the fetid air at its first stroke the roar of voices went off and lessened rolling like a peal of thunder at its third the quiet of eternity had fallen and consumed the world a mist came before my eyes when it cleared i was aware of a little group on the platform and one with a ghastly white face the center of it who is it i whispered in intolerable agony curse you growled my next neighbor cant you hold your tongue and let a cove look a word marred the full relish of his appetite i managed to slew my head away from the direct line of vision a low babble of voices came from the scaffold he must be reprieved i thought with a leap of the heart i could not conceive voices sounding natural otherwise under such fearful circumstances suddenly as i was on the point of looking once more to ease my horrible tension of mind there dropped upon my ears a low rumbling flap and immediately a hoarse murmur went up from the multitude then giving a cry myself i turned my face the rope hung down in a straight line but loop and man were gone from the universal murmur by claps and starts the old uproar bubbled forth from the faces till the pentup street resounded with it an afterdinner loquacity was on all and the fellow who had cursed me a minute ago addressed me now with overbrimming geniality of information whos him says you why wheres your wits gone matey him was muller the greasy furriner as murdered old briggs the trial had made sensation enough of late but the date of the poor wretchs execution i had had no thought of when at last i could force a passage through the pressfor they lingered like ghouls over the crumbs of the banqueti broke into holborn with my whole soul panting and crying for fresh air and forgetfulness it was hideous it was inhuman it was debasing i cried to myself to launch that quivering mass of terror into eternity in a public shambles to such as came to see it must be grossly demoralizing to those who like me were enforced spectators it was a sickening experience that must leave an impression of morbidity almost indelible suddenly i felt a hand grasp my shoulder and a voice exclaim renny by all the saints i turnedand it was jason he held me at arms length and cried again renny reallyand a true sportsman as of old then he leaned to me and whispered with a grin i say old fellow if it wasnt for luck you might be any day where he stood just now chapter xix a menace at first i hardly grasped the import of my brothers words or the fact that here was the old fateful destiny upon me again so lost were the few faculties i could command in wonder at his unexpected appearance in london i stared and stared and had not a word to say wheres your tongue old chap he cried this is an affectionate greeting on your part upon my word and after near four years too i pressed my hand across my forehead and strove to smooth the confusion therefrom you must forgive me i said at length this sudden meeting has driven me all abroad and then i got stuck down there by mistake and the sight has halfturned my brain i think by mistake was it he said with a mocking titter oh renny dont i know youthough your looks are changed too for the matter of that more than mine are i expect i could well believe soul and manhood must have wrought new expression in me but for jason he was the jason of oldfuller more set and powerful yet the same beautiful personality with the uninterpretable eyes well he said arent you surprised to see me surprise isnt the word nor pleasure either i expect no i should be a liar to say it was well you used to be that you know though i dare say youve found out the better policy now at any rate as youre here youll come home with me wont you of course thats what i intend ive been in london three or four days and went over to your old place yesterday but found you had left i got the new address off a queer old chap there why didnt you tell us you had changed i did i wrote to dad about it well anyhow he never told me that seems funny how is he oh the same old besotted curmudgeon as ever dont jason dads dad for all his failings yes and zyps zyp for all hers it gave me a thrill to hear the old name spoken familiarly though by such reckless lips isis she all right shes zyp i tell you and that means anything thats sprightly and unquenchable let her alone for a jade im sick of her name was it evident from this that his suit had not prospered i looked at his changing eyes and my heart reeled with a sudden sick intoxication of hope was my reasoning to be all gone through with again come i said lets make for my place a fellowhand lives with me there we walked up holborn together he had eyes for every incident a tongue that seldom ceased wagging many a smart and powdered working girl tripping to her business nudged her companion and looked after him he accepted it all with a bold indifferencethe masterful condescension that sets tightlaced breasts atwittering under their twiceturned jackets he was much better dressed than i was and carried himself with some show of fashion duke had left when we reached home and his absence i hardly regretted well said my brother as we entered the sittingroom youve decent quarters renny and no doubt deserve them for being a good boy you can give me some breakfast i suppose if you dont mind eating alone i said ive got no appetite all the worse for you i never lose mine the table was already laid as duke had left it i fetched a knuckle of ham from our private store and placed it before my unwelcome guest who fell to with a healthy vigor of hunger its as well perhaps i didnt find you last night he said munching and enjoying himself we should have sat up late and then i might have overslept myself and missed the fun i say didnt he go down plump i hoped the rope would break and that we should have it over again jason i cried drop it wont you i tell you i got caught there by mistake and that the whole thing was horrible to me oh all right he said with a laugh i shouldnt have thought youd have cared but i wont say anything more about it i would not challenge word or tone in him to what could i possibly appeal in one so void of the first instincts of humanity he pushed his plate away presently and fetched out a little pipe and began to smoke i had sat all the time by the window looking vaguely upon the crowded street now i said turning to him lets hear why you are in london he raised his eyebrows with an affectation of perplexity didnt i tell you he said but theres nothing to explain i wanted to come and i came four days ago more or less but what brought you where did you get the money never mind thats my affair i did get it and theres an end how long do you intend to stop it all depends upon circumstances maybe i shall get something to do here well you might i had nothing more to recommend me than you have when i first came not so much my good fellow he threw out his chest and a whiff of smoke together ive more about me to take the fancy i believe and im not handicapped with a depressing secret for the unscrupulous to trade upon besides you forget that ive a friend at court which you never had meaning me its no good i can tell you in the very beginning ive not influence enough with my employer to foist a useless fresh hand upon him well see my friendwell see perhaps by and by im not in any hurry i havent the slightest intention of working till im forced to i suppose not but what are you going to do in the meantime enjoy life as i always do here in london yes of course we cant put you up at this place its impossible wait till youre asked ive got my own quarters where find out if you can i keep my private burrow secret well its all very queer but i suppose you know your own business best naturally he said and sat frowning at me a little while then presently he rose and came and looked down upon me renny he said quietly im going now but i shall look you up from time to time i just want to say a thing first though you havent received me very well and i shant forget it theres a new manner about you thats prettier than its quite safe you seem to have thought matters over and to have come to the conclusion that this lapse of years has tided you over a little difficulty we remember i only want to suggest that you dont presume upon that too far grant it to be true as old crackenthorpe said that that fellow mullers fate isnt likely to be yours i can make things pretty hot for you nevertheless he nodded at me once or twice with his lips set and so walked from the room for an hour after he had gone regardless of the calls of business i sat on by the window pondering the meaning of this downswoop and its likely influence on my fortunes the nervous apprehension of boyhood had left me i had carved out an independent path for myself and had prospered was it likely that thus restored as it were to manliness i could weakly succumb to a sense of fatality i was stronger by nature and experience than this blackest of blackmailers he who takes his moral fiber from humanity must necessarily surpass the egotist who habitually drains upon himself as to the mere fact of my brothers journey hither and his acquirement of the means which enabled him to do so and to present a becoming appearance i cared to speculate but little london was the natural goal of his kind and when the migratory fit came he was bound by hook or by crook to gather the wherewith for his flight it was the immediate presence of his blackrent mood that i had to combat and i found myself strong to do so i would not own his mastery i would anticipate him and force the crisis he wished to postpone for his own gain and my torment that very evening would i tell duke all and abide by his judgment and dolly here on the instant i compromised with manliness and so admitted a weak place in my armor viewed through the dizzy mist of my own past and haunted suffering this sweet and natural child stood out such a tender vision of innocence that i dared not arrogate to myself the right of informing it with an evil that must be negative only in the first instance how can i imperil her soul i thought by shattering at a blow the image my image that enlightens it sophistrysophistry for what true woman is the worse for learning that her idol is poor humanity after allnot a thing to worship but a soul to help and protecta soul thirsting for the deep wells of sympathy had i been wise to forestall my brother with all whose influence was upon my life a great misery might have been averted in this instance i temporized and the fatal cloud of calamity rose above the horizon why was it that at the first dolly was much more in my mind than zyp that i cannot answer altogether but so it was the balance of my feelings was set no differently yet while it seemed quite right and proper that zyp should estimate me at my dual personality i shrunk with shuddering from the thought of dolly knowing me as i knew myself perhaps it was that for all my sense of passionate affinity to the wild creature once so part of my destinies i recognized in the other the purer soul that it was the love of the first i desired the good will of the second perhaps also the recognition of this drove me on again to abide by my decision of the morning it is useless to speculate now for the little unhappy tale ended otherwise than as i had prefigured it my day had begun with an omen as ghastly as its sequel was to be chapter xx duke speaks that evening in the luminous dusk of our sittingroom i sat up and gave duke my history he would have stopped me at the outset but i would brook no eccentric philosophy in the imperious fever of insistence that was my mood i told him of all that related personally to memy deed my repentancemy brothers exposure and renewed menaces but to zyp i only referred in such manner as to convey the impression that whatever influence she had once exerted over me was dead with boyhood and scarcely to be resurrected that here i intentionally told a halftruth only cowardly in the suspicion that the whole would be resented by my hearer on dollys behalf i cannot deny i dared not commit myself to a policy of absolute confidence when i had finished there was a silence which i myself was forced to at length break duke i said havent you a remark to makeno word of advice or rebuke not one renny what concern have we with that past existence of yours oh for heavens sake drop that nonsense for once in a way its a very real trouble to me whatever it is to you old man you did and you repented in one day the account up there must balance you think it must we are masters of our actsnot of our impulses you strike a bell and it clangs you strike a man and the devil leaps out at his eyes its in the rebound that the thought comes that decides the act in this case yours was natural to yourself for you are a good fellow and so are you a hundred times over to take it so you dont know the terror it has been to methat it must be to me still in a measure the account may balance but still well the boymy brotherdied yesafter you had tried to save him dukeduke you cant hold me not to blame i dont indeed you were very much to blame for not retreating when your better angel gave you the chance its for that youll be called to account some daynot the other well ill stand up and cry peccavi i said sadly renny said duke from the shadow of his side of the room whats this elder brother of yours like i explained jasons appearance to the best of my power ah he said quietly i thought so what do you mean nothing only i saw him this afternoon taking the bearings of the office from tother side the street very likely he mentioned something about using my influence with ripley to give him a berth later on probably he was debating his ground you havent given your confidence to any one but me in this matter no do you intend to if you think it right shall i tell ripley its my opinion you should forestall your brother in every direction well yours and his are the only two that concerns me one other renny who dolly he leaned forward and looked at me with such intensity of earnestness that his black eyes seemed to pierce to my very soul shall i he saidand his gaze never left my faceshall i acknowledge your confidence with another it shall be sacred duke i answered low if it refers to past or present he threw himself back with a sudden wail to both he cried to both he was himself again directly bah he cried what a woman i am renny you shall for once find me sick of philosophy and human i resumed my seat fairly dumfounded at this revelation of unwonted depths in my friend and stared at him in silence once more he leaned forward and seemed to read me through renny tell medo you wish to make dolly your wife duke upon my soul i dont know do you love her if i thought i did as you meant it i could answer your first question and you cant no i cant renny make her happy she loves you with all her heart would that be fair to her duke let me know my own mind first ah i am afraid you dont care to know it that you are playing with a pleasurable emotion take careoh take care i tell you the halt and maimed see further in the dark than the vigorous renny there is trouble ahead i know more of women than you do perhaps because cut off from manly exercises i can gauge their temptations and their weaknesses i see a way of striking at you that you dont dream of be great with resolve save my little booksewer i implore you duke i said with extreme emotion for i fancied i could catch the shine of most unaccustomed tears in his dark eyes my good dear fellow what is the meaning of this i would do anything to make you or dolly happy but where is the sense of halfmeasures if you feel like this why dont youi say it with all lovewhy dont he struggled to his feet and with a wild pathetic action drew emptiness about him with enfolding arms i tell you he cried in a broken voice that i would give my life to stand in your shoes valuing the evil as nothing to the sweet he dropped his head on his breast and i had no word to say my willful blindness seemed to me at that moment as vile a thing as any in my life suddenly he stood erect once more renny he said with a faint smile for all your good friendship you dont know me yet i see im too stiffjointed to kneel dont curse me for blighting your life like this but dukei never guessed if i hadit didnt matter to mei would have walked over a precipice rather than cross your path how could you know wasnt i sworn to philosophy and it cant be now it can never be think dukethink i never do anything else love may exist on pity but not on charity i put myself on one side it is her happiness that has to be considered first and renny you know the way to it duke have you always felt like this toward her always i feel here that i should answer you according to my theory of life but i have shown you my weak side every negro they say worships white as the complexion of his unknown god from my first sight of her i have tried to rub my sooty soul cleanhave tried every means like the blackgob committee in hoods poem i think you have been successfulif any rubbing was necessary i think at least you have proved your affinity to her and will claim and be claimed by her in the hereafter i shall not have the less chance then for striving to procure her happiness here oh dukeno i stood abashed in presence of so much lofty abrogation of self what am i to do i said humbly i will be guided by you shall i study to make our interests one and trust to heaven for the right feeling first tell her what you have told me you need have no fear very well i will do so on the first opportunity that confidence alone will make a bond between you but rennyoh dont delay i wont dukei wont but i wish you would tell me what danger it is you fear if i did you would think it nothing but a phantom of my brain i have said i see in the dark this room is full of fantastic shapes to me perhaps they are only the goblin lights born of warp and disease i will speak to her next sunday not sooner i cant very well we must be alone together without risk of interruption i would have told him of our yesterdays talk only that it seemed a cruel thing to take even him into that broken and tender confidence very well let it be then as you value her happiness all day it had been close and oppressive and now thunder began to moan and complain up the lower slopes of the night suddenly in the ominous stirring of the gloom i became conscious that my companion was murmuring to himselfthat a low current of speech was issuing from his lips monotonous as the babble of delirium there was a window in the roof where stars glittered like bubbles in the glassand the ceiling came almost down to the floor on one side and i cried often with terror for the window and i were alone sometimes the frost gathered there like white skin over a wound and sometimes the monstrous clouds looked in and mocked and nodded at me i was very cold or else my face cracked like earth with the heat and i could not run away for he had thrown me down years before and the marrow dried in my bones there had been a time when the woman came with her white face and loved me always listening and crept away looking back but she went at last and i never saw her again duke i whisperedduke but he seemed lost to all sense of my presence he came often and there was a great dog with him whose flesh writhed with folds of gray and the edges of his tongue were curled up like a burning leafand the dog made my heart sick for its eyes were full of hate like his and when he made it snarl at me i shivered with terror lest a movement of mine should bring it upon me and sometimes i heard it breathing outside the door and thought if they had forgotten to lock it and it came in i should die but they never forgot and i was left alone with the window in the roof and nothing else but now i feel that if i could meet that dognow now i should scream and tear it with my teeth and torture it inch by inch for what it made me suffer i cried to him again but he took no heed there was water in the end and great dark buildings went up from it and the thunder was thick in the sky then he said drink and held something to my lips and i obeyed because i was in terror of him it was fire he gave me and i could not shriek because it took me by the throatbut i fell against the water and felt it lap toward me and i woke screaming and i was in a boati was in a boat i tell you there came a booming crash overhead and the room for a moment weltered with ghastly light in its passing i saw duke leap to his feet and there was something beside hima shapea mistone of the phantoms of his brainno of minemodred pointing and smiling it was gone in an instanta mere trick of the nerves but as i stood shivering and blinded i heard duke cry in a terrible voice rennylisten it was on such a night as this that my father poisoned me chapter xxi the calm before long after the storm had broken and rolled away were we still sitting talking in the dim lamplight in these hours i learned what dark confidences my friend had to give me as to his solitary and haunted past learned more truly also than i had ever done as yet the value of a moral courage that had enabled him dogged by the cruelest hate of adversity to emerge from the furnace noble and thrice refined he had been picked up as a mere child drowning in the river by the thames police and had been ultimately consigned to a charity school from which in due course he had been apprenticed to a printer thus far had his existence emerging from profoundest gloom run a straight and uneventful coursebut before into what deadly corner of a great citys most secret burrows his young life had been first hemmed and then crushed out of shape who may say when i had got him down again unnerved but quiet now and wistful with apology over his outburst he told me all that he knew thunder always seems to turn my brain a little renny perhaps because it is associated in the depths of my mind with that strange young experience the muttering sound of it brings a picture as it were before my eyes i seem to see a confusion of wharfs and monstrous piles of blackness standing out against the sky deadly water runs between in which smudges of light palpitate and are splintered into arrows and come together again like drops of quicksilver and you are given something to drink it is poison i know it as certainly as that it is my father who wishes to be quit of me i cant tell you how i know and before there is only the room and the window in the roof and myself a sickly cripple lying in bed always alone and always fearful of something duke was the gentle woman your mother i feel that it must have been but she went after a time perhaps he killed her as he wished to kill me can you remember him at all only through a dreadful impression of cruelty i know that i am what i am by his act though when made so or under what provocation if any is all a blank it is the dog that haunts my memory most that seems queer doesnt it i suppose it was the type or symbol of all the hate i was the victim of and i often feel as if some day i shall meet it once moreonly once moreand measure conclusions with it on that little matter of the suffering it caused me we fell silent for awhile then said i softly duke with such a past for background i think i can understand how dolly must stand out in the front of your picture yes he said with a tender inflection in his voice but anyhow i have no quarrel with her sex what should i have been without that other presence in the past i have known only two women intimately for their sake my right arm is at the service of all his eyes shone upon me from the sallow strong face he looked like a crippled knight of errantry fearless and dangerous to tamper with where his right of affection was questioned the week that followed was barren of active interest it was a busy one at great queen street and all personal matters must needs be relegated to the background occasionally i saw dolly but only in the course of official routine and no opportunity occurred for us to exchange half a dozen words in private nevertheless there was in the dusty atmosphere of the place a sensation of warmth and romance that is scarcely habitual to the matteroffact of the workshop compromise with my heart as i might on the subject of zyps ineffaceable image i could not but be conscious that ripleys at present held a very pretty and tender sentiment for me the sense of a certain proprietorship in it was an experience of happiness that made my days run rosily for all the perplexity in my soul yet love such as i understood it in its spiritual exclusiveness was absent nor did i ever entertain for a moment the possibility of its awakening to existence in my breast so the week wore on and it was saturday again and tomorrow for good or evil the question must be put that evening as duke and i were sitting talking after supper jasons voice came clamoring up the stairs and a moment after my brother burst into the room he was in high spiritsflushed and boisterous as a young antinousand he flung himself into a chair and nodded royally to duke rennys chum i suppose said he and thats a distinction to be proud of for all its his brother that says so glad to know you straw duke didnt answer but he returned the nod striving to gloze over prejudice genially for my sake renny old chap cried jason i shant want my friend at court yetnot yet by a long chalk i hope look here he seized a purse from his pocket and clapped it down on the table with a jingling thud theres solid cash for you my boy fortythree pounds to a penny and a new pleasure to the pretty face of each of em where on earth did you get it jason wont you be shocked barebones come with me some night and see for yourself youve been gambling i believe horrid isnt itthe wailing baby and the deserted wife and the pistol in a garretthats what you are thinking of eh oh you dear thing but we arent built alike you and i be quiet cant you i cried angrily not a bit of it im breezy as a weathercock tonight i must talk i tell you and you always rouse the laughing imp in me wheres the harm of gambling if you win eh jack straw its no very good qualification for work if thats what you want to get mr trender work hang the dirty rubbish works for the poor in pocket and in spirit i want to see life to feel the sun of enjoyment down to my very fingertips you two may work if you like with your codes of cranky morals you may go back to your mill every monday morning with a guilty sense of relief that another weekly dissipation on hampstead heath is over and done with that dont do for me the shops here arent all ironware and stationery theres color and glitter and music and rich food and laughter everywhere around and i want my share of it when im poor ill work onlyi dont ever intend to be poor again well we dont any of us intend to for the matter of that said duke oh but you go the wrong way about it youre hampered in the beginning with the notion that you were made to work and that if you do it in fine manly fashion your wages will be paid you in full some day why what owls you are not to see that those wages that you think you are storing up so patiently are all the time being spent by such as me heres happiness at your elbow in the person of jason trendernot up in the skies there but its your nature and luckily thats my gain you wouldnt know how to enjoy ten thousand a year if you had it you think not i know it youd never be able to shake off the old humbug of responsibility toward others you mean of course i do and thats not the way to make out life not your way mine mines to be irresponsible and independentto act upon every impulse and always have a cat by me to claw out the chestnuts a high ideal isnt it dont fire that nonsense at me ideal indeed a cant term jack straw for a sort of religious mania no ideal ever sparkled like a bottle of champagne ive been drinking it for the first time lately and learning to play euchre ive not proved such a bad pupil he slapped the pocket to which he had returned his purse with a joyous laugh champagnes heaven he cried i never want any better come out with me tomorrow and taste it lets have a jaunt duke shook his head we shouldnt agree in our notions of pleasure said he then come you renny and ill swear to show you more fun in a day than youve known in all your four years of london i cant jason ive got another engagement who with never mind but i cant come oh rubbish youll have to tell me or else we go together neither the one nor the other for a moment he looked threatening im not fond of these mysteries he said then his face cleared again well he cried its a small matter for me and after all you dont know what you miss you dont keep whisky here i suppose no we dont drink grog either of us so i should have thought then ill make for livelier quartersand crying goodnight to us he went singing out of the room the moment i heard the outer door shut on him i turned to duke dont hold me responsible for him i said you see what he is renny said duke gravely i see that friendship is impossible to him and can understand in a measure what he made you suffer yet i think its true that hes of the sort whom fortune always favors they sign a compact in blood for it though as the wicked baron does in the story books he smiled and we both fell silent presently duke said from the darkness where has he put up in london i dont know he wouldnt say im not particularly anxious to find out as long as he keeps away from here ah as long as he does said my companion and sunk into a pondering fit again get off early tomorrow he said suddenly what time have you arranged toto meet dolly halfpast nine duke not before well be punctual theres a good fellow shes worth an effort i watched him as he rose with a stifled sigh and busied himself over lighting our bedroom candle in the gusty dance of the flame his eyes seemed to change and glint red like beads of garnet i had no notion why but a thrill ran through me and with it a sudden impulse to seize him by the hand and exclaim thank god were friends duke he startled a little and looked full in my face and then i knew what had moved me friends were we but heaven pity the man who made him his enemy chapter xxii the shadow of the storm dolly met me the next morning looking shy and halffrightened as a child caught fruitpicking she gave me her hand with no show of heartiness and withdrew it at once as if its fingers were the delicate antennae of her innocent soul and i her natural enemy where shall we go renny she asked glancing timidly up at me to epping again dolly dear ive set my heart on it she seemed at first as if about to ask me why then to shrink from a subject she dreaded appearing to have a leading interest in very well she answered faintly it will be lovely there now wont you help a poor woman to a crust of bread kind lidy said a voluble whining voice at our ears and a sturdy mendicant thrust her hand between us she was a very frouzy and forbiddinglooking mendicant indeed with battered bonnet askew and villainous small eyes and her neighborhood was redolent of gin spare a copper kind lidy and gentleman she entreated with a bibulous smirk and call down the blessings of eving on a widowed art as ant tysted bit or sup since yesterday come tomorrer and five blessed children wantin a ome which its the rent overdue and these ands wore to knife powder scrapin in the gutters for scraps which one crust of bread would ease kind lidy oh just a copper dolly was for putting a charitable hand into her pocket as the creature followed us but i peremptorily stopped her and would not have her imposed upon kind lidy continued the woman ive walked the streets all night since yesterday morning and the soles off my feet kind lidy wont you spare a copper and i dursnt go ome for fear of my man and i buried the youngest a week come yesterday and praise eving im a lonely widder without child or usband kind lidy just a copper for the funeraland rot the faces off of you for a couple of bloomin marks in your silks and satings and may you die of the black thirst with the ale foamin in barrils out of reach you a lidy oh yes sich as cocks her nose at a honest woman starvin in her rags and so will you some day for all your pink cheeks when youve been thrown over like this here bloomin bonnet she screamed after us and caught the moldy relic from her head and slapped it upon the pavement in a drunken frenzy and she reviled us in worse language than i can venture to record poor dolly was frightened and urged me tremblingly to hurry on out of reach of that strident cursing voice i was so angry that i would have liked to give the foulmouthed harridan into custody but the nervous tremors of my companion urged me to the wiser course of leaving bad alone and we were soon out of earshot of the degraded creature renny whispered the girl in halfterrified tones did you hear what she said what does it matter what she said dolly she cursed me god wouldnt allow a curse from a woman like that to mean anything would he my dear you must cure yourself of those fancies god you may be sure wouldnt use such a discordant instrument for his divine thunders the market value of her curse you see she put at a copper she looked up at me with her lips quivering a little she was evidently upset and it was some time before i could win her back to her own pretty self i wish the day hadnt begun like this she said in a low voice it shall come in like the lion of march dolly and go out like a lambat least i hope so so do i she whispered but with the fright still in her eyes why dolly i said i could almost think you superstitiousand you a ripley hand she laughed faintly i never knew i was renny but everything seemed bright and peaceful till her horrible voice ground it with dust i wonder why she said that said what dolly that about being thrown over now doll ill have no more of it leave her to her gin palace and set your pretty face to the forest one two three and off we go we caught our train by the tail as one may say and took our seats out of breath and merry the run had brought the bloom to my companions face once more and the breeze had ruffled and swept her shining hair rebellious she seemed a very sweet little possession for a dusty londoner to enjoya charming garden of blossom for the fancies to rove over ah me how can i proceed how write down what follows the fruit was to fall and never for me the blossoms of the garden were to be scattered underfoot and trodden upon and their sweet perfume embittered in death as we walked down the platform a voice hailing me made the blood jump in my heart rennyrenny what brings you here why what a coincidence well met old fellow and i say wont you introduce me miss mellisonthis is my brother i almost added a curse under my breath i was striving hard for selfcommand but my voice would only issue harsh and mechanical he had overreached mehad watched of course and followed secretly in pursuit how delighted i am to meet you he said here was ionly lately come to london miss mellisonsick for country air again and looking to nothing better than a lonely tramp through the forest and fate throws a whole armful of roses at me are you going there too do let me come with you dolly looked timidly up at me we had left the station and were standing on the road outside oh miss mellisons shy in company i said lets each go our way and we can meet at the station this evening im sure you wont echo that said jason looking smilingly at the girl i see heaven before me and he wants to shut me out theres an unnatural brother for you it seems unkind dont it renny we hadnt thought to give you the slip mr trender why really till now i didnt even know of your existence thats renalts way of course he always wanted to keep the good things to himself but ive been in london quite a long time now miss mellison and he hasnt even mentioned me to you dolly gave me a glance halfperplexed halfreproachful why didnt you renny i struggled to beat down the answer that was on my lips because i thought him no fit company for you i didnt see why i should i said coolly im not bound to make my friends his how rude you areand your own brother dont mind him mr trender he can be very unpleasant when he chooses she smiled at him and my heart sunk was it possible that his eyeshis low musical voicecould he be taking her captive already come i said roughly were losing the morning chattering here dolly youre not wanted jason thats the blunt truth dolly gave a little pained cry of deprecation dont renny its horrible of you i cant help it i said savagely hes as obtuse as a tortoise he ought to see hes in the way you give me credit for too delicate a discrimination my good brother but ill go if im not wanted no you shant mr trender i wont be a party to such behavior i turned upon the girl with a white face i could feel dolly i said hoarsely if he goes with you i dont her face flushed with anger for the first time in my knowledge of her you can do just as you like renny and spoil my day if you want to but i havent given you the right to order me about as if i was a child without another word i turned upon my heel and left them i was furious with a conflicting rage of emotionsdetestation of my brother anger toward dolly baffled vanity and mad disappointment in a moment the sunshine of the day had been tortured into gloom the sting of that was the stab i felt most keenly in the first tumult of my passion that this soft caprice of sex i had condescended to so masterfully in my thoughts should turn upon and defy me i had not deemed such a thing possible had she only played with me after all coquetting and humoring and rending after the manner of her kind were it so she should hear of the mere pity that had driven me to patronizing consideration of her claims should learn of my essential indifference to her in a very effectual manner i am ashamed to recall the first violence with which in my mind i tortured that poor gentle image as my rage cooled it wrought i must confess an opposite revenge then dolly became in my eyes a treasure more desirable than ever now my chance of gaining her seemed shaken i thought of all her tender moods and pretty ways so that my eyes filled with tears i had behaved rudely had shocked her gentle sense of decorum and here by reason of an exaggerated spleen had i thrown her alone into the company of the very man whose influence over her i most dreaded and what would duke sayduke who in noble abrogation of his own claims had so pathetically committed to my care this child of his deep unselfish love i had been walking rapidly in the opposite direction to that i fancied the other two would take and now i stopped and faced about scared with a sudden shock of remorse what a fool a coward a traitor to my trust i had been i must retrace my steps at once and seek them up and down the forest alleys i started off in panic haste sweating with the terror of what i had done i plunged presently into the woods and for a couple of hours hurried hither and thither without meeting them by and by breaking into the open again i came upon an inn favored of tourists that stood back from a road i was parched and exhausted and thought a glass of beer would revive me to a fresh start walking into the tap i passed by the open door of the coffeeroom and there inside were they seated at a table together and a waiter was uncorking a bottle of champagne behind them why didnt i go in then and there i had found my quarry and the game might yet be mine ask the stricken lover who will pursue his lady hotly through anxious hours and then when he sees her at last will saunter carelessly by as if his heart were cold to her attractions some such motive in a form infinitely baser was mine i may call it pride and hear the wheel creak out a sardonic laugh they seem happy enough without me my heart said but my conscience knew the selfishness that must nurse an injury above any sore need of the injurer their voices came to me happy and merry they had not seen me i drank my beer and stole outside miserably temporizing with my duty she shant escape again i thought ill go a little distance off and watch i waited long but they never came at length stung to desperation i strode back to the inn and straight into the coffeeroom it was empty seeing a waiter i asked him if the lady and gentleman who had lunched at such a table had left yes he said he believed the lady and gentleman had gone into the forest by the garden way then i was baffled again surely the curse of the virago of the morning was operating after all evening drew on and at last there was no help for it but to make for the station and catch our usual train back to town they were standing on the platform when i reached it i walked straight up to them dolly flushed crimson when she saw me and then went pale as a windflower but she never spoke a word hullo said jason the wanderer returned weve had a rare day of it and you have too no doubt i spoke steadily with a set determination to prove master of myself ive been looking for you all day dolly im sorry i left you in a temper please forgive me dear oh yes she said indifferently and weariedly it doesnt matter but it does matter to me dolly very much to keep your good opinion she turned and looked at me with a strange expression as if she were on the point of bursting into tears but she only ended with a little formless laugh and looked away again i dont think you can value my good opinion much and im sure i dont know why you should the train lunging in at this point stopped our further talk and once seated in it the girl lay back in her corner with closed eyes as if asleep jason sat silent with folded arms the lamplight below the shadow cast by his hat brim emphasizing the smile on his firmly curved lips and i for my part sat silent also for my heart seemed sick unto death at the terminus dolly would have no further escort home she was tired out she said and begged only we would see her into an omnibus and go our ways without her as the vehicle lumbered off i turned fiercely upon my brother chapter xxiii a letter and an answer you dog i said in a low stern voice tell me the meaning of this he gave a little mocking airy laugh and thrusting his hands into his pockets wheeled round upon me whats your question said he you know what have you said to the girl to make her treat me like this he raised his eyebrows in assumed perplexity really he said you go a long way to seek what have i said how have you behaved you mean you liei dont i know her thats enough if you have told her my story if he repeated coolly i may add a last chapter to it in which youll figurethats all he was a little startled i could see but retained his sang froid with an effort you jump too much to conclusion my good fellow i have said nothing to her about your little affair with modred as yet that means you intend to hold it over my head as a menace where she is concerned i know you then you know a very charming fellow why what a dolt you are heres a pother because i play cavalier to a girl whom you throw over in a fit of sulks i couldnt do less in common decency take care that you do no more im not the only one to reckon with in this business a fig for that he cried snapping his fingers im not to be coerced into taking second place if i have a fancy for first i warn you thats enough for the rest lets understand one another ill have no more of this sham for conventions sake were enemies and well be known for enemies my doors shut to you keep out of my way and think twice before you make me desperate with that i turned and strode from him his mocking laugh came after me again but i took no notice of it should i tell duke all i shrunk from the mere thought a coward even then i dared not confess to him how i had betrayed my trust what fearful suspicions of the nature of my failure lay dark on my heart noi must see dolly first and force my sentence from her lips he put down the book he was reading from as i entered the sittingroom well he said cheerily what success i sat away from him beyond the radiance of the lamp and affected to be busy unlacing my boots i cant say as yet duke do you mind postponing the question for a day or two of course if you wish it i felt the surprise in his tone maynt i ask why not now old fellow i missed my opportunity thats all is anything wrong renny not all right at least renny why shouldnt it be i cant be mistaken as to the direction of her feelingsby my soul i cant im not so sure i said in a voice of great distress he recognized it and stopped questioning me at once you want to be alone i see said he gently well ill be off as he passed me he placed his hand for a moment on my shoulder the action was tender and sympathetic but i shrunk under it as if it had been a blow when the door had closed upon him i rose and sat down at the table i wrote dear dolly i made a fool of myself today and have repented it ever since in sackcloth and ashes i had so wished to be alone with you dear and it made me mad that he should come between us he isnt a good companion for you i must say it though he is my brother had i thought him so i should have brought him to see you before i only say this to explain my anger at his appearance and now i will drop the subject for another which is the real reason of my writing i had hoped so much dear to put it to you personally there in the old forest that we have spent so many happy hours in but i missed my opportunity and now i am in too much of a fever to wait another week dolly will you be my wife i can afford a home of my own now and i shall be glad and grateful if you will consent to become mistress of it i feel that written words can only sound cold at best so i will say nothing more here but just thisif you will have me i will strive in all things to be your loving and devoted husband renalt trender all in a glow of confident tenderness inspired by the words i had written i added the address and went out and posted my little missive its mere composition the fact of its now lying in the postbox a link between us gave me a chastened sense of relief and satisfaction that was restorative to my injured vanity the mistake of the morning was reacted upon in time and i felt that nothing short of a disruption of natural affinities could interfere to keep back the inevitable answer so assured was i indeed that i allowed my thoughts to wander as if for a last farewell into regions wherein the simple heart of my present could find no way to enter goodby zyp the voiceless soul of me muttered that night looking at dukes dark head at rest on the pillow i thought it will be put right tomorrow or the next day and you dear friend need never know what might have followed on my abuse of your trust then i slept peacefully but my dreams were all of zypnot of the other the next day at the office i was careful to keep altogether out of dollys way indeed my work taking me elsewhere i never once saw her and went home in the evening unenlightened by a single glance from her gray eyes this the better policy i thought would save us both embarrassment and the annoyance of any curiosity on the part of her fellowworkers who would surely be quick to detect a romantic state of affairs between us nevertheless despite my selfconfidence i awaited that evening in some trepidation the answer that was to decide the direction of my future we were sitting at supper when it came held by one corner in her apron by our landlady and my face went pale as i saw the schoolgirl superscription from dolly murmured duke i nodded and broke the seal my hands trembled and a mist was before my eyes it ran as follows dear renny thank you very very much for your kind offer but i cant accept it i thought i had so much to say and this is all i can think of i hope it wont hurt you it cant i know for long because now i see i was never really the first in your heart and your letter dont sound as if you will find it very difficult to get over please forgive me if im wrong but anyhow its too late now i might have once but i cant now renny i think perhaps i became a woman all in a moment yesterday please dont write or say a word to me again about this for i mean it really and truly your affectionate friend dolly mellison p sit was a little unfair of you i must say not to tell me about that zyp i sat and returned the letter to its folds quite coolly and calmly if there was fire in me i kept it under then duke i said quietly she has refused me he struggled up from his chair his face was all amazement and his voice hoarse refused you what have you said what have you done something has happened i tell you why she was at perfect liberty to make her own choice you wrote to her last night yes why did you why didnt you do as i understood you intended to yesterday i asked you to leave that question alone for the present youve no right to i his face flamed up for a moment but with a mighty effort he fought it under renny he said in a subdued voice i had no business to speak to you like that but you dont know upon what a wheel of torment i have been these last weeks the girldollyis so much to me and her happiness he broke off almost with a sob i sprung to my feet i could bear it no longer think what you like of me i cried i have made a muddle of the whole businessa wretched unhappy muddle but i suffer too duke i never knew what missmiss mellison was to me till now when i have lost her i dont ask to see her letter you havent misread it by any possibility noits perfectly clear she refuses me and holds out no hope he set his frowning brows and fell into a gloomy silence he took no notice of me even when i told him that i must go into the open air for awhile to walk and try to find surcease of my racking trouble now i thought when i got outside for the villainous truth to strike at me like that it was worthy of himworthy of him and i am to blame for leaving them togetheri who pretended to an affection for the girl and was ready to swear to love and protect her forevermore what a pitiful rag of manliness what courage that darent even now tell the truth to my friend up there friend hes done with me i expect but for the other he didnt give her my historynot he perhaps he didnt as i meant it but i never dreamed that he would play upon that second stop for his devils of hate to dance to i never even thought of it what a hideous fool i have been oh jason my brother if it had only been you instead of modred i jerked to a stop some formless thoughts had been in my mind to hurry on into the presence of the villain who had dealt me such a coward blow and to drive his slander in one red crash down his throat now in an instant it broke upon me that i had no knowledge of where he livedthat by my own act i had yesterday cut off all communication between us perhaps though in his cobralike dogging of me he would be driven before long to seek me out again of his own accord that he might gloat over the havoc he had occasioned i must bide my time as patiently as i could on the chance late at night i returned and lay down upon the sofa in the sittingroom i felt unclean for dukes company and would not go up to him let me do myself justice it was not all dread of his anger that kept me from him there was a most lost sorrowful feeling in me at having thus requited all his friendship and his generosity as i lay and writhed in sickly thought my eye was attracted by the glimmering of some white object set prominently on the mantelpiece i rose and found it was a letter addressed to me in his handwriting foreseeing its contents i tore it open and read i think it best that our partnership should cease and i find lodging elsewhere you will understand my reasons dolly comes first with me thats all it may have been your error i cant think it was your willful fault but that she would have refused you without some good reason i cant believe your manner seems to point to the suspicion that somehow her happiness is threatened i may be wrong but i intend to set myself to find out and until some explanation is forthcoming i think it best that we should live apart i shall call here tomorrow during the dinner hour and arrange about having my things moved and settle matters as far as i am concerned your friend duke straw i stood long with the letter in my hand well its best i muttered at last and i thought he would do it hes my friend still thank heaven for he says so but oh jason your debt is accumulating chapter xxiv lost the week that followed was a sad and lonely one to me my romance was endedmy friend parted from memy heart ever wincing under the torture of selfreproach as to the first it would seem that i should have no great reason for insuperable regret the situation had been made for not by me i was free to let my thoughts revert unhampered to the object of my first and only true love that was all so yet i know i brooded over my loss for the time being as if it were the greatest that could have befallen me such is human inconsistency so he who vainly seeking some large reward condescends halfdisdainfully to a smaller is altogether disproportionately vexed if the latter is unexpectedly denied him i went about my work in a hopeless mechanical manner that only scarcely concealed the bitter ache my heart endured occasionally at rare intervals i came across dolly but formally only and never to exchange a word furtively glancing at her when this happened i noticed that she looked pale and i thought not happy but this may have been nothing but fancy for my hasty view was generally limited to halfprofile of me she took no heed desiring apparently the absolute close of our old intercourse and mere pride precluded me from making any further effort toward an explanation would that even then i had been wise or noble enough to force the barrier of reserve god knows but i might have been in time to save her yet maybe my attitude was not altogether unjustified to put me on the footing of a formal stranger was heavy punishment for a fault committed under motives that were anything at least but base with duke my intercourse was confined to the office and to matters of business he showed no unfriendly spirit toward me there and no desire for a resumption of our old terms he never in public or private touched upon the subject that was nearest both our hearts or alluded to it in any way if i was conscious of any melancholy shadow towering between us it was not because he sought to lend to its features the gloom that must be enwrapping his own soul at last the week ended and the silence that had lain black and ominous as a snake along it was awakened and reared itself poisonous for a spring yet its voice spoke up musical at first it was saturday afternoon and i was walking home toward my lodgings in a very depressed frame of mind when a step came behind me and duke fell into step alongside renny he said i think it right to tell you i have taken the privilege of an old friend and spoken to dolly on a certain subject i nodded the mere fact was a relief to me we could only exchange a few words but she has promised to come out with me tomorrow and then i hope i shall learn more what time will you be at home i told him all day if there was a chance of his turning up very well he said then i will call in upon you some time or other goodby he seemed to be on the point of going but to alter his mind and he suddenly took my hand and pressed it hard are you lonely old fellow very dukeand i deserve to be its for the best you agree with me quite he looked sorrowfully in my face wrung my hand a second time and walked off rapidly it was the expression of his i ever after remembered with most pathetic heartsickness and love i never saw it in his eyes againnever again i rose upon the sunday morning restless still and unrefreshed an undefinable feeling of ominous expectancy would not let me sit quiet or read or do anything but lend my mind to extravagant speculations and pace the room up and down in nervous irritability at last thoroughly tired out i threw myself into an easychair and dozed off from sheer exhaustion i could not have slept many minutes when a clap in my ears awoke me it might have been an explosive burst of thunder so loudly it slammed upon my senses yet it was nothing more than the closing of the room door then i struggled to my feet for duke stood before me and i saw that his face was white and menacing as deaths own get up he cried in a harsh stern voice i want to ask you something i faced him and my heart seemed to suddenly swerve down with a sickly sensation what is it i muttered shes gonethats all gone she never met me this morning as she promised i waited an hourmore then i grew frightened and went to her lodgings she had left the evening before saying she wasnt coming back a man came to fetch her and she went away with him do you understandwith him with whom i asked in a confused reeling manner yet i knew i want you to tell me how can i duke i want you to say what you have done with your trust there has been something going on of latesome secret kept from me where is that brother of yours i know no more than you do i shall find out before long the cunning doesnt exist that could keep him hidden from me ifif he is a party to this why are you silent i can read it in your eyes they have met and it must have been through you before god it wasnt then they have he put his hand to his face and staggered as if he had been struck there oh he gasped the horror of what i dreaded then he came closer and snarled at me heres a friend out of all the world so patronizing to accept the poor little treasure of my life and soul and so royal to roll it in the mud was this a putup affair between you you are hateful and unjust i cried stung beyond endurance he forced himself upon us last sunday i was brutal almost in my efforts to get rid of him but for some reason or other dollymiss mellisontook his side when i found so i left them in a huff and repented almost immediately but though i sought far and near i never came across them again till evening he listened with a black gloomy impatience you acted well by your own confession said he you played the part of a true friend and lover by leaving her alone for a moment only in the company of that paragon i oughtnt to i know he gave a high grating laugh but putting me on one side i began when he took me up with the most intense acrid bitterness why cant i indeedyou and all your precious kith and kin why did i ever save you from being knocked on the head in that thieves garden i was happy beforegod knows i might have been happy in another way now youve proved the viper on my hearth with a vengeance put you on one side ah i dare say that would suit you wellto shirk the responsibility of your own act and leave the suffering to others i have suffered duke and always shall i wont gainsay youbut this hurts me perhaps only one degree less than it does you why put the worst construction on it he gave another cruel laugh lets have your theory of her vanishing without a word to me he said at least you cant be certain that itit was my brother how perspicacious of you you dont think so yourself do you or that i should have meekly accepted that womans statement without some inquiry as to the appearance of the interesting stranger he dropped his cruelly bantering manner for one hard as iron and ferocious lets stop this doublefaced foolery i want his address of you i havent got it you know you cant guess at it not possibly what would you do if you had it what do you think call and offer my congratulations of course dont be a madman you know nothing for certain wait and see if she doesnt turn up at the office as usual tomorrow he seemed to think a moment and then he threw up his hands with a loud wailing moan lost he cried in my heart i know it did i not in mine it had rung in my ears all night i took a step toward him greatly moved by his despairing broken tone but he waved me back fiercely i curse the day he cried in bitter grief that ever i came across you i would have let you rob methat was nothing to her happiness but now let him look to himself he went on after a pause in which he had mastered his emotion after tomorrowi will wait till thenbut afterwardthe world isnt wide enough to keep us apart better for him to run from an uncubbed tigress than this twisted cripple he tossed one arm aloft with a wild savage gesture and strode heavily from the room chapter xxv a last message dolly never came to work the next morning but there arrived a little letter from her to mr ripley giving notice that was all with no address or clew to her whereabouts and an intimation that it was understood she sacrificed her positionpitiful heaven for what my employer tossed the note to me indifferently asking me to see about the engagement of a fresh hand if necessary he little guessed what those few simple words meant to two of his staff or foresaw the tragedy to which they were the prelude when the dinner hour came i followed duke out and put the scrap of paper into his hand without a word he was not unprepared for it for he already knew of course that his worst apprehensions were realized by the nonappearance of the girl at her usual place in the office he read it in silence and in silence handed it back to me his face in twentyfour hours seemed to have grown to be the face of an old man all its once halfsad halfhumorous thoughtfulness was set into a single hard expression of some dark resolve well he said suddenly stopping in his walk and facing me for i still kept pace with him what do you intend doing duke i have one mission in life mr trender goodafternoon to you i fell back and watched him go from me maimed as i was myself how could i in any way help him to cure his crueler hurt but now began a curious somber struggle of cross purposes to find out where jason had sunk his burrow and hidden the spoils of his ugly false sportthere we worked in harness it was only when the quarry should be run down that we must necessarily disagree as to the terms of its disposition for myself a new despairing trouble had been woven into my life by the hand that had already wrought me such evil its very touch had however made wreck of an impression that had been in a certain sense an embarrassment and my movements became in consequence less trammeled let me explain more definitely if indeed i can do so and not appear heartless dolly innocent bewitching and desirable had so confused my moral ideas as to imbue them with a certain sweet sophistry of love that halfdeceived me into a belief in its fundamental soundness that was done with dolly dethroned earthly enamored of a brazen idol could be no rival to zyp my heart might yearn to her with pity and a deep remorse that it was i who had been the weak responsible minister of her perversion but the old feeling was dead never to be revived i longed to find her to rescue her from the black gulf into which i feared she had leaped to face the villain who had bruised her heart and wrench atonement from him by the throat as it were not less it was my duty to warn him stand between him worthless as he was and the deadly pursuit alert for his destruction for duke i must judge him as he revealed himself to me and baffle if possible the terrible spirit of what i dared not name to myself think only that at one wicked blow he was deprived of that whole structure of gentle romance that had saved his moral life from starvation therefore it was that during the after hours of work i became for long a restless flitting ghost haunted by a ghost by street and rail and river aimless apparently but with one object through all we went wandering through the dark mazes of the night and of the city always hoping to light upon that we sought and always baffled theaters restaurants music halls night shows and exhibitions of every descriptionany place that was calculated to attract in the least a nature responsive to the foppery of glitter or an appeal to the senseswe visited and explored without result gambling denssuch as we could obtain the entree towere a persistent lodestone to our restlessness and here especially was i often conscious of that shadow of a shadethat dark ghost of my own phantom footstepsstanding silent at my elbow and watchingwatching for him who never came whithersoever we went the spur of the moments qualm goaded us any little experience any chance allusion was sufficient to suggest a possibility in the matter of the tendency of a lost and degenerate soul now we foregathered on the skirt of some fulsome and braying street preachers band now suffered in a music hall under the skittish vapidity of a lion comique now perhaps humbled our hot and weary pride in the luminous twilight of some old walledin church where evening service brought a few worshipers together i say we yet in all this we acted independently only whether in company or apart the spirit of one common motive linked us together and that so that i at least never felt alone so the weeks drew into months and dolly herself was a phantom to my memory by day the mechanism of our lives moved in the accustomed grooves by night we were wandering birds of passage flitting dismally over waste places more than once on a sunday had i taken train to epping driven by the thought that some halfforgotten sentiment might by chance move other than me to the scene of old pleasant experiences but she never came her seasick weary bark was nearing the rocks and the breakers of eternity were already sounding in her ears why postpone the inevitable or delay longer over description of that pointless pursuit that was to end only in catastrophe and death christmas had come and gone with mea mockery of good will and cheerand a bitter january set in that month the very demon of the east wind flew uncontrolled and his steely sting was of a length and shrewdness to pierce thickest cloth and coverlet frame and lung and heart itself one evening i had swallowed my supper and was preparing for my nightly prowl duke had remained at the office overtime and my tramp was like to be unhaunted of its familiar i had actually blown out the lamp when his rapid footstepi knew it wellcame up the stairs and in a moment the door was thrown open with a crash and i heard him breathing in the room hes gone he ejaculated in a quick panting voice no im here duke my god rennydo you hear comecome at once nolight the lamp ive something to show you i struck a match with shaking hand and put it to the wick as the dull flame sputtered and rose i turned and looked at my friend the expression of his face i shall never forget till i die it was bloodlessspectralinhuman the face of one to whom a great dread had been realizeda last hope denied he held out to me a little soiled and crumpled sheet of paper i took it with a spasm of the heart and breath that seemed to suffocate me my eyes turned from and were fascinated by it at once you had better read he said its the last chapter of your own pretty romance make hastei want to get to business it was from her as i had foreseena few sad words to the old good friend who had so loved and protected her i must let you know before i go to die i couldnt meet you that morningwhat a time ago it seems he wouldnt let me though i cried and begged him to i dont know now what made me do it all how he upset my faith in renny and turned my love to himself in a moment i think he has a dreadful influence that made me follow him and obey him it doesnt matter now i went to him thats enough and hes broken my heart please ask renny to forgive me perhaps if he had had a little more patience with me i might have acted differentbut i cant be certain even of that im going to kill myself duke dear and before i do it i just want to say this i know now you loved poor dolly all the time how i know it i dont understand but somehow its quite clear oh what have i thrown away when i might have been so happy you were always good to me and i thank you with my last breath dont hurt him duke i dont think he understands the difference to me but he always promised to be a faithful loverand yesterday i found that hes married already thats why im going to do it the paper dropped from my hand duke picked it up with an evil laugh and thrust it into his breast pocket married i muttered oh he cried its all one for that thats a family matter the question here goes beyondinto the heart of thisthis death warrant he struck savagely where the letter lay and stood staring at me with gloating eyes dukeare you going to murder him im going to find her let that do for the presentand youve got to help me where are we to look did the letter give an address no she kept her secret to the last it was a noble one i swear theres a postmark though and thats my clew hurry will you i seized my hat and stick dukefor the love of heaven why must it be too late even now because i know it is doesnt that satisfy you i loved herdo you understand it now for the first time the fiend tread on your heels arent you ever coming i hurried after him into the street a clap of wind struck and staggered us as if it had been water beating through the night its icy fury clutched at us stinging and buffeting our faces until it seemed as though we were fighting through an endless thicket of brambles struggling and panting onwardsilent with the silence of the lostwe made our way by slow degrees to the low ground about chelsea and presently came out into a freer air and the black vision of the river sliding before us from night into night duke i whispered awfullyis this what you fear follow he cried i fear nothing its past that by lowering factory and grimy wall by squalid streets peeled of uncleanliness in the teeth of the bitter blast by lowbrowed taverns that gushed red on us a moment and were gone he sped with crooked paces and i followed then he stopped so suddenly that i almost stumbled against him and we were standing at the mouth of a shadowy court and overhead a hiccoughing gas jet made a gibbering terror of his white face where are we i said and he answered where we naturally take up the clewoutside a police station chapter xxvi from the depths into a dull gusty room barren of everything but the necessities of its office we walked and stopped distempered walls a high desk a railed dock where creatures were put to the first question like an experimental torture black windows high in the wall and barred with network of wire as if to break into fragments the sunshine of hope a double gas bracket on an arm hanging from the ceiling grimly suggestive of a gallows a fireplace whose warmth was ruthlessly boxed insuch was the place we found ourselves in its ministers figured in the persons of a halfdozen constables sitting officially yawning on benches against the walls and looking perplexingly human shorn of their helmets and in the presence of a high priest or inspector and his clerk who sat respectively at the desk and a table placed alongside of it the latter rose upon our entrance and asked our business its plain enough said duke i have received by post an hour ago a letter from a young woman threatening suicide i dont know her address but the postmark is this district the officer motioned us to the higher authority at the desk may i see it said the latter my companion produced the letter and handed it over throughout his bearing and behavior were completely collected and formalpassionless altogether in their studied unemotionalism the inspector went through the poor little scrawl attentively from first word to last no doubt he was a kindly family man in private officially these pitiful warrants of heartbreaks were mere items in his days business when he had finished he raised his eyes but not his head sweetheart he said no answered duke but an old friend renny asked the inspector pointing a pen at me yes she ran away yes who with this mans brother how long ago three months about and you have never seen her since no nor him no and dont know where they lived noor i shouldnt be here the inspector caressed his short red beard looked thoughtfully again at the letter a moment or two placed it gently on the desk and leaned forward youd better take a man and hunt up the waterside she hasnt come ashore here you think she means it i thinkyes youd better go and look by water i mean yesby water thats my opinion he called to one of the seated men and gave him certain directions a minute later we were all three in the street outside what happened or whither we went during that long night remains only in my memory the ghastly shadow of a dream i can recall the white plate of the moon and still the icy wind and the spectral march onward this seemed the fitting outcome of our monotonous weeks of wanderingthis aimless corpsesearch on the part of two passionate fools who had failed in their pursuit of the living woman to my sick fancy it seemed the monstrous parody of chasean objectless struggle toward a goal that shifted with every step toward any determined point still we never stopped but flitted hopelessly from station to station only to find ourselves baffled and urged forward afresh i became familiar with rooms such as that we had leftrooms varying slightly in detail but all furnished to the same pattern grewsomer places knew us toohideous cellars for the dead where clothes were lifted from stiff yellow faces and from limbs stuck out in distorted burlesque of the rest that is called everlasting once i remember it came upon us with a quivering shock that our mission was fulfilled a body had been brought ini forget wherethe body of a young woman but when we came to view it it was not that that we sought pitiful heaven was our tragedy then but a common fashion of the dreadful waterway we groped our passage along how was it possible in all that harvest of death to find the one awn for our particular gleaning but herethough i was little conscious of it at the timean impression took life in me that was to bear strange fruit by and by dawn was in the air menacing most chill and gloomy when we came out once more upon the riverside at a point where an old rotting bridge of timber sprawled across the stream like a wrecked dam all its neighborhood seemed waste ground or lonely deserted tenements standing black and crookedly against a wan sweep of sky in the moment of our issuing as if it were a smaller splinter detached from the wreck a little boat glided out from under the bridge and made for a flight of dank and spongy steps that led up from the water not ten yards from where we stood something in the action of the dim figure that pulled or the other that hung over the stern sheets of the phantom craft moved our unwearying guide to motion us with his arm to watchfulness and an immediate pause in the same instant he hollowed his hand to his mouth and hailed any luck mate the man who was rowing slowed down at once and paddled gingerly to within a few yards of the steps who be you he growled like a dog our friend gave his authority oh said the fellow yes weve found one what sex my man gurl i could have cried out something found my heart and seized it in a suffocating grip where was it caught yonder in the timbers i reeled and clutched at duke but he shook me off sternly i knew as surely as that the night was done with that here our search ended that i stood quaking and shivering as nerveless as a haunted drunkard that i dared not follow them when they moved to the steps that dukes face was set like a dying mans as he walked stiffly from me and stood looking down upon the boat with a dreadful smileall this comes to me from the grim shadows of the past then i only knew a huddled groupa weighted chamber of shapes with something heavy and sodden swung among thema pause of hoursof yearsof a lifetimeand suddenly a hideous scream that cleft like a madmans into the waste silence of the dawn he was down upon his knees by itgroveling moaningtearing tufts of dead wintry grass with his hands in ecstasy of paintossing his wild arms to the sky in impotent agony of search for some least grain of hope or comfort i hurried to him i called upon his name and hers i saw the sweet white face lying like a stone among the grass wiser than i the accustomed ministers of scenes such as this stood watchful by and waited for the fit to pass when its fury was spent they quietly took up their burden once more and moved away i had no need then to bid my comrade command himself he rose on the instant from the ground where he had lain writhing and fiercely rejecting all offer of assistance on my part followed in the wake of the ghastly procession they bore it to the nearest station and there claimed their reward think of it we who would have given our all to save the living woman were outbidden by these carrion crows who staked upon the dead again at this point a lapse comes into my memory out of it grows a figure that of duke that stands before me and speaks with the horrible smile again on its lips you had better go home it says dukewhy what comes next what are you going to do what does it matter you had better go home i must know was there anything upon theupon the body dukewas there there was a letter who from go home i tell you i canti wonti must save you from yourself iduke he strikes at mehits me so that i stagger backand with an oath he speeds from me and is gone i recover myself and am on the point of giving mad chase when a thought strikes me and i rush into the building i have been all this time standing outside the door of chapter xxvii an unexpected meeting tearing up the steps i almost fell into the arms of our guide of the long hideous night can i see it i cried steady sir he said staying and supporting me with a hand whats up now i want to see itthere was a letteri all property found on the body is took possession of he saw it i tell you your friend there so he didbut he gave it over ill give it over i dont want to keep it man there was an address on itthere must have been i swear and if you dont let me know it therell be murderdo you understandmurder no doubt he did understand in such matters a policemans mind is intuitive come along then he said ill see what can be done and holding me along the elbow in the professional manner he led me through the building to a sort of outhouse that stood in a gloomy yard to the rear pushing open a door he bid me enter and wait while he went and communicated with the inspector the room i found myself in was like nothing so much as a ghastly species of scullery built with a formal view to cleanliness and ventilation all down its middle ran a long zinccovered table troughed slightly at the side and sloping gently like a fishmongers slab its purpose was evident in the drenched form that lay on it covered with a cloth and to this sordid pass had come she the loving and playful with whom i had wandered a few short weeks ago among the green glades of the old forest now more than the solemnity of death pronounced us apart i shivered and drew back and then was aware of a man washing his hands at a sink that stood to one end of the room he turned his head as he washed and looked at me now my man what is it he said he was lean formalfaced and spectacleda doctor by every uninviting sign of the profession i told him my business and referred shrinkingly to the thing lying hidden there there isnt i suppose anyany hope whatever oh dear no not the least he came toward me pruning and trimming his cold fingernails she has been in the water i should say quite eight hours or possibly nine he pulled the cloth down slightly with a speculative motion of his hand so as to expose the white rigid face i had no time to stop him before its sightless eyes were looking up at me oh dolly dolly such a fearful little woman and yet with the courage to bring yourself to this suddenly through the heart of my wild pity pierced a thought that had already once before stirred unrecognized in me doctor i said staring down on the poor lifeless face do the drowned always look like that certainly they do more or less but how more is it possible for instance for a person to halfdrown and then seemingly recover to be put to bed nearly himself again and yet be found dead in the morning how can i say in such a case there must be gross carelessness or quite unexpected complications but if i tell you i once heard of this happeningwas witness indeed of the fact the doctor lifted his shoulder adjusted his spectacles and shrugged himself with an awkward posture of skepticism how did he look he said dreadfulswollen horribly distorted his face was blackhis hands clenched he seemed to have died in great pain he gave a little scornful sniff do you want my opinion on that he cried wellhere it is it was a case for the police no drowned man ever looked after that fashion then you think he must have come to his death by other means and after he was put to bed i havent the least doubt about it whatsoever if it was all as you say i gave a thin sudden cry i couldnt help itit was forced from me then of my own act i pulled the cloth once more over the dead face it had spoken to me in such a manner as its love had never expressed in life you have vindicated me my sweetheart of the old days i murmured goodby dolly till i may witness your love that is undying in another world i think the doctor fancied that the trouble of the night had turned my brain what did it matter what he thoughtwhat anybody thought now i stood acquitted at the bar of my own conscience in my first knowledge of that stupendous relief i could find no place for one other sentiment but crazy gratitude as i stood halfstunned in the shock of emotion the officer i awaited entered the room bearing in his hand a slip of paper the letters detained he said but this heres the address its wrote from and youd better act upon it without delay with a tremendous effort i swept together my scattered faculties and took it from him it was not much information that the paper containedan address only from a certain nelson terrace in batterseabut such as it was i held it in common with duke whose sole advantage was a brief start of me calling back my thanks to the friendly constable i hurried into the street and so off and away in wild pursuit still as i ran a phantom voice went with me crying you did not kill himyour brother modred the rapture of it kept time to my hurrying footsteps it flew over and with me like the albatross of hope and brought the breeze of a healthfuler promise on its wings it spoke from the faces of people i passed as if they wished me to know as i swept by that i was no longer in their eyes a man of blood you did not kill him it sung in my brainyou did not kill himyou did not kill himthen all in a moment with a dying shock who did i stopped as if i had run against a wall i swear till then no shadowy thought of this side of the question had darkened my heart in passing still impelled to an awful haste i beat the whole horror resolutely to one side and rushed on my way presentlypresently i muttered i will sit down and rest and think it over from beginning to end by that time i was in a street of ugly cockney houses stretching monotonously on either side i was speeding down it seeking its name and convinced from my inquiries that i could not be far from my destination when something standing crouched against a low front garden wall where it met the angle of a tall brick gate post caught the tail of my eye and stopped me with a jerk it was duke and i had run him down he spat a curse from his drawn white lips as i faced him and bade me begone as i valued my life duke i panted watchful of him i do value it nownever mind why i value it far above his you have come to take but he is my brotherand you were once my friend no longeri swear it he cried blazing out on me dreadfully will you go while theres time then he assumed a mockery more bitter than his rage harkee he whispered this isnt the place i came here to be out of the way and rest ill go home by and by will you come with me now with you havent i had enough of you trenders i put it to you as a reasonable man as he spoke the wail of a young child came through the window of an upper room of the house adjoining at the sound he seized my wrists in one of his hands with the grip of iron forceps listen there he muttered thats his child do you hear he perpetuates his wicked race without a scruple wouldnt it be a good thing now to cut down the poisonous weed root and branch i stared at him in horror hardly till this moment had the fact of jasons being married recurred to me since i first heard of it the night before his child i echoed whats the fool gaping at would his pretty deception be complete without a wife and baby in the background to spur his fancy the door of the adjoining house was opened and a light footfall came down the steps i saw a devil leap into dukes eyes and on the instant sprung at him he had me down directly for his strength was fearful but i clutched him frantically as i fell and he couldnt shake me off strugglingsobbingwarding my head as best i could from his battering blowsi yet could find voice to cry from the groundjason in gods name run hes going to murder you up and down on the pavementbruised bleeding wrenched this way and that but never letting go my hold i felt my strength already exhausted by the long toiling of the night ebbing surely from me then in the moment of its final collapse the dreadful incubus was snatched from me and i rose halfblinded to my feet to see duke in the grasp of a couple of stalwart navvies who on their way to work had come to my assistance trapped and overcome he made no further struggle but submitted quietly to his captors his chest rising and falling convulsively dont let him go i panted he means murder weve got him fast enough said one burly fellow any bones broke master no said i im only a bit bruised renny said the prisoner in a low broken voice have you ever known me lie never what then tell them to take their hands off and ill go that wont do you may come back not till the inquests over is that a fair offer i can do nothing here now i only ask one thingthat i may speak a word standing at the gate to that skulking coward yonder i swear i wont touch him or pass inside the gate i turned to the two men ill answer for him now i said he never says what he doesnt mean you can let him go they did so reluctantly remonstrating a little and ready to pounce on him at once did he show sign of breaking his parole he picked up his hat and walked straight to the gate jason who had been standing on the upmost step of the flight that led to the open door regarding the strange struggle beneath him with starting eyes moved a pace or two nearer shelter with his head slewed backward in a hangdog fashion mr trender said duke in a hideous mocking voice miss dolly mellison sends her compliments and she drowned herself last night i could see my brother stagger where he stood and his face grow pale as a sheet i wont discuss the matter further just now went on the cripple as i am under promise to these gentlemen after the inquest i may perhaps have something to say to you he swept him a grotesque ironical bow another to us and walked off down the street when he was out of sight i turned to the men thanked them warmly for their assistance recompensed them to the best of my ability and ran up the steps to the house i found my brother inside leaning white and shaky against the wall i shut the door and addressed myself to him roughly come i said theres a necessity for action here where can we talk together how did you find me he said faintly it isnt true is itnonot therefor i was turning to the door of a back room that seemed to promise privacy where then i said impatiently hurry man this is no time for dallying he tried to pull himself together for the moment he seemed utterly unnerved jason cried a voice from the very room i had approached i dropped my stick with a crash on the floor whos that i said in a loud wavering voice the handle turned he came weakly from his corner to put himself before me it was too late for the door had opened and a woman with a baby in her arms was standing on the threshold and the woman was zyp chapter xxviii the tables turned in the first shock of the vision i did not realize to its full extent the profoundness of my brothers villainy or of my own loss indeed for the moment i was so numbed with amazement as to find place for no darker sentiment in my breast why its renny said zyp and my heart actually rose with a brief exultation to hear my name on her lips once more the game once taken out of his hands jason with characteristic sang froid withdrew into the background prepared to let the waters of destiny thunder over his head the very complication of the situation reacted upon him in such manner i think as to brace him up to a single defiance of fate from the moment zyp appeared he was almost his brazen self again zyp i muttered what are you doing here what a wife generally does in her husbands house old fellowgetting in the way it was my brother who spoke and in a moment the truth burst upon me you are married i said yes said zyp this is our baby you dog i cried i turned upon him madly you hound you dog zyp threw herself upon her knees on the threshold of the room yes she cried he is and i never knew it till two nights ago when the girl found her way here she didnt know he had a wife and it broke her heart i can understand that now but you mustnt hurt him renny the girl has drowned herself zyp and not for you renny he said it was you she loved and that he was the mediator was that a lie it was a lie i thought then it was i never believed him as i believed you but tell me you wont hurt himhes my husband swear on this renny with an infinitely pathetic action she held toward me the little bundle she had clasped all through in her arms it woke and wailed as she lifted it up it cries to you too she said my little zyp that pleads for her daddy jason gave a short ironical laugh sick at heart i motioned the young mother to rise not till you swear she said i swear zyp she got up then and led the way into the little dingy sittingroom from which she had issued a cradle stood by the fire and an empty feeding bottle lay on the table how strange it seemed that zyp should own them jason followed as far as the door where he stood leaning then in the cold light of morning i saw how wan was the face of the changeling of old days how piercing were her eyes how sadly had the mere animal beauty shrunk to make way for the soul you are brown renny she said with a pitiful attempt at gayety you look old and wise to us poor butterflies of existence oh said jason i see you are set for confidences and that im in the way ill go out for a walk stop i cried turning on him once more go as far as i am concerned and god grant i may never see your face again but understand one thing keep out of the way of the man i fought with just now for your sake he promised but even the promises of good and just men may fail under temptation keep out of his way i warn younow and always im obliged to you he answered in a highstrung voice it seems to be a choice of evils i prefer evil anyway in the open air i said not a word more and he left us and i heard the front door close on him then i turned to zyp with an agony i could not control and she was crooning over her baby zyp i oughtnt to say it i know butoh zyp i thought all these years you might be waiting for me hush renny you wrote so seldom andand i was a changeling you know and longed for light and pleasure and he seemed to promise themhe was so beautiful and so loving when he chose and you married him dad wouldnt hear of it sometimes i think renny he was your championdad i meanand wanted to keep me for you and the very suspicion made me rebellious and in the end we were married at a registrars office there in winton unknown to anybody how long ago was that it was last february and sometime in august dad found it out and there was a scene so jason brought me to london why what was he doing to keep a wife i know nothing about that such things never enter my head i think he always seemed to have money perhaps dad gave it to him he was afraid of jason im sure zyp why didnt you everwhy did none of you ever write to me about this why dad wrote renny i know he did the day we left he wanted you to come home again now he was alone to come home i never got the letter but he wrote im certain and didnt jason tell you he told me nothingi didnt even know he was married till yesterday i bent over the young wife as she sat rocking her baby zyp i must go my heart is very full of misery and confusion i must walk it off or sleep it off or i think perhaps i shall go mad did you love that girl renny no zyp i have never had but one love in my life and that i must say no more about i have to speak to you however about one who dida fierce strong man and utterly reckless when goaded to revenge he is a fellowworkman of minehe used to be my best friendand zyp his whole unselfish heart was given to this poor girl but it was her happiness he strove after and when he fancied that was centered in menot himhe sacrificed himself and urged me to win and i should have tried for i was very lonely in the world but that jasonyou know the truth already zypjason came and took her from me that was three months ago and last night she drowned herself zyp looked up at me her eyes were swimming in tears i suppose a better woman would leave such a husband she said with a pitiful sigh but i think of the little baby renny a true woman dear would remain with him as you will in his dark hour that is coming now that is what i want to warn you about in all terrible earnestness zyp this fierce man i told you about came here this morning to kill your husband i was in time to keep him back but that was only once a promise was forced from him that he would do nothing more until the inquest is over that promise unless he is dreadfully tempted he will keep i am sure but afterward jason wont be safe for an hour you must get him to leave here at once zyp she had risen and was staring at me with frightened eyes i could not help but act upon her terror dont delay move nowthis day if possible and go secretly and hide yourselves where he cant find you i dont think jason will be wanted at the inquest in any case he mustnt be found i say this with all the earnestness i am capable of i know the man and his nature and the hideous wrong he has suffered i wrote down my address and gave it to her remember i said if you ever want me to seek me there but come quietly and excite the least observation you can then gently i lifted the flannel from the tiny waxen face lying on her arm and kissing the pink lips for her mothers sake walked steadily from the room and shut the door behind me as i gained the hall jason returning let himself in by the front door he looked nervous and flustered for all his bravado he had found i suppose a very brief ordeal of the streets sufficient i should like a word with you i said before i go well he answered the atmosphere seems all mystery and righteousness come in here he preceded me into the front room and closed the door upon us then i looked him full in the face who killed modred i said he gave a great start then a laugh youre the one to answer that he said you lie as you always do my eyes have been opened at lastat last do you hear modred was never drowned he recovered and was killed by other means during the night his affectation of merriment stopped cut through at a blow a curious spasm twitched his face well he muttered looking down away from me that may be true and you none the less guilty a hateful answer and quite worthy of you i said quietly nevertheless you know it as well as i do to be a brutal falsehood i seized him by the shoulder and forced him to lift his hangdog face my god i whispered awfully i believe you killed him yourself it burst upon me with a shock why should he not have done it his resentment over zyps preference was as much of a motive with him as with meten thousand times more so taking his nature into account and the immunity from risk my deed had opened to him i remembered the scene by the river when zyp was drowning and my hand shook as i held him he sprung from me i didnti didnt he shrieked how dare you say such a thing oh i groaned shall i hand you over to duke straw when the time comes and be quit of you forever dont be a cruel brute he answered almost whimpering i didnt do it i tell you but perhaps he didnt die of drowning and i may have had my suspicions of me no nonot really of you upon my oath but some one else and yet all these years you have held the horror over my head and have made wicked capital out of it i wanted the changelingthat was why i threw him from me so that he staggered against the wall you are such a despicable beast i said that ill pollute my hands with you no longer answer me one thing more wheres the letter my father wrote to me when you were leaving winton it went to your old lodgings the man handed it to me to give to you when i called there and you tore it up yes i didnt want you to know zyp and i were married now ive done with you for zyps sake i give you the chance of escaping from the dreadful fate that awaits you if you get in that others way i warn younothing further for the rest never come near me again or look to me to hold out a finger of help to you beyond that if you breathe one more note of the hideous slander with which you have pursued me for years i go heart and soul with duke in destroying you you may be guilty of modreds death as you are in gods sight the murderer of that unhappy child who has gone to his judgment i didnt kill him he muttered again and with that without another word or look i left him chapter xxix a sudden determination the inquest was over the jury had returned a merciful verdict the mortal perishing part of poor weak and lovable dolly was put gently out of sight for the daisies to grow over by and by jason had been called but not responding and his presumed evidence being judged not necessarily material to the inquiry had escaped the responsibility of an examination and as i knew for the time being at least a deadlier risk mention of his name left an ugly stain on the proceedings and that was all now night after night alone with myself and my despair i sat brooding over the wreck and ruin of my life zyp so far as this life was concerned could never now be mine and full realization of this had burst upon me only at the moment when the moral barrier that had divided me from her was broken down that wound must forevermore eat like a cancer within me then in the worst writhing moments of my anguish a new savage lust of sleuth began to prickle and crawl over me like a leprosy if all else were taken from me i still had that interest to cheer me through lifethe hounding of my brothers murderer this feeling was curiously intermingled with a revival in my heart of loyalty to modred he had been my friendat least inextricably kin to me in a common cause against the world when i turned to the vile figure of the brother who survived the dead boys nearforgotten personality showed up in a light almost lovably humorous and pathetic my fevered soul bathed itself in the memory of his whimsicalities till very tenderness begot an oath that i would never rest till i had tracked down his destroyer and was jason that if it were so i could afford to stand aside for the present and leave him to the mercy of a deadlier nemesis he had summoned to his own undoing set coldly at the same time on a justice that should be passionless i bore in mind my brothers hint of a suspicion that involved some other person whom he left nameless this might beprobably wasa mere ruse to throw me off the scent in any case i should refuse to hold him acquitted in the absence of directer evidence still i could not stay a certain speculative wandering of my thoughts if not jasonwho then there were in the house that night but the usual family circle and dr crackenthorpe what possible temptation could induce any one of them to a deed so horrible jason alone of them had the temptation and the interest and above all the nature to act upon a hideous impulse on jason must lie the suspicion till he could prove himself innocent it was not until about the third night of my gloomy pondering that the sudden resolution was formed in me to leave everything and return to my father the fact of zyps reference to the letter he had sent me had been so completely absorbed in the tense excitement of the last few days that when in a moment it recurred to me i leaped to my feet and began pacing the room like a caged animal that scents freedom so the old man in his loneliness desired me back again why not go the accustomed life here seemed impossible to me any longer the notoriety attaching to these pitiful proceedings was already making my regular attendance at the office a sore trial duke had sent in his resignation the very morning of his attack on me before jasons house all old ties were rent and done with i was in a modest way financially independent for ripleys generous acknowledgment of my services coupled with my own frugal manner of life had enabled me to put into certain investments sufficient to produce an interest that would keep me at least from starvation and in addition how could i prosecute my secret inquiries better than on the very scene of the deed i would go my decision was sudden and final i would go then and there i sat down and wrote a brief letter to my father i have only within the last few days i said learned of the letter you wrote me three months ago jason destroyed it lest i should find out he was married to zyp i now tell you that i am ready to do as you wishto return and live with you if you still desire it in any case i can endure my present life here no longer upon receipt of a word from you i will come as i wrote the wind bringing clouds of rain with it was booming and thundering against the window soft weather had succeeded to the icebreathing blasts of a few days back and i thought of a lonely grave out there in the night of london and of how just now the water must be gushing in veins and runnels over its clayey barrow dollydolly may it wash clean your poor wounded heart after lifes fitful fever you sleep well while weoh shamed and fallen child which of us who walks straightly before our fellows would not forego passion and revenge and all the hot raptures of this bloodred world to lie down with you deep in the cool sweet earth and rest and forget i went out and posted my letter the streets were swept clean of their human refuse only a few belated vehicles trundled it out against the downpour setting their polished roofs as shields against the myriadpointed darts of the storm feeling nervous and upset i was approaching my own door when a figure started from a dark angle of the wall close by and stood before me duke i cried he was drenched with rain and mudhis dark clothes splashed and saturated from boot to collar his face in the drowned lamplight was white as wax but his eyes burned in rings of shadow i was shocked beyond expression at his dreadful appearance what have you been doing with yourself i cried duke come in for pitys sake and rest and let us talk with you he muttered in a mad grating voice with any trender i came to ask you where hes in hidingthats all i know no more than you do you lie youre keeping his secret for him what were her claims compared to family tiesdevils tiessuch as yours you know but you wont give him up to me i dont know he raised and ground his hands together in exquisite passion they drive me to madness he cried but in the endin the end i shall have him to hold him down and torture the life out of him inch by inch with the terror in his eyes all the time why i could kill him by that aloneby only looking at him he gloated over the picture called up in his soul if ever demons eyes looked from a human face they looked from his that night duke i whispered in horror you have terrible cause for hate i know but oh think of how one grain of forgiveness on your part would stand you withwith god duke he gave a wretched sickening laugh by and by he cried but tell me first where hes hiding i dont know i said duke and i held out a yearning hand to him at that he struck at me savagely and running crookedly into the night was lost in the rainy darkness chapter xxx i go home so much of strange incident had crowded with action the long years of my life in london that as i walked from the station down into the old cathedral town a feeling of wonder was on me that the hand of time had dealt so gently with the landmarks of my youth here were the same old gates and churches and houses i had known unaltered unless for an additional film of the fragrant lichen of age the very ruins of the ancient castle and palace were stone by stone such as i remembered them there was frost in the air too so that sometimes as i moved dreamily onward a sense as if all that gap of vivid life were a vanished vision and unreality moved strongly in me then it seemed that presently i should saunter into the old mill to find my father and zyp and jason sitting down as usual to the midday meal my appearance was so changed that none of all who would formerly have somewhat sourly acknowledged my passing with a nod now recognized me suddenly i caught sight of dr crackenthorpe moving on in front of me in company with another man the doctor was no more altered than his surroundings judged at least by his back view this presented the same long rusty coat of a chocolate colorrelic of a bygone generation i always thoughtcut after a slightly sporting fashion which he wore in all my memory of him throughout the winter halfwellington boots into which the ends of his trousers were tucked and a flattopped hard felt hat under the brim of which his lank tails of brickcolored hair fell in dry thin tassels the man he walked with seemed old and bent and he moved with a spiritless hesitating step that appeared to cause the other some impatience i was so far from claiming knowledge of this second person that when he turned his head aside a moment to gaze upon something as i came near it was with a most painful shock that i discovered it to be my father i hurried up calling to him he gave a great startthey both didand turned round to meet me then i was terribly taken aback to see the change that had come over him he whom four years ago i had left hale selfreliant powerful in body and intellect was to all appearance a halting and decrepit old man in whom the worst sign was the senile indecision of his eyes he came at me holding out both his hands in welcome with trembling eagerness and i was much moved to see some glint of tears furrowing his cheeks renalt my boyrenalt my boy he cried in a gladsome thin voice and that was all for he could find words for no more but stood looking up in my facei topped him nowwith a halfsearching halfdeprecating earnestness of perusal well dad i answered cheerfullyfor i would give no hint of surprise before the otheryou said come and here i am a brave fellowa brown strong man he was feeling me over as he spokerunning his thumb down the sinews of my handspinching the firm arm in my sleeve a strong man my boy he said i bred himhes my soni was the same myself once you find your father alteredeh mr bookbinder if he is at all doctor its nothing that wont improve on a little management and wholesome company well hes had plenty of mine then his states accounted for i said the long man looked at me with an expression not pleasant ay he said theres the old spirit forward again weve done very well without it since the last of the fry took themselves off its not company you batten on doctor i said but loneliness breeds other evils than coincollecting he stared at me a moment then took off his hat with an ironical sweep i mustnt forget my manners to a london rattle he said no doubt you pride yourself on a very pretty wit sir but while you talk my lunch grows cold so ill even take the liberty of wishing you goodmorning he walked off snapping his fingers on either side of him when he was gone i took my fathers arm and passed it through mine strong boy he said affectionatelythen whispered in my ear thats a terrible man renalt be careful before you offend him i looked at him in startled wonder this was not how he was used to speak i hold him as cheap as any other dog said i he patted my hand with a little sigh of comfortable admiration i want you at home he said all to myself im glad that youve come renalt its lonely in the old mill nowadays as we walked my heart was filled with remorseful pondering over the wrecked figure at my side why had i never known of this change in it what had caused it indeed gloomy sinister remembrances of my onetime suspicion of some nameless hold that the doctor had over my father stirred in me and woke a deep anger against fate were we all of us for no fault of our own to be forever stunted in our lives and oppressed by the malign influence of the place that had given us birth it was hateful and monstrous what fight could a human being show against foes who shot their poison from places beyond the limits of his understanding a trifle more aged lookinga trifle more crazy and dark and weatherstainedthe old mill looked to my returning vision and that was all the atmosphere of the place was cold and eerie and haunted as ever but a great feast awaited the returned prodigal the sittingroom table fairly sparkled with unwonted dainties of the season and a red fire crackled on the hearth my father pressed me into a chair he heaped good things upon my plate he could not do enough to prove the warmth of his welcome and the pathos of loneliness that underlay it heres to my strong son he cried pledging me gayly in a glass of weak wine and water my son that im feasting for all the doctorfor all the doctor i say the doctor dad he wouldnt have had it renalt he said it was throwing pearls before swine and most wicked waste i wouldnt listen to him this timenot i why what has he got to do with it hush he paused in his sipping and looked all about him with a fearful air of listening hes a secret man he whispered and the mills as full of ears as a kings palace i made no answer but went on with my meal though i had much ado to swallow it but to please my father i made a great show of enjoying what was put before me one thing i noticed with satisfaction and that was that my father drank sparingly and that only of wine watered to insipidity indeed i was to find that a complete change in him in this respect was not the least marvelous sign of the strange alteration in his temperament the meal over we drew our chairs to the fire and talked the afternoon away on desultory subjects by and by some shadowy spirit of his old intellectual self seemed to flash and flicker fitfully through his conversation the afternoon deepened into dusk strange phantoms wrought of the leaping flame came out of corners or danced from wall to ceiling and were gone he was in the midst of a fine flow of words descriptive of some metaphysical passages he had lately encountered in a book when his voice trailed off and died away he crept to me and whispered in my ear hes there behind the door i jumped to my feet rushed across the room andmet dr crackenthorpe on the threshold cant you come in like a decent visitor i cried stamping my foot on the floor he looked pale and i thought embarrassed and he backed a little before my onset why whats all this he said i walked straight up the stairs as a body should you made no noise i said black and wrathful what right have you to prowl into a private house in that fashion for a moment his face fell menacing but it clearedif such may express the lightening of those muddy featuresalmost immediately heres a fine reception he cried for one who comes to greet the returned prodigal in all good comradeship and to an old friend too you were never ours i muttered he plucked a bottle of gin from under his arm where he had been carrying it your father has given up the pernicious habit he said with a grin but i thought perhaps hed break his rule for once on such a stupendous occasion as this let us pledge you in a full bumper mr renalt pledge whom you like i answered surlily but dont ask a return from me i dont drink spirit then you miss a very exquisite and esthetic pleasure i may say try it this only time glasses mr trender i saw my father waver and guessed this unwonted liberality on the part of the doctor was calculated to some end of his own in an access of rage i seized the full bottle and spun it with all my might against the wooden wall of the room it crashed into a thousand flying splinters and the pungent liquor flooded the floor beneath for an instant the doctor stood quite dumfounded and went all the colors of the prism then he walked very gently to the door and turned on the threshold you were always an unlicked cub he said softly but this transcends all your past pleasantries i mean it too i said still in a towering passion i intend it as a hint that you had best keep away from here ive no cause to remember you with love and from this time understand youve no claim of friendship upon this household i will remember he said i always do perhaps ive another sort of claim though who knows he nodded at me grimly once or twice like an evil mandarin and walked off down the stairs i looked at my father he was sitting his hands clasping the elbows of his chair with a wild lost look upon his face what have you done he whispered renalt what have you done we are in that mans power to ruin us at a word chapter xxxi one mystery explained the explanation i had desired for the morrow i determined to bring about there and then i went and stood above the old man and looked down upon him dad i said softly once before if you remember i came to you heartfull of the question that i am now going to put to you again i was a boy then and likely you did right in refusing me your confidence now i am a man and dad a man whose soul has been badly wounded in its sore struggle with life he had drooped forward as i began but at this he raised his head and looked me earnestly in the eyes i know renalt it was i broke the bottle then as you have now you have taken the lead into your own hands what is it youd ask dont you know dad yes i know give me a little time and perhaps some day ill tell you why not now dad he seemed to muse a little space with his brows gone into furrows of calculation why not he muttered why not suddenly he leaned forward and said softly has it ever concerned you to think what might be the source of your fathers income i have thought of it dad many and many a time it wasnt for me to ask i have tried to force myself to believe that it came from our grandfather he was a just man renalt and a hard i married against his will and he never spoke to me afterward but the mill the mill he left to me as it had been left to him he would not in his justice deprive me of the means of living what my hands have wrought of this his may do he wrote but all his little personal estate he willed elsewhere and you never worked the mill for a time i worked it to some profit we began not all emptyhanded she brought a little with her my mother at the word he halfstarted from his chair and sunk back into it again his eyes blazed as i had not seen them do since my return for twenty years and more he shrieked that name has never been on your lipson the lips of any one of you i would have struck him down without pity that spoke it i stood looking at him amazed for a moment he seemed transformedtranslated out of his fallen selffor a moment and no more his passion left him quakingly ah he cried with a gasp and looked up at me beseechingyoure not offendedyou are not offended renalt no no i said impatiently you must tell me why dad you will wont you he answered with a sobbing moan you her son must not know havent i been faithful to her have i ever by word or sign dishonored her memory in her childrens earsmy boy have i i have never heard you mention her till now i have never dreamed of her but as a nameless shadow father let her be so always she wrecked my lifein a day she made me the dark brute you remember well i was not so always renalt this long degraded life of despair and the bestial drowning of it were her doinghers i tell you remorse it has struggled to master me and i have laughed it awayall these years i have laughed it away yet it was pitiful when she died a heart of stone would have wept to see her but mine was leadleadlead he dropped his head on his breast i stood darkly pondering in the quiet room there seemed a stir and rustling all round within the house as if ghostly footfalls were restlessly pacing out their haunting penance renalt said my father presently never speak of her never mention her by that name she passed and left me what i am i closed the mill and shut its door and that of my heart to every genial influence that might help it to forget i had no wish to forget in silence and solitariness i fed upon myself till i became like to a madman then i roused and went abroad more for i had a mission of search to attend to you never found him the words came to my lips instinctively how could i fail to interpret that part at least of the miserable secret to this daynever he answered preoccupiedsuddenly heedless of my assurance in so speaking a new light had come to his facean unfamiliar one i could have called it almost the reflection of cunningvanitya selfcomplacent smugness of retrospect but i found something else he cried with a twitching smirk what was that he leaned forward in a listening attitude hush he murmured was that a noise in the house i heard nothing dad he beckoned me to stand closerto stoop to him a jar of old greek and roman coins he fell back in his chair and stared up at me with frightened eyes the mystery was out and an awful dismay seized him that at length in one moment of sentiment he had parted with the secret that had been life to him what have i said he whispered stilly renalt you wont give any heed to the maundering of an old man i looked down on him pityingly dont fear me father i said almost with a groan i will never breathe a word of it to anybody good dear boy he answered smiling i can trust you i know you were always my favorite renalt and he broke off with a sudden sharp cry my favorite and he stared up at me my favorite so kings treat their favorites he passed a nervous hand across his forehead his wild eyes never leaving my face i could make nothing of his changing moods what about the jar of coins i said ah he muttered the odd expression degrading his features once more they were such a treasure it was never one mans lot to acquire before or sinceheavens compensation for the cruelty of the world where did you find them in an ancient barrow of the dead he whispered looking fearfully around himthere on the downs it had rained heavily and there had been a subsidence i was idly brooding and idly flung a stone through a rent in the soil it tinkled upon something i put in my hand and touched and brought away a disk of metal it was a golden coin i covered all up and returned at night unearthed the jar and brought it secretly home it was no great size but full to the throat of gold then i knew that life had found me a new lease of pleasure i hid the jar where no one could discover it and set about to enjoy the gift it came in good time the mill had ceased to yield my store of money was near spent i selected three or four of the likeliest coins and carried them to a man in london that bought such thingsa numismatist he called himself if he had any scruples he smothered them then and afterward in face of such treasures as it made his eyes shoot green to look upon he asked me at first where i had got them hunting about the downs i said that was the formula he never asked for more he gave me a good price for them one by one and made his heavier profit no doubt on each they yielded richly and went slowly they made an idle debauched man of me who forgot even his revenge in the glut of possession he seemed even then to accuse himself through an affectation rather than a conviction of avarice they went slowly he repeated tilltillrenalt i would have loved you as boy was never loved if you had killed that doctor as you killed he stopped and gave a thin cry of anguish i didnt kill modred father i know it now no noyou didnt he halfwhined in a cowering voice dont say i said it i caught myself up well talk about that presently the doctor that night you remember he cried passionately when i dropped a coin and he saw itthat was the beginning oh he has a hateful greed for such things a wicked suspicious nature he soon began cajoling threatening worming my secret out of me i had to silence him now and again or he would have exposed me to the world and wrenched my one devouring happiness from me you gave him some of the coins he has had enough to melt into a grill as big as st lawrences and he shall fry on it some day more than thatmore than that he clenched his hands in impotent fury there was one thing in the jar worth a souls ransoma cameo renalt that i swear was pricelessi who speak from intuitionnot knowledge the beauty of the old world was crystallized in it an emperor would have pawned his crown to buy it his words brought before me with a shock the night of modreds death when i had stood listening on the stairs one eveninga terrible evening renaltwhen i went to fetch a new bribe for him from the hidingplace he demanded it before he would move a finger to help that poor boy upstairs i found this cameo gone he swore he hadnt set eyes on it and to this day i believe he lied how can i tellhow can i tell twenty times a week perhaps my vice brought the secret almost within touch of discovery sometimes for days together i would carry this gem in my pocket and take it out when alone and gaze on it with exquisite rapture then for months it would lie safely hidden again if i had dropped and lost it in one of my fitsas he suggestedshould i have never heard of it again renalthe held out two trembling hands to meit was the darling of my heart find it for me and i will bless you forever he ended almost with a sob i could have wept myself over the pitiful degeneration of a noble intellect father you said he cajoledthreatened didnt you ever reveal to him where the jar was hid no a million times no he would have sucked me dry of the last coin he knew that i had made a rich findno more and on the strength of that vague surmise you have allowed him to blackmail you all these years he hung his head as if cruelly abashed you dont know the man as i do he cried in a low voice he is a devilnot a man i was utterly shocked and astounded well i said at length i wont ask you for your secret to share it with any one would kill the zest no doubt he lifted his head with a thin wail i put my hand gently on his shoulder dad i said i must never leave you again he seized my hand and kissed it harkee renalt he whispered many are gone but there are some left could i find out where the cameo is we would take it and what remains and leave this hateful placeyou and iand bury ourselves in some beautiful city under the world where none could find us and live in peace and comfort to the end peace can never be mine again father would you like to know why would you like to know what has made a sorrowful haunted man of me while you were living on at the old mill here these five years past tell me he said confide in this old broken selfish man who has that love in his heart to seek comfort for you where he can find none himself then standing up in the red dusk of the room i gave him my history nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice and he sat with face darkened from me and quivered only when he heard of jasons villainy and at the end he lifted up his voice and cried oh absolom my sonmy son absolom chapter xxxii old peggy the months that immediately followed my homecoming were passed by me in an aimless desultory temporizing with the vexed problems that unanswered were consuming my heart i roamed the country as of old and renewed my acquaintance with bird fish and insect starting to gather a collection of butterflies and mothsmany of which were local and rarewith the mere object of filling in the lapses of a restless ennui and in some dull gratitude to a pursuit that had helped me to a little degree of late success i rapidly rose to an interest in its formation that became i may say the then chief happiness of my life to my father also it brought in the arrangement and classification of specimens a certain innocent pleasure that helped to restore him to some healthier show of manliness moral and physical poor broken old man i would not now have stultified his pathetic confidence in me for the biggest bribe the world could hold out yet it must not be supposed i ever really for a moment lost sight of the main issues of a mystery that was bitten into my heart with an acid that no time could take the strength from sometime sooner or later i knew it would be revealed to me who it was that killed modred as to that lesser secret of the coinsit troubled me but little free of that dread of possible ruin that appeared to cling hauntingly to my father i was not disinclined to the belief that the complete dissipation of his bugbear estate might prove after all his moral salvation remove its source of irritation and would not the sore heal sometimes in the full pressure of this thought i found it almost in my mind to hunt and hunt until i found his hidingplace and to commit its remaining treasures to the earth or the waters then it would seem a base thing to doa mean advantage to take of his confidenceand i would put the thought from me still however i might decide ultimately this determination dwelt firmly and constantly in meto oppose by every means in my power any further levying of blackmail on the part of the doctor this unworthy eccentricity had not to my knowledge been near the mill since that night of my return that he presently found means nevertheless of communicating with his victim i was to find out by a simple chance june had come upon us leading this placidly monotonous life when returning one afternoon from a ramble after specimens i found my father sitting upstairs in a mood so preoccupied that he did not notice my entrance his head was bowed his left arm drooping over one end of the table suddenly hearing my footsteps in the room he started and a gold coin fell from his hand and spun and tinkled on the boards whats that i said he stooped and clutched it and hugging it to his breast looked up in my face with startled eyes but he gave no answer is it necessary to change another dad no he muttered a thought stung me like a wasp is it for a bribe i demanded still he kept silence father i said give it to me renalti cant i mustnt give it to me if you refusei threaten nothingbutgive it to me he held it forth in a shaking hand i took it and slipped it into my pocket now i said sternly i am going to see dr crackenthorpe he rose from his chair with a cry you are mad i tell you you can do nothingnothing it is time this ceased for good and all father i stand between you nowremember that you have to choose between me and that villain which is it to be renaltmy son it is for your sake i can look after my own interests which is it to be he dropped back into his chair with a groan go then he muttered and god help you i turned and left him my heart was blazing with a fierce resentment but i would not leave the house till my veins ran cooler for no advantage of temper should be on the side of that frosty bloodsucker i wandered downstairs past the door of the room of silence but the rough jeering of the wheel within drove me away to where i could be out of immediate earshot of it from the kitchen at the back came the broken whining voice of old peggy rottengoose who yet survived and waited upon the meager household with a ghoulish faithfulness that no time could impair the words of some sardonic song came sterilely from her withered lips she was apt at such grewsome ditties i saw three ravens up a tree heigho i saw three ravens up a tree and they were black as black could be all down by the greenwood side o i stuck my penknife in their hearts heigho i stuck my penknife in their hearts and the more i stuck it the blood gushed out all down by the greenwood side o i softly pushed open the door that stood ajar and looked in the old creature was sitting crooning in a chair a picture or print of some kind at which she was gazing in a sort of hungry ecstasy held out and down before her at arms length i stole on tiptoe behind her and sought to get a glimpse at that she devoured with her rheumy eyes why what are you doing with that peg i said with a start of surprise cunning even under the spur of sudden discomfiture she whipped the thing beneath her apron before she struggled to her feet and faced round upon me what ails ye renalt she wheezed in a voice like that of one winded by a blowto fright a body sich like you neednt be frightened unless you were doing something you shouldnt you know shud and shudnt she said her yellow under jaw scratched all over with fine wrinkles moving like a barbels i doesnt take my morals fro a trender you take all you can get peggy why not a picture with the rest my own nevvy she cried with an attenuated screamblessed son to amelia as were georges first wife and died o cramps o the cold dew from a shift hung out on st bartlemeys day now peggy i said sternly i saw that picture and it

hang in modreds room ye lie renalt she cried panting at me its amelias boyand maynt i enjoy the fruits o my own heritage let me look at it then and if im wrong ill ask your pardon keep arf she cried backing from me keep arf or ill tear your weasand wi my claws i made a little rush and clutched her she could not keep her promise without loosening her hold of the picture but she butted at me with her cap bobbing and dinted my shin with her vicious old toes then seeing it was all useless she crumpled the paper up into a ball and tossing it from her fell back in her chair and threw her apron over her head i dived for the picture and smoothed out its creases peggy i said i tuk iti tuk it wailed the old woman i tuk it fro the wall when i come up wi the blarnkets and nubbody were there to see why did you take it and why have you riddled it with holes like this she slipped down on her trembling knees dontee be hard on me renaltdontee i swear i were frighted myself at what i done i didnt

peggy youd no business to take the picture of course and still less to treat it like this but your natures a thieving one and i suppose you cant help it get off your knees its done and theres an end

like i thought maybe if ye saw it yed want to tell the old man upstairs and hes got the strong arm yet for all the worm in his brain i shant tell him this time but dont let me catch you handling any of our property again and i left the room a little flustered by my late tussle and hardly yet in a mood for the interview i clearly foresaw would be no amicable one i wandered out turning my footsteps not at present in the direction of the doctors house but toward that part of the river called the weirs which ran straight away from the mill front this was a pleasant picturesque stretch down which the water shaded by many stooping trees and bushes washed and gurgled brightly a railed pathway ran by it and to the same side cottages at intervals and little plats of flowering parterres it was a reach which unpreserved was much favored of the townsfolk for fishing a man was whipping the stream now in its broadest part and i stopped to watch him he was a rosy wellknit fellow of or so with a

servant was gadding probablyi tried the handle found it to be on the latch only and walked in the house was quiet as a desert save that from the doctors private consultingroom as he called it issued a little weak snoring sound i paused in the dusky passage before tapping at the closed door of this room the whole place was faintly stringent with the atmosphere that comes from a poor habit of ventilationan atmosphere like that emitted from crumbling old leatherbound folios a ragged strip of carpet so trodden up its middle to the very string as to give the impression of a cinderpath running between dully flowering borders climbed the flight of stairs before me and stretched itself upon the landing above in an exhausted condition in a shallow alcove to one side of me stood a gaunt and voiceless old grandfather clock a gasbrowned bust of pitt rendered ridiculous by a perfect skullcap of dust stood on a bracket over a door opposite and a few anatomical prints of a dark and melancholy cast broke the monotony of the yellow walls rendered none the less depressed in my errand by these dismal surroundings i pulled myself together and tapped roundly on the doctors door no response followed i knocked again and again without result at length i turned the handle and stepped of my own accord into the room he was sitting at the table half his body sprawled over it and an empty tumbler rolled from one of his hands overhead the row of murderers busts looked down upon him with every variety of unclean expression and seemed to prick their ears with sightless rapture over that bestial music of his soul the doors of a high cabinet that in other brief visits i had never seen but closely locked now stood open behind him revealing row upon row of shelves whereon hundreds of coins of many metals lay nicely arranged upon cotton wool a few of these also lay about him on the table and it was evident that a drunken slumber had overcome him while reviewing his mighty collection so deep was he in stupor that it was not until i hammered and shook the very table that he so much as stirred and it was only after i had slipped round and jogged him roughly on the shoulder that he came to himself then he dragged his long body up swaying a little at first and turning a stupid glazed eye on me two or three times and from me to the scattered coins and back again suddenly he scrambled to his feet and backed from me thieves he yelled thieves thatll do i said coolly im not the thief in this house dr crackenthorpe what are you doing here he cried in a furious voice how did you get in what do you want i want a word with youill tell you what when youre quieter as to getting in i knocked half a dozen times and could get no answer so i walked in curse the baggage he muttered cant i rely upon one of them ill twist her pretty neck for this you need twist nothing on my account if i had failed to catch you now i would have dogged you for the opportunity oh thats it is it he said with a laugh and a savage sneer well state your business and be off he spoke ferociously but on the instant seeing my eye caught by something lying on that part of the table his body had covered dived for it and had it in his grasp then with a backward sweep of his hand he closed the cabinet doors and stood facing me now sir he said dr crackenthorpe i answered you wont bully me away from my purpose im a better man than you and a stronger i believe but i wont begin by threatening and thats very kind he put in mockingly still wed better come to business dont you think im coming to it and straight whats that youve got in your hand what i intend to keep there is that all its a cameo you stole from my father dont take the trouble to deny it i dont take any trouble on your account my good fellow its a cameo as you very properly observe but it happens to belong to me by thieving ill swear now dr crackenthorpe i intend to make you disgorge that cameo together with one or two other trifles youve coerced my father into handing over to you no he said in the same jeering tone further than that i intend to put a stop here and at once to that blackmailing process youve carried on for a number of years blackmailings a very good word it implies a reciprocity of interests and how are you going to do all this you shall hear at the assizes maybe he gave a laughquite rich for him walked to the table picked up deliberately the coins lying strewn there stepped to the cabinet deposited all therein shut and locked it and put the key in his pocket now mr bookbinder he said facing me again youve a very pretty intelligence but youve not acquired in london that knowledge of the nine points of the law without which the tenth is empty talk heres a truism also thats escaped your matured observation and its called be sure of your facts before you speak am i not i cried contemptuously well see even a crichton may suffer trifling lapses of memory let me lead yours back to that melancholy morning of your departure from the parent nest let me recall to you the gist of a few sentences that passed between your father and myself prior to the advent of your amiable brother who was so hard on you some mention of a lost trifle was made then i believe and permission given me to keep it if i happened to alight upon it wasnt that so i can remember something of the sort i muttered gloomily ah so far so good now supposing that lost trifle were the very trinket your most observant eyes just now caught sight ofi dont say it was but we will presume so for the sake of argumentsupposing it were should i not be entitled to consider it my own you may be lying i said angrily probably you are where did you find it that is as much outside the question as your very offensive manner youve always been the bane of our house what do i care what you think of my manner the sharper it cuts the better pleased am i youve worked upon moods and weaknesses of the old man with your infernal cunning and got him under your thumb as you think dont be too sure youll find an enemy of very different caliber in me theres a law for blackmailers though you maynt think it he cocked his head on one side a moment like a vile carrion crow then came softly and pushed a lean finger at my breast and a law for fratricides he said quietly i laughed so disdainfully that he forgot himself on the instant in a wild burst of fury toad filthy poisonous viper he yelled you think to combat me with your pitiful little sword of brass have i overlooked your insolence dye think speak a word furtherone word you pestilent dog and ill smash you body and soul as i smash this glass in his rabid frenzy he actually seized and threw upon the floor the tumbler from which he had lately been drinking and putting his heavy heel on it crushed it into a thousand fragments oh he moaned his breath chattering like a dry leaf in the wind ill be even with you my friendill be even with you you dareyou dareyou dare you the poor dependent on my bounty whom i could wither with a word the law you call upon so glibly has a long arm for murderers you think a little lapse of years has made you safehe laughed wildlysafe holy saints in heaven ive only to step over to the police stationfive minutesand youre laid by the heels and a pretty collar weaving for your neck he checked himself in the torrent of his rage and lifted his hand menacingly harkee he cried i can do that and at a word i would now dye set your little tin plate against my bludgeon yes i said he seemed to doubt my answer as if his ears had misinterpreted it for he went on if you value your life keep out of my way take the lesson from your father he knew what i could do if i chose and he took the best means in his power to buy my silence i gave a cry of fierce triumph sothe secret is out it was to save me as he thought that my father parted with his treasure the blackmailer gave no answer i went and stood close up against him daring him with the manliness he lacked you are a contemptible dastardly poltroon i said with all the coldest scorn i could muster he started back a little if i had killed my brother in good reality i would go to my hanging with joy if the only alternative were buying my safety from such a slimy crawling reptile as you if he echoed with a pale effort at another laugh if was what i said pretty doctor you not to know as i have since found out that the boy died by other means than drowning in an ungovernable burst of fury i took him by the throat and drove him back against the tableand he offered no resistance you dog i cried oh you dog you dog you did know it of course and you had the devils heart to lie to my father and beat him down in the dust for your own filthy ends had i a hand in my brothers death you know i had not any more than youperhaps not so much on the snap of the thought i spurned him from me and staggered back why i cried staring at him standing cowering and sullen before me had you if the truth were known you were in the house that night he choked once or twice and smoothing down the apple in his throat with a nervous hand came out of his corner a pace or two you can put two and two together he said in a shrill voice defiant still but with a whining ring in it what interest could i possibly have in murdering your brother for the restyou may be right and you can say it and plume yourself upon having successfully traded on the lie yes he said with a recovering grin i think i can i turned from him sick at his mere presence and now said he i intend to trade upon the truth i forced myself to face round upon him again the boy he said looking down hatefully and shifting some papers on the table with his fingertips it was obvious to any but the merest ignoramus never died of drowning how then from the appearancesof strangulation i should say strangulation who do you want these trifles back ask your father first why he had modreds braces in his pocket the morning after he was very drunk that nightfuriously drunk and he left me alone in the parlor for awhile chapter xxxiv i visit a grave all that night i tossed and tossed in vain effort to court the sleep that should quench the fever in my racked and bewildered brain my errand had been a failure in every sense but the purely personal it had been a failure and now indeed that personal side was the one that least concerned me as to every other soul in whom i was interested it seemed that a single false step on my part might lead to the destruction of any one of them where could i look for the least comfort or assistance my father had glanced anxiously at me when i returned the evening before it has been as you prophesied i said the man is a devil he gave a heavy sigh and drooped his head what did he tell you he muttered he told me lies father i feel sure but he is too cunning a villain to play without a second card up his sleeve the old man raised imploring eyes to my face dad i cried is it true you have bought his silence all these years for my sake at that he rose to his feet suddenly no word of that he shrieked not a word i cant bear it i looked at him with my throat swelling ill not refer to it if you wish it i said gently i do wish it what does it amount to how could i do less very well dad ill keep my gratitude in my heart gratitude he seemed greatly excited his voice was broken with emotion gratitude to me for what for driving you from home for dealing out your inheritance piecemeal to that hungry vulture yonder you kill me with your cruelty father i cried amazed no no renalt you dont mean to be but you mustnt talk of ityou mustnt its a long knife in my soulevery word the one thing i might have done for youi failed in the wild girl renalt that you lovedoh a little more watchfulness on my part a little less selfishness might have saved her for you he broke down a moment then went on with a rough sob you think i love you and i want you to think it butif you only knew all i know enough i hold you nothing to blame in all you have referred to he waved me from him entreating me to leave him alone awhile and he was so unstrung that i thought it best to comply but now a new ghost shook my very soul in its walking and it was the specter of the blackmailers raising was it possiblewas it possible that my father that nightin some fit of drunken savagery i put the thought from me with loathing but it returned again and again one fair morning it occurred to me to go and look upon the grave i had never yet visited perhaps i thought i should find inspiration there this vengeful bewildered pursuiti did not know how long i should be able to endure it sometimes reviewing the latter i felt as if it would be best to abandon the chase right then to yield the chimera to fate to resolve as she might judge fit or never to resolve at all perhaps then the thought that only by running to earth the guilty could i vindicate the innocent would steel me more rigidly than ever in the old determination the ancient church in the yard of which modred was buried stands no great distance away upon a slope of the steep hill that shuts in the east quarter of winton as i passed from the road through the little gate in the yard boundaries a garden of green was about mean acre of tree and shrub and grass set thickly with flowering barrows and tombstones wrapped in lichen like velvet for the royal dead the old church stood in the midst as quiet and staid and peaceful there in its bower as if no restless life of a loud city hummed and echoed all about it i paused in indecision for the first time it occurred to me that i had made no inquiry as to the position of my brothers grave that i did not even know if the site of his restingplace was marked by stone or other humbler monument while i stood the sound of a voice cheerily singing came to me from the further side of a laurel bush that stood up from the grass a rood away i walked round it and came plump upon my philosophical friend of the weirs kneedeep in a grave that he was lustily excavating hullo i said and hullo he answered you seem to find your task a pleasant one said i ah he said what makes ee think thart now he leaned upon his spade and criticised me you sing at it dont you mebbe i do men sing sometimes ive heard when theyve got the horrors on em have you got the horrors then not in the sense o drink though mayhap ive had them too in my time he lifted his cap to scratch his forehead and resumed his former position lookee here he said i stand in a grave i do ive dug two fut down he could wake to a whisper so be as you laid him there did he lift his arm his fingers ud claw in the air like a forked rardish i go a fut deeperand hed struggle to bust himself out and not succeeding thered be a little swelling in the soil above there cracked like the top of a loaf i go another fut and hes safe to lie but hed hear arnything louder than a barts whistle yet at two yard hell rot as straight and dumb as a dead arder what then i said what then why this digging here week in week out i thinks to myself what if they buried me six feet deep some day before the life was out o me why should they why shouldnt they men have been buried quick before now and why not me i laughed but looking at him i noticed that his forehead was wet with beads of perspiration not called forth by his labor how long have you been digging graves i asked in a matter of way to help him recover his selfpossession six year come martlemas he resumed his work for awhile and i stood watching him and pondering presently i said you buried my brother then ay he answered heaving out a big clod of earth with an effort so strained that it seemed to twist his face into a sort of leering grin i was ill when my brother died i said and have lived since in london i dont know where he lies show me and ill give you the price of a drink he jumped out of the pit with alacrity and flung his coat over his shoulders tying the dangling arms across his breast tharts easy arned he cried hilariously come along and he clumped off across the grass see there he said suddenly stopping me and pointed to a mangy and neglected mound that lay under a corner of the yard wall is that it he looked at me a moment before he answered through all his heartiness there was a queer suggestion of craft in the fellows face that puzzled me it might be for its state he said but it isnt you may as soon grow beans in snow as grass on a murdered marns grave does a murdered man lie there ay a matter of ten year ago it may be he wur found one summer morn in a ditch by the battery yon and his skull split wi a billhook nubbody to this day knows his name or him as did it a grim tragedy to end in this quiet garden of death we moved on again not so far and my guide pointed down there he lies he said a poor shallow little heap of rough soil grown compact with years a few blades of rank grass standing up from it starved and stiff like the bristles on a hogs back all around the barrows stretched green and kindly only here and on that other were sordid desolation no stone no boards no longlifeless flower even to emphasize the irony of an epitaph nothing but entire indifference and the withering footmark of time i mind the day said the sexton looking ower the hedge yon i see vokes pig running wi a straw ins mouth we shall have rain says i and rain it did wi a will three o them came wi the coffinthe old marn and a young unhim ud be your brother nowand the long doctor fro chisll in the arternoon as i was garthering up my tools the old marn come back by hisself and chucked a sprig o vervn on the mound oho thinks i thatll be to keep the devil fro walking the storm druv up while he wur starnding there and sent him scuttling i tuk shelter i the church and when i come out by and by there wur the witchweed gonewashed fro the grave youll say and ill not contradict ye but the devil knows his own what do you mean he turned and spat behind him before answering he died o cold i the inside eh something of that sort the doctors certificate said so ah he took off his cap again and rubbed his hot head all over with a whisp of handkerchief supposing hed been laid two fut and no moreit wur a smarl matter arter the rain to bust the lid and stick his fingers through a small matter perhaps for a living man he glanced sidelong at me then gingerly pecked at the mound with his foot no grassll ever grow there said he that remains to be seen i took a sixpence from my pocket and held it out to him look here i said take this and ill give you one every week if youll do your best to make and keep it likelike the other graves he put out his hand instinctively but withdrew it empty no no he said its no marner o good try id rather not goodmarning to ye and he turned his back on me and walked straight off with his shoulders hunched up to his ears i watched his going moodily but with no great surprise it was small matter for wonder that modreds death should have roused uncanny suspicions among the ignorant and superstitious who knew of us the mystery that overhung our whole manner of life was sufficient to account for that for long after the sexton had resumed his workso long indeed that when i rose to go only his head and shoulders bobbed up and down above the rim of the pit he was diggingi sat on the grass beside that poor sterile mound and sought inspiration of it but no voice spoke to me from its depths chapter xxxv one sad visitor the autumn of that year broke upon us with sobbing winds and wild wet gusts of tempest laden with flying leaves in the choked trenches drowned grasses swayed and swung like torn skirt fringes of the meadows in the woods drenched leaves clung together and talked through the lulls of the devastation that was wrecking their aftermath of glory it had been blowing in soft irresistible onrushes all one dank october day and all day had i spent in the high woods that crown the gentle hills three or four miles to the southwest of the city the air in the long quiet glades was mystic with the smell of decay the heels of vanishing forms seemed to twinkle from tangled bends of undergrowth as i approached them then often in going by a spot i could have thought lately tenanted a sense would tingle through me as of something listening behind some aged trunk that stood back from my path gradually dark shut in and i must needs thread my way among the trees while some little show of light remained if i did not wish to be belated in the dense thickets it would not have troubled me greatly had this actually happened to yield my tired limbs and wearier soul to some bed of moss set in the heart of an antique wood seemed a blessed and most restful thing to do but the old man awaited me at home and thither my duty must carry me i had traversed a darkling alley of leafage treading noiseless on the spongy floor of it and was coming out into a little lap of treeinclosed lawn that it led to when i stopped in a moment and drew myself back with a start something was there before mea fantastic moving shape that footed the grass in a weird sinuous dance of intricate paces and waving arms and feet that hardly rustled on the dead leaves it was all wild elfin ineffably strange and unearthly i felt as if the dead past were revealed to me and that here i might lay down my burden and yield the poor residue of life to one last ecstasy dipping swaying now here now there about the dusky plat of lawn sometimes motionless for an instant so that its drooping skirts and long loosened hair made but one treelike figure of it again whirling into motion with its dark tresses flung abroadthe figure circled round to within a yard of where i was standing then in a loud tremulous tone i cried zyp and sprung into the open she gave a shriek craned her neck forward to gaze at me and falling upon her knees at my feet clasped her arms about me for a full minute we must have remained thus and i heard nothing but the breathless panting of the girl zyp i whispered at last what are you doing here in the name of heaven i wanted to see you renny i have walked all the way from southampton night came upon me as i was passing through the woodandand i couldnt help iti couldnt help it this mad dancing im so unhappy renny poor zyp is so unhappy does this look like it the elves caught me it was so lovely to shake off all the weight and the misery and the womanliness are you tired of being a woman zyp tired my heart aches so that i could die oh i hate it all no no renny dont believe me my little child my little little child how can i have her and not be a woman get up zyp and lets find our way out of this not till youve promised me where can we talk better the foolish people never dare to walk here at night you love the woods too renny oh why didnt i wait for you why why didnt i wait for you come we must go not till youve promised to help me i promise she caught my hand and kissed it as she knelt then rose to her feet and her dark eyes burned upon me in the gloom you didnt expect to see me how could i least of all here its on the road from southampton at least if it isnt the woods drew me and i couldnt help but go why have you come from southampton we fled there to escape him him who yet i had no need to ask that horrible man oh his white face and the eyes in it renny i think jason will die of that face i remembered dukes words and was silent it comes upon us in all places and at all hours wherever we go he finds means to track us and to followin the streets in churches where we sometimes sit now at windows staring in and never moving renny she came close up against me to whisper in my ear and put her arm round my neck like the zyp of old perhaps she was halfchangeling again in that atmosphere of woodland leafiness rennyonce he tried to poison jason oh zyp dont say that he didhe did jason was sitting by an open window in the dark and a tumbler of spirit and water was on the table by him he was leaning back in his chair as if asleep but he was really looking all the time from under his eyelids a hand came very gently through the window pinched something into the glass and went away again quite softly why didnt jason seize itcall outdo anything that wasnt abject and contemptible you dont know how the long strain has told upon him sometimes in the beginning he thought he must face it out for life or death and end the struggle but he isnt really brave i think no zyp he isnt and now it has gone too far all his spirit is broken he clings to me like a child he sits with his hand in mine staring and listening and dreadfully waiting and that other doesnt mean to kill him now i thinknot murder him i mean he sees he can do it more hideously by followingby only following and looking renny in a moment she bowed her head upon my arm and burst into a convulsive flood of crying i waited for the first of it to subside before i spoke again these almost the only tears i had ever known fall from her were eloquent of her change indeed oh she cried presently in a broken voice he didnt treat me well at firstmy husbandbut this piteous clinging to me nowsomething chokes she flung her head back from me and wrenched with her hands at the bosom of her dress as if the heart underneath were swollen to breaking then she tossed up her arms and drooping her head once more fell to a passion of weeping zyp i said quietly when she could hear me what is it you want me to do we want money renny she gasped still with fluttering sobs drying her eyes halffiercely as if in resentment of that brief selfabandonment he has no spirit to make it now as he used we have escaped to southampton intending to go abroad somewhere and lose ourselves and be lost we fled in a fright unthinking and now we can get no further youll help us renny wont you ill help you zyp now and always if you need italways as far as it is possible for me to we dont want muchenough to get away thats all if he could only be free a little while i think perhaps he might recover partly and be strong to seek for work it will take me a day or two so long oh renny i must go to london to raise it i cant possibly manage it otherwise she gave a heavy forlorn sigh i hope it wont come too late you can trust me dear not to delay a minute longer over it than is absolutely necessary you are the only one i can always trust she said with a little wan melancholy smile a sleek shine of moonlight was spreading so that i could see her face turned up to me you will come on to the mill zyp not now it is useless i hear my baby calling renny butwhat will you do walk back to southampton tonight part of the way at least when i get tired i shall sleep sleep where under some tree or bush where could i better zyp you mustnt anything might happen to you her face took a flash of scorn to mein the woods or the open fields you forget who i am renny no insistence or argument on my part could alter her determination return she would then and there well i said at last hopeless of shaking her how shall i convey the money to you jason shall come and fetch it jason yes i cant leave the child again besides it will be better for him to move and act than sit still always watching and waiting very well then let him come when he likes tomorrow i will get the money she came and took my hand and looked up in my face goodby you good man she said give me one kiss renny i stooped and touched her cheek with my lips that is for the baby i said and god bless zyp and the little one she backed from me a pace or two with her dark eyes dreaming did you think i could ever be like this renny i wonder if they will turn to me as they used she dropped upon her knees before a little plant of yellow woundwort that grew beside a tree she caressed it she murmured to it she gave it a dozen fond names in the strangest of elfin language it did not stir it remained just a quiet drowsy woodland thing ah she cried leaping to her feet its jealous of the baby what do i care she gave it a little slap with her hand wake up you sulky thing she criedim going to tell you something theres no flower like my baby in all the world chapter xxxvi i go to london i walked home that night in a dream the white road lay a long luminous ribbon before me the wet hedges were fragrant with scented mist there was only the sound in my ears of my own quick breathing but in my heart the echo of the sweet wild voice that had but now so thrilled and tortured me i thought of her swerving presently from her dreary road southward to sleep under some bush or briar fearless in her beautyfearless in her confidence of the rich nature about her that was so much her own she seemed a thing apart from the worlds evil a queenliest queen of fancy that had but to summon her good fellows if threatened sweet safety go with you my fairy i cried and crying stumbled over a poor doe rabbit sitting in the road with glazing eyes and the stab of the ferret tooth behind her ear zyp zyp i muttered gazing sorrowfully on the dying bunny are you as much earth after all as this poor hunted brute ah never never let your kinsfolk strike you through your motherhood i found my father sitting up for me amid the gusty lights and shadows of the old mill sittingroom he welcomed me with a joy that filled my heart with remorse at having left him so long alone dad i said i have seen zyp he only looked at me in wonder she was coming to implore my help to enable her andand her husband to escapeto get away abroad somewhere escape from what that manmy onetime friendthat i told you about he has pursued them all the year with deadly hatred jason is halfmad with terror of him it seems my fathers face darkened he summoned his own nemesis he said what do they wantmoney yes i promised her what i could afford tomorrow i must run up to london to raise it on what security a mortgage i suppose i have some small investments in house property he mused a little while it is better he said by and by to leave all that intact we must part with another coin or so renalt if you think it best father i wouldnt for my soul go back from my promise will you take them up and negotiate the business i grow feeble for these journeys of course i will if youll give me the necessary instructions he nodded ill have them ready for you tomorrow he said then for a long time he sat gazing gloomily on the floor where are they he said suddenly zyp and jason at southampton she walked from there and i met her in the woods she would come no further but started on her way back again how are you going to get the stuff to them then jason is coming here to fetch it he rose from his chair with startled eyes here coming here he cried renalt dont bring himdont let him father hes a bad fellowa wicked son hell drain us of all what the doctors left hell take dont let him come he spoke wildlyimploringly he held out his hands kneading the fingers together in an agony of emotion dad i said dont go on so youre overwrought with fancies how can he possibly help himself to more than we decide to give him try to pull yourself togetherto be your old strong self oh he moaned i do try but you know so little hes a brazen heartless wretch we shall die paupers his voice rose into a sort of shriek come i said firmly you must command yourself this is weak to a degree remember i am with you to look after your interestsyour peaceto defend you if necessary he only moaned again you dont know i know this i said that by zyps showing my brother is a broken manhelpless demoralizedin a pitiable state altogether he seemed to prick his ears somewhat at that if he must come he said if he must come watch himgrind him undernever let him think for an instant that he keeps the mastery he shall never have cause to claim that father he spoke no more but crept to his room presently and left me pondering his words far into the night later on as i lay awake in bed i heard his room door open softly and the sound of his footsteps on the stairs this however being no unfamiliar experience with us disturbed me not at all in the morning at breakfast he handed me a couple of ancient gold coins take these he said they should bring apiece his instructions as to the disposal of the relics i need not dwell upon their consignee a highly respectable tradesman in his line would no doubt consider any mention of his name a considerable breach of confidence i had my own opinion as to the laws of treasuretrove and he may have had his as to my father when armed with my fathers warranty i visited this amiable receiver i found him to be an austerelooking but pleasant gentleman with an evident enthusiasm for the scholarly side of his business he gave me the price my father had mentioned and bowed me to the door with a faint blush it was so early in the day by the time i had finished my business that deeming it not possible that jason could reach the mill before the evening at earliest i determined upon returning by an afternoon train that i might make a visit that had been in my mind since i first knew i was to revisit london it was to a dull and lonely cemetery out battersea way where a poor working girl lay at rest it was late in the afternoon when i came to the lodge gate of the burialplace and inquired there as to the position of the grave indeed in the quarter where i found her the graves lay so close that it seemed almost as if the coffins must touch underground my eyes filled with humble tears as i stood looking down on the thin green mound a little cross of stone stood at the head and on it d m and the date of her death the grave had been carefully tendedlovingly trimmed and weeded and coaxed to the greenest growth in those nine short months a little bush rose stood at the foot and on the breast of the hillock a bunch of rich fading flowers lay they must have been placed there within the last two or three days onlyby the same hands that had gardened the sprouting turfthat had raised the simple cross and written thereon the date of a great hearts breaking i placed my own sad token of autumn flowers nearer the foot of the mound and going to the cross bent and kissed it my eyes were so blinded my throat so strangled that for the moment i felt as if as i did so it put its arms about my neck and that dollys soft cheek was laid against mine i know that i rose peaceful with the assurance of pardon and that by and by that gentle unresting spirit was to extend to me once more in the passing of a dreadful peril the saving beneficence of its presence chapter xxxvii a face dark was falling as on my return i came within sound of the mill race i thought i could make out a little group of people leaning over the stone balustrade of the bridge as i approached such i found to be the case and among them dr crackenthorpe standing up gaunt in his long brown coat i was turning in at the yard when this individual hailed me and by doing so brought all the faces round in my direction i walked up to him well i said these good folk are curious its no affair of mine but half a minute ago there came a yell out of the old cabin yonder fit to wake the dead well i said again with a mighty assumption of coolness i hardly felt oh dont suppose i care it only seemed to me that some day perhaps youll have the place stoned about your ears if you dont let a little more light in a murmur went up from the halfdozen rustics and brainless idlers we dont warnt no drownding ghosteses in winton said a voice i went straight up to them dont you i said then youd best keep out of reach of them that can make you that and something worse i suppose some of you have cried out with the lumbago before now that warnt no lumbago cry master wasnt it now have you ever had it noi harsnt ill give you a good imitationand i made a rush at the fellow who spoke the crowd scattered and the man suddenly backing toppled over with a crack that brought a yell out of him see there i cried you scream before you are touched even a pretty fool you to gauge the meaning of any noise but your own gobbling over a slice of bread and bacon this was to the humor of the others who cackled hoarsely with laughter if you want to ask questions i said turning upon them put them to this doctor here who sits every day in a room with a row of murderers heads looking down upon him with that i walked off in a heat and was going toward the house when dr crackenthorpe came after me with a stride and a furious menace youll turn the tables will you he said in a suffocating voice some day my friendsome day i didnt answer him or even look his way but strode into the mill and banged the door in his face as i entered our sittingroom i found jason standing motionless in the shadow a few feet from my fathers chair the old man welcomed me with an agonized cry of rapture and endeavored to struggle to his feet but dropped back again as if exhausted i went and stood over him and he clung to one of my hands as a drowning man might who cried out just now i asked fiercely of jason he gulped and cleared his throat but could only point nervelessly at the cowering figure before him father what is the matter you wouldnt come renaltyou wouldnt come i prayed for you to come what has he been doing it was all the old horror over again send him away dont let him come near me i was falling distracted i turned to jason once more come out with it i said what have you been doing he strove to smile his face was ghastlypinched and lined nothing he said at last with a choking cluck in his throat i have done nothing dont believe him moaned my father he wanted all he wanted to sink me to ruin i wanted to ruin nobody cried my brother finding his voice in a wail of despair im desperate thats alldesperate to escapeand he offers me little more than hed give to a beggar i tell him im not far from one myself he wont believe it he threatened me renalt he brought the hideous time back again a light broke upon me as from a furnace door snapped open dad i said gently will you go to your room and leave the rest to me i helped him to his feetacross the room his eyes watched the other all the time it was pitiful to see his terror of him jason stood where he had planted himself waiting my return with hanging head and fingers laced in front of him i led the old man to the foot of the stairs then i returned to the room and stood before my brother i understand it all now i said in a straight quiet voice the some one else you suspected or pretended to was our father no answer while i was in london you traded upon this pretended knowledge to force money out of the old man no answer your silence will do what can i say but that it was like you to traffic upon a helpless mans miserable apprehensions for your own sordid endsand that man your father to do this while holding a like threat over anothers headyour brothersstill for your own pitiful ends and all the time who knows but you may be the murderer i am not the murderer you persist andand its too cruel cruel to you who killed modred i believe it was dad i believe upon my soul its a lie he thinks it himself anyhow is it any good saying to you that a man of his habits as he was then might be driven to believe anything of himself why did he have the braces in his pocket then he had carried the boy upstairsyou know that he had been bathing and his things were scattered it isnt all modred had discovered his secret in spite of myself i started what secret i said where the coins were hidden what coins for the first time he looked at me with a faint leer of cunning i wont condescend to prevaricate for any purpose i said i do know about the treasure because he told me himself but i swear i know to this day nothing about its hidingplace he looked at me curiously well he said modred had found it out anyway how do you know didnt he offer to give zyp something in exchange for a kiss that night we watched them out of the window go on it was gold i saw it he must have found his way to the store and stolen it maynt it be now that dad discovered he had been robbed and took the surest way to prevent it happening again noa thousand times i spoke stanchly but my heart felt sick within me he was silent so i said in a highstrung voice this was your manner of business during my absence that the way to the means that helped you up to london a miserable discovery for youfor i gather from your words you too found out about the hidingplace you had better have left it alonea million times you had better still he was silent did zyp know too nonot from my telling i cant answer for what she may have found out for herself she sees in the dark how much did you have from first to last but i suppose you helped yourself whenever you needed it i didnti swear i didnt i never put finger on the stuff till dad handed it over to me what right had he to keep us without a penny all those years when riches were there for the taking he could do what he liked with his own i conclude at any rate the end justified the means a pretty use you made of your vile extortiona bloody vengeance is the price you pay for it at that he gave a sudden cry im losti know it help me to escape renny help me to escape do you think you deserve that of me jason he dropped upon his knees an abject wailing figure i donti dont but youre generousrenalt i always thought you good and generous when i laughed at you most save me from that terror he strikes at me in the darki never know where his hideous face will show next he follows mehaunts metries to poison me to torture me to death oh renny help me answer me truly first for how long were you robbing the old man i may have had small sums of him for a yearnothing much when zyp and i made up our minds to go i bid for a larger and he gave it me he didnt know you were married he wouldnt hear of itits the truth he meant her for you i think and the worst threats i could use never shook him from his refusal to countenance us brave old man rennyhelp me for zyps sake i said sternlyyes were it not for her appeal i tell you plainly you might perish for me he looked so base kneeling there in his craven degradation that i could not forbear the stroke my father provides the means i said i went to london today to realize it here it is and make the most of it he took it from me with trembling hands ten pounds he said blankly no more isnt it enough enough to get away with not enough to find a living on across the water its all youll getthats final remember now that i stand here by my father always remember that when your fingers itch for hush moneyand remember who it was that was once my friend he rose and crept to the door with bowed head some old vein of tenderer feeling gushed warm in me jason i cried i forgive you for all you have done to me he turned and came back to me seized me by the wristand his eyes were moist with tears for pitys sake come a little way with me renny you dont know what i suffer a little way on your road do you mean yes i darent go by train he might be there i must walk and i dreadrenny supposing i should meet him on the way why thats nonsense havent you just come alone i was driven by the thought of what i was seeking then it was bad enough but now ive got it all nerve seems shaken out of me im afraid of the dark was this the stuff that villains are made of almost i could find it in me to soothe and comfort the poor terrified creature very well i said i will walk part of the way with you his wan cheek flushed with gratitude i got my hat and stick and ran up to my father to tell him whither i was off as i came downstairs again jason was disappearing into the loft where the stones were that stood opposite the sittingroom the wheel underneath was booming as usual and the great disks revolved softly with a rubbing noise i saw him go to the dim window that stood out as if hung up in the black atmosphere of the room a square of latticed gray it was evidently his intention to reconnoiter before starting for the window looked upon the bridge and the now lonely tail of the high street suddenly a sort of stifled rushing noise issued from his lips and he stole back on tiptoe to the passage without the room there in the weak lamplight he fell against the wall and his face was the color of straw paper and his lips were ashen hes there he said in a dreadful whisper hes standing on the bridge waiting for me chapter xxxviii a night pursuit i rushed across the room and looked out through the dim glass at first i could make out nothing until a faint form resolved itself suddenly into a face gray and set as the block of stone it looked over it never moved but remained thus as if it were a sculptured death designed to take stock forever with a petrified stare of the crumbling mill then as my eyes grew accustomed to the outlines i saw that it leaned down in reality with its chin resting on its hands that were crossed over the top of the parapet even at that distance i should have known the mouth though the whole pose of the figure were not visible to convince me jason looked at me like a dying man when i returned to him the full horror of a mortal fright than which nothing is more painful to witness spoke from his lungs that heaved as if the sweet air had become a palpable thing to enter within and imprison his soul from all hope of escape he tried to question me but only sunk back with a moan now i said you must summon all your resolution act promptly and in half an hour you will be beyond reach of him my own nerves were strung to devouring action a kind of exultation fired me to master this tyranny of pursuit whatever might be its justification the tactics of aggressive force should at least be open and human i thought you dont want to pass the night here he made a negative motion with his head i think youre right it might only be postponing the end will you place yourself in my hands he held out his arms to me imploringly very well now listen to me there he will remain in all likelihood for some time not knowing he is discovered we must give him the slipescape quietly at the back while he is intent on the front i could only make out that his white lips whispered you wont leave me not till all danger is past i promise you i went over the house and quietly tested that every bolt and catch was secure then i fetched a dram of spirit and made the poor demoralized wretch swallow it it brought a glint of color to his cheeka little firmness to his limbs another he whispered no i answered you want the nerve to act not the overconfidence that leads to a false step come together we stole to the rear of the building where the little platform hung above the race i locked the door behind us and pocketed the key now i said quietly and no hesitating follow me the stream here sought passage between the inclosed millhead with its tumbling bay and waste weirthe sluice of which i never remember to have seen shuton the one side and on the other the wall of an adjoining garden this last was not lofty but was too high to scale without fear of noise and the risk of attracting observation underneath the heavy pull of the water would have spun us like straws off our feet had we dropped into it there there was only one way and that i had calculated upon to the left some branches of a great sycamore tree overhung the wall the nearest of them some five feet out of reach climbing the rail of the platform i stood upon the outer edge and balanced myself for a spring it was no difficult task to an active man and in a moment i was bobbing and dipping above the black onrush of the water pointing out my feet with a vigorous oscillating action i next swung myself to a further branch which i clutched letting go the other here i dangled above a little silt of weed and gravel that stood forth the margin of the stream and onto it i dropped finding firm foothold and motioned to jason to follow he was like to have come to grief at the outset for from his nerves being shaky i suppose he sprung short of the first branch hitting at it frantically with his fingers only so that he fell with a bounding splash into the waters edge the pull had him in an instant and it would have been all up with him had i not foreseen the result while he was yet in midair and plunged for him luckily i still held on to the end of the second branch to which i clung with one hand while i seized his coat collar with the other for half a minute even then it was a struggle for life or death the stout wood i held to deciding the balance but at last he gained his feet and i was able to pull him wallowing and stumbling toward me it was not the depth of the water that so nearly overcame us for it ran hardly above his knees it was the mighty strength of it rushing onward to the wheel he would have paused to regain his breath but i allowed him no respite hurry i whispered who knows but he may have heard the splash he needed no further stimulus but pushed at me to proceed in a flurried agony of fear i tested the water on the further side of the little mound it was possible to struggle up against it along its edge and of that possibility we must make the best clutching at the wall with crooked fingers for any hope of support we moved up step by step until gradually the wicked hold slackened and we could make our way without bitter struggle presently to the right the wall opened to a slope of desert garden ground that ran up to an empty cottage standing on the fall of the hill above over to this we cautiously waded and climbed once more to dry land drenched and exhausted no pause might be ours yet however stooping almost to the earth we scurried up the slope passed the cottage and never stopped until we stood upon the road that skirts the base of the hill a moments breathing space now and a moments reflection downward the winding road led straight to the bridge and the very figure we were flying yet it was necessary to cross the head of this road somehow to reach the meadows that stretched over the lap of the low valley we must traverse before we could hit the southampton highway fortunately no moon was up to play traitor to our need i took my brother by the coat sleeve and led him onward he was trembling and shivering as if with an ague over the grass by way of the watery tracks we spedpassing at a stones throw the pool where modred had nearly met his death breaking out at last with a panting burst of relief into the solitary stretch of road running southward before us in the glimmering dark it went silent and lonely between its mothhaunted hedges and we took it with long strides my brother hurried by my side without a word subduing his breathing even as much as possible and walking with a light springing motion on his toes but now and again i saw him look back over his shoulder with an awful expression of listening it was after one of his turns that jason suddenly whipped a hand upon my arm and drew me to a stop listen he whispered and slewed his head round with a dry chirp in his throat faintlyvery faintly a step on the road behind us came to my ears hes following murmured my brother with a sort of despairing calmness nonsense i said how do you know its he its a public highway i do know hark to the step it was a little nearer there was a queer dragging sound in it was it possible that some demon inspired this terrible man to an awful species of clairvoyance how otherwise could he be on our tracks unless indeed the splash had informed him there was a gap in the hedge close by where we stood and not far from it in the field beyond a haystack looming gigantic in the dark with a rapid motion i dived pulling jason after meand stooping low we scurried for the shelter and threw ourselves into the loose stuff lying on the further side of it there lying crushed into the litter with what horror of emotion to one of us god alone may know we heard the shuffling footsteps come rapidly up the road as it neared the gap my brothers hand fell upon mine with a convulsive clutch it was stone cold and all clammy with the ooze of terror as the footstep passed he relaxed his hold and seemed to collapse i thought he had fainted but mercifully i was mistaken the step behind the hedge seemed to go a little further then die out all at once i thought he had passed beyond our hearing and lay still some moments longer listeninglistening through the faint rustling sounds of the night for assurance of our safety at length i was on the point of rising when a strained hideous screech broke from the figure beside me and i saw him sway up kneeling and totter sideways against the wall of hay with the sound of his voice i sprung to my feetand there was the pursuer come silently round the corner of the stack and gazing with gloating eyes upon his victim chapter xxxix a strange vigil had jason fainted as i thought he had his enemy would have been upon him before i was aware of his presence even as it was in an instant i had interposed my body between them for a full minute perhaps we remained thus like figures of stone before i found my voice you can go back i said never taking my eyes off him its too late he gave no answer nor did he change his position i wont appeal to you i said by any claim of old friendship to leave this poor wretch in peace if common humanity can make no way with you how shall any words of mine he made a little sidling movement to which i corresponded with a like youre welcome to measure your strength with mine i said youll have to do it before you can think to get at him he looked at me with glittering eyes as if debating my power to stop him duke i cried be merciful if his crime was great he has repented he spoke at last screwing out an ugly high little chuckle with a straining of his whole body like a cock crowing why so have i he said theres a place waiting for the two of us among the blessed saints while shes frying down below it was hers to forgive and she has forgiven i know be merciful and worthy of her you are to meet some day what can i do more disinterested then than send him repentant to sit with her theres a noble revenge to take if hed stopped in london id have allowed him a little longer perhaps but as he wants to escape i must make sure or the devil might have me by the leg you see all the time we spoke jason was cowering among the hay his breath sounding in quick gasps now he gave out a pitiful moan and duke bent his head waiting for a repetition as if it were music to him for the last time be merciful duke well so i will he spoke looking up at me with his head still bent sideways and in that position felt in one of his pockets if the gentleman will condescend to take this he said standing suddenly erect and holding out a little white paper packet in his hand i will go and welcome but i must see him swallow it first poison not at all a love potionnothing more duke stole toward me insidiously holding out the paper the moment he was within reach i struck it out of his hand while my arm was yet in the air he came with a rush at mecaught his foot in a projecting rootstaggered and fell with a sliding thump upon the grass keep behind i shouted to jason who was uttering incoherent cries and running to and fro like a thing smitten with a sunstroke he stopped at sound of my voice then came and clung to me feeling me to be his last hope for a moment duke lay as if stunned then slowly gathered himself together and rose to his feetrose only to collapse again with a snarling curse of agony he glowered up at us moaning and muttering and nursing his injured limb for so it seemed that in falling he had cruelly twisted and sprained one of his ankles when the truth broke upon me i turned round upon my brother with a great breath of gratitude and relief run i cried you can be miles away before he will be able to move even jason leaped from me his eyes staring maniacally you fool i cried go leave him to me you can be at southampton before he is out of the field here even if he is able to walk by morning which i doubt he has me to reckon with some little nerve came to him once standing outside the baneful influence of the eyes he dashed his hand across his forehead gave me one rapid wild glance of gratitude and renewed hope and turning ran for his life into the darkness as his footsteps clattered faintly down the road i returned to grapple with his enemy i almost stumbled over him as i turned the corner he had rolled and struggled so far in his rabid frenzy and now seeing me come back alone he set up a yell of rage reviling and cursing me and hurling impotent lightnings of hate after his escaped victim gradually the storm of his passion mouthed itself away and he lay silent on the ground like a dead thing then i moved to him knelt and softly pulled him by the sleeve duke shall i bind it up for you what my heart he spoke with his face in the grass bind it in a sling you foolits a heavy stoneand smite the accursed philistine on the forehead with it has this bitter trouble dehumanized you altogether do you blame me in this he was my brother and you were my friend what is the value of it all i would have crushed you like a beetle if you stood in my way to him deviltry is the only happiness i think he was beforehand with me in that what a poor idiot to let him be i might have enjoyed a minutes bliss for the price of my soul and now my only hope of it is by killing him that you shall never do if i can prevent it he rolled over on his back thrust his arms beneath his head and lay staring at me with deeply melancholy eyes lets cry an armistice for the night he said in a low gentle voice forever duke between us two why noton all questions but the one find some pity in your heart even for him never he jerked out an arm and shook it savagely at the sky never i gave a heavy sigh well i said lets look to your foot at least is he beyond my reach quite you can put it out of your head even if your limb were sound youd never catch him now with the morning they go abroad where to honestly i dont know you found him the funds yes he groaned and turned his face away for a moment i busied myself over his bruised ankle presently he said how long am i to lie here till i can see to cut you a stick from the hedge you wouldnt be able to limp a step without one very well will you sit by me as long as you like i have no likes or dislikes now renny and only one hate we wont talk of that not now this field is the neutral ground once outside it the armistice ends duke how can it be otherwise renny my old friend are you going to back me in the chase unless you do you must see that it is impossible for us to come together i see nothingfeel nothing but a vast interminable sorrow duke and iyou have a gentle hand renny so had she she bound up my wrist for me once when i had crushed it in the galleypuller shall we recall those days my heart swelled to hear him in this softened mood as i thought alas it was only a brief interval of lucidity in his madness ah if we could look beyond i finally answered with a deep sigh we canwe do imagination isnt guided by rule of thumb even here the promise dawns slowly scabs are thickest on the body when its healing of its fever they will fall off by and by for all the dismal shrieks that degeneration has seized us he closed his eyes and lay back upon his hands once more imagination was this ever my world there is a wide green forest and the murmur of its running brooks is all of faces sweet as flowers and voices that i know for i heard them long ago in a time before i existed here and i walk on free forever of the aching past the eternity of most beautiful possibilities and discoveries before me joyous all through but for one sad little longing that encumbers me not for longno not for long on a lawn fragrant with loving flowers and gathered here and there to deep silence by the stooping shadows i come upon hermy love my dear dear love and she kisses the sorrow from my eyes and holds me to her and whispers you have come at last his voice broke with a sob glancing at him i saw the tears running down his cheeks this grief was sacred from word of mine i rose softly and set to pacing the meadow at a little distance by and by when i returned i saw him sitting up the mood had passed but he was still gentle and human till dawn was faint in the sky we sat and talked the dark hours away the sun had risen and duke was watching something in the grass when suddenly he shook himself and turned to me cut me my stick renny he said the pilgrim must be journeying come home with me duke he shook his head look he said i have tried to read a lesson of a spider as bruce did i broke and tangled the little fellows web like a wanton and what did he do but roll the rubbish up into a ball and swallow it i cant get rid of my web in that way renny i did my utmost to hold him to his softer mind he would not listen but drove me from him cut me my stick he said or i shall have to crawl down the road on all fours i did his bidding sadly propped up by me on one side he was able with the help of his staff to limp painfully from the field outside it he sat himself down on the hedge bank goodmorning mr trender he said duke let me at least help you to the town not a step im obliged to you i shall get on very well by and by goodmorning i seized and shook his handit dropped listlessly from minehesitated looked in his face and turning from him strode sorrowfully off homeward chapter xl a story and its sequel nine months had passed since my parting with duke on the hillside and my life in the interval had flowed on with an easy uneventful monotony that was at least restorative to my turbulent soul we had not once heard during this stretch of time from jason or zyp and could only conclude that finding asylum in some remote corner of the world they would not risk discovery in it by word or sign letters like homing pigeons sometimes go astray duke had put in no second appearance dr crackenthorpe kept entirely aloof all the tragedy of that dark period crushed within a single year of existence seemed swept by and scattered like so much road dust only my father and i remained of the strutting and fretting actors to brood over the parts we had played and one of us was gray at heart forevermore and the other waxing halt and old and feeble now often i tried to put the vexing problem of my brothers death behind me and yet if i thought for a moment i had succeeded it was only to be conscious of a grinning skeleton at my back and in this year a strange and tragic thing happened in winton that was indirectly the cause in me of a fresh fungus growth of doubt and dark suspicion and it fell out in this wise some twenty years before when i was a mere child the story came to me later a great quarrel had taken place between two citizens of the old burg they were partners before the dispute in a flourishing business and the one of them who was ultimately worsted in the argument had been the benefactor of the man that triumphed the quarrel rose on some question as to the terms of their mutual agreement the partner who had been taken into the firm out of kindness claiming the right to oust the other by a certain date the technicalities of the matter were involved in a mass of obscurity but anyhow they went to law about it and the beneficiary won the case the other was forced to retire to all intents and purposes a ruined man but he bore with him a possession that no judge could deprive him ofa deep deadly hatred against the reptile whose fortunes he had made and who had so poisonously bitten him in return he was heard to declare that alive or dead he would have his enemy by the heel some day and no one doubted but that he meant it some months later as the successful partner was returning home from his office one winter night a pistol shot cracked behind him and he was constrained to measure his portly figure in the slush of the street there his late partner came and looked upon him and gave a weltering grunt like a satisfied hog and kicked the body and went his way but his victim was scarcely finished with in the manner he fancied the ball glancing from a lamppost had smashed the bones of his right heel only and he was merely feigning death when his enemy was retired he crawled home on his hands and knees leaving a sluggish trail of crimson behind him and once safe in the fortress of his household sent for the doctor and an inspector of police the wouldbe murderer was of course captured tried and sentenced to a twentyyear term of penal servitude he made no protest and took it all in the nature of things but before leaving the dock he repeatedlooking with a quiet smile on his becrutched and bandaged oppressor sitting pallidly in the courthis remarkable formula about alive or dead having him by the heel some day then he disappeared from wintons ken and for sixteen years the town knew him no more and his victim prospered exceedingly and walked far into the regions of wealth and honor for all a painful limp that seemed as if it should have impeded his advance at the end of this time a little local excitement was stirred by the return of the criminal out on ticketofleave and presenting all the appearance of a degraded battered and senile old man his onetime partnera town councilor by thenresented his intrusion exceedingly but finding him to be impervious apparently to the sting of memory and presumably harmless to sting any more on his own account he bestirred himself to quarter the driveling wreck on an almshousea proceeding which gained him much approval on the part of all but those who retained recollection of the origin of the quarrel in this happy asylum the poor ruin breathed his last within a month of its admission and the rubbish of it was buriednot in the pauper corner of some city cemetery as one might suppose but in the very yard of the cathedral itself for curiously enough the fading creature before his death had claimed lyingroom in a family vault sunk in that august inclosure and his claim was found to be a legitimate one i knew the place where he lay well for an end of the old vault they had opened for his accommodation tunneled under a pathway that cut the yard obliquely and passing along it ones feet hit out the spot in a low reverberating thud of two steps that spoke of hollowness beneath the gravel the july of the present year i write of being the fourth from that poor things death and burial was marked by one of the most terrific thunderstorms that have ever in my memory visited winton if there was one man abroad in those bitter hours there was one only i should say and he paid a grewsome price for his temerity he was returning home from a birthday party was that fated councilor and fired with a dutch courage must have taken that very path across the yard under which his once partner lay and which he generally for some good reason rather avoided what followed he might never describe himself for that was the last of him but a strange and eerie scene met the sight of an early riser abroad in the yard the next morning it appeared that a bolt had struck and wrenched a huge limb from one of the great lime trees skirting the path that the heavy butt of this clapping down upon that spot of the gravel under which the end of the vault lay had splintered the massive lid stone into half a dozen pieces so that they collapsed and fell inward crashing upon and breaking open in their fall the paupers coffin underneath whom god seeks to destroy he first maddens into this awful trap in the rain and storm and darkness mr councilor walked plump and there he was found in the morning dead and ghastly his already oncewounded leg caught in a crevice made by the broken stone and woodhis heel actually resting in the bony hand of his enemy who had waited for him so long all that by the way it was a grim enough story by itself no doubt but i mention it only here as bearing indirectly upon a little matter of my own old peggy had retailed it to me with much grisly decoration on the afternoon following the night of the tempest the thorns of her mind were stored with a wriggling halfhundred of such tales by and by i walked out to visit the scene of the tragedy it was dark and gloomy and still threatening storm there was little left of the ruin of the night the fallen branch had been sawed to lengths and carted away and only its litter remained the vault had been covered in again with a great slab lifted and brought from one of the precinct pathways that were paved with ancient gravestones a solitary man was raking and trimming the gravel over the restored surface the crowds who no doubt had visited the spot during the day were dwindled to a halfdozen morbid idlers and a sweeping flaw of tempest breaking suddenly from the clouds even as i approached drove the last of these to shelter i myself scuttled for a long low tunnel that pierced a south wing of the cathedral and promised the best cover available this was to be reached by way of a doublearched portal which enjoyed the distinction of conveying illluck to any who should have the temerity to walk through a certain one of its two openings turning when i reached the archway i saw that the solitary gravetrimmer was running for the same shelter as myself with head bent to the storm he bolted through the gate of illomen stopped recognized his error hurriedly retraced his steps spat out the evil and came through the customary opening at slower pace as he approached me i saw what i had not noticed before that he was my friend the sexton of st johns goodafternoon said i as he walked under the tunnel seized off his cap and jerked the rain drops from it i fancied there was a queer wild look on his face and at first he hardly seemed to be able to make me out ah he said suddenly goodarternoon to you even then he didnt look at but beyond me following with his bloodshot eyes as it were the movements of something on the stone wall at my back so youre translated it appears eh he said vaguely youre promoted to the yard here arent you i come to oblige jem sweet ars be down wi the arsmer he said that was friendly anyhow it was an unchancy task you took upon yourself what isnt he shouted quite fiercely all in a moment give me another marn asll walk all day wi the devil arm in arm as i does you found him down there eh he took off his cap and flung it with quick violence at the wall behind me then pounced upon it lying on the ground as if something were caught underneath it my he muttered rising with the air of a schoolboy who has captured a butterfly and seeking to investigate his prize made a frantic clutch in the air as if it had escaped him whats that said i a wasp a warsp he cried in a sort of furious fright who ever see a pink warsp wi a mouth like a purse and blue inside he stood by me shaking and perspiring and suddenly seized me with a tremulous hand they shudnt a sent me down there he whispered it give me the horrors it did to see that theyd burried him quick and that for fower year hed been struggling and wrenching to get out im afraid that the devils got you indeed my friend its all along o thart he come and he looked down upon me there in the pit who did the devil him or thart chisll doctor its all one i swat cold i tell ye i see his face make a ugly fiddlepattern on the sky my mate hed gone to dinner and the yard was nigh empty lookee here i whispered up to him he were burried quick as they burried that boy over in st johns yonder that you murdered chapter xli across the water for an instant the blood in my arteries seemed to stop so that i gasped when i tried to speak what boy was that i said in a forced voice when i could command myself what boyehwhat boy his eyes were wandering up and down the wall again him i say as they burried quickyoung trender o the mill how do you know he was buried alive how could he have been if he was murdered how do i know he were murdered i say im george white the sextonand what i knows i knows and the doctor murdered him dont i say so he had hardly spoken when he put his hand to his head moved a step back and stood staring at me with horrorstricken injected eyes my god he muttered he whispered there into the pit that if i said to another what i said to him i were as good as a dead man the panic increased in him i could see the tortured soul moving as it were behind the flesh of his face when the nerve of endurance snapped he staggered and fell forward in a fit helpless to minister to a convulsion that must find its treatment in the delirium ward of a hospital i ran to the police station which was but a short distance away and gave information of the seizure i had witnessed a stretcher was sent for the poor racked wretch he was carried away spluttering and writhing and so for the time being my chance of questioning him further was ended now plainly and solemnly had i been face to face with an awful fragment of the truth or had i been but the chance hearer of certain delirious ravings on the part of a drinksodden wretchravings as baseless as the unsubstantial horror at which he had flung his cap that the latter seemed the more probable was due to an obvious inconsistency on the part of the halfinsane creature if the boy had been murdered how could he have been buried alive moreover it was evident that the sexton was near a monomaniac on the subject of living interments moreover secondly it was altogether improbable and not to be accounted for that the keenwitted doctor should intrust a secret so perilous to such a confederate and what object had he to gain by the destruction of modred beyond the satisfying of a little private malice perhaps an object quite incompatible with the fearful danger of the deed on the other hand i could not but recall darkly that the sexton on the morning when apparently sane and sensible he had conducted me to my brothers grave had thrown out certain vague hints and implications which hardly noticed by me at the time assumed a lurider aspect in the light of his more definite charge that by zyps statement to me after my illness it would seem that dr crackenthorpe had shown some eagerness and made voluntary offer of his services in the matter of hushing up the whole question of modreds death that it was not impossible that he also had discovered the boys knowledge of the secret of the hidingplace and had jumped at a ready opportunity for silencing forever an unwelcome confederate stung to sudden anxious fervor by this last thought i broke into a hurried walk striving by vigorous motion to coax into consistent order of progression the dread hypothesis that so tore and worried my mind suddenly i found that striding on preoccupied i was entering that part of the meadowland wherein lay the pool of uncanny memories it shone there before me like a silver rent in the grass the shadow of a solitary willow smudged upon its surface and against the trunk of the tree that stood on the further side of the water a long dusky figure was leaning motionless it was that of the man who was most in my thoughts and looking at him even at that distance something repellant in his aspect seemed to connect him fittingly with the stormy twilight around him that was imaged in my soul straight i walked down to the waters edge and hailed him and though he made no response i saw consciousness of my presence stir in him i want a word with you i called shall i shout it across the river he slowly detached himself from his position and sauntered down to the margin over against me proclaim all from the housetops where i am concerned he answered in a loud voice who is it wants me and what has he to say you know me i suppose i have not that pleasure i believe never mind i have just come from talk with a confederate of yoursthe sexton of st johns i know the man certainly is he in need of my services he would say god forbid to that i fancy hes had enough of you maybe oh in what way in the way of silencing awkward witnesses pray be a trifle less obscure i have this moment left him he was seized with a fit of some sort hed rather have the devil himself to wait upon him than you i expect why so i had some talk with him before he went off his head do you wish to know what he charged you with certainly i do murder dr crackenthorpe looked at me across the water a long minute then never taking his eyes off my face lifted up the skirts of his coat and began to shamble and jerk out the most ludicrous parody of a dance i have ever seen then all of a sudden he stopped and was doubled up in a suffocating cackle of laughter presently recovering himself he walked off down the bank to a point where the stream narrowed and motioned me to come opposite him its not from fear of you and your sexton he explained still gasping out the dry dust of his humor your exquisite pleasantry has weakened my vocal chordsthats all i treated him to a long stare of most sovereign contempt for all his assumed enjoyment i fancied he was pretty observant of my mood and that he was calculating the nature of the charge i had fired at him and whom did i murder he said making a great show of mopping his face with his handkerchief say it was my brother modred im glad for your sake to hear you qualify it you should be that there is no witness to this gross slander i presume you to be then one of that pleasant family of trender who have a local reputation none of the sweetest he came down close to the waters edgewe were but a little distance apart thereand shook a long finger at me my friend my friend he said sternly your excuse must be the hotheadedness of youth for the sake of your father who once enjoyed my patronage i will forbear answering a fool according to his folly for his sake i will be gentle and convincing where it is my plain duty i am afraid to chastise this man you speak of is a heavy drinker and is now by your own showing on the verge of delirium tremens do you take the gross imaginings of such a person for gospel dr crackenthorpe i said quietly your threats fall on stony ground i admit the man is hardly responsible for his statements at the present moment only as it happens i have met and spoken with him before i thought i could see in the gathering darkness his lips suck inward as if with a twitch of pain and did he charge me then with murdering your brother he said what viewed in the light of his after outburst has awakened grave suspicions in me he threw back his head with a fresh cackle of laughter suspicions he cried is that all its natural to have them perhaps i had mine of you once you know you lie there of course by your own confession you lie and now he went on ignoring my interruption they are diverted to another will you answer me a question or two if they are put with a proper sense of decorum i will give them my consideration do you know where my father keeps the treasure the bulk of which you have robbed him of most offensively worded but i will humor you i never had needhe shot out an evil smileof obtaining my share of the good things by other than legitimate means do you know no i dont upon the honor of a gentleman did my brother thats dead know really you tempt me to romance to satisfy your craving for information i was not in your brothers confidence was there the least doubt that my brother was dead when he was buried ah i see you have been hunting chimeras in george whites company it is the mans werewolf my good friend you may take my professional certificate that no such thing happened i looked at him my soul lowering with doubt and the gloom of baffled vengeance have you anything further to ask he said with mocking politeness any other insane witness to cite on behalf of this base and baseless prosecution none at present i turned and walked a step or two intending to leave him without another word but on a thought strode back to the waterside listen you i cried for the time you are quit of me but bear in mind that i never rest or waver in my purpose till i have found who it was that killed my brother with that i went from him chapter xlii jasons second visit it behooves me now to pass over a period of two years during which so little happened that bore directly upon the fortunes of any concerned in this lamentable history that to touch upon them would be to specify merely the matteroffact occurrences of ordinary daily life to me they were an experience of peace and rest such as i had never yet known i thinka long sleep on the broad sands of forgetfulness whitherward the storm had cast me and from which it was to tear me by and by with redoubled fury and mangle and devour my heart in gluttonous ferocity as yet however the moment had not come and i lived and went my way in peace and resignation the first forewarning came one september afternoon of that second year of rest i had been butterflyhunting about the meadows that lay to the west of the city when a particularly fine specimen of the second brood of brimstone tempted me over some railings that hedged in the ridge of a railway cutting that here bisected the chalky slopes of pasture land i was cautiously approaching my settled quarry net in hand when i started with an exclamation that lost me my prize on the metals some distance below a man whose attitude seemed somehow familiar to me was standing i shaded my eyes with my hand and looked down with bewilderment and a little fear constricting my heart he stood very still staring up the line and a thickness came in my throat so that i could not for the moment call to him as i wanted to for there was an ominous suggestion in his posture that sent a wave of sickness through mea suggestion of rigid expectation like that one might fancy a victim of the old reign of terror would have shown as he waited his turn on the guillotine and as i paused in indecisionat that moment came a surging rumble and a puff of steam from a dip in the hills a hundred yards away and the figure threw itself down with its neck stretched over the shining vein of iron that ran in front of it and i cried jason in a nightmare voice and had hardly strength to turn my head away from the sight that i knew was coming yet through all my sick panic the shadow of a thought flashedblame me for it who willlet me bear it and not give way for he is taking the sure way to end his terror the thunder of the monster death came with the thoughtshook the air of the hillsbroke into a piercing scream of triumph as it rushed down on its victimpassed and clanged away among the hollows as if the crushed mass in its jaws were choking it to silence then i brushed the blind horror from my eyes and looked down he was lying on the chalk of the embankment below me he was stirring he sat up and looked about him with a bewildered stare the tragedy had ended in bathos after all at the last moment courage had failed the poor wretch and he had leaped from the hurtling doom shaking all over i scrambled slipping and rolling down the slope and landed on my feet before him up i cried up dont wait to speak or explain theyll telegraph from the next stoppingplace and youll be laid by the heels for attempted suicide he rose staggering and halffell against me renny he whimpered in a thick voice and clutched at my shoulders to steady himself my god i nearly did itdidnt i come away i tell you itll be too late in another halfhour i ran him shambling and stumbling down the cutting till we had made a halfcircuit of the town and were able to enter it at a point due east to that we had left then at last on the slope of that quiet road we had crossed when escaping from duke i paused to gather breath and regard this returned brother of mine it was a sorry spectacle that met my vision a personality pitiably fallen and degraded during those thirty months or so of absence it was not only that the mere animal beauty of it was coarsened and debauched into a parody of itself but that its informing spirit was so blunted by indulgence as to have lost forever that pathetic dignity of despair with which a hounding persecution had once inspired it as i looked at him at his dull bloodshot eyes and loose pendulous lower lip my heart hardened despite myself and i had difficulty in addressing him with any show of civility now i said what next he stared at me quite expressionless and swayed where he stood he was stupid and sodden with drink it was evident lets go home he said im heavy for sleep as a hedgehog in the sun i set my lips and pushed him onward it was hopeless entirely to think of questioning him as to the reason of his sudden reappearance and under such circumstances in his present state the most i could do was to get him within the mill as quietly as possible and settle him somewhere to sleep off his debauch in this i was successful beyond my expectations and not even my father who lay resting in his roomas he often did now in the hot afternoonsknew of his return till late in the evening in the fresh gloom of the evening he stirred and woke his brain was still clouded but he was in i supposed such right senses as he ever enjoyed now at the sound of his moving i came and stood over him he stared at me for a long time in silence as he lay do you know where you are i said at last rennyby the saints he spoke in a dry parched whisper its the mill isnt it yes its the mill i brought you here filthy with drink after youd tried to throw yourself under a train and thought better of it he struggled wildly into a sitting posture and his eyelids blinked with horror i thought of it all the way in the traincoming upfrom london he said in a shrill undervoice when i got out at the station i had some morethe last straw i supposefor i wandered and found myself above the placeand the devil drove me down to do it well you repented it seems i couldntwhen i heard it and the very wind of it seemed to tear at me as it passed what brings you to london i thought you were still abroad what drove me what always drives me that cruel persecuting demon he found you out over there then i cant hide from him ive never had a week of rest and peace after that first year it was all right then i threw upon the green cloth the miserable surplus of the stuff you lent me and won for six months we lived like fighting cocks we dressed the young un in the color that brought us luck my soul shes a promising chick renny youre her uncle you know you cant go back from that where did he come across you in a kursaal at homburg we were down in the mouth then six weeks of lentils and sour bread i saw him looking at me across the petits chevaux tablecurse his brutes face we never got rid of him after that give me some drink my hearts dancing like a pea on a drum theres water on the washhand stand dont talk like that theres a fire here no water can reach i see there is youve added another strand to the rope thats dragging you down he fell back on the bed writhing and moaning whats the good of moralizing with a poor fool condemned to perdition its my only means of escaping out of hell for a moment sometimes with that in me im a man again a man thereget it for me like a dear old chap and dont talk its so easy for a saint to point a moral he was so obviously on the verge of utter collapse that i felt the lesser responsibility would be to humor him i fetched what he begged for and he gulped down a wineglassful of the raw stuff now i said are you better a little drop more and im a peacock with my tail up he tossed off a second dose of almost like proportion now he said dangling his legs over the bedside and giving a foolish reckless laugh question mon frre and i will answer though his manner disgusted and repelled me i must needs get to the root of things you fled from him to england again to london of all places its the safest in the world they say where a man may leave his wife and live in the next street for twentyfive years without her knowing it you havent left yours nowe stick together zyps trumps she is you longfaced moralizer not that she holds one by her looks any longer and thats to my credit for sticking to her you missed something in my being beforehand with you there i can tell you was this pitiful creature worth one thrill of passion or resentment i let him go on for months that devil followed us he said at last he forced a quarrel upon me in some vile drinkingplace and brought me a challenge from the man he was seconding you should have seen his face as he handed it to me it took all the fighting nerve out of me i swear i would have stood up to his fellow if he had found another backer and you ran away what else could i do and he pursued you again there isnt any doubt of itthough his dreadful face hasnt appeared to me as yet you had the nerve it seems to travel down here all alone i borrowed it sometimes now when the stuff runs warm in me i feel almost as if i could turn upon him and defy him im in the mood at this moment why doesnt he come when im ready for him oh the brute the miserable cowardly brute he jumped to his feet gnashing his teeth and shaking his fists convulsively in the air as he stood thus the door of the room opened and i turned to see my father fall forward upon his face with a bitter cry chapter xliii another respite jason stood looking stupidly down on the prostrate form while i ran to it and struggled to turn it over and up into a sitting posture father i cried im heredont you know methen i turned fiercely to my brother and bade him shift his position out of the range of the staring eyes whats the matter he muttered sullenly ive done no harm cant he see me even without going off into a fit get further away do you hear he shambled aside murmuring to himself a little tremulous sigh issued from the throat of the poor stricken figure i leaned over seized the bottle of brandy from the bed and moistened his lips with a few drops from it does that do you good dad he nodded i could make out that he was trying to speak and bent my head to the weak whisper i saw somebody i knowi know never mind that now leave it all to me youre my good son you wont let him rob me renny in an hour or two he shall be packed off you neednt even see him again is he back in england in london yes what does he want to see usthats all not money no no he isnt in need of that just now can you move back to your bed do you think if i help you you wont let him come near me he shall go straight from this room out of the house come he said presently ill try i almost lifted him to his feet and he clung to my arm stumbling beside me down the passage to his room when he was lying settled on his bed and at ease once more i returned to my brother he was sitting in a maudlin attitude by the window and i saw that he had been at the bottle again now i said sternly lets settle the last of this with a final question what is it you want he looked up at me with an idiotic chuckle wand what everybodys always wanding and i most of all you mean more money i suppose more yes mush moremush more than you gave me last time too not so much probably but lest zyp should starve ill send you what i can in the course of a few days he rose with a feebly menacing look im not going till i get what i wand i wand my part of the treasure i know where its hid you fool and im wound up for a try at it ge out of my way ill go and help myself he made a stumbling rush across the room and when i interposed myself between the door and him he struck out at me with a blow as aimless and unharmful as a babys if you dont knock under at once i said i swear ill tie you up and keep you here for dukes next coming he stood swaying before me a moment then suddenly threw himself on the bed yelping and sobbing like a hysterical schoolgirl its too cruel he moaned you take advantage of your strength to bully me beyond all bearing why shouldnt i have my share as well as you never mind all that give me your address if you want anything at all he lay some time longer yet then fetched out a pencil and scrap of paper and sulkily scrawled what i asked for nowi looked at my watchtheres a train back to town in half an hour youd best be starting nice hospitality upon my word supposing i stop the night youre not going to stop the night unless you wish to do so in the street ive a good mind to you beast and bring a crowd about the place and duke with it perhapseh his expression changed to one most fulsomely fawning renny he said you cant mean to treat me your own brother like this lets have confidence in one another and combine he gave a little embarrassed laugh i know where the treasures hid i tell you sposing we share it and he stopped abruptly with an alarmed look something in my face must have forewarned him for he walked unsteadily to the door glancing fearfully at me passing the brandy bottle on his way he seized it with sudden defiance ill have this anyhow he murmured you wont object to my taking that much away hugging it to his breast under his coat he went from the room i followed him down the stairs saw him out of the house shut the door on him then i listened for his shuffling footstep going up the yard and away before i would acknowledge to myself that he had been got rid of at a price small under the circumstances i remained at my post for full assurance of his departure for many minutes after he had left and when at last i stole up to my fathers room i found the old man fallen into a doze seen through the wan twilight how broken and decaying and feeble he seemed i sat by him till he stirred and woke his eyes opened upon me with a pleased look at finding me beside him and he put out a thin rugged hand and took mine into it ive been asleep he said i dreamed a bad son of mine came back and terrified the old man it was a dream wasnt it renny only a dream dad jason isnt here i thought it was it didnt trouble me much for all that i learned confidence in the presence of this strong good fellow here dad weve left of the fifty i raised two months ago on that julian medallion may i have ten of them ten pounds renalt thats a mighty gap in the hoard i want it for a particular purpose you can trust me not to ask you if it were to be avoided he gave a deep sigh take it then it isnt in you to misapply a trust he turned his face away with a slight groan poor old man my soul cried out with remorse to so trouble his confidence in me yet what i proposed seemed to me best he would not rise and come down to supper when i suggested it let me lie here he said sometimes it seems to me renalt im breaking upthat the wheel down there crows and sings for a victim again it was the first time i had ever heard him directly refer to this stormy heart of the old place that had throbbed out so incessantly its evil influence over the lives shut within range of it it was plunging and murmuring now in the depths below us so insistent even at that distance that the soft whining of the stones in our more immediate neighborhood was scarcely audible its a bewildering discovery he went on that of finding oneself approaching the wonderful bourne one has struggled toward so long i dont think im afraid renalt lying here in peace and watching my soul walk on yet now though i know i have done two great and wicked deeds in my lifetime i wouldnt put off the moment of that coming revelation by an hour i stroked his hand listening and wondering but i made no answer its like being a little child he said fascinated and compelled toward a pleasant fright when you were a toddling baby if one came at you menacing and growling in fun youd open your eyes in doubt with fear and laughter and then instead of flying the danger would run at it halfway and be caught up in daddys arms and kissed that seems to illustrate death to me now the heart of that grim timeworn playfellow may be very soft after all its best not to cry out but to run to him and be caught up and kissed into forgetfulness oh my father how in my soul did i echo your words he wandered on by such strange sidewalks till speech itself seemed to intermingle with the inarticulate language of dream is there truth after all in the senile visions of age that can penetrate the veil of the supernal though the worn and ancient eyes are dim with cataracts as i sat alone with my thoughts that night many emotions significant or pathetic wrought changing phantoms of the shadows in the dimly lighted room sometimes shapeless and full of heavy omen they revolved blindly about that dark past life of my father a little corner of the curtain over which had that evening been lifted for my behoof sometimes they thrilled with spasms of pain at the prospect of that utter loneliness that must fall upon me were the old mans quiet foretelling of his doom to justify itself sometimes they took a red tinge of gloom in memory of his words of selfdenunciation what had been a worser evil in him than that long degrading of his senses yet of the wicked deeds he had referred to that which could hardly be called a deed was surely not one perhaps after all they were nothing but the baseless product of a fancy that had indulged morbidity until as with frankenstein the monster it had created mastered it might this not be the explanation of all even of that eerily expressed fear of his that had puzzled me in its passing that the wheel was calling for a victim again chapter xliv the secret of the wheel the day that followed the unlookedfor visit of my brother jason to the mill my father spent in bed when in the morning i took him up his breakfast i could not help noticing that the broad light flooding the room emphasized a change in him that i had been only partly conscious of the evening before it was as if during the night the last gleams of his old restless spirit had died out i thought all edges in him bluntedthe edges of fear of memory of observation of general interest in life the immediate cause of this decline was with little doubt the shock caused by my brothers unexpected return to this i never again heard him allude but none the less had the last of his constitution succumbed to it i feel sure the midday post brought me a letter the sight of which sent a thrill through me i knew zyps queer crooked hand that no dignity of years could improve from its immature schoolgirl character she wrote dear renny jason told you all i suppose we are back again and dependant on dads bounty and yours oh renny it goes to my heart to have to wurry you once more but we are in soar strates and so hampered in looking for work from the risk of coming across him again at present he hasnt found us out i think but any day he may do so if you could send us ever so little it would help us to tide over a terruble crisus the little one is wanting dainties renny and weit is hard to say itbread sometimes but she will only eat of the best and chocalats she loves i wish you could see her she is my own fairy i work the prettiest flowers into samplers and try to sell them in the shops but i am not very clever with my needel and jason laughs at them though my feet ake with walking over these endless paving stones renny dear i must be a beggar please dont think hardly of me for it but my darling thats so pretty and frale oh renny help us your loving sister zyp what you send if annything please send it to me thats why i write for the chief part jason would give us his last crust butyou saw him renny and must know i bowed my head over the queer sorrowful little note that this bold reliant child of nature should come to this there and then i vowed that so long as i had a shilling i could call my own zyp should share it with me at a word from her i wrote to her to this effect i placed my whole position before her and bade her command me as she listed only bearing in mind that my father old and broken had the first claim upon me then i went out and bought the largest and most fascinating box of chocolates i could secure and sent it to her as a present to my little unknown niece and forwarded also under cover the order for the a day or two brought me an acknowledgment and answer to my letter the latter shall forever remain sacred from any eyes but mine and unless man can be found ready to brave the curse of the dead shall lie with me who alone have read it in the grave on the morning preceding that of its arrival a fearful experience befell me that was like to have choked out my soul then and there in one black grip of horror all that first day after jasons visit my father lay abed and whenever i visited him was cheerfully garrulous but without any inclination to rise the following morning also he elected to have breakfast as before in his room and soon after the meal he fell into a light doze in which state i left him it was about oclock that sitting in the room below i was startled by hearing a sudden thud above me that shook the beams of the ceiling i rushed upstairs in a panic and found him lying prostrate on the floor uninjured apparently but with no power of getting to his feet again whats this i cried dad are you hurt he looked at me a little wondering and confused but answered no he had only slipped and fallen when rising to don his clothes i lifted him up and he couldnt stand but sunk down on the bed again with a blank amazed look in his face renalt he said in a thin perplexed voice whats happened to the old man the will was there but the powers gone gone it was forever from that day he walked no moredid nothing but lie on his back calm and unconcerned for the most part and fading quietly from life but in the first discovery of his enforced inertness some peculiar trouble unconnected with the certain approach of death lay on him like a black jaundice sitting by his side after i had got him back upon the bed i would not break the long silence that ensued with shallow words of comfort for i thought that he was steeling his poor soul as he lay to face the inevitable prospect suddenly he turned on the bedfor his face had been darkened from meand looked at me with his lips trembling what is it dad im down renny i shall never rise again youll rest dad youll rest think of the peace and quiet while i sit and read to you and the sun comes in at the window good lad it isnt that though rest has a beautiful sound to me its the thoughtharkee renny its the thought that a task ive not failed in for twenty years and more must come to be anothers what task there are ears in the walls closer my son the task of oiling the wheel below shall i take it up dad is that your wish i answered stoutly though my heart sunk within me at the prospect you or nobody it must be are you afraid i wish i could say i wasnt he clutched my hand in tremulous eagerness master it you must my lad much depends on it they whisper the room is haunted not for you renalt if for anybody havent i been familiar with it all these years and yet i lie here unscathed how can it spare the evil old man and hurt the just son he halfrose in his bed and stared with dilated eyes at the wall you are there he cried in a loud quavering voice out of the years of gloom and torture you menace me still why it was just i say how could i have clung to my purpose and defied you otherwise you will never frighten me he fell back breathing heavily in sorrow and alarm i bent over him suddenly conscious of my eyes looking down upon him he smiled and a faint flush came to his cheek dreams and shadowsdreams and shadows he murmured you will take up my task renalt must i dad oh be a man he shrieked grasping at me i have defied iti the sinner and how can it hurt you is it so necessary its the key to allthe golden key were it to rust and stop the secret would be open to any that might look and the devil have my soul do you wish me then to learn the secretwhatever it is he looked at me long with a dark and searching expression i ask you to oil the wheel he said at lengthnothing more very well i will do what you ask he gave a deep sigh and lay back with his eyes closed i saw the faint color coming and going in his face suddenly he uttered a cry and turned upon me my sonmy son bear with me a little longer it is an old habit and for long made my only joy in a dark world i find it hard to part with my fetish i dont want you to part with it what does it matter i will oil the wheel and you shall rest in peace that your task is being faithfully performed by another hush you dont mean it but every word is a reproach ive known so little love and here i would reject the confidence that is the sign of more than i deserve for him the base and cruel to guess at it and you to remain in ignorance renalt listen im going to tell you no dad no renalt you wont break my heart what trust havent you put in me and this is my return feel under my pillow boy oh dad let it rest eagerly impatiently he thrust in his own hand and brought forth a shining key take it he cried it opens the box of the wheel but first lower the sluice and turn the race into the further channel you will see a rope dangling inside in the darkness hold on to it and work the wheel round with your hands till a float projecting a little beyond its fellows comes opposite you in this youll find a slit cut ending in an eyehole pass the rope as it dangles into this hole and keep it in place by a turn of the iron button thats fixed underneath the slit now step on to the broad float never letting go the rope and the weight of your body will turn the wheel carrying you downward till a knot in the rope stops your descent what then dad my sonyoull see the place that for twenty years has held the secret of my fortune chapter xlv i make a descent if it had many a time occurred to me since first i heard of the jar of coins that the secret of their concealment was connected somehow within the room of silence it must have done so from that old association of my father with a place that the rest of us so dreaded and avoided the scorn of superstitious terror that he showed in his choice the certainty that none would dream of looking there the encouragement his own mysterious actions gave to the sense of a haunting atmosphere that seemed ever to hang about the neighborhood of the roomthese were all so many justifications of the wisdom of his choice now i understood the secret of that everlasting lubrication for had anything happened when he might chance to be absent to choke or damage the structure of the ancient wheel the stoppage or ruin ensuing might have laid bare the hidingplace to any curious eye for as part of his general policy i conclude no veto except the natural one of dread was ever laid on our entering the room itself if we wished to well i said stifling a sigh that in itself would have seemed a breach of confidence when am i to do my first oiling father it wasnt touched yesterday renalt from the first i have not failed to do it once at least in the twentyfour hours you would like me to go nowat once ah if you will very well as i was leaving the room he called me back theres the oil can in yonder cupboard and a bullseye lantern fixed in a belt you will want to light that and strap it round you i went and fetched them and holding them in my hand asked him if there was anything more no he said be careful not to let go the rope thats all why do you want me to go down dad let me just do the oiling and come away no nownow he said with feverish impatience the murders out and my conscience quit of it youll satisfy me with a report of its safety renalt theres a brave fellow it would be a sore thing to compose myself here to face the end and not know but that something had happened to your inheritance my spirit groaned but i said to him very well i would go he called to me once more and i noticed an odd repression in his voice assure yourself and me of the safety of the jar nothing else if by chance you notice aught beyond keep the knowledge of it locked in your breastnever mention it or refer to it in any way full of dull foreboding of some dread discovery i left him and went slowly down the stairs i paused outside the ominous door with a thought that a little whisper of laughter had reached my ears from its inner side then muttering abuse on myself for my cowardice i pushed resolutely at the cumbrous oak and swung it open a cold vaultlike breath of air sighed out on me and the marrow in my bones was conscious of a little chill and shiver but i strode across the floor without further hesitation and fetched from my pocket the iron key the hole it fitted into was near the edge of the great box that inclosed the wheel standing there in close proximity to the latter i was struck by the subdued character of the flapping and washing sounds within heard at a distance they seemed to shake the whole building with their muffled thunder here no formidable uproar greeted me and so it was i conclude from the concentration of noise monopolizing my every sense i put in the key swung open the doorand there before me was a section of a huge disk going round overwhelmingly and all splashed and dripping as it revolved with great jets of weedysmelling water i say disk for the arms to this side had been boarded in that none i supposed might gather hint of what lay beyond the eyes into which the shaft ends of the wheel fitted were sunk in the floor level flush with the lintel of the cupboard door that lay furthest from the window so that only the left upper quarter of the slowly spinning monster was visible to me it turned in an oblong pit it seemed wooden in its upper part but going down into a narrow gully of brick at the bottom of which the race boomed and roared with a black sound of fury if the hollow thunder of the unseen torrent had been dismal to hear the sight of it boiling down there in its restricted channel was awful indeed from the forward tunnel through which it escaped into the tail bay a thin streak of light tinged the plunging foam of it with green phosphorescence and made manifest the terror of its depths for all my dread of the place a strange curiosity had begun to usurp in me the first instincts of repulsion though i had been in the room some minutes no malignant influence had crept over me as yet and a hope entered me that by thus forcing myself to outface the fear i had perhaps triumphed over its fateful fascination leaving the door of the cupboard open i hurried from the room and so to the rear of the building and the platform outside where the heads of the sluices were that regulated the water flow here removing the pin i dropped the race hatch and so cut off the stream from the wheel returning i left open the door of the room that the wholesome atmosphere outside should neighbor me at least and means of escape if necessary readily offer themselves and lighting the lantern in the belt strapped the latter round my waist when i came to the cupboard again the boom of water below had subsided to a mouthing murmur and the spin of the wheel was lazily relaxed so that before it had turned half its own circumference it stood still and dripping the sight when i looked down now was not near so formidable for only a band of water slid beneath me as i bent over still my heart was up in my mouth for all that now the moment had come for the essaying of my task oiling such parts of the machine as were within reach i next grasped the rope which i had at the first noticed hanging from the darkness above down into the pit just clear of the blades and set to peering for the broader float my father had mentioned luckily the last motion of the wheel had brought this very section opposite me so that i had no difficulty in slipping in the rope and securing it by means of the button underneath then with a tingling of the flesh of my thighs and a mental prayer for early deliverance i stepped upon the blade with a foot on either side of the rope to which i clung grimly and in a moment felt myself going down into blackness the wheel turned gently under my weight giving forth no creak or scream and the dark water below seemed to rise at me rather than to wait my sinking toward it but though the drip and slime of the pit shut me in there was action in all i was doing so matteroffact as to halfcure me for the moment of superstitious terror suddenly the wheel stopped with a little jerk and thud of the float on which i stood against a bend in the tackle that passed through it holding on thusand indeed the tension necessary to the act spoke volumes for my fathers vigor of endurancethe light from the lantern flashed and glowed about the interior structure of the wheel before me then looking between the bladesfor the periphery of the great circle was not boxed ini saw revealed to me in a moment the secret i had come to investigate for firmly set in a hole dug in the brick side of the chasm at a point so chosen within the sweep of the wheel that no spoke traversed it when it lay motionless and at arms reach only from one standing on the paddle was a vessel of ancient pottery about a foot in height and so smeared and dank with slime as that a careless grasp on its rim might have sent the whole treasure clattering and raining through the wheel into the water below cautiously i put out a hand grasped and gently shook the jar a dull jingle came from it and so my task was accomplished by this time however i was so confident of my position that i got out the oil can and began to lubricate deliberately the further shaft end of the wheel while i was in the very act a metallic glint struck by the lantern light from some object pinned on to the huge hub that crossed the channel almost directly in front of my line of vision caught my eye and drove me to pause i craned my neck to get a nearer view and gave so great a start of wonder as to lose my hold of the oiler which fell with clink and splash into the water underfoot nailed to the great axle was something that looked like the miniature portrait of a man but it was so stained and flaked by years of dark decay that the features were almost obliterated the face had been painted in enamel on an oval of fluxed copper yet even this had not been able to resist the long corrosion of the atmosphere in which it was held prisoner i could make out only that the portrait was that of a young man of fair complexion thin lighthaired and dressed in the fashion of a bygone generation more i had not time to observe for as i gazed suddenly with a falling sway and a flicker the lantern at my waist went out chapter xlvi caught in the first horror of blackness i came near to letting go the rope and falling from my perch on the blade my brain went with a swing and turn and a sick wave overwhelmed my heart and flooded all my chest with nausea was i trapped after alland just when confidence seemed established in me for some evil moments i remained as i was not daring to move to look up even blinded only by the immediate plunge into cabined night terrible and profound i had left the matches above there was no rekindling of the lamp possible up through the darkness i must climband how then for the first time it occurred to me that my fathers directions had not included the method of the return journey perhaps he had thought it unnecessary to clearer senses the means would have been obviousa scramble merely by way of the paddles while the wheel was held in position by the rope in the confusion of my senses i thought that my only way was to swarm up the dangling rope and without doubt such was a means if an irksome one of escape only i should have left the tackle anchored as it was to the wheel this i did not do but moved by a sudden crazy impulse stooped and turned the button that held all in place it was good fortune only that saved me then and there from the full consequences of my act for pulled taut as it was and well out of the perpendicular the moment it was released the rope swung through the slit like a pendulum carrying me frantically clinging to it with one hand off the paddle then before i had time to put out my free hand to ward off the danger clump against the wheel i came in the return swing and with such force that i was heavily bruised in a dozen places and near battered from my hold clawing and scratching like a drowning cat and rendered halfstupid by the blow i yet managed to grasp the rope with my other hand and so dangle there with little more than strength just to cling on once i sought to ease the intolerable strain on my arms by toeing for foothold on the paddle again but the wheel swinging free now slipped from under me so that i was nearly jerked from my clutch then there was nothing for it but to gather breath and pray that power might come to me to swarm up the rope by and by drooping my head as i hung panting the blackness i had thought impenetrable was traversed by the green glint of light below that i have mentioned the sight revived me in a moment it was like a draught of water to a fainting soldier now i felt some connectedness of thought to be possible with a bracing of all my muscles i passed my legs about the rope and began toilingly to drag myself upward i had covered half the distance when i felt myself to be going mad how this was i cannot explain the fight against material difficulties had hitherto it seemed left tremors of the supernatural powerless to move me now in a moment black horror had me by the heart that i should be down thereclambering from the depths of that secret and monstrous pit the very neighborhood of which had always filled me with loathing seemed a fact incredible in its stupendous unnature this may sound exaggerated it did not seem so to me then despite my manhood and my determination in an instant i was mastered and insane still i clung to the rope and crawled upward then suddenly i saw why night had fallen upon me in one palpable curtain when the lantern was extinguished for the door of the cupboard was closed had it only swung to but what air was there in the close room beyond to move it hanging there like a lost and fated fiend a bubble of wild ugly merriment rose in me and burst in a clap of laughter i writhed and shrieked in the convulsion of it the dead vault rung with my hysterical cries it ceased suddenly as it had begun and grinding my teeth in a frenzy of rage over the thought of how i had been trapped and snared i swung myself violently against the door and letting go my hold at the same instant burst it open with the force of my onset and rolled bleeding and struggling on the floor of the room beyond after a minute or two i rose into a sitting posture leaning on one hand halfstunned and halfblinded a dense and deadly silence about me but this was penetrated presently by a fantastic low whispering sound at my back as if there were those there that discussed my fate i turned myself sharply about dull emptiness only of rotting floor and striding rafter and the gathered darkness of wall corners the sense of fanciful murmuring left me and in its place was born a sound as of something stealthily crossing the floor away from me at the same instant the door of the room which i had left open swung softly to on its hinges and i was shut in then with a fear that i cannot describe i knew that the question was to be put to me once more and that i was destined to die under the torture of it i had no hope of escapeno thought that the passion that prompted me to selfeffacement might diverted carry me to the door in one hard dash for light and liberty the single direction in which my mind moved unfettered was that bearing upon the readiest means to my purposeto die and thereto what offered itself more insistently than the black pit i had but now risen from a runa leapa shattering diveand the murmuring water and oblivion would have me forevermore i turned and faced the dark gulf i pressed my hands to my bursting temples to still the throb of the arteries that was blinding me then spasmodically my feet moved forward a pace or two i gave a long quivering sigh my arms dropped inert and a blessed warmth of security gushed over all my being pale luminous most dear and pitiful an angel stood before the opening and barred my way a shadow onlybut an angel a spirit come from the sorrowful past to save me as i alas had never saved her i fell on my knees and held out my arms to her with the drowning tears falling over my cheeks i could not speak but only moan like a child for cheer and comfort and she smiled on methe angel smiled on me as dolly sweet and loving had smiled of old oh god oh god thus to permit her to come from over the desolate waste for solace of my torment was all this only figurative of the warring clash of passion and conscience the presence was to me actual and divine it led me or seemed to lead from the mouthing deathacross the roomout by the open door that none had ever shut and then it was no longer and i stood alone in the gusty passage i stood alone and cured forever of the terror of that mad and gloomy place whose influence had held me so long enthralled henceforth i was quit of its deadly malice i knew it as certainly as that i was forgiven for my share in a most bitter tragedy that had littered the shore of many lives with wreckage for me at least now the question was answeredanswered by the dear ghost of one whose little failings had been washed pure in the bountiful spring of life presently moved by the sense of sacred security in my heart i passed once more into the room of silencenot with bravado but strong in the good armor of selfreliance i closed and locked the door of the cupboard and walked forth again feeling no least tremor of the nervesconscious of nothing to cause it thence i went out to the platform and levering up the sluice heard the water discharge itself afresh into the hollowbooming channel that held the secret of the wheel and now indeed that my thoughts were capable of some order of progression that very secret rose and usurped the throne of my mind deposing all other claimants what weird mystery attached to the portrait nailed to the axle that it was placed there by my father i had little doubt but for what reason and of whom was it i recalled his wild command to me to never make reference to aught my eyes might chance to light upon other than the treasure i had gone to seek in that direction then nothing but silence must meet me of whom was the portrait and what the mystery on the thought the attenuated voice of old peggy came from the kitchen hard by in a cracked and melancholy stave of her favorite song i washed my penknife in the stream heigho i washed my penknife in the stream and the more i washed it the blood gushed out all down by the greenwood side o old peggy when had she first established her ghoulish reign over us had she been employed here in my mothers time i only knew that i could not dispart her ancient figure and the mill in my memory i pushed open the door and walked into the kitchen she was sitting darning by the frouzy little windowa great pair of spectacles on her bony noseand looked at me with an eye affectedly vacant as if she were a vicious old parrot speculating upon the most opportune moment for a snap at me thats a pretty song peggy i said and a pretty old ooman to sing it she answered were you ever young peggy not that i remembers i were barn wi a wrinkle in my brow like a furrowdrain and two good teeth in my headpiece i dare say how old were you when you first came here how old old enow and young enow to taste wormwood in the sarce gleeted fro three winton brats thats no answer you know whats your present age one hundred mebbe was modred born when you came born eighteen bard months to my sorrow a rare gross child to be sure wi sprawling fat puds like the feet o them crocodillies in the show if peggy could be trusted i had got an answer which barred further pursuit in that direction she could never i calculated have been personally acquainted with my mother or the circumstances of the latters death indeed i could not imagine her tolerated in a house over which any selfrespecting woman presided elsewhere i must look for some solution of the puzzle that had added its complexity to a life already laboring under a burden of mystery but in the meantime an older vital question rereared its head from the very hearthstone of the mill whereon it had lain so long in stupor that i might have fancied it dead chapter xlvii some one comes and goes november had come with early frosts that flattened the nasturtiums in the town gardens and stiffened belated bees on the michaelmas daisies that were the very taverns of nature to lure them from their decent homes this year the complacent dogmatism of an ancient proverb was most amply justified by results be there ice in november that ill bear a duck therell be nothing after but sludge and muck the bellying winds of december were to drive up such clouds of rain and storm that every gully in the meadows was to join its neighbor in one common conspiracy against the land and every stream to overrun its banks swollen with the pride of hearing itself called a flood i had been reading one bright morning to my father until he fell asleep and was sitting on pensively with the book in my hand when i became aware of a step mounting the stairs below and pausing at the sittingroom door i rose softly at once and descending came plump upon dr crackenthorpe just as he was crossing the threshold to enter he was very sprucely dressed for him with a spray of ragged geranium in his buttonhole and this no less than the mere fact of his presence in the house filled me with a momentary surprise so great that i had not a word to say only i bowed him exceedingly politely into the parlor and civilly asked his business an expression of relief crossed his face i thought as though he had been in two minds as to whether i should take him by the collar and summarily eject him there and then i havent seen your father about lately he jerked out with some parody of a smile that i concluded was designated to propitiate i called to inquire if the old gentleman was unwell he is practically an invalid i said he keeps entirely to his own room indeed i am concerned nothing serious i trust my services i need not say are at the command of so valued an old friend he needs no services but mine it is the debility of old age i fearnothing more yet he is a comparatively young man but its true that to mortgage ones youth too heavily is to risk the premature foreclosing of old age i dare say was there any other object in your visit one otherfrankly he held out a damp hand to me it shook rather im tired of this duel of crosspurposes will you agree to cry an armisticepeace if you like i took him in from head to foota little to his discomfiture no doubt is this pure philanthropy dr crackenthorpe i said most pure and disinterested said he i claim without offense the grievance as mine and i am the first to come forward and cry let there be an end to it not so fast you start on a fundamental error a grievance as i take it can only separate friends there can be no question of such a misunderstanding between us for we have always been enemies thats your fancy cried he thats your mistaken fancy im not one to wear my heart on my sleeve if ive always repressed show of my innate regard for you youre not to think it didnt exist why waste so many words thats a good form of regard to act the bulldog to us as you always did it was a chastening sense of duty i suppose that induced you to leave me for years under an ugly stigma when you knew all the time that i was innocent is your valued friendship for the old man best expressed by blackmailing and robbing him on the strength of a fragment of circumstantial evidence i have made myself particeps criminis does that go for nothing a little consideration was due to me there a moiety of the treasure he was squandering i took advantage of my influence to secure in trust for his children you shall have it all back again some day and should show me profound gratitude in place of sinister disbelief a fine cheapening of cupidity and well argued how long were you thinking it out as to that question of the suspicions you labored underremember that any conclusion drawn from circumstances was hypothetical i may have had a professional opinion as to the cause of death and a secret one as to the means employed that was conjecture but if you are fair you will confess that by running away to london you did much to incriminate yourself in mens minds i never looked upon it in that light i dare say not innocence from its nature may very often stultify itself i think you innocent now then i was not so certain it was not perhaps till your father sought to silence me that my suspicions were diverted into a darker channel you put a good case i said amazed at the mans plausibility you might convince one who knew less of you you can prove nothing to my discredit this is all the growth of early prejudice think that at any moment i might have denounced him and left the proof of innocence on his shoulders and killed the goose with the golden eggs i am not altogether childish dr crackenthorpe or quite ignorant of the first principles of law in england the burden of proof lies on the prosecution how would you have proceeded i should at least have eased my conscience of an intolerable load and escaped the discomforting reflection that i might be considered an accessory after the fact as indeed you are in the sight of heaven by your own showing though i swear my father is as innocent of the crime as i am he shrugged his shoulders with a deprecating gesture anyhow my position shows my disinterestedness he said and you are growing frightened over it it seems well take whatever course pleases you from our point of view here i feel quite easy as to results you misapprehend me this visit is actuated by no motive but that of friendliness i wish to bury the hatchet and resume the pleasant relations that existed of old they were too onesided besides all the conditions changed upon my return and no one regretted it more than i i have from the first been your true friend as i have attempted to show you have a valuable inheritance in my keeping indeedhe gave a sort of high embarrassed titterit would be to your real advantage to hand the residue over to me before he has any further opportunity of dissipating it i broke into a cackle of fierce laughter so i cried the secret is out i must compliment you on a most insatiable appetite but believe me you have more chance of acquiring the rocs egg than the handful he looked at me long and gloomily i could feel rather than hear him echo the handful but he made a great effort to resume his conciliatory tone when he spoke again you jump to hotheaded conclusions it was a simple idea of the moment and as you choose to misinterpret it let it be forgotten the main point is are we to be friends again and i repeat that we cant resume what never existed this posturing is stupid farce that had best end shall we make the question conditional that cameo that you have come into possession ofwe wont hazard a supposition by what meansrestore it at least to its rightful owner as an earnest of your singlemindedness i who am to inherit it in the end give you full permission he started back and his face went the color of a withered aspen leaf its mine he cried shrilly i wouldnt part with it to the queen see then what am i to believe i walked close up to him his fingers itched to strike me i could see dr crackenthorpe i said you had best have spared yourself this errand why what a poor scamp you must be to think to take me in with such a fusty trick make the most of what youve got youll not have another stiver from us look elsewhere for a victim your evil mission in life is the hounding of the wretched mine you know some clews are already in my hand and if there is one man in the world i should rejoice to drag downyou are he he walked to the door and turning stamped his foot furiously down on the boards you bitter dolt he roared with a withering sneer understand that the chance i gave you is withdrawn forever there are meansthere are means and i he stopped gulped put his hand to his throat and walked out of the house without another word i stood looking after him all blazing with anger no least fear of the evil creature was in me but only a blank fierce astonishment that he should thus have dared to brave me on my own ground what cupidity was that indeed that could not only think to gloss over long years of merciless torment by a few false suave words but could actually hope to find the profit of his condescension in a postprandial gorging of the fragments his inordinate gluttony of avarice had passed over however putting all thought of him from me i returned to my father chapter xlviii a fruitless search one result of dr crackenthorpes visit was that i determined to then and there push my secret inquiries to a head in the direction of my friend the sexton of st johns i had not seen or heard of this man since the day of his seizure in the archway of the close but i thought his attack must surely by now have yielded and left him sane again that very afternoon leaving my father comfortably established with book and paper i walked over to the old churchyard under the hill and looked about among the graves for some sign of him who farmed them the place was empty and deserted it showed clearly that the hand of order was withdrawn and had not been replaced not knowing whither to go to make inquiries i loitered idly about some little time longer in the hope that chance might throw some one who could direct me in my way within my vision two mounds only stood out stark and sterile from the tangled green of deaths garden and one was modreds and the other the grave of the murdered man it was only a strange chance of course yet a strange chance it was that should smite those two out of all the yard with barrenness as i turned i was aware of a bent old man issuing from a side door of the church with a bunch of keys in his hand to him i walked and addressed my inquiries ah he said struggling out of a violent fit of coughing george white sir the mans dismissed for drunkenness to my sorrer so it is i has to do his work till they finds a substitoot itll be the death of me this chill autumn do you know where he lives he aint appinted yet george white i mean he lives if living he is ower at fullflood yonder i misremember the number but its either or or mebbe theyll tell you if you ask not but what id leave him alone if i was you for hell do you no good he cant do me any harm at least i think ill try go your courses then young men are that boldblooded go your courses you cant miss if you follers my directions i had my own opinion as to that but i tramped off to the district indicated which lay in the western quarter of the town chance put out a friendly hand to me i had paused in indecision when a woman standing at an open door behind me hailed another who was coming down the pavement with a little basket over her arm goodarternoon mrs white said the first wife as the other came up and how did ye find your marn i pricked up my ears no better and no worse mrs catty and tharnk ye kindly the horrers has left him im told yere told true but little recommends the going his face is the color o my apron herean awesome sight its the music membrim in his stommick tis said thats out o toon ah ma dear i know it its what the doctors call an orgin and the pain is grinding god bless yeits naught to what it were tis the colic o the mind he suffers one may say deary me deary me poor mr white i left him asitting before the infirmary fire in a happythetic state they names it though to my mind he looked wretched and so must you be to harve your marn in the house well welland dismissed from his post too come rain or sunshine i hurried off satisfied with what i had heard if the woman with the basket was not the sextons wife there was no happy fortuity in fate for a moment i had thought i would address myself to her but the reflection that no good purpose could be answered thereby and that by doing so i might awaken suspicions where none existed made me think better of it expanding her allusions i writ down in my mind that george white taken in hand by the police had been remanded to the workhouse infirmary pending his recovery from an attack of delirium tremens and such i found to be the case now the hope of getting anything in the nature of conclusive proof from him seemed remote at least no harm could be done by me paying him a visit fortunately i discovered upon presenting myself at the house that it was a visitors day and that a margin yet remained of the time limit imposed upon callers i was referred to the infirmary doctora withered stick of a man with an unprofessional beard the color and texture of dead grass this gentlemans broadcloth reversing the order of things seemed to have worn out him instead of he it so sleek imposing and many sizes too large for him were his clothes he listened with his teeth it seemed for his lip went up exposing them every time he awaited an answer george white the mans in a state of melancholia following alcoholic excess he is only a responsible creature at moments and has hallucinations i doubt his recovery i might take my chance of one of the moments sir you might if you could recognize your opportunity is it important very thats no idle assertion i assure you he only knows the truth of a certain matter the solution of which affects many people well you can try i give you little hope an attendant must be within reach theres no calculating the next crazy impulse in such cases an attendant took me in charge and convoyed me to the infirmarya cleanly bare room with a row of bedsteads headed against a distempered wall and nailed to the latter over each patients pillow a diagnosis of his disease and its treatment like a descriptive label in a museum some of the beds were occupied a convalescent pallid figure or two lingered about the sunny windows at the end of the room and seated solitary before the fire was the foundering wreck of george white the attendant briefly said thats him and retiring a short distance away leaned against a bedstead rail i fetched a chair from the wall and sat myself down by the poor shattered ruin a hopeless vacuity reigned in his expression at first and presently he began to maunder and dribble forth a liquid patter of words all unintelligible by and by some connectedness was apparent in his wanderings i stooped my head to listen hes alone and asleepthe only one time to trysarftly nowa fut i the toehole wi cautionand im up and out curse the crumbling clay ah a bits fell on him my god what a grin one eyes open if i cud sweat to moisten it now im dry wi fire and dust im farlin backim he halfrose to his feet i put out a hand to control him but he sunk down again and into apathy in a moment a few minutes and the stream of words was flowing once more not so deepnot so deep arter all the tails o the warms wriggles on the coffin while their heads be stuck out i the blessed air two fut i make it i cud putt my harnd through so be as this cruel lid would heist up its breakingthe soils coming through the cracks its pouring in and choking meits choking me i say isnt there none to hear why im sinking the subsoils dropped in i shall be ten fut down and no chance if again the struggle again the collapse and by and by the monotonous murmur gathering volume as it proceeded sing says youand the devil drums i the pit if i so much as whisper lookee therat the white square o the sky tharts what keeps me going if you was to blot thart out hed have me by the hip wi a pinch like a bloodhounds jaw theres summut darkens whos thart alooking down why you bloody murderer i knows you i found you out i did you ugly cutthroat devil already dead says you who kills dead men there baint a thing i the warld id hold my tongue for but drinkyou gie it me then whats this the bottles swarming wi maggotsarnts black arnts youre a rare villain not a doctor i say a doctor dont cut the weasands o dead men and let out the wormsmillions of themand theres some wi faces and shining rings and gewgaws the ungodly shall go down into the pithelp me out o ittheyre burying me alive he leaped to his feet with drawn ashy face the watchful attendant was at his side in a moment and had put a restraining hand on him youll get nought out of him sir he said its my belief hell never utter sane word again as he spoke the sextons eyes lighted on me in their wild roving steadied flickered and took a little glint of reason still gazing at me he sunk into his chair again leave us alone for a minute i said to the man he seems to recognize me i think as long as his eyes dont wander maybe he answered keep em fixed on youand he withdrew to his former standpoint george i said in a low distinct voice do you know me i held him with an intense gaze he seemed struggling in an inward agony to escape it george i said again do you know who i am the grave yon where no grass grows he muttered yes yes why doesnt it grow there ask the ask whom im listening its heoh my god i saw the terror creep and flutter behind the surface of his skin i saw it leap out and heard a yell as his eyes escaped their thraldom and on the instant the attendant was there and struggling with him in the shock of it i jumped up and turnedand saw dr crackenthorpe standing in the doorway i ran at him in a sort of frenzy what do you want i cried what are you here for i think i was about to strike him when the wizened figure of the doctor who had given me permission to enter thrust itself between us whats all this he said in a sharp grating voice how dare you make this uproar sir i fell back shaking with rage all down the row of beds pale sick faces had risen looking on in wonder beside the fire my escort was still struggling with the madman what right has he to be hereto come and spy upon me i cried this is simply outrageous dr crackenthorpe he glanced at the newcomer with no very flattering expression is here to superintend the removal of a patient of his he must be protected from insult i rescind my permit johnson see this man off the premises a second attendant advanced and took me police fashion by the elbow i offered no resistance impulse had made a fool of me and i felt it the sound of the scuffle by the fire still continued as i passed dr crackenthorpe he made me a mocking bow hat in hand then waving me aside as if i were some troublesome supplicant he desired to ignore he advanced further into the room then came a sudden thud and loud exclamation at which both i and my attendant turned the madman had bested his enemy and dashed him to the floor a moment then he paused his gasping mouth and pale eyes indicative of his terror of the man approachinga moment only and he turned and fled i was conscious of a sudden breaking out of voicesof a fearful screech ringing above themof a hurried rush of shapesof a bound and crash and shattering snap of glass it all happened in an instant and there was a jagged and gaping fissure in a window at the end of the roomand george white was gone chapter xlix a quiet warning i fully expected to be summoned as a witness to the inquest held on george white however as it turned out they left me alone and for that i was thankful though indeed i had little to fear from any crossexamination and dr crackenthorpe would hardly have ventured under the circumstances to use his professional influence to my discomfiture seeing that i had shown knowledge of the fact that between him and the dead man was once at least some species of understanding so he gave his version of the affair without any reference to me who indeed could hardly in any way be held responsible for the catastrophe and now he lay dead the latest victim of the inquisition of the wheel i most fully believed a poor wretch withered under its ban that would reach it seemed to agents but remotely connected with the dark history of its immediate neighbors he was dead and with him i could but think had passed my one chance of probing the direful mystery in that direction where the core of it festered thereafter for weeks i walked in a stubborn rebellion against fate intensified by the thought that this stultifying of my purpose had come upon me on the heels of my triumphant mastery of that old weird influence of the milla triumph that had seemed to pronounce me the very chosen champion of truth to whom all ways to the undoing of the wicked should be revealed but now as the month drew to its close a new anxiety came to humble me with the pathos of the world and to assimilate all restless emotions into one pale fog of silence gray and sorrowful on a certain morning looking in my fathers face when i brought him his breakfast i read something there the import of which i would not consider or dwell upon until i could escape and commune with myself alone there was little external change in him and he was bright and cheerful it was only a certain sudden sense of withdrawal that struck a chill into mea sense as if life seeking to steal unobserved from its ancient prison knew itself noticed and affected to be dallying simply with the rusted locks and bolts realizing this presently to the full i determined then and there to put everything else to one side and to devote myself singlehanded to the tender ministering to his last days upon earth and grief and sadness were mingled in me for i loved the old man and could not but rejoice that the inevitable should come to him so peacefully but prospect of the utter loneliness that would fall upon me when he was gone woke a selfish resentment that he should be taken from me and fought in my heart for mastery over the better emotion did he know not certainly perhaps for slowly dying men give little thought to the way they wander but something in the prospect opening out before him must i think have struck him with a dawning marvel at its strangeness as a sleeper wakened from a weird romance of dreaming finds a wonder of unfamiliarity in the world restored to him it may have been that some increase of care on my part making itself apparent was the first warning to him that all was not as it used to be for there came a night when he called to me as i was leaving his roomafter seeing him comfortably establishedin a voice with a queer ring of emotion in it what is it dad i asked hurrying back to his bedside im wakeful tonight my lad well and easy but wakeful shall i stop with you a bit longer i saw he wished it and sat myself down upon the foot of the bed good lad he said i dont deserve all this renalt it should be a blank and empty thing to review a life spent in idleness and selfindulgence i ought to feel that and yet im at peace why wasnt i of your militant philosophers who treating love like any other luxury find salve for the bitter sting of it in a brave independence of righteousness as well ask dad why in battle the bullets spare some and mangle others you mean the faculty of overriding fate is constitutional not a courageous theory renalt yet i think your philosopher would be the first to acknowledge its truth of course hed have a principle to prove but i cant gather consolation there for having wittingly sunk myself to the beasts dad why should i mince matters let me look at you full face i have never been a liar but ive chosen to deceive myself into the belief that mere brute selfindulgence was a fine revolt against the tyranny of the gods it may have been natures counterirritant to unbearable suffering sophistry my boy its out of the kindness of your heart but its sophistry better to die shrieking under the knife than to live to be a hopeless disfigured cripple look at me lying here what heritage of virtue what example of endurance shall i leave to my children you have never complained no comfort renaltnone i nursed my resentment from base fear only that by revealing it it would dissipate with such a belief i have to face the supreme court up there andhe looked at me earnestlybefore very long i think i shook my head in silence i could find no word to say am i afraid he went on still intently regarding me i think notat present yet i have some bitter charges to answer this rest will restore you again dad he did not seem to hear me his eyes left my face and he continued in a murmuring voice the last dispossession the old suffer is sleep it seems balm in gileadbalm in gilead what little breath will keep the spark alive i thought as i sat and watched the worn quiet figure the face looked as if molded out of wax and so moved me that presently i must rise and bend over it thinking the end had actually come while i watched with my rising however a sigh broke from it and a little stir of the limbs so that my heart that had fallen leaped up again with gladness then he looked up at me standing above him and a smile passed like a gleam of sunlight over his features i always loved you my son renalt he murmured and murmuring fell into a light trance once more the following day there was no change in his condition i could have thought him floating out of life on that tide of dreaming thoughts that seemed to bear him up so gently and so easily when at moments he would rise to consciousness of my presence he would nod to me and smile and again sink back on the pillow of gracious somnolence i had been sitting reading to myself in my fathers room and all was glowing silence about me when a sudden clap at the windowcasement made me start i jumped to my feet and looked out a vast gloomy curtain of cloud was drawing up from the east even as i looked some shafts of its bitterness drove through the joints of the lattice stabbing at me with points of ice and i shivered though the sunlight was still upon me the storm came on with incredible speed within five minutes of my rising clouds of hail were flogging the streets and from a whirling fog of night jangle of innumerable voices hooting and whistling broke like a besieging cloud of goths upon the ancient capital chapter l stricken down for ten minutes during which the city was blind with hail i could see nothing but a thicket of white strings dense as the threads in a loom hear nothing but the pounding crash of thunder and fierce hiss and clatter of the driving stones then darkness gathered within and without and down came the storm with an access of fury that seemed verily as if it must flatten out the town like a scattered ants nest so infernal for the moment was the uproar that i hurried to my fathers side fearful that his soul might actually yield itself to the raging tyranny of its surroundings he lay unmoved in the same quiet stupor of the faculties unconscious apparently that anything out of natures custom was enacting near him as suddenly as it had begun the white deluge ceased as though the last of its reservoirs above were emptied the reaction to comparative silence was so intense that in the first joy of it one scarcely harkened to the voice of a great wind that had risen and was following on the heels of the storm to batten like a camp follower on the wreckage of the battle that had swept by for four weary days it flew going past like an endless army and laden clouds were its parks of artillery and the swords of its bitterness never rested in their scabbards on that first evening when the hailstorm had passed and light was restored i was standing by the window looking out on the bridge and the street all freckled with white when a low moaning sound came to my ears i turned sharply round thinking it was my father but he lay peaceful and motionless i hurried to the door and opened it and there in the passage outside was old peggy cast down upon her face and groaning and muttering in a pitiful manner i gave her a little ungallant peck with my foot now i cried whats this what are you doing her face was hidden on her arm and she spoke up mumblingly oh she said lordlord it baint worthy o you whats the matter i say take the clean and wellpreserved theres better fish than a poor feckless old ooman all fly blown like a carkis wi ungodliness i gave her another little stir i repent she shrieked ill confess everything only spare me now gie me a monthtwo months to prepare my sore wicked soul for the felons grave peggy i said sternly get up and dont make a fool of yourself she seemed to listen is that you renalt she said presently get updo you hear keep the bolt fro me pray to the lord for a bad old ooman wrastle for me renalt are you crazy she bumped her elbows on the floor as she lay in fretful terror wrastlewrastle she whined dont waste your breath on axing things while you talk he enters who enters the lord of hosts i saw his face at the window and the breath o his nostrils was like the sound o guns i arlays meant to repenti swear it on the blessed book its a wicked thing to compact wi the prince o darkness believe me truth i arlays meant it but the pot must be boiled and the beds made and where were old peggys time you wudnt smite a body lord for caring of her dooties and i repent now its never too late over one sinner doing penance oh lord take the young and wellfavored and gie crass rottengoose a month for her sins peggy i havent a doubt youve plenty to do penance for but have you really the stupendous assurance to think that all this storm is got up on your account get up you old idiot the thunders past and theres nothing to be afraid of now her lean body went in with a great sigh for some moments she lay as she was then cautiously twisted her head and peered up at me sakes alive she muttered listening was it all for nowt then i saw the craft come back to her withered eyes in the dusk heave me up renalt she said the lord has seen the wisdom o let alone praise to his mercy dont presume on that peggy hell call to you at his own time though it maynt be through a thunderstorm look to yourself renalt the young twigs snap easiest you may be the first to go wi the load o guilt you gathered in london yon for company very likely you asked me to pray for you just now you know whats on your mind peggy rottengoose i had the old sinner to her feet by this time her face was a yellow haggard thing to look atshining like stained brass something in it seemed to convey to me that perhaps after all the angel of the storm had struck at her in passing she looked at me morosely and fearfully what but ministering to satans children she said you graceless old villain ive a mind to pitch you into the race i made a clutch at her as i spoke but she evaded me with a wriggle and a shrill screech i didnt mean it let me go by what have you got to repent of in the first place i was stealing the pictur o modredthere no peace ha i hard since i done it i let the old liar pass and she shuffled away hugging herself and glancing round at me once or twice as if she still doubted the meaning of my threat i paid no more attention to her but returned to my fathers room the old man lay on his back placid and unconcerned but his eyes were open and he greeted me with a cheerful little nod darkness deepened in the room and the white face on the pillow became a luminous spot set weirdly in the midst of it i had not once till then i think admitted a single feeling of disloyalty toward my father to my heart now a little unaccountable stirring of impatience and resentment awoke in me i was under some undefinable nervous influence and was surely not true to myself in the passing of the mood it seemed suddenly a monstrous thing to me that he the prime author of all that evil destiny that had haunted our lives should be fading peacefully toward the grave while we must needs live on to outface and adjust the ugly heritage of responsibilities that were the fruits of his selfish policy of inaction such sudden swift reactions from a long routine of endurance are humanly inevitable they may flame up at a word a look a shying thoughtthe spark of divinity glowing with indignation over intolerable injustice then the dull decorum of earth stamps it under again and we go on as before during that spell of rebellion my soul passed in review the incidents of a cruel visitation of a fathers sins upon his children i saw the stunted minds meanly nurtured in an atmosphere of picturesque skepticism i saw the natural outgrowth of this in a reckless indifference to individual responsibility following thereon came one by one the impulse to triumph by evilthe unchecked desirethe shameless deedthe road the river and the two lonely graves i rose to my feet and paced the room to and fro casting a resentful glance now and again at the quiet figure on the bed driven to quick desperation i strode to the door opened it and descended the stairs in the blaze of my anger i burst into the haunted room thinking to stay the monster with the mere breath of my fury but the cold blackness drove at me and for all my confidence repelled me on the very threshold i rushed away to the sluice let it fall and shut off the race then i returned breathless and panting and looked at the open door youre a very material devil i muttered a boy could silence your voice for all its boastfulness as i spoke again a little ugly secret laugh seemed to issue from it probably it was only an expiring screech of the axle but it made my blood run tingling for all that i mounted the stairs determinedly crushing down the demon of fear that sought to unman me i have silenced its hateful voice i cried to myself and whispered it again as i reentered my fathers room the old man lay silent and motionless as i seated myself once more by the window now the great blasts of tempest held monopoly of the ghostly house unpierced of that other voice that had been like the grinding of the teeth of the storm presently i heard him stirring restlessly in his bed and little fitful moans came from his lips his uneasiness increased he muttered and threw his arms constantly into fresh positions could it be that my untoward silencing of that voice that for such long years had been his counselor and familiar was making a vacancy in his soul into which deadlier demons were stealing i moved to the bed and looked down upon him as i did so the old tenderness reasserted itself and the mood of blackness passed away if he had bequeathed to us a dark heritage of suffering it is by suffering that the soul climbs from the bestial pitfalls of the senses as i leaned down to cover his chest that his restless tossing had bared a second tempest of hail swept furiously upon the town i ran to the window and looked out in the flashing radiance of the lamp that stood upon the bridge oppositefor night was now settled upon the cityi saw the tumult of white beat upon the stones and rebound from them and thrash all the road as it were with froth suddenly a figure started up in the midst of the flickering curtain of ice it was there in a momentwaving its wild armswringing its handsshrieking i could have fancied though no sound came to me but in the wonder and instant of its rising i knew it to be dukes hardly had i mastered the first shock of surprise when there came the sound of a great cry behind me i turned and there was my father sitting up in bed and his face was ghastly the wheel he shrieked in a suffocating voice the wheel im under it and fell back upon his pillow chapter li a meeting on the bridge it was not immediate death that had alighted but deaths forerunner paralysis i realized this in a moment the mute and stricken figure the closed eyes the darkly flushed face wrenched to the right and the flapping breath issuing onesided from the lipsi needed no experience to read the meaning of these i ran to the head of the stairs and shrieked to old peggy to come up then i hurried to the dressingtable and lighted a candle that stood thereon as i took it in my hand to approach the bed a pane in the lattice behind me went with a splintering noise and something whizzed past my head like a hornet and a fragment of plaster spun from the wall near at the same instant a little muffled sound no louder in the tumult of hail than the smack of an elastic band on paper came from the street outside instinctively i winced and dodged not knowing for the moment what had happened then in the midst of my distraction fury seized me like a snake the blind was up my figure plainly visible from the bridge as i crossed the room the madman outside had shot at me whether from pure deviltry or because he took me for jason i neither knew nor cared coming on the head of my trouble the deed seemed wantonly diabolical had i been master of my actions i think i should then and there have rushed forth and grappled with the evil creature and crushed the life out of him as it was i ran to the window and dashed it open and leaned forth he was there on the bridge still standing up in the pelting storm bareheaded fantastica thing of nameless expression i shrieked to him and cursed him i menaced him with my fists for the moment i was near as much madman as he perhaps some words of my outcry reached him through the hurtling of the storm perhaps he recognized me for i saw him shrink down and cower behind the stones of the bridge i rattled to the window pulled down the blind and turned myself to the stricken figure on the bed as i did so old peggy came breathing and shambling into the room whats to do she said coughing feebly and glaring at me whats to do renalt look there whats happenedwhats the matter with him it is death perhaps she shuffled to the bedside holding in her groaning chest with one hand for a minute she must have stood gazing down ay she said at last leering round at me the lord mistook the room looking in at winder ralph it was were wantednot old peggy praise to his goodness is he dying maybemaybe not yet awhile the dumbstroke have tuk him paralysis so they carls it better ax the doctor look you to him then and look well while i run out to seek for one i leave him in your charge i took her by the arm and stared in her face as i spoke my expression must have been frowning and threatening but indeed i mistrusted the old vagabond she shrunk from me with a twitch of fear hell come round wi his face to the judgment she said and i left her standing by the bedside and hurried from the house leaving the yard i turned sharply round upon the bridge the storm had yielded but the ground was yet thickly strewed with white not a soul seemed to be abroad only low down against the parapet of the bridge was a single living thing and it crouched huddled as if the storm had claimed a victim before it passed my brain still burned with fury over the foul action that had so nearly sent me from my father in his utmost need i could think of nothing at the moment but revenge of nothing but that i must sweep this horror into the river before i could hope to deal collectedly with the fatality that had befallen me i only feared that it would escape me and leaped on it mad with rage i tore him up to his feet and held him from me with a savage gaze and he looked at me with a dark amazed stare but there was no terror in his eyes and even as i held him i saw in the dim lamplight how worn and haggard he had grown how sunken was his white face how fearfully the monomania of revenge had rent him with its jagged teeth you dog i said you end in the millrace heredo you understand you are a murderer in will and would have been in deed if your aim had answered true to your devils heart down with you i closed with him but he still struggled to hold me off i thought it was hethe other hes left london he must be here somewhere there was no deprecation in his tone he spoke in a small dry voice and with an air as if none could doubt that he was justified in his pursuit and must stand aside or suffer by it rather than that it should cease where he is i neither know nor care i answered set and stern youve raised your hand to me at last dog that you are and thats my concern i should have known at firstthat its useless arguing mercy with a devil i had my arms round him like steel bands once he might have been my match or better but not now in his state of physical degeneration yes end it he whispered i always thought to die by water as she did the chase here is exhausting me i can finish my task more effectively from the other side the grave i gave a mocking laugh you shall purge your hate in fire there i said ghostly revenge on the living is an old wives tale he struggled to force an arm free and pointed down at the foaming milltail theres a voice there he cried that says otherwise i read it and so do you for all your shaking heroics fling me down i escape the selfdestruction that was to come fling me down and end it i tightened my arms about him the first desperate fury of my mood was leading me and with it the impulse to murder the wan oncedear features were appealing to me against their will and mine suddenly while i wavered an appalling screech burst from him he wrenched himself free of me with one mad superhuman effort struck out at the empty air and turned and fled across the bridge and up toward the hill beyond in a moment he was lost to sight in the darkness in the shock of his escape i twisted about to see what had so moved himand not a yard behind me was standing dr crackenthorpe for many seconds we stared at one another speechless and motionless his face was pale and set very grimly at last he spoke and murder was the word he muttered he runs fast for a murdered man i said with a sneer who was it he said gazing with a strange fixed expression up the dark blown hill a ghost i answered with a reckless laugh the town is full of them tonight he looked at me gloomily i could have thought he shivered slightly do you know him he was my friend once stand out of my way ive an errand on hand my fathers had a seizure had acome ill go see him you wont i wont have you near him stand out of my way youre a fool promptness is everything in such cases i hesitated for what his professional opinion was worth this man had always stood to us as adviser in such small ailments as we suffered i had no notion where to seek another my father would be unconscious of his presence at least he could pronounce upon the nature of the stroke very well i said ungraciously you can see him and judge whats the matter the old man was lying as i had left him when we entered the bedroom his eyes were still closed and his breathing sounded hard and stertorious hes mortal bad sir peggy said hell die hard i do believe dr crackenthorpe waved her away and bent over the prostrate figure as he did so its eyelids seemed to flicker as if with dread consciousness of his approach be quick i said what has happened he felt the dying pulse bent his yellow face and listened at the heart he was some minutes occupied presently he rose and came to me all formal and professional you must prepare for the worst he said he may speak again by and by but i doubt it in my opinion it is a question of a few days only no medical skill can avail is there nothing i can do nothing he bowed to me stiffly i am at your service he said in a cold voice if i can be of any further use to you you will let me know you are not ignorant of where to find me i believe he was walking to the door but turned and came toward me again that onetime friend of yours he said is he stopping in the town i really dont know dr crackenthorpe i met him by chance and you saw he ran from me you seem interested in him heyes he struck me as bearing a likeness to ato a patient i once attended goodnight chapter lii a written word my escape from that strong net of fatality that had enmeshed so many years of my still young life had been it seemed only a merciful respite now the toils regathering about me again woke a spirit of hopeless resignation in me that had been foreign to my earlier mood of resistance man has made of himself so plodding an animal as to almost resent the unreality of his brief vacations he eats his way like a woodboring larva through a monotonous tunnel of routine satisfied with the thought that some day he may emerge into the light on the other side readywinged for flight to the garden of paradise perhaps lazarus was humanly farseeing in refusing the rich man a drop of water it would have made the poor wretchs after lot tenfold more unendurable now a feeling came over me that i could struggle no more but would lie in the web and suffer unresisting the onsets of fate my fathers seizure dukes reappearance and his hint as to the visit i was to expect from jason the sudden flight of the cripple before the vision of dr crackenthorpeall these were strands about my soul with which i would concern myself no longer i would do my duty so far as i could and set my face in one direction and glance aside no more that night i ordered peggy to bedfor since jasons going she slept in the houseand myself passed the dreary vigil of the hours by my fathers side indeed for the three days following i scarcely lay down at all but took my food in snatches and slept by fits and starts in chairs or windowcorners as occasion offered during the whole of this time the condition of the patient never altered he lay on his back breathing crookedly from his twisted mouth his eyes closed the whole of the right side of his body stricken motionless his left hand he would occasionally move and that was the single sign of animate life he showed and day and night the wind blew and the hail and rain came down in a cold and ceaseless deluge the whole country was flooded i heard and the streams risen but still the rending storm flew and added devastation to misery it was on the afternoon of the third day that chancing to look at the old man as i sat by his bedside i saw with a certain shock of pleasure that his eyes were open and fixed upon my face i jumped to my feet and leaned over him and at that some shadow of emotion passed across his features as if the angel of death stood between him and the window presently his left hand that lay on the coverlet began moving the fingers twitched with a beckoning motion and he raised his arm several times and let it fall again listlessly i fancied i was conscious of some dumb appeal addressed to me toward which my own soul yearned in sympathy yet strive as i would i could not interpret it an inexpressible trouble seemed lost and wandering in the fathomless depths of the eyes passionate utterance seemed ever hovering on the lips ever escaping the grasp of will and sliding back into blackness dad i said what is it try to express by a sign and i will try to understand the hand rose again weakly fluttered in the air and dropped upon the coverlet thrice the effort was made and thrice i failed to interpret its significance then a little quivering sigh came from the mouth and the eyes closed in exhaustion i racked my brains for the meaning of the sign some trouble it was evident sought expression but whatwhatwhat my mind was all dulled and confused by the incidents of the last few days while i was vainly struggling for a solution old peggy entered the room with tea and bread and butter for my afternoon meal she paused with the tray in her hands watching the blind groping of the fingers on the bed ay she said but i doubt me ye cudnt hold a pen master i turned sharply to her is that what he wants pen or penciltis arl one when speech goes we talk wi the fingers what a fool i had been the sign i had struggled in vain for hours to read this uncanny old beldame had understood at a glance i hurried out of the room and returned with paper and pencil i thrust the latter between the wandering fingers and they closed over it with a quick weak snap but they could not retain it and it slipped from them again upon the coverlet a moan broke from the lips and the arm beat the clothes feebly heave en up said the old woman hes axing ye to i put my arm under my fathers shoulders and with a strong effort got him into a sitting posture propped among the pillows i placed the pencil in his hand again and held the paper in such a position that he could write upon it he succeeded in making a few hieroglyphic scratches on the white surface and that was all its no manner o use renalt said peggy better lat en alone and drink up your tea put it down there and leave us to ourselves the old creature did as she was bidden and shuffled from the room grumbling i placed the paper where my fathers hand could rest upon it and sat down to my silent meal presently watching as i ate the weak restless movements of the hand upon the quilt a thought occurred to me which then and there i resolved to put into practice it was evident that unless through an unexpected renewal of strength those dying fingers would never succeed in forming a legible word with the pencil they could barely hold but they could make a sign of themselves and that little power i must seek to direct i hurried down to the kitchen and seized from the wall an ancient bone tablet that peggy used for domestic memoranda scraping a little soot from the chimney i mixed it with water into a thick paste and spread a thin layer of the latter over the surface of the tablet it dried almost immediately and writing on it with the tip of my finger i found that the soot came readily away leaving the mark i had made stenciled white and clear under the upper coating returning to my father with this extemporized first principle and the saucer of black paste i held the tablet before his dim wandering eyes and wrote on it with my finger demonstrating the method at first he hardly seemed to comprehend my meaning but after a repetition or two his glance concentrated and his forehead seemed to ripple into little wrinkles of intelligence at that i smeared the surface of the bone afresh waited a minute for it to dry and placed it under his hand upon the bed leaving him to evolve the method from his poor crippled inner consciousness but a few moments had elapsed when a small low sound from the bed brought me to my fathers side he looked from me to the tablet where it lay and there was a strained imploring line between his eyes gently i took up the little black square and i saw that something was formed on it with infinite toil for it was only his left hand he could use he had scratched on it a single straggling word and in the fading light i read it forgive father i cried is that what you have been striving to say he dragged up his unstricken arm slowly into an attitude as if the hand sought its fellow to join it in a prayer to me before god i said you wrong me to think i could say that word what have i to forgive you for my sins have been my own and they have met with their just reward am i to forgive you for loving me daddad i have known so little love that i cant afford to wrong yours by a thought look i will blot this out that you may know my heart has nothing but tenderness in it for you i snatched up the tablet and smeared out the cruel word and placed the blank surface under his hand again he was looking at me all the time with the same dim anguished expression and now his head sunk back on the pillow and a tear rolled down his face night came upon me sitting there and presently overcome by emotion and weariness i fell over upon the foot of the bed and sunk into a profound sleep for hours i lay unconscious and it was broad day in the room when i awoke with a sudden start realizing in a moment how i had betrayed my vigil i leaped to my feet with a curse at my selfishness and looked down upon my father he was lying back sunk in a wan exhausted sleep and under its influence his features seemed to have somewhat resumed their normal expression but it appeared he had again been scrawling on the tablets with the first of the dawn probably and these were the broken words thereon that stared whitely up at me i murd mored chapter liii an attempt and a failure for a minute or more i must have stood gazing down on the damning words unmoving breathless almost then i glanced at the quiet face on the pillow and back again to the tablet i held in my hand i am glad to knowproud in the little pride i may call minethat at that supreme moment i stood stanch that i cried to myself it is a lie born of his disease he never did it that i dashed the tablet back upon the bed and that my one overwhelming thought was how may i defend this poor soul from himself that he might die in peace with his consciencethat was the end of my desire yet how was i knowing so little to convince him disproof i had none but only assurance of sympathy and a moral certainty that a nature so constituted could never lend itself to so horrible a deed in the midst of my confusion of thought a sudden idea woke in me and quickened into a resolve i went swiftly out of the room down the stairs and walked in upon old peggy mumbling her bread and milk in the kitchen i was going out for awhile i told her and bade her listen for any sound upstairs that might betoken uneasiness on the part of the patient for the time being there was no rain to greet me as i stepped outside but the wind still blew boisterously from the east and the sky was all drawn and wrapt in a doleful swaddle of cloud sternly and without hesitation i made my way to the house of dr crackenthorpe an anaemic crosslooking servant girl was polishing what remained of the handle of the front door with a tattered doeskin glove is the doctor inside i said to her she left the glove sticking on the handle like a frouzy knocker and stood upright looking down upon me what do you want with him she said i wish to see him on private business hes at his breakfast he wont thank you for troubling him now i dont want him to thank me i wish to see him thats all well then you cantand thats all i pushed past her and walked into the hall and she followed me clamoring the ugly voice i knew well called from a back room i had not yet been into whats that i turned the handle and walked in he was seated before a stained and dinted urn of copper and a great slice of toast from which he had just bitten a jagged semicircle was in his hand i told him you was at breakfast said the cross girl but nothing ud suit his lordship but to drive his elbow into my chest and walk in she emphasized her little lie with a pressure of her hand upon the presumably wounded part assault and battery said the doctor showing his teeth get out of my house fellow after ive had a word with you eh edith go and fetch a constable certainly i said the very thing i should like ill wait here till he comes he called to the girl as she was running out wait a bit leave the fellow with me and shut the door she obeyed sulkily and we were alone together he went on with his breakfast with an affectation of unconcern and took no notice of me whatever i believe you wished me to let you know dr crackenthorpe if i should be in further need of your services he swallowed huge gulps of tea with an unpleasant noise protruding his lips like a gargoyle but answer made he none i am in need of your services he dissected the leg of a fowl with professional relish but did not speak in a gust of childish anger that was farcical i nipped the joint between finger and thumb and threw it into the fire for an instant he sat dumfounded staring at his empty plate then he scrambled to his feet and ran to the mantelshelf all in a scurry of fury and began diving among the litter there and tossing it right and left the pistolthe pistol he muttered in a cracked voice where is it what have i done with it never mind you expect a fee for your services i suppose he slackened in his feverish search and i saw he was listening to me you dont want to kill the goose with the golden eggs i presume said i coolly he twisted round and faced me you have a rude boorish insistence of your own he cried at me hoarsely but i suppose i must value it for what its worth its the custom to ask a fee for professional services you volunteered yours you know he shrugged his shoulders quite so he said the matter lies with you with you i think in visiting my father the other night you had no secret hope i suppose that we should pay you in the sort of coin you have already had too much of you insult me sir unwittingly i assure you will you answer me one question is there the remotest chance of my father recovering from this attack not the remotestnot of his definitely rallying even i should say is that only an opinion bah miracles dont occur in surgery he is practically a dead man i tell you why do you adopt this attitude to me then if you have an eye to a particular sort of fee perhaps i wanted proof that the old man was past levying toll on a wicked smile wrinkled his mouth perhaps i satisfied myself he was and from you i expected no consideration or justice you can leave that out of the question a mere business contract is another matter and that is what i come to propose oh indeed he said it with a sneer but moved nevertheless nearer the table so that we could talk without raising our voices may i ask the nature of this stupendous contract i will tell you without asking i make you this offerto hand over to you all that remains of the treasure on one condition and that is that you tell me how my brother modred came by his death he gave a little start then dropped his eyes frowning and drummed with his fingers on the table i saw he understood that he was groping in his mind for some middle course whereby he could satisfy all parties and secure the prize for himself if your father didnt do it he was beginning but i took him up at the outset you know he didnt it is a foul lie of such a man dr crackenthorpemy voice despite my stubborn resolve broke a littlehe is lying there on his deathbed despairing haunted with the thought that it was he who in a fit of drunken madness strangled the life in his own son it is all hideousmonstrousunnatural you know more about it i believe than any man you were sitting with him that night but he left me awhile you know it wasnt in his nature to do such a thing pardon me i have always looked upon your father as a dangerous reckless fellow i wont believe it you know more than you will saymore than you dare to tell oh if that churchyard fellow had only lived i would have had the truth by now i hope so though you do me the honor to hold me implicated with him in some absurd and criminal secret and on the strength of a little delirious ravingnot an uncommon experience in the profession trust me i dont appeal to your charity or your mercy theres a rich reward awaiting you if you tell what you know and ease the old dying mans mind further than thatif you withhold the truth and let him pass in his misery i swear that ill never rest till ive dragged you down and destroyed you he bent his body in a mocking and ungainly bow i really cant afford to temporize with my conscience for any one living or dead as it is i have allowed myself to slip into the position of an accomplice which is an extreme concession on my part of friendly patronage toward a family that has certainly never studied to claim my good offices i looked at him gloomily i could not believe even now that he would dismiss me without some byeffort toward the prize that he saw almost within his grasp and i was right still he went on i dont claim infallibility for my deduction i shall be pleased if you wish it to return with you and if possible to question the patient i was too anguished and distraught to reject even this little thread of hope perhaps it was in me that at the last moment the sight of that stricken figure at home might move the cold cynicism of the man before me to some weak warmth of charity he bade me wait in the hall while he finished his breakfast and i had nothing for it but to go and sit down under the row of smoky prints he kept me a deliberate while and then came forth leisurely and donned his brown coat that was hanging like a decayed pirate beside me we walked out together the mill greeted us with no jarring thunder as we entered its door for the discord of its phantom grinding i had myself silenced i listened as we climbed the wooden stairs for any sound from the room above but only the echo of our footfalls reverberated in the lonely house no sign of old peggy had i seen but when i pushed open the door of my fathers room there she was standing by his bed and leaning over at the noise of our entrance she twisted her head gave a sort of sudden peewit cry and tumbled upon the floor in a collapsed heap the tablet from the bed in her hand chapter liv a last confession i thought that the old woman startled by our entrance had merely stepped back tripped and so come to the ground but the doctor uttered an exclamation ran to the prostrate figure and called me to bring a spongeful of water from the washhandstand when i had complied i saw that the ancient limbs were rigid the teeth set the lips foaming slightly peggy was in an epileptic fit and that at her age was no light matter i feared that her struggles might presently wake my father who was to all appearance sleeping peacefully and asked the doctor if it would not be possible to move her to another room he shook his head but gave no answer suddenly i was conscious that his eyes were fixed upon the tablet still held in her crooked fingers and that in my distraction i had not erased the damning words that were traced thereon the wet sponge was in my hand with a quick movement i stooped and swept it across the surface as i did so the doctor slewed his head round and smirked up at me with a truly diabolical expression then he snatched the sponge and plumped it with a slap on the withered forehead the soot from the tablet ran in wet streaks over the sinister old face and made a grotesque horror of it the wretched creature moaned and jerked under the shock as though the water were biting acid not a word was spoken between us for full twenty minutesnot till the fit at length subsided and left the racked body to the rest of exhaustion the eyes became human with what humanity was left them the pallid face fell into its usual linesthe old woman lay flat with closed lids in the extreme of debility then said dr crackenthorpe take you her feet and i her head and well move her out of this we carried peggy into my room and laid her on the bed that had been jasons her hours must be numbered i thought as i looked at the gray features already growing spectral in the rising fog of death turning from that old fallen stump dr crackenthorpe suddenly faced me a smile on his crackled lips so he said on the top of that confession you sought to convince me against your own judgment i havent a thought to deny it i value it at nothing he has fed on a baseless chimera at your instigationyes you neednt lietill his mind is sick with disease what does it matter i know him and i stake my soul on his innocence i asked you to ease his mindnot mine i tell you in a wordi strode up to him and spoke slowly and fiercelymy father had no hand in modreds death and i believe you know it he backed from me a little breathing hard when a sound from the bed stopped him i started and turned the old womans hand was up to her neck her sick eyes were moving from the one to the other of us in a lost questioning way a murmur was in her lean pulsing throat lie quiet peggy i said you may be able to speak in a minute if you lie quiet the words seemed only to increase the panic in her with a gurgling burst a fragment of speech came from her mouth be i passing the doctor heard it yes he said brutally she appeared to collapse and shrink inward but in a moment she was up leaning on her elbow and her face was terrible to look at twas i killed the boy she cried with a sort of breathless wail tell himtell ralph and so fell back and i thought the life was gone from her was i base and cruel in my triumph i rose erect indifferent to the tortured soul stretched beneath me who was right i cried believe me now you dog and growl and curse your fill over the wreck of your futile villainy his mouth was set in an incredulous grinning line i brushed sternly past him making for my fathers room i could not pause or wait a moment the poor souls long anguish should be ended there and then as i stooped over his bed i saw that some change had come upon him in sleep the twist of his mouth was relaxed his face had assumed something of its normal expression i seized up the tablet from where it had tumbled on the floor i smeared it with a fresh coating from the saucer his first waking eyes i swore should look upon the written evidence of his acquittal while i was waiting for the stuff to dry he stirred murmured and opened his eyes renalt he said in a very low weak voice speech had returned to him i knelt by his side and passed my tremulous arms underneath him father i said you can speakyou are awake again i have something to tell you something to say dont move or utter a sound you have been asleep all this timeonly asleep while you were unconscious old peggy has been taken illvery ill in the fear of death she has made a confession father i saw what you wrote on thislook on this tablet it was all untrue i have wiped it out it was peggy killed modredshe has confessed it he lifted his unstricken handthe other was yet paralyzedin an attitude of prayer presently his hand dropped and he turned his face to me his eyes brimming with tears renalt he murmured in the poor shadow of a voice i thank my godbut the greater sini can never condonethough you forgive memy son forgive what have i to forgive dad my heart is as light as a feather he only gazed at me earnestlypathetically i went and sat by his side and smoothed his pillow and took his hand in mine now the incubus is gone dad and youll get well you musti cant do without you the black shadow is passed from the mill and the coming days are all full of sunshine what has sheconfessed how didshedo it i didnt wait to hear i wanted you to know and left her the moment she had spoken alone i hesitated and stammered there he said with a faint smile i knowi know hes in the house i dont feari dont feari tell you impast that he wont wantto come in here he spoke all this time in a bodiless low tone and the effort seemed to exhaust him for some time i sat by him till he fell into a light slumber no sound was in the house and i did not even know if dr crackenthorpe had left the adjoining room but when my father was settled down and breathing quietly i rose and stepped noiselessly thither to see he was standing against the window and turned stealthily round as i entered watching me as i walked toward him i glanced aside at the bed something about the pose of the figure thereon brought me to a sudden stop my heart rose and fell with a sharp quick emotion and in the instant of it i knew that the old woman was dead her head had been propped against the bolster so that her chin rested upon her withered breast that would never beat again to the impulse of fear or evil or any kinder emotion for peggy had answered to her name for the moment i stood stupefied i think i had hardly realized that the end was so near sorrow i could not feel but now regret leaped in me that i had not waited to hear all that she might tell only for an instant on the next it flashed through me that it was better to put my trust in that first wild confession than to invite it by further questioning to selfcondonationperhaps actual denial you went too soon dr crackenthorpe said in a cold voice of irony i must tell you that was hardly decent i never thought she had spoken her last nor had sheby a good deal she said more much moreand to a different purpose i stared at him breathing hard are you going to lie again i muttered that pleasantry is too often on your lips sir he said coolly none doubt truth so much as those who have dishonored her the dead woman there leaves you this as a legacy he thrust the thing he was holding into my hand i recognized it in a sort of dull wonder it was that ancient mutilated portrait of modred that i had once discovered in peggys possession from the stained and riddled silhouette to the evil face of the man before me i glanced and could only wait in dumb expectancy she told me where to find it he said and i brought it to her i never heard you move i stepped softly for fear of disturbing your father do you see that outraged relic the old creatures selfaccusation turned upon itupon that and nothing else what do you mean that you must look elsewhere i am afraid for the criminal our pleasant rottengoose shared the gross superstitions of her kind all these years she has secretly hugged the really reprehensible thought that the boys death was due to her i dont understand a base superstition my frienda very base superstition she had in her possession i understand a flint shaft of the paleolithic period there are plenty such to be picked up in the neighborhood the ignorant call them elf arrowheads and cherish a belief that to mutilate with one of them a bodys portrait or image is to compass that persons destruction this harridan cherished no love for your brother and fancied she saw her opportunity of seizing revenge without risk on a certain night of misfortune the boy died and henceforth she knew herself as his murderess goodmorning to you may i remind you that my fee is yet unpaid i will certify to the present cause of death with pleasure chapter lv a shadow from the past like one in a dream i heard the doctors footstep recede down the stairs and heard the yard door close dully on him as he left the house in my suffering soul i felt one cruel shaft rankling and for the rest only a vague sense of loss hung like a cloud over all my faculties i had no doubt of the truth of the evil creatures words not otherwise could his knowledge and possession of the tattered portrait be accounted for now too peggys unaccountable terror at my discovery of her chaunting and gloating over her work on a certain afternoon recurred to me and was confirmation irrefragable the wretched old woman had had all the will and intention but she was innocent of the deed i must look elsewhere as he had saidbegin all over again truebut now less than ever in my fathers direction had i needed in my heart convincing proof of the old mans guiltlessness his manner in accepting his acquittal would have afforded it by this he had shown that with him as with the hounds that had sought to pull him down his guilt was purely conjecturalpresumed merely on the circumstantial evidence of the braces found in his pocket but i judged him in my heart and pronounced him acquitted now it was idle to moan over my impetuous rush to conclusions i must only guard against permitting the disillusion to vex the few last days that remained to him if i wronged the old dead housewife thereby it was in degree only for morally she was as guilty as if her charm had borne all the evil force she attributed to it well i must see about getting some harpy in to minister to her final dumb necessities and then a low cry coming from the other room broke upon my ears with beating heart i rushed from the death chamber onlymerciful heavento enter another at the first glance i saw that the white spirit had entered during my absence and had written the sign of eternity on my fathers forehead he was sitting up in bed and the expression on his face was that of a dreadful eager waiting renalt he called to me in a clear loud voicethe recovered note of an old stronger personality i hurried to him fell on my knees put my arm about his shoulders renalt i am dyingbut not yet the spirit wont let me pass till i have spoken he turned his head with a resolute effort and gazed upon me what thing have i beenwhat thing have i been send me my enemies that i may face and defy them which of them worse than myself oh cravencraven father i only am with youno enemy father he struck his fist down upon the counterpane by your love for me you shall know the truth judge me thenjudge me then as you will hear me speak and make no answer till i have finished judge me then and let me pass to my doom weighted with your judgment father renalt i killed your mother i fell back appalled an instantthen i leaned forward and again held him in my arms ah his voice broke swerved and recovered itself not with this handmy god nobut surely and pitilessly none the less not a month after modred was born i found my name and trust dishonored and by her listen speak nothing you must know all she had been in service in london before i married herwhere to this day i have never learned i shall know sooni shall know she was friendlessa weak irresponsible beautiful young woman i threw aside all for her sake and my love grew tenfold in the act of combating the misfortune it brought me i could love renalti could love there was a passion in my fervor he clasped his hands wildly and looked piercingly before him how the old torment flames up in me at the last i think i gave my soul to the wanton and i thought i had hers in exchange what inspired fools love makes of us my castle in cloudland stood firm till that month after modreds birth then all in a daya minuteit dissolved and vanished i came upon her secretly gloating over a portraitthe miniature of a man i sawsuspectedwrenched half the truth from her half the truth only renalt when i wedded with her she had a child living she whose love i had looked upon as a precious possession was all base and hollow behind her beautiful personality moreshe had borne me three children yet what affection she was capable of clung about the memory of her first passion true this spark had wearied of her had dismissed her from his servicehis service you understand and from the face of her child yet the long years of my passionate devotion weighed as nothing in the balance i was the means ready to make of her an honest womanthat was all an honest womanmy god his teeth snapped together with a click his dying eyes shone out but their inspiration was demoniacal in one thing only he went on in a low hard voice the poor frail wretch was stable that portraitthe miniatureshe died refusing to reveal to me its identity no threats no cruelty availed she kept her secret to the last as he now continued his left hand clutched and tightened upon the bedclothes and a dark shadow seemed to grow out of his face i shut her close in the room below there with only the voice of the wheel for company i swore she should remain till she confessed each day i brought her food and water and each day i said give me his name but she was always silent she had been weak and ailing from caring for her baby modred and she faded before my eyes yet i was merciless a little more i thought and so worthless fragile a thing must needs yield and answer me it was will against will and hers conquered he paused a moment and i could see drops of sweat freckling his forehead slowly hour by hour the stealth and darkness of her prison wrought madness in her still i persisted and she refused once she asked to see her childrenthe little baby i was rearing as best i might with infinite toil and difficultyand i laughed and shut her in again the next morning going to her i was dumfounded to hear no booming voice greeting me from the basement the wheel had stopped i threw back the door and she was gone but the cupboard was sprung open and the dammed water spurted and leaped from the motionless blades a stump of timber was lying near she had burst the lock with it andi rushed and dropped the sluice hurried back and looked down i saw her dress tangled in the floats below and the water heaping into a little mound as it ran over something then i raced to the room over above wrenched up a board and fastening a rope to a beam lowered the slack of it into the pit it served me well in after days as you know i can hardly remember how i got her out i know all my efforts were futile till i thought of notching a paddle and fixing the rope in the hole when at last i laid her down on the floor of the room i grew sick with horror there was that in her staring eyes that made my soul die within me i threw the place open to the authorities i courted every inquiry she had been in a delirious state i said since the coming of the child and had thrown herself down in a fit of madness only the evidence of the burst lock i suppressed we had been reserved folk making few friends or none our manner of life was known only to ourselves not a soul suspected the truth and many pitied me in my bereavement i kept my own counsel they brought in a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity and she lies under an old nameless mound in the cemetery yonder then i shut my heart and my door and made out life in the blackness at first i was whelmed in the horror of the catastrophe yet my pity was not touched and i soon came to believe in the justice of her fate i never put hand on her i thought twas god wrought the punishment but soon a terrible hatred woke in my heart for the first author of my misery one day i descended by the wheel again and nailed the miniature to its axle wait you there i cried till the question is answered so shall he follow in her footsteps ah i have heard talk of the fateful fascination of the wheel why has it never drawn him to come and claim his portrait the fevered torrent of speech broke suddenly in him and silence reigned in the room the dying heart leaped against my chest as i held him and my own seemed to flutter with the contact what could i think or say i was dazed with the passion of my emotions presently he turned himself quickly and looked at me your judgment he cried hoarsely did i well or wickedly through my mind there swiftly passed memory of the barren neglect of our younger lives of all the evil and misery that had been the indirect result of so cowardly a nursing of an injury i bowed my head and said in a low voice i forgive you that is all you must ask of me perhaps in the light of his later gentleness he understood me for suddenly the tears were running down his cheeks and he cried falteringly out of the abyss of death a ghost rises and faces me all this have i done for the son i love with the words he fell back from my arm and lay gasping on his pillow and though my father was near spent and i knew it i could find in my heart no word of justification of his conduct no comfort but the assurance of my forgiveness oh it is an evil thing to arrogate to ourselves gods prerogative of judgment to assume that in any personal wrong we can so disassociate justice and resentment as ever to be capable of pronouncing an impartial sentence to return a blow in kind is a natural and wholesome impulse but deliberate cruelty following however great a provocation can never be anything but most base and unmanly and the sin had been sinned before she even knew my father yet maybe to a nature like his that was the reverse of a palliation to feel that he had never had her true love or duty while lavishing his all of both on her to feel that in a manner the veins of his own children ran with contaminationi could conceive these operating more fiercely in his mind than the discovery that some later caprice of fancy had lured her from her faith it was all past and over and i would not condemn or even judge him though i had been one victim of his quarrel with life what was my grievance in face of the awful prospect so immediately before him in a few hoursmoments maybethe call would come and his soul would have to submit itself for analysis in the theater of the skies chapter lvi alone about of the afternoon my father who had lain for some hours in a state bordering on stupor and whose breathing had latterly become harsh and difficult rose suddenly in his bed and called to me in a strong voice i was by his side in a moment and lifted him up as he signified i should do a mortal whiteness was in his face and i saw the end was approaching i have no fear he said in a sort of sick ecstasy i can be true to myself at the last thank god the soul triumphs over the body he swayed in my arms clutched at me and dragged himself erect again my brainmy brain something seems to swerve in it quick before its too late he held on to me at the last moment the latent determination of his character trod weakness under and proved the soul masterful with all his functions withering in the blighting breath of the destroyer his spirit stood out fearless and courageous a conqueror by its mere individuality it had darkened early and candles were lighted in the room and the blind pulled down outside the wind tore at the crazy lattice or finding entrance moaned to and fro in the gusty passages it threatened to be a night of storm and sweeping rain and all its wild and dismal surroundings were in keeping with the ghastly figure lying against me yet if there was one in that lonely chamber who shrunk and feared it was i not that other so verging on his judgment with so many and such heavy responsibilities to answer for god forgive him i triumph renalt he said feeding the effort of speech with quick drawn gasps this later craven has never been ii was strong to carry out a purpose even if it led me to the gallows some whitelivered devil usurped out with the worm at last i triumph and abide by that i did in the righteousness of wrath but youyou let me say itquicki was fast on the coward grip oh a bitter bitter curse on the treacherous beast who unmanned me only to you renalt i pray and ask for pardon i thoughtall the timei had killed the boythe bracesi never knew hehe that reptile suggestedperhaps modred hadfound and kept the cameo i went up blindlycame down blindlyi was drunkbestiali could remember nothing he moaned and would have clasped his hands to me but for weakness at the last the paralysis of his limbs had departed and he could move disease loosened its clutch it seemed in the presence of the death it had invoked renalti remembered nothingbut i fearedand fearing i saw the odium rest on you and did not speak it was i gave you to that living deathi who submitted to that fiends dictating because he struck at me through the sordid passion that had mastered my better nature renalt fatherhear me am i speaking distinctly listen i forgive you all it seemed as if a flush passed across his face he pressed my hand feebly and dropped his head now he muttered come the crash of doom to all else i am ready to answer call the like a glass breaking his voice snapped and immediate silence befell he had not stirred in my arms but now i felt the whole surface of his body moving as it were of itself with a light ruffling shudder suddenly he seemed to shrink into himself rather than away from me so that he cowered unsupported on the bed i fell back and looked at his face his head moved softly from side to side the eyes following something unseen of me hither and thither about the room in a moment they contracted and fixed themselves horribly on one point as if the things had come to the bed foot and were softly mounting it in the same instant on my dull and appalled senses broke the low booming voice of the wheel circling in its black pit far below and i knew that in the phantom sound no material force spoke but that the heart of the dying man was transmitting its terrors to me then i saw my father sink slowly back drawing as he did so the sheet up and over his face as if to shut out the sight and all the time the convulsive fluttering of my own breath alone stirred the tense silence that reigned about us i must have remained in this position many minutes fixed and motionless in a trance of fear when the stealthy noise below seemed to cease suddenly as it had begun at that i leaped to my feet with a strangled cry and tore the bedclothes away from the face the eyes stared up at me as if i were the secret presence the jaw was dropped the whole body collapsed and sunk into the sheets he had died without a soundtherein a moment had died of that that was beyond human speech of something to which no dreadful human cry could give expression wading near knee deep in the flooded meadows sense and reason returned to me by slow degrees then a wan streak of sunrise gaped like a dead mans wound on the stormy horizon and a new day was breaking to wind and deluge that seemed endless ah surely i had been tried beyond mortal endurance so i thought not knowing what was yet to come what tension the souls fetters can be put to without breaking the sodden day broadened and found me still wandering once during the morning i crept back to the house of terror and standing without its door summoned the old woman who had come of herself to attend to dead peggys laying out and told her of my fathers death and directed her to a second task later in the day i told myself i would return by and by when the dead should be decently composed for rest and their expression should have resumed something of its normal cast then i hurried forth again and sought forgetfulness in the keen rush of air and wide reality of the open country walking resting on some gate or stile seeking a wayside tavern for food and drinkalways i kept steadily away from me the slightest reflection on any of the last words spoken by my father i could not bear that my thoughts should so much as approach them i had greatly suffered been greatly wronged yet let my mind dwell insistently on the thought that these evils were of the past never more to vex me out of reason should i look steadily forward shutting my ears like the prince in the fairy tale to the spectral voices that would fain provoke me to an answer it was growing near that dusky period of the short day when if one lifts ones eyes from the ground the sky seems closing in upon the earth worn out and footsore i had rounded toward the city from its eastern side and was traversing the now lonely stretch of bypath that leads from the station when i saw a woman and little child going on in front of me haltingly as i came up they drew aside to let me pass and i cried out zyp and stopped in astonishment and a little fear she faced round upon me breathing quickly and put one hand to her bosom in a startled manner that was quite foreign to her renny she whispered with a fading smile on her white facepitiful heaven how white and worn it had become and burst into tears the next moment shocked beyond measure at her appearance her woeful reception of me i stepped back all amazed she mistook my action and held out an imploring arm to me the little weird girl at her side half buried herself in her mothers skirts and peered up at me with deep eyes set in a tangle of hair renny cried zyp oh you wont throw me off you wont refuse to hear me come away i said hoarsely to some quiet road where we can talk undisturbed you are not too tired toooh im wearied to death why not the mill renny why not the mill zyp not nownot at present ill tell you by and by see ill take the little girl on one arm and you can cling to the other she pushed the child forward with a forlorn sigh it whimpered a little as i lifted it but i held it snug against my shoulder and its soft breath on my cheeks seemed to melt the hard core of agony in my brain soon i had them in a quiet spot and seated upon a fallen log there holding the child against me i looked in the eyes of the mother and could have wept zyp zyp what is it a boisterous clap of wind tumbled her dark hair as i spoke what was it her lustrous head was strewed with ashy threads as if the clipping fate had trimmed some broken skein of life over it her eyes were like fathomless pools shrunk with drought an impenetrable sorrow was figured in her wasted face this was the shadow of zypnot the sweet substanceand moving among ghosts and shadows my own life seemed stumbling toward the grave chapter lvii a promise clasping thin nervous fingers zyp looked up in my face fearfully have you seen jason no has he come too hes gone on before to the mill to seek you god help him ive been out all day is it the old trouble zyp oh renny i despair at last i fought it while i was strong but nownow her head sunk and she pressed a hand to her bosom again what ails you dear zyp are you ill i dont know something seems to suck at my veins i have nothing definite the wretchedness of life is sapping my strength i suppose is it still so wretched i am always here to give you what help i can oh i know and we must always be cursing your quiet with our entreaties zyp you neednt talk like that my heart is open to my little sister and is this my bonny niece she was a slender mite of four or thereabouts with a delicate thin face oval like a blushing rose petal and a quaint solemn manner of movement and broken speech give me a kiss mouse oh what a prim little peck a faint smile came to the mothers lips youll learn to love your uncle renna did you name her after me dont flatter yourself i call her renna for short her real names zyp i laughed over the queer deduction then sighed will you love me i said to the little girl but she was too shy to answer i stroked her shining head and poke over it to zyp tell me all about it dear said i its nothing but the old miserable storypursuit and flight and with each new movement some little means of living abandoned looking at this pale injured woman a fierce deep resentment flared up in my heart against the inexorable tyranny of the fiend who would not learn mercy i had too long stood aside too long remained neutral in an unnatural warfare the most innocent victim of which was she whose image my soul professed to hold inviolate old ties bound me no longer her champion would i be in life and death meeting stealth with secrecy pursuit with ambush i put the child from me and rose hurriedly to my feet zyp i cried this must end forgive me that holding you in my heart as i have always done i have not been more active in your succor here all doubt ends i devote myself body and soul to your help and welfare crying softly she drew her little one to her and wound her arms about her now the last of her weird nature seemed broken and gone and she was woman only helpless and alone renny renny she sobbed why didnt you sooner oh renny why didnt you sooner her anguishher implied reproachpierced to my soul has that been in your mind zyp i never thoughtit was always a habit with me to yield the lead to jason and you were so strong and independent not now for longa haunted hunted thing but i had no rightand then your father if i thought i had sacrificed your interests to a mistaken sense of duty to himah zyp it would be a very bitter thing no no youve always been strong and good and generous dont mind what i say im only desperate with trouble hush little rabbit mother cries with joy to have found a friend need you have sought long every word you say seems a reproach no no no youll misread me and fall away from us at the last i swear not tell me what has happened we thought we had escaped himperhaps that he was dead there was a long respite then one nightfour five days agohe was there some place where they gamble with cardsand he accused my husband of cheating there was a terrible scene jason came home all smeared with blood but it was the old terror that made us despair why are such things allowed on earth it seemed all leaf and flowers and sky to me once how long ago he stood outside our lodgings the next morning his dreadful face was like a devils then we knew we must go when the bill was paid we had only a few shillings left in our sickness we turned to you and we set off tramping tramping down to winton by easy stages jason carried the child my arms were too weak and hethat other hes sure to follow us but he wont know weve walked i remembered the figure on the bridge four nights ago and was silent renalt what can we do jason has gone to me for money i suppose oh if you could only let us have a little we might escape abroad again and bury ourselves in some faraway spot where he could never find us zyp listen to me my father died last night died the old man oh renny renny he had been long ailing i have been wandering all day to try to restore my shattered nerves that is why i have not met jason dead the old poor man and you are alone yes zyp she broke down and wept long and sadly he was good to me she moaned and i requited his kindness ill and now i come to worry you in your unhappiness you came to lighten it with a glimpse of the old sweet natureyou and your pretty baby here do you think her pretty renny he would have been fond of her and hes gone what a world of death and misery now the mill is no place for you at present old peggy is dead too and gone to her judgment in a few days the house will be quit of mourning then you must all three come and live with me there and well make out life in company she sat clasping her little girl and staring at me her lips parted as she listened breathlessly that would be good she whispered do you hear baby mumby and renna will lie down at last and go to sleep the child pressed her cheek to her mothers and put her short arms about her neck with a sympathetic sigh her lot i think had been no base contrast with that of children better circumstanced she was dressed even now as if from the fairy queens wardrobe though zyps poor clothes were stained and patched in a dozen places then my loveoh may i not call her so nowlooked up at me sorrowfully over the brink of her short ecstasy dear renny she said how can it ever be as you say rest can never come to us while he lives i have sworn zyp i am confident and strong to grapple with this tragic furioso if he persists after one more warning well set the law on him for a wandering lunatic that i believe he isoh she closed her eyes as if in an ineffable dream of peace and security the question is what are you to do in the meantime thats soon settled we came over micheldever only a few miles away well go back there and hire a single room in the villagei saw one to let that would suit usand wait till you send for us very well and what do you say to taking little zyp back by yourself and leaving jason here under my wing if you think it best i must make certain arrangements with him yes i think that will be best i spoke cheerfully and buoyantly anxious to quicken and sustain her newborn hope uneasy forebodings nevertheless drove me to make the proposition i could not free my mind of the thought that duke yet hung secretly about the place induced to wait and watch on that sure instinct that had never yet in the long run failed to interpret to him the movements of his victims therefore i felt it safer to keep my brother for the present under friendly lock and key rather than risk a further exposing of him to the malignant observation of his enemy zyp take this money i wish it were more but it will keep you going for the present no renny i have a little left dont worry me changeling ah the name and the flowers she rose to her feet have you forgotten my asking you never to pick one not once in my life since zyp my conscience is free of that reproach she looked at me with a sweet strange expression in her wet eyes goodby dear brother she said suddenly holding out her hand to me shall i not see you off no we shant have long to wait i dare say and jason will be wishing for you kissrenny kiss dad for methis kissand she stepped hurriedly forward and put her soft trembling lips to my forehead my blood leaped for a moment i was near catching her madly in my arms goodby i cried swerving back goodby little zyp they moved from me a few paces out in the road the wind caught the womans skirts and flung her dark hair abroad suddenly she turned and came back to me renny she said in low heartrending tones it looks so happy and golden but the fierce air talked in my lungs as i went oh promisepromisepromise anything zyp in the wide world to care for my little onemy darling if im called away before god i swear to devote my life to her she looked at me a long moment with a piercing gaze gave a hoarse low sob and catching at her childs hand hurried away with her down the road i watched their going till their shapes grew dim in the stormy dusk then twisted about and strode my own way homeward heaven help me it was my last vision of her who through all the hounding of fate had made my life a perfumed altarflame before i reached the mill the rain swept down once more wrapping the gabled city in high spectral gloom not dust to dust it seemed was our lot to be in common with the sons of men but rather the fearfuller ruin of those whose names are writ in water so fiercely drove the onset of flying deluge that scarcely might i force headway against its icy battalions dark was falling when at last i reached the mill and all conflicting emotions i might have felt on approaching it were numbed by reason of the mere physical effort of pressing forward therefore it was that hastening down the yard my eyes were blind to neighboring impressions otherwise some unaccustomed shape crouching in the shelter of its blackness would have induced me to a pause as it was i fell rather than beat against the door and then drew myself back to gather breath almost immediately a step sounded coming down the passage beyond the door was pulled inward and i saw the figure of jason standing in the opening ah i gasped and was about to step in when he gave a sickly screech and his hands went up as if in terror to ward off a blow i felt a breath at my ear and turned quickly roundand there was the white face of duke almost looking over my shoulder chapter lviii the specter hound that night when the flood waters rose to a head was a terrible one for wintonone ghastly in the extreme for all lost souls whose black destinies guided their footsteps to the mill perhaps a terror of being trappedto what hideous fate who knowssomewhere in the tortuous darkness of the building sent my brother leaping by a mad impulse into the waste uproar of the night anyhow before my confused senses could fully grasp the dread nature of the situation he had rushed past me plunged into and up the yard and was racing for his life as he sprang by the cripple made a frantic clutch at him nipped the flying skirt of his coat staggered and rolled over actually with a fragment of torn cloth in his hand he was up on his feet directly however and off in pursuit though i in my turn vainly grasped at him as he fled by then reason returned to me and i followed it all happened in a moment and there were we three hotly engaged in such a tragic game of followmyleader as surely had never before been played in the old city and there was no fear of comment or interference we had the streets the wind and rain the night to ourselves and before our eyes if these failed us the wastes of eternity racing in the tracks of the cripple as he followed in jasons i managed to keep measured pace with him and that was all how he made such time over the ground with his crooked limbs was matter for marvel yet i think in that mad brief burst i never lessened the distance between us by a yard it was a comparative test of the fearful the revengeful and the apprehensive impulses and sorely i dreaded in the whirling scurry of the chase that the second would win across the yardto the left over the short stone bridge under whose arch the choked milltail tumbled and snarleda little further and up chisll street with a sharp swerve to the right the hunted man rushed with duke at his heels then a hundred yards on in one lightninglike moment jason giving out in a breathless impulse of despair as it seemed threw himself against the shadowy buttress of a wall crouching with his back to the angle of it duke checking his flying footsteps some paces short of his victim came to a sudden stop and i carried forward by my own impetus almost fell against the cripple and staggering seized him by the arms from behind and so held him fiercely my lungs pumping like piston rods suddenly i marveled to find my captive offering no resistance seeking for the reason of this collapse i raised my eyes and wondered can this account for it we stood outside dr crackenthorpes house light came through a lower window immediately opposite us and set in the luminous square like an ugly shadow on a wall was the profile and upper half of the body of the doctor himself he seemed to be bending over some task and the outline of his face was clearly defined suddenly the clothed flesh of the arms i grasped seemed to flicker as it were with shuddering convulsion and from the lips of the man held against me the breath came sibilant like the breath of one caught in a horror of nightmare before i could think how to act the figure of the doctor rose erect and i saw him fix his hat on his head evidently he was preparing to leave the house i felt myself drawn irresistibly to one side helpless as a child i stumbled in the wake of the cripple tripping over his heels at every step he hardly seemed to notice the drag set upon him but stole into a patch of deep shadow without the dim wedge of light cast through the window and i had to go too if i would keep my hold on him crouching there with what secret terror on one side and marvel on the other it is impossible to describe we saw the dark street and the driving rain traversed by a shaft of light as the hall door was pulled open and become blackness again with its closing then descending the shallow flight of steps his head bent to the storm and one hand raised to his hat the doctor came into view and the whole body of the cripple seemed to shoot rigid with sudden tension this fourth actor on the scene turning away from us walked unconscious of jason hidden in the shadow as he passed him up the street his hand still to his head his long skirts driven in front of him by the wind so that he looked as if his destiny were pulling him reluctant forward by allembracing leading strings as he went up the slope and vanished in the darkness a groan as if of pentup agony issued from duke and immediately he drew me from the shadow and round to the foot of the steps a chink of light that divided the blackness above us showed that the door had not been closed to probably the doctor had gone forth on some brief errand only and would return in a moment suddenly i became conscious that duke was mounting the stepsthat some strange spirit in which his first mission of hate was absorbed was moving him to enter the house where are you going i cried struggling with him he gave no answer took not the least notice of me what response could i expect from a madman like this staring before himpanting like one at the end of a racehe slowly ascended dragging me with him then on the turn of a thought i quitted my hold of him and he staggered forward the next instant he had recovered himself had pushed open the door and was in the hall i hurried to where jason yet stood motionless his face white as a patch of plaster set against the darkness of the wall keep off he cried in a wavering voice you fool its i didnt you see him go into that house some insane fancy had drawn him off the scent run back to the milldo you hear i wont leave himhe shant follow he came from his corner and clutched me with shaking hands wheres there money its all useless without that i tell you give it to me or ill kill you ive as much right to it as you my god why didnt you tell me the old man was dead it was devilish to let me go in on him like that tell me where to find money and ill take it and be off listen to me if he comes out again while you talk i wont answer for the result well discuss money matters by and by go nowback to the mill do you understand and wait till i come he was about to retort but some sound real or fancied strangled the words in his throat he leaped from meglanced fearfully at the light streaming from the open doorcrossed the street his body bent double and keeping this posture hurried with a rapid shuffling motion back in the direction of the mill standing with one foot on the lowest step leading up to the house i watched till he was out of sight then turned and looked into the dimly lighted hall what should i do how act with the surest safety and promptitude in so immediate a crisis i could not guess what unspeakable attraction had so strangely drawn the hunter from his trembling quarry at the supreme moment only i saw that he had vanished and that the hall was empty of him a quick odd sound coming from the interior of the house decided me i sprung up the steps and softly entered the hall the door leading to the doctors private room where the murderous busts grinned down stood open and from here issued the noise that was like the bestial sputtering growl of some tigerish thing mouthing and mangling its prey i stepped hastily over the threshold and stopped with a jerk of terror something was there in the dully lighted roomdown on the rug before the fire something had rolled and raved and tore at the material beneath itan animals skin judged by the whisps of ragged hair that stuck in the creatures claws and between his teeth that had rent them outsomethingduke who foamed and raged as he lay sprawled on his hands and knees and snarled like a wild beast in his frenzy of insanity hes madmad i whispered to myself in an awful voice and yet he heard me and paused in the height of his fury and looked round and up at me standing whitelipped by the door then suddenly while i was striving amid the wild heat of my brain to identify some hooded memory that raised its head in darkness the maniac sprung to his feet gripped me by the wrist and pointed down at the huddled heap beneath him look he shrieked the firelight dancing in his glittering eyes look weve met at last the dog that scared and tortured the wretched sick boythe dog the devil into the fire with him to blaze and writhe and scream as a devil should he plunged again snarling and before i could gather sense to stop him had seized and flung the whole mass upon the burning coals flames shot out and around and the room in a moment was sick with the stench of flaring pelt i rushed to tear the heap away but he met and struggled with me like a fiend inspired and helpless i saw the flames lick higher straining against me he laughed and yelled he wants water he shrieks to abrahambut not a dropnot one look at his red tongue shooting out in agony they fall before meat last at last my time has come his voice rose to a screamthere was a responsive shout from the door i slewed my head round and saw the white face of the servant girl peering through the opening behind the figure of dr crackenthorpe standing there in black blank amazement help i cried hes mad with a deep oath the doctor strode forward and duke saw him in an instant with a cry of different tonea shriek of terrorhe spun me from him sprung past the other drove the girl screaming into the passage and was gone stop by all the doctors exclamation was for me i had staggered back but an immediate fear drove me with no time for explanation to hurried pursuit out of the way i cried violently he mustnt escape he would have barred my passage i came against him with a shock that sent him reeling as his hands clutched vainly in the air i rushed from the room and from the house with my first plunge into the street a weltering stream of fire ran across the sky and in a moment an explosive crash shook the city like the bursting open of the gates of torment amid flood and storm and the numbing slam of thunder the tragedy of the night was drawing to its close chapter lix into the depths momentarily i sawa black mote in that flickering violet transparencythe figure of duke as he ran before me bobbing up and down like the shadow of the invisible man drawn by a sure instinct he was heading for the mill and every nerve must i strain to overtake him now goaded by fear and triumph to maniacal frenzy but half the distance was covered when the rain swept down in one blinding sheet that lashed the gutters into froth a foot high and numbed the soul with its terrific uproar on i staggered knowing only for my comfort that the pursued must needs labor against no less resistance than the pursuer inch by inch i fought my way taking advantage of every buttress and coign of shelter that presented itself leaping aside with thumpheart from the crash of falling tiles or dropping swing of branches as the wind flung them right and left in its passing now stumbling and regaining my feet shoulder to the storm now driven back a pace by some gusta giant among its fellowsinch by inch i drove on till the mill yard was reached and all the way i gained never a foot upon him i strove to run down then rushing along the yard where comparative shelter was i found a thrill of fear in the midmost confusion of my thoughts for the safety of the building itself for the voice of the milltail smote the roar of the elements and seemed to silence it and the foam of its fury sprung and danced above the highwalled channel and flung itself against the parapet of the bridge in gusts of frosty whiteness and in the little lulls came the whistle of sliding tiles from the roof or snap of them breaking from the walls so that it seemed before long nothing but a skeleton of ancient timbers like the ribs and spars of the phantom deathship would stand for the blast to scream through then i came panting to the mill my soul so whelmed in the roar of all things that room scarcely was for thought of those two stark sleepers lying quiet above and deaf forevermore to the hateful tumults of lifecame to the mill and on the instant abandoned hope for so it appeared that in rushing from the door none had thought to shut it and the tempest had caught and near battering it from its hinges had dashed it wrenched and splintered against the wall of the passage beyond and in such way that no immediate human power might close it and there lay the way into the building open to all who listed and if jason had run thither as i bade him these thoughts were in passing i never stayed my progress for them but without pause leaped into the inclosed darkness and only then i stood still instantly with my plunge into that pit of blackness the hosts of the storm without seemed to break and scatter before the wind shaken with low spasms of thunder as they fled but under my feet the racing waters took up great chords of sound so that the whole building trembled and vibrated with their awful music overstrung to a pitch of madness i felt my way to the foot of the stairs and stumbling mounted in the darkness and reached the first landing all was still as death perhaps it was death come in a new shape and stealthily lying somewhere to trip up my feet in a ghastly game of clowns i dared not go further dared hardly to breathe as i stood a rat began gnawing at the skirting the jar of his teeth was like the turning of a rusty lock the old superstition about falling houses passed through my mind what if the close night about me were to be suddenly rent with the explosive splintering of great beamswith the raining thunder of roof and chimneystack pouring downward in one vast ruin of which i should be the mangled palpitating core my body burst into a cold sweat perhaps above all the fear in me was that death should find me with my mission unaccomplished that i should have striven and waited in vain shrinking i would not push further to the upper rooms but felt my way down the stairs once more it was at least hardly probable that jason would have rushed for asylum to the very death chambers above more likely was i to find him crouching unnerved if still alive in some dark corner of one of the lower rooms as i descended into the passage i fancied i heard a step coming toward me and the next moment a dusky shape stood up between me and the dim oblong of lesser darkness that marked where the front door gaped open i ran forwardgrasped at it blindly and long arms were crooked about me and held me as in a vise whos here cried dr crackenthorpe in a mad voice who is it say renalt trender and let me choke the cursed life out of him his passion would hardly allow him to articulate he dragged me unresisting to the door up the yard and thrust his ugly face down till it almost touched mine it is he cried with a scream of fury looklook there see what youve done i had marked it alreadya dull glow rising over the houses and chimney pots that lay between us and chisll streeta glow writhed with twisted skeins of smoke that rolled heavily upward coiling sluggishly in the calm that had fallen look he screeched the priceless treasures of a lifethe glories i bartered my soul fordoomed in a moment and by your act oh dog for revenge you lie i cried outshrieking his rage with a fury that halfshook him from his hold on me i had no part in it you saw it and you know go attend to your own ive deadlier work in hand i tore myself free of him with a violence that brought him on his knees and hurried up the yard once more and into the pitchy house he came upon me again while i was fumbling in my pockets for a match but he put out no hand to me a second time listen you he said and the words rose and burst from his throat like bubbles you have been a thorn in my foot ever since i trod this city if yours wasnt the act you were the cause i would have killed you both on the spotyou and your accompliceif the fire blazing out on the curtains had left me time now you shall know what it is to have made me desperatedesperate do you understand you fulsome cur better take a viper to bed with you than the thought of my revenge dr crackenthorpe i said very coolly you are a ruffian and a blackguard which is the more desperate of us two is an open question anyhow i fancy myself the stronger theres the door if you remain this side of it after i have counted twelve you try conclusions with the milltail yonder i had struck a match while i spoke and kindled an oil lamp standing on a bracket this wrestle with an evil soul had braced my nerves like a tonic he slapped back against the passage wall staring at me and gasping his face i saw was grimed with smoke and his coat scorched in places i began to count looking into his eyes with a grim smilehad got as far as nine without awakening movement on his part when a deathly yell rung through the house and the words died on my lips i felt the blood leave my face sinking like water in snow there was no mistaking the direction from which the sound had come it issued from the haunted roomthere from the black end of the passagefrom the core of hideous night whose silence no storm could penetrate once i looked at the face before me and saw my own terror reflected in it then i sprung for the dreadful place sick at whatever cost to solve the mystery of the cry groping for the heavy timbered door i came suddenly upon a wide luminous square and almost fell into it then i saw indeed that the door itself was open and that a dim glow lighted the interior of the room something else i saw in the same instantduke standing at the open mouth of the cupboard that inclosed the wheelduke with a fearful smile on his white face and his head bent as if he listened and his black glowing eyes set in pools of shadow alone moved fixing their gaze steadily on mine as i came into their vision stop he said in a clear low voice he need not have bidden me my limbs seemed paralyzedmy heart stiffening with deadly foreboding of some approaching wickedness a lighted lantern stood near him on the floor and threw a gigantic distorted shadow of him on the wall against the window did you hear he said in a whisper that thrilled to me where i stood is it haunted this room of yours it seems so listen he leaned over and looked down into the pit so that the upper half of his body was plunged in black shadow simultaneously an appalling scream rose from the depths and echoed away among the rafters above the marrow froze in my bones i struggled vainly to rush forward but my feet would not obey my will my god i muttered from a crackled throatmy god he was looking at me again across the glowing space a grin twitching up his mouth like a dogs if you move to come at me he said i leap down there and end it he wont thank you though duke i forced myself to mutter at length in uncontrollable horror is it jason oh be satisfied at last and god will forgive you why so i am he cried with a whispering laugh but i never sent him down there he went of his own accorda secret snug hidingplace but he should have waited longer and who would have thought of looking so deep it was his leaning over as he came up to put the lantern where it stands that drew me in the sickness of my terror i saw it all jason flying back to the mill mad with fear mad for the means of escapejason who had already solved the mystery of the treasure and had only hitherto lacked the courage necessary to a descent upon itjason in his despair had seized a light burst into the room of silence had found the wheel stopped and the key in the lock as i had left them had summoning his last of manliness gone down into the pit and returning had met his fearful enemy face to face i read it all and utterly hopeless and demoralized as i wasknowing that a movement on my part would precipitate the tragedyyet found voice to break the spell and delivered my agony in a shriek jason i screamed jason climb up you are as strong as he climb up and defy him we are two to one even as the volume of my cry seemed to strike a responsive weak echo from the bowels of the pit i was conscious that dr crackenthorpe was breathing behind me over my shoulder and while the sound of my voice ran from beam to beam in devilish harmonics the cripple suddenly threw up his arms with a quavering screech and leaped upon the threshold of the cupboard the man he yelled the dog and now the man i know him at last dr crackenthorpe broke past me with an answering cry he fired my house stop him the hound stop him as he sprang forward duke with a sudden swoop seized the lantern from the floor and flung it at him and at the same instantas i saw by the flaming arc of light it madeclutched the rope and swung himself into the vault the lantern crashed and was extinguished the doctor uttered a fierce oath spellbound i stood and for half a dozen seconds the weltering blackness eddied with a ghastly silence then i heard the doctor fling past me running out of the room with a fearful exclamation on his lips and as he went scream after scream rise from the depths so that my soul seemed to faint with the agony of it groping staggering my brain reeling i stumbled toward the sound god forgive me i whispered death is better than this even with the thought a new uproar broke upon my sensesthe thunderous heaving onrush of a mighty torrent of water underfoot in a flash i knew what had happened the hideous creature had lifted the sluice and turned the swollen flood upon the wheel then the past swept over me in a hurried panorama as my poor brain paused for rest who killed modredhow did he die what is the mystery of duke straw what was the sin of my mother whose portrait was it that my father nailed to the axle of the wheel these and many other of the problems haunting my life came to me in swift succession only to be passed in dullness and left unanswered chapter lx who killed modred in the instant of realization as i stood near deathstricken where i had stopped i felt the whole room shake and tremble as the torrent leaped upon the wheel with a flinging shock heard a clanking screech rise from the monster as it turned slowly at first but quickly gathering speed under the awful pressure heard one last bubbling scream waver up from the depths and die within the narrow vault then all sense was whelmed and numbed in the single booming crash of water already indeed the choked water hurled high by the paddles was gushing through the opening in cascades upon the floor how long would the ancient rafters and beams and walls resist the terrible pressure i had no thought or desire to escape what had taken me long to describe all passed in a few seconds but providence that here included so many actors in the tragedy in one common ruin had not writ my sentence and my young suffering soul it spared to this dark world of memories insatiable yet however it claimed a last victim he came running back now breathing hateful triumph in the lust of his wickednesscame to gloat over the work of his evil hands i heard him splash into the water that poured from the wheeldance in itlaugh and scream out tit for tat and the devil pipes caught in his own net you there in the dark do you hear where are you wheremy arms hunger for you the paralysis of my senses left me man or fiend i shrieked above the thunder of the water down on your knees it is the end for both of us down and weep and prayfor i believe before god you have just murdered your son there was a brief fearful pause he seemed to be listeningthen without preface or warning there came a sudden surging crash deafening and appalling and i thought is it upon us still i stood unscathed though a cracking volley of sounds rending and shattering succeeded the crash and one wild dreadful cry that pierced through all then silence fell broken only by the smooth washing sweep of a great body of water through the channel below silence fell and lapped me in a merciful unconsciousness for with the relaxing of the mental pressure i went plump down upon the floor where i stood and lay in a long faint when i came to myself a dim wash of daylight soaking through the blurred window had found my face as i lay prone upon the boards and was crawling up to my eyes like a child to open them an ineffable soft sense of peace kept still my exhausted limbs in the first waking moments and only by degrees occurred to me the horror and tragedy of the previous night still i made no attempt to rise hoping only in forlorn selfpity that death would come to me gently as i lay and take me by the hand saying with the vexing problems of life you need nevermore trouble yourself all around save for the deep murmur of water was deathly quiet and i prayed that it might remain so that nothing might ever recall me to weariful action again then a faint groan came to my ears and the misericordious spell was broken slowly and feebly i gathered myself together to rise but a second moan dissipated the selfish shadow and stung me to some reluctant action leaning upon my hand i looked about me and could hardly believe the evidence of my senses when i saw the walls and rafters of the fateful room stretching about me unaltered and unscathed the crash that had seemed to involve all in one splintering ruin had left seemingly no evidence of its nature whatsoever only for a considerable distance from the mouth of the cupboard the floor was stained with a sop of water and not a dozen feet from me huddled in the darkest of it lay a heaped and sodden mass that stirred and sent forth another moan as i looked painfully then i got upon my feet and stole with no sentiment but a weak curiosity to the prostrate thing it was as if i had died and my dissatisfied ghost postponed its departure seeking the last explanation of things thus while my soul was sensitive to the least expression of the tragedy that absorbed it in the human world outside it seemed no longer to feel an interest and here under my eyes was tumbled the latest grim victim of this house accursedthe engineer of much diabolical machinery mangled by the demon he had himself evoked what a pitiful collapsed ruin that for all its resourcefulness could only moan and suffer only a thin thread of crimson ran from the corner of his mouth and where it had made during the night a little pool on the floor under his head it looked like ink near him lay a great jagged block of wood green with slime i crept to the cupboard opening and looked down the wheel was gone then i knew what had happened the house had triumphed over the stubborn monster that had so long proved its curse at the supreme moment the vast dam had yielded and saved the building it had gone leaving not a trace of wreckage but thisthis and the single torn fragment that had struck down the wretch who set it in motionhad gone bearing away with it in one boiling ruin the crushed and twisted bodies of the last two victims of its insensate fury but one further sign was there of its mighty passinga ragged rent a foot square driven through the very wall of the house within the vault and here a thin shaft of light came in and fell like the focus of an awful eye full upon the miniature where it lay nailed face upward upon the axlefell also upon that empty niche in the brickwork where once had stood the treasure for which jason had given his life i turned to the shattered man leaned over him touched him he gave a gasp of agony and opened his eyes the white stare of horror was in them and the blood ran faster from his mouth water he cried with a dry clacking sound in his throat i hurried from the room although he called after me feebly not to leave him drew a jugful from the tap in the kitchen and returned i heard no sound in the house a glimmer of flood came in through the gaping door to the yard no immediate help was possible in the rising of that direful morning after the storm i was alone with my many dead i put the jug to his lips and he sucked down a long gluttonous draught then he looked at me with eager inquiry breaking through his mortal torment my chest is all broken in he said straining out his voice in bitter anguish when i move the end will come quickyou said somethingat the last momentwhat was it that i believed it was your son you sent to his death down there i have no son onceyesbut he diedwas poisonedor drowned oh god forgive this man i cried lifting my face in terror and in that sick moment inspiration i think was given me he never died he was saved to grow up a hopeless cripple and that was he you murdered last night he closed his eyes again and i saw his ashen lips moving oh man i cried are you praying take grace of repentance and humble your wicked soul at the last i cant believe you innocent of a share in the wretchedness of this wretched house i am the only one left of itbroken and lost to hope but i forgive youdo you understandi forgive you i never killed the boy he muttered in a low suffering tone and with his eyes still closed will you tell me all you know about it if you are guiltless be merciful as you hope for mercy

raised the hatch god knows their bodies may be miles away by this time he looked up at me with an awful expression then without another word dragged himself inch by inch along the floor to the pit

it off my own portraitminna thus and in such manner i heard my mothers name spoken for the first time felt the awful foundering truth burst upon my heart uttering it the soul of this fearful man tore free with a last dying scream of agony and he dropped upon his face over the threshold of the running vault one moment fatestricken i heard in the silence the heavy drip of something going pattering down into the pitthe next darkness overwhelmed and the world ceased for me did i ever see zyp again i know that some one came to me lying entranced in a long sick dream who bore her resemblance at least and who spoke gentle words to me and put cold sweet drink to my lips but when i woke at last she was not thereonly a kind soft woman a ministering nurse who moved without noise and foresaw all my fretful wants if she came she went and left no trace and i know in my heart i am never to see her more and here month by month i sit alone in the old haunted crazy placealone with my memories and my ghosts and my ancient fruitless regrets dolly and my fatherthe doctor and those other two found far away welded in a dead embrace and crushed and dinted one into the otherthe fair and the ugly all
