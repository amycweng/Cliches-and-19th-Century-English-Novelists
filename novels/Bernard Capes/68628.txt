the skeleton key by bernard capes author of the great skene mystery a castle in spain etc etc with introduction by g k chesterton new york george h doran company introduction to introduce the last book by the late bernard capes is a sad sort of honour in more ways than one for not only was his death untimely and unexpected but he had a mind of that fertile type which must always leave behind it with the finished life a sense of unfinished labour from the first his prose had a strong element of poetry which an appreciative reader could feel even more perhaps when it refined a frankly modern and even melodramatic theme like that of this mystery story than when it gave dignity as in our lady of darkness to more tragic or more historic things it may seem a paradox to say that he was insufficiently appreciated because he did popular things well but it is true to say that he always gave a touch of distinction to a detective story or a tale of adventure and so gave it where it was not valued because it was not expected in a sense in this department of his work at least he carried on the tradition of the artistic conscience of stevenson the technical liberality of writing a penny dreadful so as to make it worth a pound in his short stories as in his historical studies he did indeed permit himself to be poetic in a more direct and serious fashion but in his touch upon such tales as this the same truth may be traced it is a good general rule that a poet can be known not only in his poems but in the very titles of his poems in the case of many works of bernard capes the lake of wine for instance the title is itself a poem and that case would alone illustrate what i mean about a certain transforming individual magic with which he touched the mere melodrama of mere modernity numberless novels of crime have been concerned with a lost or stolen jewel and the lake of wine was merely the name of a ruby yet even the name is original exactly in the detail that is hardly ever original hundreds of such precious stones have been scattered through sensational fiction and hundreds of them have been called the sun of the sultan or the eye of vishnu or the star of bengal but even in such a trifle as the choice of the title an indescribable and individual fancy is felt a sub conscious dream of some sea like a sunset red as blood and intoxicant as wine this is but a small example but the same element clings as if unconsciously to the course of the same story many another eighteenth century hero has ridden on a long road to a lonely house but bernard capes by something fine and personal in the treatment does succeed in suggesting that at least along that particular road to that particular house no man had ever ridden before we might put this truth flippantly and therefore falsely by saying he put superior work into inferior works i should not admit the distinction for i deny that there is necessarily anything inferior in sensationalism when it can really awaken sensations but the truer way of stating it would perhaps be this that to a type of work which generally is for him or anybody else a work of invention he always added at least one touch of imagination the detective or mystery tale in which this last book is an experiment involves in itself a problem for the artist as odd as any of the problems which it puts to the policeman a detective story might well be in a special sense a spiritual tragedy since it is a story in which even the moral sympathies may be in doubt a police romance is almost the only romance in which the hero may turn out to be the villain or the villain to be the hero we know that mr osbaldistones business has not been betrayed by his son frank though possibly by his nephew rashleigh we are quite sure that colonel newcomes company has not been conspired against by his son clive though possibly by his nephew barnes but there is a stage in a story like the moonstone when we are meant to suspect franklin blake the hero as he is suspected by rachel verinder the heroine there is a stage in mr bentleys trents last case when the figure of mr marlowe is as sinister as the figure of mr manderson the obvious result of this technical trick is to make it impossible or at least unfair to comment not only on the plot but even on the characters since each of the characters should be an unknown quantity the italians say that translation is treason and here at least is a case where criticism is treason i have too great a love or lust for the roman policier to spoil sport in so unsportsmanlike a fashion but i cannot forbear to comment on the ingenious inspiration by which in this story one of the characters contrives to remain really an unknown quantity by a trick of verbal evasion which he himself defends half convincingly as a scruple of verbal veracity that is the quality of bernard capes romances that remains in my own memory a quality as it were too subtle for its own subject men may well go back to find the poems thus embedded in his prose g k chesterton dedication mrs bernard capes wishes to express her gratitude to mr chesterton for his appreciative introduction to her

dark horse xx the baron lays his cards on the table xxi a last word footnotes the skeleton key chapter i my first meeting with the baron from the late mr bickerdikes apologia some few years ago in the month of september i happened to be kicking my heels in paris awaiting the arrival there of my friend hugo kennett we had both been due from the south i from vaucluse and kennett from the riviera and the arrangement had been that we should meet together for a week in the capital before returning home enfants perdus kennett was never anything but unpunctual and he failed to turn up to time or anywhere near it at the rendezvous i was a trifle hipped as i had come to the end of my circular notes and had rather looked to him to help me through with a passing difficulty but there was nothing for it but to wait philosophically on and to get pending his appearance what enjoyment i could out of life it was not very much the parisian may be a saving man but paris is no city to save in it is surprising how dull an empty purse can make it it had come to this after two days either that i must shift my quarters from the ritz into cheaper lodgings or abandon my engagement altogether and go back alone one afternoon aimless and thirsty i turned into the caf lunivers in the place du palais royal and sat down at one of the little tables under the awning where was a vacant chair this is a busy spot upon which many streets converge and one may rest there idly and study an infinite variety of human types there was a man seated not far from me against the glass side of the verandah whose occupation caught my attention he was making very rapidly in a minute book pencil notes of all the conspicuous ladies hats that passed him it was extraordinary to observe the speed and fidelity with which he secured his transcripts a few apparently random sweeps of the pencil in his thin nervous fingers and there in the flitting of a figure was some unconscious head ravished of its most individual idea it reminded me of the wig snatching of the eighteenth century yet i could not but admire the dexterity of the thief as sitting behind him i followed his skilful movements a clever dog that sir said a throaty voice beside me it came from a near neighbour whom i had not much observed until now a large faced clean shaved gentleman of a very full body and a comfortable complacent expression he was dressed in a baggy light grey suit wore a loose panama hat on his head and smelt pleasantly and cleanly of snuff on the table before him stood a tumbler of grenadine and soda stuffed with lumps of ice and with a couple of straws sticking from it most i answered what would you take him to be eh said the stranger without prejudice now a milliners pander will that do i thought it an admissible term and said so adding or a fashion plate artist surely replied the stranger a distinction without a difference is it not no more was said for the moment while i sat covertly studying the speaker he reminded me a little of the portraits of thiers only without the spectacles a placid well nourished benevolence had been his prominent feature were it not somehow for the qualification of the eyes those were as perpetually alert busy observant as the rest was seemingly supine they appeared to peck for interests among the moving throng as a hen pecks for scattered grain wonderful hands he said suddenly coming back to the artist do you notice anything characteristic about them now no i said what he did not answer but applied for a refreshing moment or two to his grenadine ah he said leaning back again with a relishing motion of his lips a comfortable seat and a cool glass and we have here the best caf chantant in the world well it suits me i agreed to pass the time ah he said your friend is unpunctual i yawned inexcusably he always is what would you think of an appointment sir three days overdue i should think of it with philosophy having the ritz cuisine and cellar to fall back upon i turned to him interestedly my hands behind my head you have no but you said he i was a bit puzzled and amused but curious too you are not staying at the ritz i asked he shook his head good humouredly then how do you know i am there is not much mystery in that said he you happened to be standing on the steps when i happened to be passing the rest you have admitted and among all these i waved my hand comprehensively you could remember me from that one glimpse he laughed but again ignored my question how did you know i persisted that my friend was a man you yourself said he supplied the gender but not in the first instance no not in the first instance he agreed and said no more you dont like the ritz i asked after an interval just to talk and be talked to i was horribly bored that is the truth by my own society and here was at least a compatriot to share some of its burden with me i never said so he answered but i confess it is too sumptuous for me i lodge at the htel montesquieu if you would know where is that may i ask it is in the rue montesquieu but a step from here i should like if you dont mind to hear something of it i am at the ritz true but in a furiously economical mood certainly he answered with perfect good humour it would not suit all people it does not even figure in the guides but for those of an unexacting disposition well it might serve to pass the time you can have your good bedroom there and your adequate petit djeuner nothing more for meals there is a duvals across the road or more particularly the restaurant au buf la mode in the rue de valois close by where such delicacies may be tasted as sole la russe or noisettes dagneau la rjane try it i was half thinking i would and wondering how i could express my sense of obligation to my new acquaintance when a sudden crash and scream in the road brought us both to our feet the hat sketcher having finished with his task and gone had stepped thoughtlessly off the kerb right under the shafts of a passing cab for a tranquil body my companion showed the most curious excitement over the accident uttering broken exclamations of reproof and concern he hurried down as fast as his bulk would permit him to the scene of the mishap about which a crowd was already swarming i could see little of what followed but the press after a time dispersing i made shift to inquire of an onlooker as to the nature of the victims hurt and was told that the man had been taken off to the st antoine hospital in the very cab which had run him down my friend of the panama hat accompanying him and so there for the moment our acquaintance ended but we met again at the montesquieu whither i had actually transferred my quarters in the interval a day or two later he came down into the hall just as i had entered it from the street and greeted me and pressed my arm paternally but this will not do at all he said this will not do at all and summoned the htelier from his little dark room off the passage i am sorry monsieur he said when the bowing goodman appeared to find such scant respect paid to my recommendation if this is the treatment accorded to my patronage i must convey it elsewhere the proprietor was quite amazed shocked confounded what had he done to merit this severe castigation from m le sage if m le baron would but condescend to particularise his offence the resources of his establishment were at m le barons command to remedy it that is easily specified was m le barons answer i sing the modest praises of your hotel to my friend mr bickerdike on the strength of these my friend decides to give you a trial what is the result you put him into number where the aspect is gloomy where the paper peels off the wall where to my certain suspicion there are bugs i laughed not quite liking this appropriation but the landlord was profuse in his apologies not for a moment had he guessed that i was a friend of m le baron le sage i had not informed him of the fact it was a mere question of expediency number happened to be the only room vacant at the moment but since in short i was transferred straightway to a very good appartement in the front where were ample space and comfort and a powder closet to poke my head into if i wished and invoke the ghosts of the dead lords of montesquieu whose htel this had once been now i should have been grateful for m le barons friendly offices and i hope i was but with a dash of reservation i did not know what to make of him in fact and the uncertainty kept me on my guard nor was i the more reassured upon his commiserating me presently on the fact of my friend mr kennett not having yet turned up so he had found out my friends name that might be possible through an inquiry at the ritz where kennett was expected but why was he interested in inquiring at all then as to my own name he might have ascertained that of course of my present landlord a pardonable curiosity only somehow coloured by his unauthorised examination of my room what had he wanted in there in the first instance on the other hand he was evidently held for whatever reason in high respect by the proprietor and if the reason itself was to seek for me i had certainly no grounds for suspecting its adequate claims he appeared to be a man of education and some distinction not to speak of his title which however might be territorial and of small account and assuredly he did not seem french unless by deliberate adoption his speech appearance habit of mind were all as english as the shoes he wore on his feet i asked him on that day of his service to me how it had gone with the poor hat sketcher whom i had understood he had accompanied to the hospital he seemed to regard my question as if for a moment it puzzled him and then he answered o the artist o yes to be sure i accompanied him did i yes yes an old house this mr bickerdike a fragment of old paris if there is nothing more i can do for you i think i will be going so it always was on the few further occasions which brought us together he could not or would not answer a direct question directly he seemed to love secrecy and evasion for their own sake and for the opportunity they gave him for springing some valueless surprises on the unsuspecting well he should not have his little vanity for me there is nothing so tiresome as that habit of meaningless reserve of hoarding information which there can be no possible objection to disseminating but some people seem to have it i responded by asking no more questions of m le baron and i only hope my incuriosity disappointed him the next day or the day after kennett turned up and i left the montesquieu for my original quarters chapter ii my second meeting with the baron from mr bickerdikes manuscript it might have been somewhere near the anniversary of my first meeting with the baron when i came upon him again in london this time i had been lunching at simpsons in the strand and my meal finished had gone up into the smoking room for a coffee and liqueur this is a famous corner of a famous caravansary being dedicate like no other smoking room i know to the service of the most ancient and most royal game of chess many of whose leading professors forgather therein as it were in an informal club for the mixed purposes of sociability and play there one may watch astounding mental conflicts which leave ones brain in a whirl or if one prefers it may oneself join issue in a duel whether for glory or profit or better still like gargantua having a friend for adversary for the mere serious diversion of the game and for its capacity for giving a rare meditative flavour to ones tobacco the room too for such a haunt of gravity is a cheerful room with its large window overlooking the strand and one may spend a postprandial hour there very agreeably and eke very gainfully if one takes an idlers interest in other peoples problems that i may confess i do wherefore simpsons is or was a fairly frequent resort of mine now on this occasion i had hardly entered the room when my eyes fell on the figure of m le baron sitting profoundly absorbed over a game with one in whom i recognised a leading master in the craft i knew my friend at once as how could i fail to for he sat before me in every detail the stranger of the caf lunivers bland roomy self possessed and unchanged as to his garb i would not venture to break into his preoccupation but passed him by and took a convenient seat in the window stothard has found his match remarked a casual acquaintance who lounged near me nodding his head towards the pair who is it i asked do you know i know his name was the answer le sage an out of pocket french baron but thats all o out of pocket is he ive no right to say it perhaps but i only surmise hell play you for a half crown at any time if youre rash enough to venture he plays a wonderful game is he new to the place o no ive seen him here frequently though at long intervals well i think ill go and watch them their table was against the wall opposite the window one or two devotees were already established behind the players mutely following the moves i took up a position near le sage but out of his range of vision he had never to my knowledge so much as raised his face since i entered the room intent on his game he appeared oblivious to all about him yet the moment i came to a stand his voice and only his voice accosted me mr bickerdike how do you do sir i confess i was startled after all there was something disconcerting about this surprise trick of his it was just a practised pose of course still one could not help feeling and resenting in it that impression of the preternatural it was no doubt his desire to convey i responded with some commonplace acknowledgment to the back of his head and no more was spoken for the moment almost immediately the game came to an end m le baron sat back in his chair with a my mate i think a claim in which his opponent acquiesced half the pieces were still on the board but that made no difference your supreme chess expert will foresee at a certain point in the contest all the possible moves to come or to be countered and will accept without dispute the inevitable issue the great man stothard was beaten and acknowledged it m le baron rose from his seat and turned on me with a beaming face happy to renew your acquaintance mr bickerdike he said you are a student of the game not much better i think i answered i am still in my novitiate you would not care o no i thank you im not gull enough to invite my own plucking it was a verbal stumble rather than a designed impertinence on my part and i winced over my own rudeness the moment it was uttered the more so for the composure with which it was received no that would be foolish indeed said m le baron i floundered in a silly attempt to right myself i mean i only meant im just a rotten muff at the game while you i stuck at a loss while i he said with a smile have just like david brought down the giant stothard with a lucky shot he touched my arm in token of the larger tolerance and in some confusion i made a movement as of invitation towards the table in the window i am obliged he said but i have this moment recalled an appointment so i thought in inventing a pretext for declining he administers a gentle rebuke to my cubbishness you found your friend i hope he asked when you left the montesquieu on that occasion kennett yes i answered and added moved to some expiatory frankness it is odd by the bye m le baron that our second meeting should associate itself with the same friend i am going down to morrow as it happens on a visit to his people no he said really that is odd indeed he shook hands with me and left the room standing at the window a moment after i saw him going citywards along the strand looking with his short thick legs and tailed morning coat for all the world like a fat jaunty turtle on its way to birchs now i fancied i had seen the last of the man but i was curiously mistaken when i arrived at waterloo station the next day there rather to my stupefaction he stood as if awaiting me and at the barrier my barrier leading to the platform for my train the two oclock bournemouth express we passed through almost together hullo i said going south he nodded genially i thought with your permission we might be travelling companions with pleasure of course but i go no further than the first stop winton nor i o indeed a delectable old city you are putting up there no o no my destination like yours is wildshott wildshott you know the kennetts then i know sir calvin his son your friend i have never met it is odd as you said that our visits should coincide but you must have known yesterday if you did not know in paris why in the name of goodness did you not i began and came to a rather petulant stop this secrecy was simply intolerable one was pulled up by it at every turn did i not he said blandly no now i come to think of it o louis is that an empty compartment put the rugs in then and the papers he addressed a little vivid eyed french valet who stood awaiting his coming at an opened door of a carriage le sage climbed in with a breathing effort and i followed sulkily who on earth or what on earth was the man nothing more nor less than what he appeared to be he might have protested after all not himself but common gossip had charged him with necessitousness he might be as rich as crsus for all i knew or he was likely to say neediness was not wont to valet it though insolvency very well might but he was a friend of sir calvin a most exclusive old bashaw and again he was said to play chess for half crowns o it was no good worrying i should find out all about him at wildshott with a grunt of resignation i sank into the cushions and resolutely put the problem from me but the fellow was an engaging comrade for a journey i will admit so much he was observant amusing he had a fund of good tales at his command and his voice without unpleasant stress was softly penetrative adapted to anecdote moreover his habit of secrecy of non committal made for a sort of ghostly humour which was as titillating as it was elusive and the faint aroma of snuff which was never absent from him seemed somehow the appropriate atmosphere for such airy quibbles it surrounded him like an aura not disagreeably was associated with him at all times as one associates certain perfumes with certain women a particular snuff macuba i think it is called a very delicate brand so he is always recalled to me himself and his rappee inseparable chapter iii wildshott wildshott the hampshire seat of the kennetts stands off the winton sarum road at a distance of some six miles from the former and some three and a half from the sporting town of longbridge on the way to the latter the house is lonely situated in wild but beautiful country lying as it does in the trough of the great downs whose summits hereabouts command some of the most spacious views in the county a mile north east footing a gentle incline shelters the village of leighway less than a mile away in a hollow of the main road stands a wayside tavern called the bit and halter and with these two exceptions no nearer neighbour has wildshott than the tiny red deer inn which perches on a high lift of the downs a mile and a half distant rising north the stately wrought iron gates of wildshott open from the main road thence a drive of considerable extent reaches to the house which is a rectangular red brick jacobean structure with stone string courses and a fine porch having a great shell over it there are good stables contiguous and the grounds about are ample and well timbered almost too well timbered it might be thought by some people since the closeness of the foliage gives an effect of gloom and solemnity to a building which amid freer surroundings should have nothing but grace and frankness to recommend it but settled as it is in the wash of the hills with their moisture draining down upon it growth and greenness have become a tradition of its life and as such not to be irreverently handled by succeeding generations of kennetts all down the west boundary of the upper estate which to its northernmost limit breaks upon that bare hill on whose summit at closer range now the little red deer inn sits solitary runs a wide fringe of beech wood which is continued to the high road and thence on the further side dispersed among the miscellaneous plantations which are there situated the highway itself roughly bisects the property the best of whose grass and arable lands are contained in the southern division and can be reached from the house if one likes through the long beech thicket by way of a narrow path which entering near the stables runs as far as the containing hedge in which at some fifty yards from the main entrance is a private wicket leading down by a couple of steps to the road this path is known through some superstitious association as the bishops walk and is little used at any time the fact that it offers a short cut from the house to the lower estate being regarded perhaps as inadequate compensation for its solitariness its dankness and the glooms of the packed foliage through which it penetrates opposite the wicket across the road an ordinary bar gate gives upon a corresponding track driven through the thick of a dense coppice which at a depth of some two hundred feet ends in the open fields it is useful to bear in mind these local features in view of the event which came presently to give them a tragic notoriety at winton a wagonette met the two gentlemen and they were landed at wildshott soon after four oclock bickerdike was interested to discover that they were the only guests he was not surprised for himself since he and hugo kennett were on terms of unceremonial intimacy he did wonder a little what qualities he and the baron could be thought to possess in common that they should have been chosen together for so exclusive an invitation but no doubt it was pure accident and in any case there was his friend to explain he was a bit down in the mouth was hugo for any reason or no reason or the devil of a reason never mind what and old viv was always a tower of strength to him in his moods hence old vivs citation to come and buck his friend and incidentally to enjoy a few days shooting which accounted for one half of the coincidence old viv accepted his part philosophically it was not the first time he had been called upon to play it with this up and down young officer whose temporal senior he was by some six years and whose elder in all questions of sapience and self sufficiency he might have been by fifty he did not ask what was the matter but he said all right as if all right were all reassurance and gave a little nod to settle the matter he had a well looking rather judicial face clean shaven a prim mouth a somewhat naked head for a man of thirty and he wore eyeglasses on a neatly turned nose with a considerable prominence of the organ of eventuality above it the complacent bachelor was writ plain in his every line and then he inquired regarding the baron o i know very little about him was young kennetts answer i believe the governor picked him up in paris originally but how or where i cant say hes a marvel at chess and you remember thats the old mans obsession theyre at it eternally while hes down here this isnt his first visit then no i believe not but its the first time ive seen him im quoting audrey for the chess why whats the matter is anything wrong with him there you go you rabbit who said anything was wrong with him ive met him before thats all have you where why in paris you remember the montesquieu and my french baron i remember there was a baron i dont think you ever told me his name well it was le sage and this is the man is it thats rather queer what is the coincidence of your meeting again like this o as to that coincidence you know is only queer till you have traced back its clues and found it inevitable well thats true you can trace it in his case to the governors being down with the gout again and confined to the house and wanting something and somebody to distract him there you are you see he thought of chess and thought of this le sage and wrote up to him on the chance your father probably knows more about his movements than we do so were both accounted for no what is queer to me is the mans confounded habit of secrecy why didnt he say when i met him in paris that the friend i was waiting for was known to him why didnt he admit yesterday admit until we actually met on the platform to day that we were bound for the same place i hate a stupidly reticent man kennett laughed and then frowned and turned away to chalk his cue the two men were in the billiard room playing a hundred up before dinner well he said stooping to a losing hazard i hope a fellow may be a good fellow and yet not tell all thats in him of course he may answered bickerdike le sage im sure is a very good fellow a very decent old boy and rare company when he chooses i can answer for that but theres a difference between telling all thats in one and not telling anything well perhaps he thinks said the other impatiently that if he once opened the sluice hed drain the dammed river do let him alone and attend to the game bickerdike responded unruffled he had found his friend in a curiously touchy state irritable and nervous and moody he had known him to be so before though never perhaps so conspicuously hugo was temperamentally high strung and always subject to alternations of excitement and despondence but he had not yet exhibited so unbalanced a temper as he seemed inclined to display on this occasion he was wild reckless dejected but seldom normal appearing possessed by a spirit which in turns exalted or depressed him what was wrong with the boy his friend covertly pondering the handsome young figure found sufficient solution in the commonplace he was in one of his nervous phases that was all they would afflict men subject to them at any odd time and without apparent provocation it was one of the mysteries of our organic being a question of misfit somewhere between spirit and matter no one looking at the young soldier would have thought him anything but a typical example of his kind constitutionally flawless mentally insensitive he belonged to a crack regiment and was popular in it was tall shapely built attractive with a rather girlish complexion and umber gold hair a ladies man a pattern military man everything nice and yet that demon of nerve worked in him to his perfections undoing perhaps it was the prick of conscience like a shifting grit in ones shoe now here now there now gone for the boy had quite fine impulses for a spoilt boy a spoilt child of fortune and spoilt like byron by his mother in the ruinous way his father the general alternately indulgent and tyrannical was the worst of parents for him he had lost his mother long ago his one sister flippant independent undervalued it may be and conscious of it offered no adequate substitute for that departed influence and so the good in hugo was to his own credit and stood perhaps for more than it might have in another man his father sir calvin he had got his kcb by the way after tel el kebir in in reward for some signal feat of arms and at the expense of his trigger finger was as proud as sin of his comely lad and blind to all faults in him which did not turn upon opposition to himself he designed great connexions for the young man and humoured his own selfishness in the prospect he was a martinet of fifty five with a fine surface polish and a heart of teak beneath it a patrician of the claudian breed irascible much subject to gout for his past misdeeds and an ardent devotee of the game of chess at which he could hold his own with some of the professed masters it was that devotion which had brought him fortuitously acquainted with the french baron a sort of technical friendship it might be called and which had procured the latter an occasional invitation of late to wildshott le sage came for chess but he proved very welcome for himself there was a sort of soothing tolerance about him the well informed urbanity of a polished man of the world which was as good as a lenitive to the splenetic invalid but nobody unless it were sir calvin himself appeared to know anything concerning him whether he were rich or indigent what if dependent on his wits he did for a living what was the meaning or value of his title in an englishman if english he were whether in short he were a shady baron of the chevalier dindustrie order or a reputable baron with only some eccentricities to mark him out from the common one of these not necessarily questionable was his sly incommunicativeness another was his fondness for half crowns he invariably whether with sir calvin or others made that stake no more and no less a condition of his playing at all and for the most part he carried it off vivian bickerdike soon learned all that there was to be told about him and he was puzzled and interested intrigued as they would say in the horrible modern phrase but being a young man of caution in addition to great native curiosity he kept his wits active and his suspicions if he had any close the game proceeded badly enough on the part of hugo who was generally a skilful player he fouled or missed so many shots that his form presently became a scandal phew whistled his opponent after a peculiarly villainous attempt whats gone wrong with you the young man laughed vexedly then in a sudden transition to violence threw his cue from him so that it clattered on the floor i cant play for nuts he said you must get somebody else hugh said his friend after a moment or two of silence theres something weighing on your mind is there cried the other jeeringly i wonder what is it you neednt tell me o thank you for that i tell you what viv i dreamed last night i was sitting on a barrel of gunpowder and smoking a cigarette and the sparks dropped all about didnt i thats what i feel anyhow nerves all nerves my boy o shut up that long mug and talk of something else i told you i was off colour when i wrote i know you did and i came down good man youll be in at the kill theres going to be a most infernal explosion pyrotechnics galore or isnt there never mind he appeared to bickerdike to be in an extraordinary state verging on the hysterical but no more was said and in a few moments they parted to dress for dinner m le baron coming up to his room about the same time and for the same purpose was witness of a little stage comedy which being for all his bulk a light treader he surprised the actors were his valet louis and an under housemaid the latter of whom was at the moment depositing a can of hot water in the washing basin he saw the lithe susceptible little gascon steal from his task of laying ready his masters dress clothes saw him stalk his quarry like a cat pounce enfold the jimp waist heard the startled squeal that followed a smack like a hundred kisses a spitting sacr chien from the discomfited assailant as he staggered back with a face of fury and a hand held to his ear and seeing stood to await the upshot a questioning smile upon his lips both parties realised his presence at the same instant and checked the issue of hot words which was beginning to join between them the girl giving a defiant toss to her chin hurried past le sage and out of the room m louis cabanis returned to his business with the expression of a robbed wild cat le sage said nothing until he was being presently helped on with his coat and then suddenly challenging the valet eye to eye he nodded and congratulated him that is better my friend it is not logical you know for the injurer to nurse the grievance the gascon looked at his master gravely will you tell me who is the injurer monsieur surely answered le sage it cannot be she in these first few hours of your acquaintance but if she had appeared to encourage me monsieur the baron laughed the only appearance to be trusted in a pretty woman louis is her prettiness monsieur is her ravishing loveliness well well louis as you will only bear it no grudge he turned away from a parting keen scrutiny of the dark handsome face and left the room softly carolling the little episode had amused rather than surprised him certainly it had seemed to point in respect of time to a quite record enslavement on the gascons part but then the provocation to that passionate impressionable nature for the girl had been really amazingly pretty with that cast of feature that hebe like beauty of hair and eye and complexion about whose fascination no two properly constituted minds could disagree she was a domestic servant and she was a young morning goddess fresh from the unsullied dawn of nature a psyche a butterfly a cressid like enough if i were younger thought le sage even i and he carolled as he went down to dinner chapter iv i am interested in the baron from the bickerdike ms i seemed conscious somehow at dinner on the night of our arrival of a feeling of electricity in the domestic atmosphere having no clue such as the later course of events came to supply to its origin i diagnosed it simply and vulgarly as the vibrations from a family jar of the sort to which even the most dignified and well regulated households cannot always rise superior sir calvin himself exacting and domineering could never at the best of times be considered a tactful autocrat a prey to his hereditary foe he appeared often to go out of his way to be thought detestable when such was the case his habit of harping on grievances could become an exquisite torture his propensity for persisting in the unwelcome the more he saw it resented a pure malignancy on this occasion observing an obvious inclination in his son my friend to silence and self obliteration he took pleasure in drawing him out with something of the savagery i could not but think of a fisherman who wrenches an obstinate hermit crab from its borrowed shell for bait i saw how poor hugh was rasped and goaded but could do no more than take upon myself where i could the burden of response believing at the time that this aggravated fencing between the two was a part or consequence of some trouble the serious nature of which might or might not have been implied in my friends recent outburst i made and could make but an inefficient second yet even had i known as i came to know that my surmise was wrong and that the fathers persistence was due to nothing but a perverse devil of teasing it is not clear to me how else i could have helped the situation i could not have hauled my host by the ears as i should have liked to do over his own dining room table but the sense of atmospheric friction was not confined to these two in some extraordinary way it communicated itself to the servants the very butler our young hostess i had not seen audrey at tea and now greeted her for the first time she came in late to find us by the bashaws directions already seated and to suffer a sharp reprimand for her unpunctuality which brought a flush to her young rebellious cheek nor did i better things so far as she was concerned by an ostentatious display of attentions she seemed to resent my sympathy even more than the harshness which had provoked it it is the way of cats and women to tear the hand that would release them from the trap the dinner in short began very uncomfortably with an irascible host a moody son and an offended daughter the butler taking his cue from his master and the servants from the butler they waited nervously and got in one anothers way only the more flurriedly for their whispered harrying by the exacerbated cleghorn i was surprised i confess by the change in that usually immaculate dignitary the very type and pattern of his kind correct imperturbable pontifical i had never before known cleghorn to manifest the least sign of human emotion unless it were when mr yockney the curate from leighway had mixed water with his chteau margaux now preposterous as it appeared i could have believed the great man had been crying his globous eyes his mottled cheeks bore suspicious evidences of the fact his very side whiskers looked limp surely the domestic storm if such which had rocked the house of kennett must have been demoralising to a hitherto unknown degree it was the baron who redeemed the situation winning harmony out of discord he had to do him justice the reconciliatory faculty chiefly i think because he could always find as one should a bright interest in differences of opinion instead of a subject for contention i never knew him then or thereafter to be ruffled by opposition or contradiction he accepted them placidly as constituting possible rectifications of his own argumentative frontiers his opportunity came with a growl of sir calvins over the lateness of the evening papers the general had been particularly curious to hear the result of a local trial known as the antonferry bank robbery case which was just reaching its conclusion and it chafed him to be kept waiting le sage asked for information and the supplying it smoothed the troubled waters there is a relish for most people in being the first to announce news whether good bad or indifferent the case as stated was remarkable for nothing but the skill with which it had been unravelled a bank in antonferry a considerable market town lying some eight or nine miles north of wildshott had been robbed and the question was by whom that question had been answered in the upshot by an astute scotland yard detective who in spite of the obloquy thrown upon his kind by mr sherlock holmes had shown considerable sagacity in tracing the crime to its source in the banks own manager a startling dnouement the accused on the strength of this experts evidence had been committed to stand his trial at winton quarter sessions and it was the issue of that event which was interesting sir calvin he had had some dealings with the bank in question and had even been brought into some personal contact with the delinquent official it seems he ended that there can be no doubt about the verdict that ridgway is a clever dog the detective queried le sage and the general nodded the sort i should be sorry if a thief to have laid on my trail but supposing you left none questioned the baron with a smile ah said sir calvin having nothing better to reply i have often thought said le sage that if crime realised its own opportunities there would be no use for detectives at all eh why not asked his host because there would be nothing to find out answered the baron how dye mean nothing to find out nothing whatever my idea now of a successful crime is not a crime which baffles its investigators but a crime which does not appear as a crime at all instance m le baron i ventured to put in why said le sage good humouredly a dozen may well present themselves to a man of average inventive intelligence direct murder for example how crude when a hundred means offer themselves for procuring plausible ends to life tetanus germs and an iron tack ptomaine that toxicologic mystery so easy to introduce the edge of a cliff and a windy day a frayed picture cord a loosened nut or two a scrap of soap left on the boards by an opened window given adroitness timeliness a little nerve would not any of these do audrey drew back in her chair with a flushed little laugh what a diabolical list she said and made a face as if she had taken medicine yes said i but after all baron this is no more than generalising you want a concrete instance he answered beaming on me what do you say then to a swimmer being awarded the humane societys certificate for attempting to save the life of a man whom he had really drowned it needs only a little imagination to fill in the details that is good i admitted we put one to your credit again said the baron i offer the case of a senseless young spendthrift he gambles he drinks his life is a bad life from the insurance companys point of view when hard pressed he is lavish with his ious when flush of money he redeems them he pays up he throws the slips into the fire with hardly a glance at them one who holds a good deal of his paper observes this and acts accordingly he preserves the original securities and on redemption offers forgeries in their place which he is careful to see destroyed on the death of the young man he puts in his claim on his estate on the strength of the indisputable original documents thus he is paid twice over without a possibility of any suspicion arising but one of the forged ious said audrey had been carried up the chimney without catching a light and had been blown through the open window of the young mans family lawyer who had kept it as a surprise there was a shout of laughter in which the baron joined bravo audrey cried her brother what about your average inventive intelligence baron i said specifically a mans pleaded le sage women fortunately for us are not eligible for the detective force audrey laughed at the compliment but i think she liked the baron for his pleasant good nature about that for my part i kept an open mind had he really invented these cases on the spur of the moment or could it be possible that they touched on some experience of his own one could not say of course but one could bear the point in mind the dinner went cheerfully enough after this jeu desprit of audreys that had even roused hugh from his glooms and to quite exaggerated effect he became suddenly talkative where he had been taciturn and almost boisterously communicative where he had been reserved but i noticed that he drank a good deal and detected curiously as i thought a hint of desperation under his feverish gaiety in all this it may be said i was appropriating to myself without authority a sort of watching brief on behalf of a purely chimerical client i had no real justification for suspecting the baron either on his own account or in association with my friends apparent state it was presumptive that sir calvin knew at least as much about the man as i did still i thought so long as i preserved my attitude of what i may call sympathetic vigilance la sourdine nothing could be lost and something even might be gained the common atmosphere perhaps affected me with the others and inclined me to an unusually observant mood a mood it may be prone to attach an over importance to trifles thus i could find food for it in an incident so ordinary as the following there was a certain picture on the wall a genre painting to which le sage sitting opposite it referred in some connexion sir calvin replying remarked that so and so had declared one of the figures to be out of proportion too short or too tall i forget which and in order to measure the discrepancy interposed after the manner of the connoisseur a finger between his eye and the subject there was nothing out of the common in the action save only that the finger he raised was the second finger of his right hand the first having been shot away in some long past engagement but it appeared quite obviously to me to arrest in a curious way the attention of the visitor he forgot what he was saying at the moment his speech tailed off he sat gazing as if suddenly fascinated not at the picture but at the finger the next instant he had caught up and continued what he was observing but the minute incident left me wondering it had signified i was sure no sudden realization of the disfigurement since that must have been long known to him but of some association with it accidentally suggested that in that single moment was my very definite impression i could hardly have explained why at the time but there it was and i may say now in my own justification that my instinct or my intuition was not at fault once or twice later i seemed to catch le sage manuvring to procure a repetition of the action but without full success and soon afterwards the two men fell upon the ever absorbing subject of chess and lapsed into vigorous discussion over the relative merits of certain openings such as the scotch the giuoco piano the ruy lopez attack philidors defence and the various gambits to wit the queens the allgaier the evans the muzio the sicilian and god knows what else they did not favour the drawing room for long after dinner but went off to the library to put their theories into practice leaving hugh and me alone with the lady i cannot admit that i found the subsequent evening exhilarating hugh appeared already to be suffering a relapse from his artificial high spirits and again disturbed me by the capricious oddity of his behaviour he and his sister bickered after their wont a good deal and once or twice the girl was brought by him near the verge of angry tears i thought i never could quite make out audrey she seemed to me a young woman of good impulses but one who was for ever on the defensive against imagined criticism and inclined therefore in a spirit of pure perversity to turn her worst side outermost yet she was a really pretty girl a tall stalk of maidenhood nineteen and athletically modern in the taking sense and had no reason but to value herself and her attractions at the plain truth they represented the trouble was that she was underestimated and i think proudly conscious of the fact with a father like sir calvin it was and must be hugo first and the rest nowhere he bullied every one but there was no under suggestion of jealous proprietorship in his bullying of audrey as there was in his adoring bullying of his son he did not care whether she felt it or not with the other it was like a lovers temper wooing by chastisement nor was hugo perhaps a very sympathetic brother he could enjoy teasing like his father and feel a mischievous pleasure in seeing the galled jade wince audrey i believe would have worshipped him had he let her i had observed how gratified she looked at dinner over his commendation of her jest but he held her aloof between condescension and contempt and the two had never been real companions the long motherless girl was lonely i think and it was rather pathetic still she did not always go the right way about it to avoid unfavourable criticism we were out for a day in the stubble on the morrow and i made it an excuse for going to bed betimes the trial of the bank manager i may mention by the way had ended in a verdict of guilty and a sentence of three years penal servitude i found and took the paper in to sir calvin before going upstairs the servants never dared to disturb him at his game chapter v the baron continues to interest me from the bickerdike ms we were three guns hugo myself and a young local landowner sir francis orsden of audley whom i had met before and liked he was a good fellow though considered effeminate by a sporting squirearchy but that i could never see our shooting lay over the lower estate from which the harvest had lately been carried and we went out by the main gates meeting the head gamekeeper hanson with the dogs and a couple of boy beaters in the road our plan was to work the stubble as far as possible in a south westerly direction making for asholt copse and hansons cottage where audrey and the baron were to meet us driving over in a pony trap with the lunch i perceived early enough that my chance of a days sport wholly untrammelled by scruples of anxiety was destined to be a remote one hugh it had been plain to me from the first had not mastered with the new day his mood of the night before his nervous irritability seemed to me even to have increased and the truth was he was a trying companion i had already made him some tentative bid for his confidence but without result i would not be the one again to proffer my sympathy uninvited after all he had asked for it and was the one to broach the subject if he wanted it broached probably i knew him the matter was no great matter some disappointment or monetary difficulty which his fancy exaggerated he hated trouble of any sort and was quite capable of summoning a friend from a sick bed to salve some petty grievance for him so i left to him to explain if and when he should think proper it was a grey quiet day chill but without wind the sort of day on which the echo of a shot might sound pretty deceptively from a distance a point to be remembered i was stationed on the left orsden on the extreme right and hugh divided us his shooting was wild to a degree he appeared to fire into the thick of the coveys without aim or judgment and hardly a bird fell to his gun hanson who kept close behind his young master turned to me once or twice when the lie of the ground brought us adjacent and shook his head in a surprised mournful way once hugh and i came together at a gap in a hedge i had negotiated it without difficulty and my friend was following when something caught my eye i snatched at his gun barrel directing it between us and on the instant the charge exploded good god man i exclaimed you like the veriest cockney greenhorn he had been pulling his piece after him by the muzzle and the almost certain consequence had followed i stood staring at him palely and for the moment his face was distorted hugh i said stiffly you didnt mean it he broke into a mirthless laugh mean it you mug of course i didnt mean it why should i i dont know mug for saving your life anyhow ill remember it vivian i wish i owed you something better worth the paying thats infernal nonsense of course now look here whats it all about all what you know ill tell you by and by viv on my honour i will will you hadnt you better go back in the meantime and leave your gun with hanson no dont be a fool or make me seem one ill go more careful after this i promise you on my sacred word i will there get on i was not satisfied but hanson coming up at the moment to see what the shot had meant i could have no more to say and prepared silently to resume my place its all right george said his master only a snap at a rabbit had he meant to kill himself if he had what trouble so much more tragic than any i had conceived must lie at the root of the matter but i would not dare to believe it it had been merely another manifestation of the reckless mood to which his spoilt temper could only too easily succumb nevertheless i felt agitated and disturbed and still in spite of his promise apprehensive of some ugly business he shot better after this episode however and thereby brought some reassurance to my mind hanson that astute gamekeeper led us well and profitably and the morning reached its grateful end in that worthys little parlour in the cottage in the copse with its cases of stuffed birds and vermin and its table delectably laid with such appetising provender as ham tongue and a noble pigeon pie with bottled beer syphons and old whisky to supply the welcome moisture audrey presided and the baron who had somehow won her liking and whom she had brought with her in the governess cart made a cheerful addition to the company he was brightly interested in our mornings sport as he seemed to be generally in anything and everything but even here one could never make out from his manner whether his questions arose from knowledge or ignorance in essential matters they were not i suppose in conformity with his principle of inwardness intended to betray but the whole thing was to my mind ridiculous like rattling the coppers in ones pocket to affect affluence one might have gathered for all proof to the contrary that his acquaintance with modern sporting weapons was expert yet he never directly admitted that he had used them or was to be drawn into any relation of his personal experiences in their connexion the subject of poachers was one on which i remember he exhibited a particular curiosity asking many questions as to their methods habits and the measures taken to counter their dangerous activities it was orsden who mostly answered him in that high eager voice of his with just the suspicion of a stammer in it which i could never hear without somehow being tickled hugh took no trouble to appear interested in the matter he was again i noticed with uneasiness preoccupied with his own moody reflections and was drinking far too much whisky and soda the baron asked as if for information yet it struck me that his inquiries often suggested the knowledge they purported to seek as thus might it not be possible now that among the quiet respectable men of the village who attend to their business drink in moderation go punctually to church and are well thought of by the local policeman the real expert poacher is mostly to be found the man who makes a study and a business of his craft and whose depredations conducted on scientific and meteorological lines should cause far more steady havoc among the preserves than that wrought by the organised gangs or by the unprofessional loafer moucher i think you call him or thus this country now with its mixture of downlands and low woods and the variety of opportunities they afford should be one might imagine peculiarly suited to the operations of these gentry or thus i wonder if your shrewd poacher makes much use of a gun unless perhaps on a foggy morning when the sound of the report would be muffled he should be a trapper i think par excellence and other proffered hypotheses seeming to show an even more intimate acquaintance with the minuti of the subject such as the springes nets ferrets and tricks of snaring common to the trade a list which set orsden cackling after a time on my word baron said he if it wasnt for your innocent way of p putting things i could almost suspect you of being a poacher yourself le sage laughed of other mens game in books perhaps he said well said orsden youre right so far that one of the closest and cunningest poachers i ever heard of was a leighway hedge carpenter called cleaver and he was as quiet sober civil spoken a chap as one could meet pious too and reasonable though a bit of a village politician with views of his own on labour yet it came out that for years hed been making quite a handsome income out of audley and its neighbours a sort of d deacon brodie you know not one of their preserves though youre at fault there baron your local man knows better than to put his head into the noose his dealings are with the casual outsiders so far as pheasants are concerned when he takes a gun its mostly to the birds and of course he shoots them sitting brute said audrey well i dont know said the young baronet hes a tradesman isnt he not a sportsman and tradesmen dont give law how did he escape so long asked the girl why you see answered orsden you cant arrest a man on suspicion of game stealing with nothing about him to prove it he must be caught in the act and if one third of his business lies in poaching quite two thirds lie in the art of avoiding suspicion fellows like cleaver are cleverer hypocrites than they are trappers j joseph surfaces in corduroys do you find said le sage men of his kind much prone to violence not usually replied orsden but they may be on occasion if suddenly discovered at work with a gun in their hands its exposure or murder then you see ruin or safety with no known reason for any one suspecting them i expect many poor innocent d devils were hanged in the old days for the sins of such vermin yes said le sage a shot gun can be a great riddler one or two of us cackled dutifully over the jeu de mot could we have guessed what tragic application it would receive before the day was out we might have appreciated it better perhaps i shall not soon forget that afternoon it began with audrey and the baron driving off together for a jaunt in the little cart they were very merry and our young baronet would have liked i think to join them i had noticed le sage looking excessively sly during lunch over what he thought no doubt was an exclusive discovery of his regarding these two but he was wrong they were good friends and that was all and as to the young ladys heart i had just as much reason as orsden which was none whatever for claiming a particular share in its interest any thought of preference would have been rank presumption in either of us and the wish i am sure was founded upon no such supposition it was merely that with hugh in his present mood the prospect of spending further hours in his company was not an exhilarating one he was flushed and lethargic and very difficult to move to further efforts when the meal was over but we got him out at last and went to work it did not last long with him it must have been somewhere short of three oclock that he shouldered his gun and came plodding to me across the stubble look here viv he said im going home make my apologies to orsden and keep it up with him but im no good and ive had enough of it he turned instantly with the word giving a short laugh over the meaning expressed obviously enough i dare say in my eyes and began to stride away no he called im not going to shoot myself and im not going to let you make an ass of me so long i had to let him go any further obstruction from me and i knew that his temper would have gone to pieces i gave his message to orsden and we two continued the shoot without him but it was a joyless business and we were not very long in making an end of it we parted in the road orsden for the bit and halter and the turning to leighway and i for the gates of wildshott it was near five oclock and a grey still evening as i passed the stables a white faced groom came hurrying to stop me with a piece of staggering news one of the maids he said had been found murdered shot dead that afternoon in the bishops walk chapter vi that thunders in the index le sage in the course of a pleasant little drive with audrey asked innumerable questions and answered none this idiosyncrasy of his greatly amused the young lady who was by disposition frankly outspoken and whose habit it never was to consider in conversation whether she committed herself or any one else truth with her was at least a state of nature though it might sometimes have worn with greater credit to itself a little more trimming and states of nature are relatively pardonable in the young a child who sees no indecorum in nakedness can hardly be expected to clothe truth this sir francis asked the baron he is an old friend of yours o yes said audrey quite an old friend and favourite well he seems one of us you see dont you like him yourself i suppose he and your brother are on intimate terms we are all on intimate terms hugh and frank no more than frank and i and no less perhaps or perhaps not quite so much o yes they are what makes you think so not quite so intimate i will put it as your brother and mr bickerdike im sure i dont know hugh is great friends with them both tell me now which would you rather he were most intimate with how can it matter to me you have a preference i expect i certainly have but that doesnt affect the question it was hugh you were speaking of not me shall i give your preference it is for mr bickerdike well guessed baron am i to take it as a compliment to my good taste he is a superior man isnt he and always wishes one to know it too aha then the baronet is the man how absurd you are do you value your friends by preference nobody is the man as you call it because i dont much like mr bickerdike it doesnt follow that i particularly like anybody else why dont you like him i dont know perhaps because he likes himself too much conceited is he not quite that a first rate prig i should call him always wanting to appear cleverer than he really is isnt he clever o yes clever after a sort but frightfully obtuse too i wouldnt trust him with a secret hes so cocksure of himself that hed always be liable to give it away with his blessing but i oughtnt to speak like that of him hes a great friend of hughs and he does really like to help people i think only it must be in his own way and not theirs do you like him i am rather surprised that he and your brother should be on such close terms of friendship are you why is not mr hugo now without offence a rather passionate self willed young gentleman very i should say balance and instability there you are you mean they are not at all alike i should have thought that was the best reason in the world for their chumming one of oneself is quite enough for most people fancy the horror of being a siamese twin is that why you and sir francis are on such good terms because there is nothing in common between you isnt there what for instance he presents himself to me from what little i have seen and heard of him as a rather gentle spiritual young man with a taste for books and the fine arts and a preference in sport if any for angling in aere piscari what does that mean i should fancy him a fisherman by choice of ideas rather than of streams and me i suppose a cross tempered empty headed country hoyden who thinks of nothing but dogs and stables but she laughed as she bent to le sage looking mockingly into his smiling eyes m le baron what a character it is not of my giving he said a spirited diana should have been my antithesis but why should you contrast us at all frank and i are not going to live together you are bearing in mind i hope he said that i promised your father to be back at wildshott by half past two for chess again what can you find in it she pulled up the pony and halting in the road determinedly faced her companion do you know you never answer anything thats asked of you why dont you i didnt know i didnt dont fib sir he chuckled aloud you are a frank young lady he took her slim left hand between his cushiony palms and patted it paternally when a suspected man is arrested my dear the first warning he receives from the police is that anything he says may be used in evidence against him supposing we apply that rule to common converse then at least we shall avoid self committal but are we all every one of us suspected people one never knows what may lie in a question for instance you ask me what can i find in chess very seeming innocent but o the suspicion it may embody what suspicion why that chess represents my poor wits and that i live upon them audrey tinkled with laughter i never guessed i was such a serpent but i am afraid i was only thinking of the dullness of it to sit for ten minutes looking at a board and then to move a pawn a single inch on it ugh by that time i should be screaming for grab let us play grab one night said the baron gaily they drove on by the pleasant lanes and presently came out into the high road near wildshott as they passed the wicket in the hedge a gleam of something quickly seen and quickly withdrawn among the green beyond caught le sages attention he laid a hand on the reins suggesting a halt was that a private way to the house he asked there where the little gate stood audrey told him yes that it was called the bishops walk and that he might lift the latch and go by it if he pleased she twinkled as she spoke and the baron looked roguish inquisitive said he i admit it if it is the word for an inquiring mind but not conceited i hope i am going to explore he was out in the road to the dancing relief of the governess cart springs and waved au revoir to his companion she nodded and drove on while he turned to go back to the wicket he hummed as he went a little philandering french air droning the words in a soft throaty way and was still recalling them as he mounted the two steps from the road opened the gate and passed through his eyes moving in an immobile face were busy all the time dites moi belle enchanteresse he sang qui donc vous a donn vos yeux just above his breath and suddenly at a few yards in eighteen or twenty swerved from the close narrow track and stepped behind a beech trunk and there was a girl hiding from view her eyes wide her forefinger crooked to her lip vos doux yeux si pleins de tendresse hummed m le baron and nodded humorously i thought i recognised you from the road she did not flush up or exclaim me or exhibit any of the offensive defensive pertness of the ordinary housemaid surprised out of bounds she just stood looking at the intruder a wonder on her rosy lips and le sage for his part returned her scrutiny at his leisure his impression of the night before he found more than confirmed by daylight she was a very arcadian nymph with a sweet briar complexion and eyes and hair of thyme and honey shapely as a doe ineffably pretty he wondered less than ever over louiss infatuation and what was she doing here her head was bare a light waterproof veiled her official livery it might be concluded without much circumspection that a tryst was in the air i am sorry said m le baron i did not come to be a spoil sport i ought perhaps to have pretended to see nothing and pass by but that rudeness of my man last night sticks in my mind and it occurred to me to apologise for him she laughed with a tiny toss of her head thank you sir but i can look after myself so i perceive he said you tone very well with the trees no eyes except perhaps the favoured ones could possibly guess you were here except yours sir she said with just a tiny sauce of irony except mine of course he agreed and left her to wonder why if she would well he said after a smiling moment that was an unpardonable act of louiss only dont visit it further on his head i have wanted to warn you and here is my opportunity he comes of a hot blooded race and theres no knowing but you can look after yourself i will take your word for it he believed she could though she made no further answer to assure him and with a nod he went on his way taking up again the little murmured burden of his song yeux yeux astres divins tombs des cieux o eyes he said sweetest eyes were even seen from what heaven did you fall to flower in a housemaids face there was something suggestive about the girl more than her surprising beauty a towniness a hint both in speech and manner of some shrewd quality which was not of the soil when lamia takes to country service thought the baron let more than rustic hearts look to their locks with whom he wondered could be her assignation what if after all it were with louis himself would that surprise him perhaps not cabanis was a handsome and compelling fellow and women like the lord could chasten whom they loved but he devoutly hoped it was not so he desired no amorous complications in his train and disturbed by the thought he inquired for his valet the moment he reached the house only to learn that the man had gone out some time before and had not yet returned somewhat disquieted le sage entered the hall where he was met by his host ah baron hailed sir calvin punctuality itself go into my study will you and ill join you in a moment the study was a comfortable room on the ground floor with a large bay window overlooking the gardens here the table for chess was set ready with a brace of high easy chairs and handily contiguous a smokers cabinet there were trophies of the chase and some good sporting pictures on the walls against them a couple of mahogany bookcases containing well bound editions of alken surtees and others and let into an alcove of that one of them which included the fireplace a substantial safe le sage knew it was there though it was hidden from sight behind a shallow curtain and now as he moved humming about the room his hands behind his back his eyes scrutinising a picture or two while he awaited his hosts coming he gravitated gradually toward its place of concealment arrived there he lifted very delicately and still humming the hem of the curtain just exposed the keyhole and bent to examine it with singular intentness but a moment later when the general entered he was contemplating a coaching print by flavell over the mantelpiece indifferent art i suppose you will admit he said but there is something picturesquely direct about these old sporting pieces well they suit me answered sir calvin because i understand them reds red and blues blue to me and if any artist tells me they are not ive nothing to answer the fellow but that hes a damned liar le sage laughed what is the colour of a black eye then and they settled down to their game the general was a good player all the best of his mental qualifications which were otherwise of the standard common among retired officers of an overbearing obstinate and undiscerning disposition were displayed in his astute engineering of his small forces he was a tactical napoleon in miniature when it came to chess he seemed to acquire then a reason and a dignity inconspicuous in his dealings with living people the chess men could not misrepresent him their movements were his movements and their successes or failures his if he lost he had no one but himself he could possibly blame and his understanding of that condition seemed to bring out the best in him he was never choleric over the fortunes of the game for the rest he was not a wise man or an amenable man or anything but a typical despot of his class having an inordinate pride of family which owed less than it should have to any moral credit he had brought it in the past in person he was a leanish clean built soldier of fifty five with bullying eyebrows and a thick blunt moustache of a grizzled blonde he and the baron were very fond of devising problems which they would send up for solution to the morning post they set to elaborating a tough one now a very difficult changed mate two mover which kept them absorbed and occupied over the board for a considerable time indeed a full hour and a half had passed before they had settled it to their satisfaction and then the baron taking a refreshing pinch of macuba rose to his feet that is it my friend said he an economical bp at k knight and the thing is done the clock on the mantelpiece chimed a quarter past four as he spoke and on the tinkling reverberation of its one stroke some one opened the door it was hugo kennett the young mans face was ghastly his hands shook he came into the room hurriedly as if overweighted with some dreadful piece of intelligence good god hughie exclaimed his father and rose staring at the boy his eternal cigarette caught between his teeth the young soldier made an effort to speak his breath fluttered audibly in him like the leaf of a ventilator his nerve seemed for the moment gone utterly beyond his control steady sir commanded the general and his masterful tone had its visible effect now he said after a rallying pause what is it hugh swallowed once or twice and answered le sage observant of him could see what immense force he had to put upon himself to do so the bishops walk can you come at once sir theres been what looks like a dreadful murder there sir calvin never so much as blenched or exclaimed one might at least admire in him the self possessed soldier not to be rattled by any sudden call upon his nerve murder he said whose murder the young mans lips quivered he looked physically sick its one of the maids sir i saw her i came upon her myself i had forgotten my gun and went back to fetch it and there she was lying on her face and he put his hands before his own face and shuddered horribly look here said the father you must pull yourself together this wont do at all baron get me my hunting flask if youll be so good its in the right hand top drawer of my desk he poured into the cup with an unshaking hand a full half gill of liqueur brandy and made his son drink it down it wrought a measure of effect a tinge of colour came to hughs cheek his hurried respirations steadied now said sir calvin try to be coherent what do you mean by forgetting your gun i mean sir he looked down his features still twitched spasmodically i mean it was like this i was no good at the shoot and i left it and came back by myself came back by the bishops walk just a little way inside i stopped to light a cigarette and rested my gun against a tree and forgot it but an hour later i remembered that i had left it there and went back to fetch it and saw o it was ghastly steady man was the girl there when you first entered the path le sage listened for an answer in the affirmative and could hardly hear it when it came and you stopped to light a cigarette the father looked keenly into the sons face you havent yet told us what girl hughie the good liqueur was working the young fellow lifted his head a new passionate expression in his eyes it was annie sir that good looking housemaid you wouldnt wonder over my horror if you saw he must have fired at short range the damned villain and when she was turned from him there is a hole in her back that one could put ah i cant tell you m le baron exclaimed that would have been said he speaking for the first time between three and four when you discovered the body just now answered hugh addressing his father i have come straight from it they are waiting for you sir to know what to do it was done with your gun is that the assumption suggested the baron i dont know replied the young man feverishly again not to the questioner i suppose so i dare say both barrels are discharged and one i am pretty sure i left loaded are you coming sir sir calvin frowning a stiff moment moved to acquiesce they all went out together at the entrance to the track a group of frightened maid servants stood white lipped and whispering afraid to penetrate farther one or two grooms and a couple of gardeners had already gone in and were awaiting about the body the arrival of their master it lay face downwards close beside the beech trunk behind which the living girl had sought to hide herself from le sage that stood at a point in the winding path some twenty five yards from the wicket and was nowhere remotely visible from the road she might have been making her way back to the house when she was fired on and shattered it was a pitiful ugly sight but death must have been instantaneous that was one comfort le sage made the most of it to himself though he was really distressed and moved poor eyes he thought si pleins de tendresse but an hour ago so beautiful and now quenched in death so this was the tryst you kept why it can hardly be cold yet about your heart sir calvin stern and wrath gave brief directions a shutter was to be brought a doctor fetched from longbridge by one servant the county police informed by another he asked a short question or two one of his son was this the tree against which he had left his gun leaning hugh answered no while le sage listened he had left it he said propped against a smaller trunk four or five yards nearer the gate he had had to pass the body to recover it and had then taken it home and thrust it into the gun room as he had hurried by to raise an alarm he spoke with extreme agitation averting his eyes from the dead girl and indeed it was a sight to move a tougher heart than his sir calvins next question was to the group at large it was to ask if any one knew of any enemy the unfortunate victim had raised against herself or of any possible reason for the attack but no one knew or guessed or if he felt a suspicion would have dared to formulate it it would have been too risky a venture at this stage of the affair their master looked from face to face and grunted and spoke a warning word if that were so he said let them avoid all loose discussion of the matter until the police had taken it in hand it might after all prove no murder but only an accident the perpetrator of which terrified by the deed which he had unwittingly committed might be keeping silence only until assured that he could tell the truth without danger to himself le sage ventured to applaud that suggestion turning to hugh to ask him if he did not think it a quite reasonable one but the young man refused to consider it he was very excited it was murder he said gross palpable open and it was mere criminal sophistry to pretend to account for it on any other theory his father steadied him once more with a word and the three turned to go back to the house together as they had come leaving the men to follow with the body on issuing from the copse they found the little group of frightened sobbing women reinforced by cleghorn the butler wore a cloth cap and a light overcoat his face was the colour of veal and his lower jaw hung in a foolish incapable way ha cleghorn said his master this is a bad business its knocked me all of a heap sir answered the man his voice shook and wheezed ive only this moment heard of it sir hugo hung behind as they entered the hall his father steady as a rock marched on to his study and was followed by m le baron the latter shut the door upon them an ugly business he said a cursed interruption to our game damned the general he was greatly incensed that such a vulgar scandal should have come to pollute the sacred preserves of wildshott seemed to him the incredible outrage what am i to do he said what is the infernal procedure there will have to be an inquest i suppose and then and then to indict the murderer said le sage answering the pause you think it is a murder what do you think i dont know i suppose so it may prove a devil of a business to find out ought we to have a detective these provincial police are excellent men but their normal training still it may prove a quite simple affair i have a feeling somehow that it wont id better write up to scotland yard if youre decided on it why not apply there is or was in the neighbourhood the very man you mean that fellow ridgway by jove yes a clever dog ill motor into winton first thing to morrow and find out in the meantime wheres hugo i think i saw him go upstairs ill have him sent to you if youll allow me i was wanting to write some letters he retreated with a smile which left his face the moment he was outside finding a servant he gave her sir calvins message and then put a question of his own do you know where my man is my dear i think mr cabanis is out sir answered the girl her cheeks were still mottled with the fright of things he went out some time ago o to be sure about three oclock wasnt it earlier than that sir directly after dinner in the servants hall her manner appeared a little odd disordered but that might have been due to the shock they had all received and he has not yet returned said the baron cheerily well send him to me the moment he comes in if you will be so good and he moved to mount the stairs humming as he went but again though his song was light he turned a dark face to the wall chapter vii the baron visits the scene of the crime from the bickerdike ms i confess that the mans communication coming on the top of my concern for my friend fairly in the first moment of it took me aghast the state in which i had found hugh that disquieting business of the gun his insistence on sticking to his weapon it was inevitable that my mind should instinctively leap to some association between these and a catastrophe so seemingly their corollary in its nature and instrumentality it was odd but ever since my meeting with the baron in simpsons smoking room a sense as of some vague fatality had seemed to overcloud me it was formless impalpable but it was there like that unnerving atmosphere which precedes according to people who know an earthquake but that first sick alarm was not long in dissipating itself in me in a fine scorn the thing to my recovered judgment was simply incredible apart from the brutal clumsiness the unthinking recklessness of such a deed what was there in my knowledge of my friend to justify such a horrible assumption spoilt he was selfish he was no doubt but always the last man in the world to incline to personal violence a sensitiveness to pain almost morbid on account of himself or others was rather his characteristic an excess of affection his charm and his weakness he could not have done it of course for whatever mad reason but as i came to learn the particulars of the tragedy so far as they were known or guessed another suspicion less base though still discomposing would occur to me the poor girl according to all accounts had been a great beauty and it appeared probable from evidence freely volunteered by m le baron who had passed through the copse some short time before the murder must have been committed and who had seen and spoken with her there that she was keeping an assignation with whom who could as yet say but i had too good reason to dread my friends susceptibility where the adorable feminine was concerned and i could not forget how the time of the assignation if such it were had coincided with that of his leaving the shoot this i thought may be as unjustified an assumption as the other still for the sake of argument admit it and one thing at least is accounted for with such a wire strung nature as hughs the consciousness of a guilty intrigue would be quite enough to induce in him that state of recklessness and excitability which had so bothered and perplexed me it was still in fact perplexing me at dinner on the night of the murder when after the withdrawal of audrey and the servants much discussion of the tragic subject took place and later when he and i were for a brief time alone together in the billiard room it was not so much that he was not shocked and horrified with the rest of us as that his emotions were expressed in such an extraordinary form they made him lament one moment and go into half hysterical laughter the next now utter raging imprecations against the dastard capable of so damnable a crime now assert that jealousy was probably responsible for it and that no man who had not felt jealousy had a right to sit in judgment on a passion which was after all not so much a passion as a demoniac possession then he would declare that the thing being done it was no good making oneself miserable about it and rally me on my long face which he said made him feel worse than a hundred murders the horror of the thing had no doubt unhinged him coupled with the knowledge that it was through his own carelessness in leaving a loaded gun within reach of temptation that the deed had been made possible with such a nature as his that consciousness must have counted for much though still and at the same time i could never quite rid myself of the feeling that beneath all his expressed remorse and pity a strange little note of i will not call it relief but ease from some long haunting oppression made itself faintly audible however remembering his late promise of confidence to me i determined to abide in patience its coming only wondering in the interval what had instigated his remarks on jealousy and if it were possible that they had been inspired by any suspicion of the criminal and if so on what personal grounds he came down quite quiet to breakfast the next morning and from that time onwards was his own rational hospitable self early in the afternoon of that day sir calvin came back with the detective sergeant ridgway in tow the latter had been retrieved by good luck from antonferry whither after the trial he had returned from winton to settle for the lodgings he had occupied during the bank investigations the general had been fortunate in encountering him at the very moment of his departure and had at once secured from him contingent on the receipt of official authority a promise to undertake the case a prepaid telegram to scotland yard had brought the necessary sanction and within a couple of hours of its despatch the sergeant was safe at wildshott and already engaged over the preliminaries of the business personally i admit i felt greatly relieved by his appearance on the scene a notable writer has somewhat humoured a belief in the fatuity of the professional detective but that was with a view i think to exalt his own incomparable amateur rather than to discredit a singularly capable body of men having a pretty persistent record of success to justify their being intellectuality was at least not absent by inference from this face when i saw it i felt that the case was in safe hands and that henceforth we might one and all of us cast whatever burden of personal responsibility had unwittingly overhung our spirits the sergeant was installed in the house and lost no time in getting to work in a reassuring business like way he went in the first instance to view the body which had been laid on a table in the gun room with a policeman one of two brought over the night before by the chief constable a friend of sir calvins in person to watch the door thereafter established in the generals study he briefly reviewed the evidence of such witnesses as could supply any topical information that bore on the crime le sage to wit hugo himself mrs bingley the housekeeper and one or two of the servants including the men who on their young masters alarmed summons had first entered the copse to remove the body i was present during the whole i think of this examination and for the following reason it happened that i and the baron on his way to the study met in the hall when he attacked me i thought rather impertinently on a question of punctilio do you not think my friend he said that under the circumstances it would be decent of us to offer to terminate our visit supposing we both here and now address sir calvin on the subject i was very much annoyed baron i said i am not accustomed to seek advice in matters of conduct and i certainly shall not do as you propose apart from the question of deserting my friend in a crisis i think that any suggestion of our leaving now would look like a desire to avoid inquiry which i for my part am far from wishing to do and would bear a very bad complexion you can act as you like but it is my intention to see this thing through o very well he said then i will speak for myself alone why should he wish to escape all my instinctive suspicion of him reawakened on the moment and i wondered true he could not himself have perpetrated the crime hugos evidence would not permit of such a supposition but could he not be somehow implicated in it as instigator or abettor i determined then and there to keep a very close observation on m le baron we entered the room together since i would not suffer his going in alone to misrepresent me sir calvin was there with his son and the detective i saw the last for the first time he was quite the typical hawkshaw and handsome at that a lithe man of middle height with a keen dark aquiline face and clean shaven jaws and chin i could have thought him a young man for his work and reputation he did not look more than thirty five and might have been less but about his mental ability if one could judge by indications there was no question a certain rather truculent dandyism in his dress contrasted oddly with this intellectuality of feature it showed itself a little over emphatic in the matter of trouser crease and collar and scarf pin and it tilted his black plush homburg hat when out of doors at a slightly theatrical angle but taste after all is a question not of mind but of breeding and the man who has like disraeli to stand on his head for a living may be excused a little ostentation in the process he looked at us both searchingly as we entered this sergeant said sir calvin is the baron le sage whom i mentioned to you as having encountered the unfortunate young woman in the copse a little before the detective nodded i should like to ask a question of you sir le sage told what he knew it was very little and only of value in so far as it touched upon the evidence of time it must have been a little before half past two when we met he said and shortly after three said the detective turning to hugo when you came by the same path sir and had your little talk with her like this gentleman my talk said the baron smiling was of the briefest we exchanged but a pleasant word or two and i passed on and yours said the detective to hugh was perhaps of a more prolonged sort it may have been sergeant was my friends answer he was looking pale but composed and his manner was absolutely frank and unequivocal you see said he poor annie was after all one of the household and there was nothing out of the way in my stopping to speak with her we may have chatted for ten minutes i should think no longer while i put down my gun and lighted a cigarette i was back at the house by a quarter past three or thereabouts and you remembered and returned for your gun that must have been just about four oclock so that the murder if murder it was must have been committed some time between and pm that is so i suppose the detective stood as if mutely weighing the few facts at his disposition for a moment or two then turned to the general we shall want evidence of identity sir calvin he said your housekeeper i suppose engaged the young woman can i see her mrs bingley was rung for and in the interval while awaiting her appearance le sage approached our host pardon me sir calvin said he but before you proceed any further would you not prefer that i should withdraw i cannot but feel that my visit itself is proving untimely and that it were better that i should relieve you of the embarrassment of but the general broke in forcibly not a bit of it theres nothing to conceal damn it man beyond helping this sergeant what we can to find out the truth i dont see why the even tenour of our ways need disturb itself by so much as a thought no no you came for chess and youll stay for chess a sentiment which while justifying my own attitude pretty effectually disposed of the barons affected and perhaps interested scruples he smiled with a tiny shrug well if i am not in the way and addressed the detective the ruling passion you see sergeant ridgway do you play chess a little answered the man cautious even in his admission its a great game its the game said the baron well play you and i one of these days when youre needing some distraction from your labours very well sir responded the detective civilly and at that moment mrs bingley entered the room wildshott was by common assent fortunate in its housekeeper she was a good soul and a good manager strict but tolerant ruling by tact alone spare and wiry her virgin angularity despite her courtesy title was of the sort one associates with blessed women in old painted manuscripts firmness and patience showed in her capable face to which agitation had now lent a rather red eyed pallor she bowed to sir calvin and faced the detective quietly you wanted to speak with me sir just a few words he answered this young womans name mrs bingley was annie evans sir and her age she was just by her own statement turned twenty three you have communicated with her relations no indeed she never referred to any and i have no means of finding them out annie was a very reserved girl but surely when you engaged her i did so by advertisement sir through the ladies times newspaper we were in immediate need of an under housemaid and there was a difficulty about local girls i put an advertisement in the paper as i had often done before preferring that method to the agencies and she answered it that was about two months ago and her former employer that was a mrs wilson sir she had gone to new zealand and left a written character with annie it was quite against my custom to take a servant with only a written character but in this instance i was persuaded to break my rule the character given was so excellent and the girl herself so modest and attractive hm then you saw her before engaging her i went up to see her at the office of the paper itself by her own appointment and was so struck by her manner and appearance that i settled with her then and there she was to come down two days later to the best of my memory i never inquired about her people but she must have spoken of them received letters she never spoke of them to my knowledge or that of her fellow servants to whom i have put the question as to letters annie certainly did receive one now and again one or two quite recently but i have been looking and can find no trace of any it would have been just like her funny sensitive ways to destroy every one of them the detective was silent for a moment his dark scrutinizing eyes fixed on the speakers face as if he were pondering some significance to him in the answer what became of the written character he asked presently i returned it to her sir it is customary to do so in case she should want to use it again that being so i should have thought she would have kept it yes sir but you have not come across it it may be in her boxes i have not looked you and i must overhaul those boxes mrs bingley did you think now of making any inquiries about this mrs wilson no it would have been useless she had already sailed for new zealand do you remember her address she wrote so far as i can recollect from the savoy hotel sergeant ridgway took an envelope from his pocket and making a note on the back of it returned it into keeping well you can leave that to me he said and resting his right elbow in the palm of the other hand softly caressed his chin bending an intent look on his witness now maam he said i want to ask you a particular question has annie evanss conduct while in this service always continued to justify you in your first good opinion of her always answered the housekeeper with emphasis she was a thoroughly good straightforward girl and during the short time she was here i have never had any trouble with her that was of her own procuring will you tell me quite what you mean by that well sir she could not help being pretty and admired and if it led to some quarrels among the men on her account the blame was theirs and never in the smallest degree to be charged to her conduct with them she always did her best to keep them at a distance o quarrels were there can you tell me of any particular quarrel now i could began the housekeeper and stopped come mrs bingley said her master you must speak out without fear or favour i know it sir said the housekeeper distressed i will try to do my duty hey cried the general of course you must you wouldnt want to risk hanging the wrong man what particular quarrel hey it was between mr cleghorn and the barons gentleman sir cleghorn eh great scott was he sweet on the girl i think for some time he had greatly admired her sir and then mr cabanis came and being a young man with ways different from ours again she hesitated out with it cried sir calvin dont keep anything back on the night before before the deed said the housekeeper with an effort annie had come down into the kitchen i was told red with fury over mr cabanis having tried to kiss her she had boxed his ears for him she said and he had looked murder at her for it he came down himself later on i understand and there was a fine scene between the two men it was renewed the next day at dinner when annie wasnt there and in the end after having come to blows and been separated they both went out cabanis first and mr cleghorn a little later that is the truth sir and now may i go i think we were all sorry for the baron it appeared so obvious whither the trend of the detectives inquiries must henceforth carry him but he sat quite quiet with only a smile on his face louis is not vindictive was the sole thing he contented himself with saying sir calvin turned to the detective do you need mrs bingley any more not for the present answered the sergeant and the housekeeper left the room i had expected from him on her disappearance some significant look or gesture betokening his acceptance of the inevitable conclusion but he made no such sign and merely resumed his business conduct of the case he knew better than we no doubt that in crime the most obvious is often the most unreliable we must find the girls relations if possible sir calvin he said you can leave that to me however what i would advise if her boxes yield no clue would be an advertisement in the papers an examination of some of the servants ensued upon this but beyond the fact of their supplying corroborative testimony as to the quarrel their evidence was of little interest and i omit it here the baron disappeared during the course of the inquiry so secretively that i think i was the only one who noticed his going at the end the detective expressed a desire to examine the scene of the crime if one of us he said would conduct him there he would be satisfied and would ask no more he did not want a crowd i ventured to volunteer and was accepted sir calvin had looked towards his son but hugh with reason sufficient had declined to go he had sat throughout the inquiry after giving his own evidence perfectly still and with a sort of white small smile on his lips thinking my own thoughts i was sorry for him the sergeant and i made for the coppice passing the constable at the gun room door he nodded to him thats a poor thing inside he said as we went on what a lot of trouble shed save if she could speak well i suppose that him that did it thinks shes got her deserts i hope hell get his i answered ah he agreed i hope he will we turned a bend as we came near the fatal beech tree and there was the baron before us the detective stopped with a smart exclamation then went on slowly doing a little amateur detective work on your own sir he asked sarcastically i was considering my friend answered the baron it becomes interesting to me you see since my man is involved who said he was involved sir ah who now you can see very distinctly sergeant where the body lay just the one ugly token no signs of a struggle i think and the ground too hard to have left a trace of footprints but i wont disturb you at your work i wouldnt sir said the detective pretty bluntly you can undertake i fancy to leave it all to me im sure i can answered the baron pleasantly and he went off towards the house humming softly to himself a little french air who is he asked the detective when the odd creature was out of hearing i know little more about him than you do i answered and sir calvins acquaintance with him is i think almost as casual as my own we both met him abroad at different times he may be a person of distinction or he may be just an adventurer for all i know to the contrary well said the officer whoever he is i dont want him meddling in my business and i shall have to tell sir calvin so do i said chess is the barons business and its that that hes here for but i kept my private suspicions while duly noting as much as might or might not be implied in le sages curious interest in the scene of the crime no doubt the last thing he had expected was our sudden descent upon him there chapter viii an entracte jake was a boy of imagination though one would never have thought it to look at his jolly rubicund face and small sturdy form the very gaiters on his stout calves spruce and workmanlike would have precluded any such idea his master sir francis orsden the son of one of whose gamekeepers he was would never though a young man of imagination himself have guessed in jake a kindred spirit yet when sir francis played on the organ in the little church at leighway and jake blew for him it was odds which of the two brought the more inspiration to his task sir francis would practise there occasionally and bring the boy with him because jake was dogged and strong of muscle and not easily tired he never knew what secret goad to endurance the small rascal possessed in his imagination the business in hand blowing was to watch a plummets rise and fall you pumped for the fall and slackened for the rise that was the hard prose of it but jake knew a better way he would imagine himself blowing up a fire with a bellows when a full organ was needed he had to blow like the devil to keep the plummet down and then the fire roared under his efforts otherwise a gentle purring glow was easily stimulated at another time he would be filling a bucket at a well for a succession of thirsty horses and would so nicely time the allowance for each that the bucket was descending again on the very point of its being sucked dry or he would be the landlord of the bit and halter dozing over his parlour fire nodding nodding down in little jerks and then recovering himself with an indrawn rising sigh sometimes when the music was very liquid he would work a beer engine one or two good pulls and then the upward flow through the syphon sometimes he would fish and getting a bite pull in these make believes greatly ameliorated the tedium of his office by importing a sense of personal responsibility into it it was not so much the music he had to keep going as his fancy of the moment one morning he was blowing for his master and pretending rather gruesomely to be an exhausted swimmer struggling for a few strokes and then relaxing and drifting until agonised convulsively to fresh efforts when he became aware of a young lady standing by him and amusedly watching his labours jake ducked even in the process of pumping and miss kennett put a finger to her lips she was quite a popular young lady among the villagers whom she treated on terms of sociability which her father would strongly have disapproved had he known there was nothing of touchstones rosy audrey about miss kennett but there was a good deal of the graceful and graceless rebel grievance mutely felt had thrown her into another camp than that of her order sir francis played on unconscious of his listener until presently with a whispered give it me jacob the young lady appropriated the pump handle and began herself to inflate the lungs of the music the change did not make for success her strokes femininely short and quick raced against the rising plummet and presently gave out altogether at a critical moment of full pressure the wind went from the pipes in a dismal whine miss kennett sat back on the pump handle in a fit of helpless laughter and sir francis came dodging round the organ in a fume great scott he exclaimed and the asperity in his face melted into an amiable grin my mistake said audrey do go on how did you know i was here i didnt but i heard some one grinding the organ and came in to see jake said his master miss kennett is going to blow for me so you can cut along the boy touched his forehead secured his cap and departed a good youngster said sir francis i love him said audrey ah sighed the young baronet lucky jake frank dont be tiresome do you really want me to blow for you no not for ever i know you are going to say it and it would simply be silly if i am going to stop here you must talk sense i have hardly said anything yet well dont say it sit down and play i dont want to play i want to be serious why am i so obnoxious to you audrey now i shall go no do be patient really you know you have never yet said in so many words why you wont marry me yes i have it is because i couldnt possibly call myself audrey orsden of audley well if you will be flippant she stood looking at him a moment i didnt mean to be flippant frank nothing but kind shall we go a walk together its such a lovely morning only you must promise i think i know what you mean by kind audrey kind in forbearing very well i will promise he stowed his music away and they went out together out through the green and shadowed churchyard with its old headboards and epitaphs there was one to a merry maid dead at sixteen whose thoughtless laughter had served some mortuary rhymster for a theme on the perishableness of sweet things with an earnest recommendation to the christian to be wise while he might as if wisdom lay in melancholy there was a fine opportunity for drawing a moral but sir francis did not draw it perhaps he thought he would rather have marriage as a jest than no wife at all soon they were outside the village and making for the free downs audrey was always at her best and frankest on the downs i had wanted to speak to you said her companion is it really true that our friend the barons man has been arrested in connexion with this horrible affair yes it is quite true poor baron i am not allowed to know much about it all but it seems that everything points to this louis being the culprit he went out on the afternoon of the murder with the express purpose of seeking annie and did not come home till long afterwards the police have taken him into custody on suspicion it must be awkward for you all having the baron for a guest it is in a way but we cant very well ask him to go elsewhere while his man is in peril he offered but papa wouldnt hear of it he said the best thing for them both was to go on playing chess hows hugo hes all right why shouldnt he be i dont know only he struck me as being upset about something on that day we shot together well he doesnt give me his confidence you know no i know poor audrey why do you call me poor audrey asked the girl angrily i dont want your pity or anybodys you dont want anything of mine im sure and yet its all there for your acceptance every bit is this keeping your promise no i dont i want what i want and its nothing that you can give me not my whole love and submission audrey she flounced her shoulder and seemed as if about to leave him but suddenly thought better of it and faced him resolutely its that frank though you dont seem to understand it i dont want any mans submission i want his mastership if i want him at all her eyes softened and she looked at him pityingly i hate to pain you you dear but i cant marry you you have a thousand good qualities you are gentle and true and just and honourable and you have a mind to put my poor little organ to shame why you should possibly want me i cant tell but im very sure of one thing that i am wise in disappointing you we should be the brass and the earthenware pots frank and you would be the one to be broke i know it you are a poet and i am the very worst of prose you have a right to despise me and i have a right not to despise you but to see what you are not from my point of view that is to say a sportsman you know i could never pretend to any sympathy with your real tastes books and music and musty old prints and all that sort of thing he laughed well i shall try again his persistence goaded her to cruelty if you want to know the truth i like a man to be a man as my brother is his face twitched and sobered and i am not one why do you make me say these things she cried resentfully you drive me to it and then take credit i suppose for your larger nature i take credit for nothing said he my account with you is all on the debit side audrey dear please forgive me for having broken my word it shall be the last time i believe it has been the first she said with a rather quivering lip i will say that for you frank your word is your bond now do let us talk about something else i came out to get rid of all that horrible atmosphere of police and detectives and suspicions about everybody and everything and this is my reward the inquest is taking place this very day and how glad i shall be when the whole sick business is over and the poor thing decently buried words cant say now one two three and let us race for that clump chapter ix the inquest the bit and halter was seething with excitement its landlord joe harris selected foreman of the jury about to sit on the poor remains of that which five days earlier had been the living entity known as annie evans had all the bustling air of a master of the ceremonies at some important entertainment the tap overflowed as on an auction day occasion most popular for bringing together from near and far those birds of prey to whom a broken home or a bankrupt farm stock offers an irresistible attraction here it was another sort of calamity but the moral was the same it turned upon that form of epicurism which consists in watching comfortably from an auditorium the agonies of ones martyred fellow creatures in the arena there are sybarites of that complexion who if they cannot be in at the death will go far to be in at the burying the case both from its local notoriety and the agreeable mystery which surrounded it had aroused pretty widespread interest speculation as to its outcome was rife and voluble quite a pack of vehicles stood congregated in the road and quite a crowd of their owners in and about the inn enclosure each known official visage as it appeared was greeted with a curious scrutiny silent until the new comer had passed and then rising garrulous in the wake of his going there was no actual ribaldry heard but plenty of rather excited jocularity with odds given and taken on the event if the poor shattered voiceless thing which lay so quietly in its shell in an outhouse awaiting the coming verdict could only once have pleaded in visible evidence for itself surely the solemnity of that mute entreaty for peace and forgetfulness would have found its way even to those insensate hearts but charity is as much a matter of imagination as of feeling and many an unobtrusive need in the world fails of its relief through the lack of that penetrative vision in the well meaning our souls it may be are not to be measured within the limits of our qualities at near eleven oclock the deputy district coroner mr brabner drove up in a fly he was a small important looking be whiskered man in large round spectacles of such strength as to impart to his whole face a solemn owlish look very sapient and impressive a hush fell upon the throng as he alighted with his clerk and ushered by the landlord entered the inn but he had hardly disappeared when a more thrilling advent came like aarons serpent to devour the lesser this was of the arrested man in charge of a couple of officers from the county police station the unhappy little gascon looked frightened and bewildered his restless vivacious brown eyes glanced hither and thither among the people seeming to deprecate to implore to appeal for pity from a monstrous terror which had trapped and was about to devour him but his emotions had hardly found scope for their display when he was gone hurried in by his escort thereafter the party from the house with all necessary witnesses being already assembled in the inn no time was lost in opening the proceedings which were arranged to take place in the coffee room the one fair sized chamber in the building though still so small that only a fraction of the waiting public could be allowed admittance to it the rest hanging disconsolately about the passages and windows and getting what information they could by deputy the coroner took his seat at one end of the long table provided the jury probi et legales homines to the number of twelve good farm hands and true the most of them and ready to believe anything they were told were despatched to view the body and the business began mr redstall a winton solicitor watched the case on behalf of sir calvin the deceaseds family being unrepresented and mr fyler barrister at law appeared for the police a report of the subsequent proceedings is summarised in the following notes evidence of identification being in the first instance required sergeant ridgway of the scotland yard detective force stated that it had been found impossible so far in spite of every effort made to trace out the deceaseds relations he had himself made a journey to london whence the girl had been originally engaged for the express purpose of inquiring but had failed wholly to procure any information on the subject all agencies had been communicated with and the name did not figure anywhere on their books an advertisement appealing to the next of kin had been inserted in a number of newspapers but without as yet eliciting any response he called on mrs bingley to repeat the statement she had already made to him regarding the deceaseds engagement by her and the housekeeper having complied he asked the coroner in default of any more intimate proof to accept the only evidence of identification procurable at the moment further attempts would be made of course to elucidate the mystery as by way of the deceaseds former employer mrs wilson but that lady being gone to new zealand might prove as difficult to trace as evanss own connexions and in any event a long time must elapse before an answer could be obtained from her a search of the girls boxes and personal belongings though minutely conducted by himself and the housekeeper had failed to yield any clue whatsoever and in short so far as things went that was the whole matter the sergeant spoke now as hereafter always with visible effect not only on the jury but on the coroner himself his cool keen aspect his pruned and essential phrases the awful halo with which his position as a great london detective surrounded him not to speak of the local reputation he had lately acquired weighted his every word to these admiring provincial minds with a gravity and authority which were final if he said that such a thing was it was the coroners clerk entered on his minutes the name of annie evans domestic servant age twenty three family and condition unknown and the case proceeded mr hugo kennett was the first witness called he gave his evidence quietly and clearly though with some signs of emotion when he referred to his discovery of the dead body his relation of the event has already been given and need not here be repeated the essential facts were that he had entered the bishops walk on the fatal afternoon shortly after three oclock had encountered and stood talking with the girl for a period estimated at ten minutes had then continued his way to the house which he may have reached about and later just as it struck four had suddenly remembered leaving his gun in the copse and had returned to retrieve it with the result known the body was lying on its face and from its attitude and the nature of the injury it would appear that the shot had been fired from the direction of the road he went at once to raise an alarm at the conclusion of this evidence counsel rose to put a few questions to the witness q you say mr kennett you left at once on discovering the body to give the alarm a yes q leaving your gun where it was a no i forgot i spoke generally not realising that the point might be important q you see that it may be a quite q you secured your gun first then a yes i did i had to pass the body to do it not liking the job but driven to it in a sort of insane instinct to get the thing into my safe keeping when it was too late you see i blamed myself for having in a sort of way contributed to the deed by my carelessness i was very much agitated q you mean that in your opinion the crime might never have been committed had not the gun offered itself to some sudden temptation a yes that is what i mean q you are convinced then that the shot was fired from this particular weapon a it seems reasonable to conclude so q why a i had left it with one of the barrels loaded and when i saw it again they had both been discharged q you will swear to the one barrel having been loaded when you left it leaning against the tree a to the best of my belief it was q you will swear to that a no i cannot actually swear to it but i am practically convinced of the fact q did you notice when you took up the gun again if the barrels or barrel were warm a no i never thought of it q dont you think it would have been well if it had occurred to you dont you think you would have done better to leave the gun alone altogether until the police arrived a the witness for the first time exhibiting a little irritability under this catechism i dare say it would have been better i was agitated i tell you and the situation was new to me one doesnt think of the proper thing to do on such an occasion unless one is a lawyer i just took the gun with me and chucked it into the gun room as i passed hating the infernal thing q very natural under the circumstances i am sure now another question the shot was fired you consider from the direction of the road at what distance from the deceased would your knowledge as a sportsman put it a judging roughly i should say about fifteen feet q about the distance that is to say between the tree against which you had leaned your gun and the spot where the body was found a yes q then the inference is that the gun had suddenly been seized by some one from its position fired and replaced where it was a i suppose so q you reached the house you say about and left it again on your way to the copse just as it struck four would you mind telling us how you disposed of the interval a with some temper i was in my own den all the time what on earth has that to do with the matter q everything sir touching on the critical movements of witnesses in a case of this sort matters i wish to ask you for instance if during that interval from to oclock you heard any sound any report like that of a gun being discharged a if i had i should probably have paid no attention to it the sound of a gun is nothing very uncommon with us q i ask you if you were aware of any such sound a not that i can remember mr fyler was an advocate of that old bailey complexion colourless black eyebrowed moist thick rinded whose constant policy it is to provoke hostility in a witness with the object of bullying him for it into submission and self committal with every reason in the present case to respect and none to suspect the deponent his professional habit would nevertheless not permit him to cast his examination in a wholly conciliatory form q now mr kennett i must ask you to be very particular in your replies to the questions i am about to put to you you came upon annie evans i understand shortly after entering the copse and put down your gun with the purpose of speaking to her a with the purpose of lighting a cigarette q but you did speak with her a yes i have said so q you placed your gun against the tree where you afterwards found it a yes q was the deceased then standing near you or further in by the tree where her body was found a she was standing some amazing purport in the question seemed suddenly here to burst upon the witness and he uttered a violent ejaculation great god are you meaning to suggest that i fired the shot myself sensation q i am suggesting nothing of the sort of course will you answer if you please whether after you had put aside your gun she came towards you or you walked towards her a recovering himself with obvious difficulty she came towards me q so as to bring herself within view we will say of any one who might be watching from the road or thereabouts a just possibly she might if the person had come inside the gate q would you mind telling us what was the subject of your brief conversation with the deceased a i asked her what she was doing there q just so and she answered mr kennett a o what one might expect q evasively that is to say a yes q did you twit her possibly with being there for an assignation a something of the sort i might q and she admitted it a of course not laughter q what else would you mind saying a i understood from her that she had come out to escape the company in the kitchen it seemed there had been a row regarding her between cleghorn our butler and the prisoner and she wanted to get away from them both she said that the foreigner had paid her unwelcome attentions and had tried to kiss her for which she had boxed his ears and that ever since she had gone in fear of her life from him sensation i took it more for a joke than a formal complaint and did not suppose her to be serious it did not occur to me that she was really frightened of the man or i should have taken steps for her protection q and that was all a all that was essential q thank you mr kennett i will not trouble you any further witness turned and retired his evidence had yielded something of the unexpected in its incredulous little outburst and in its conclusion as to the first it was patent that counsels object in putting the question which had provoked it was to suggest maddened jealousy as a motive for the crime on the part of some one to whom the girls actions had become suddenly visible through her movement towards the witness between whom and herself had possibly occurred some philandering passages such at least from the witnesss own implied admission of a certain freedom in his conversation with the deceased would appear a justifiable assumption his final statement though legally inadmissible inasmuch as it supplied the motive with a name caused a profound stir in court mrs anna bingley housekeeper to sir calvin kennett was the next witness called her evidence repeated in effect what has already been recorded and may be passed over where it was important it was like the other evidence of hearsay and inadmissible jane ketchlove cook to sir calvin gave evidence she had never seen the prisoner till the night of his arrival though she had seen his master once or twice on the occasion of former visits he the baron had not at those times come accompanied by any gentleman mr cabanis made himself quite at home like he was a very lively talkative person and easily excited she thought he showed himself very forward with the ladies and they remarked on it though putting it down to his foreign breeding on the night of his arrival the valet went up to lay out his masters things about seven oclock shortly afterwards annie followed him with the hot water she witness rather wondered over the girls assurance in going alone after the way the man had been acting towards her he had seemed like one struck of a heap with her beauty for the poor creature was beautiful there was no denying it it was as if he claimed her for his own from the first moment of his seeing her and dared any one to say him nay a few minutes later annie came down red with fury over his having tried to kiss her she had boxed his ears well for him she said mr cleghorn was in the kitchen and he flew into a fury when he heard he said she must have encouraged the man or he never would have dared he was a great admirer of annie himself and it was always said among us that they would come to make a match of it annie answered up asking him what business it was of his and there was a fine row between the two in the middle this cabanis came down his cheek was red as fire and he looked like a devil he said no one had ever struck him man woman or child without living to repent it he and mr cleghorn got at it then and the rest of us had a hard ado to part them but we got things quiet after a time though it was only for a time mr cleghorn having to go upstairs upset as he was they simmered like and came on the boil again the next day at dinner in the servants hall annie was not there and that seemed to give them the chance to settle things in her absence mr cleghorn began it insisting on his prior claim to the girl and cabanis answered that if he couldnt have her nobody else should he would see her dead first that led to a struggle ending in blows between them and at the last cabanis broke away declaring he was going out then and there to find the girl and put the question to her q what question a whether it was to be himself or mr cleghorn sir q did he utter any threat against the girl in case her choice was against him a not in so many words sir but we were all terrified by his look and manner q they struck you as meaning business eh a that was it sir q about what time was that a as near as possible to two oclock q and mr cleghorn followed a after waiting a bit sir to recover himself then he got up sudden saying he was going to see this thing through and putting on his cap and coat out he went q at what time was that a it may have been ten minutes after the other q did you form any conclusion as to what he meant by seeing the thing through a we all thought he meant sir that he was going to follow cabanis and get the girl herself to choose between them q when did you see him again a it was at half after four when as some of us stood waiting and shivering at the head of the path he came amongst us q in his cap and overcoat a yes sir just as he had gone out we told him what had happened q and how did he take it a very bad sir he turned that white i thought he would have fallen q and when did the prisoner return a it may have been five oclock when i saw him come in q did his manner then show any signs of agitation or disturbance a no sir i cant say it did on the contrary he seemed cheerful and relieved as if he had got something off his mind q did you tell him what had happened a yes to be sure q and how did he take it a very quiet sort of stunned like q did he make any remark a he said something in his own language sir very deep and hoarse it sounded like but i really cant manage it m le baron interposing it was non non par piti counsel tartly i shall be obliged sir if you will keep your evidence till it is asked for m le baron admitted his error with a bow q was that all a one of the maids told him sir that his master was asking for him and he went off at once without another word q and he has never referred to the subject since a he would not talk of it it was too horrible he said jessie ellis parlour maid and a couple of house maids they kept no male indoor servants except the butler at wildshott kate vokes and mabel wheelband gave corroborative evidence substantiating in all essential particulars the last witnesss statement reuben henstridge landlord of the red deer inn was the next witness summoned he was a big cloddish fellow unprepossessing in appearance and reluctant and unwilling in his answers as though surlily suspecting some design to ensnare him into compromising himself he deposed that on the afternoon of the crime he was out on the hill somewhere below his inn taking the air when he saw a man break through the lower beech thicket skirting wildshott and go down quickly towards the high road that man was the prisoner he parted the branches savage like and jumped the bank and trench moving his arms and talking to himself all the time witness went on with his business of taking the air and when he had had enough returned to his own premises later mr cleghorn whom he knew very well as a casual customer came in for a glass he did not look himself and stayed only a short time and that was the whole he knew of the matter q what time of day was it when you saw the prisoner come from the wood a ten after two it might be q and he went down towards the road a aye q did you notice what became of him a no i didnt i had my own concerns to look after q taking the air eh a thats it q you werent taking it with a wire i suppose laughter a no i werent you keep a civil tongue in your head the witness called sharply to order by the coroner stood glowering and muttering q where is your inn situated a top o stockford down q how far is it from the high road a call it a mile and a half q where were you on the hill when you saw the prisoner a nigher the road than the inn three quarters way down say q were you anywhere near the prisoner when he emerged a nigh as close as i am to you q did he see you a no he didnt i were hid in the ditch laughter q you didnt recognise him a not likely id never seen him before q did anything strike you in his manner or expression a he looked uncommon wild q did he now what time was it when you started to return to your inn a it may have been an hour later q a little after three say a aye q did you pass anybody by the way a no q the red deer is very lonely situated is it not a lonely enough q high up at the meeting of four cross roads i understand a thats it q you dont have many customers in the course of a day a maybe maybe not q not so many that you would forget this one or that having called yesterday or the day before a what are you trying to get at q i must trouble you to answer questions not put them what time was it on that day when mr cleghorn looked in a put it at four oclock q and you thought he looked unwell a he said himself he was feeling out of sorts the liquor seemed to pull him round a bit q did he say anything else a not much he went as soon amost as hed drunk it down i thought hed tired himself walking up the hill q what made you think that a i seed him acoming when he was far off i was crossing the yard to the pump at the time that might have been at a quarter before four he looked as if hed pulled his cap over his eyes and turned his coat collar up but i couldnt make him out distinct q how did you know then that it was mr cleghorn a because he come in himself a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes later who else could it be q what sort of coat and hat or cap was this figure wearing a what i see when mr cleghorn come in of course same as hes got now q colour style the same in every particular a thats it q you made out the figure in the distance to be wearing a coat and cloth cap like mr cleghorns a natrally as it were mr cleghorn himself q now attend to me will you swear you could distinguish the colour of the coat and cap the figure was wearing a i wont go so far as to say that it were a dull day and my eyesight none of the best and he were too far off and down in the shadder of the hollers he looked all one colour to me a sort o misty purple but i knew him for mr cleghorn sure enough when he walked into the tap q wonderfully sagacious of you laughter how far away was this figure when you saw it a couple o hundred yards maybe q was it climbing the hill fast a what you might call fast hurrying q didnt it strike you as odd then that it should take it a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes to cover that short distance between the spot where you saw it and your inn a no it didnt i didnt think about it mr cleghorn he might have stopped to rest himself or to tie a bootlace or anything q after seeing the figure did you return to the bar a no i went into the parlour to make tea q and remained there till mr cleghorn entered a thats it counsel nodded across at the detective as if to say heres possible matter for you sergeant and with that he closed the examination and told the witness he might stand down samuel cleghorn butler to sir calvin was then called to give evidence witness appeared as a substantial well nourished man of forty with a full rather unexpressive face a fixed eye literally and a large bald tonsure not at all the sort of figure one would associate with a romantic story of passion and mystery he admitted his quarrel with the prisoner pleading excessive provocation and that he had followed him out on the fatal afternoon with the intention actually suggested by the witness ketchlove he had failed however to discover him or the direction in which he had gone and had ultimately after some desultory prying about the grounds withdrawn himself to the upper kitchen gardens where he had taken refuge in a tool shed and there remained nursing his sorrow until or thereabouts when feeling still very overcome he had decided to go up to the red deer for a little refreshment which he had done afterwards returning straight to the house q how did you leave the kitchen garden a by a door in the wall sir giving on the downs and by that way i returned q during all this time while you were looking for the prisoner or mourning in the tool shed laughter did you encounter any one a not a soul that i can remember sir q you were greatly attached to the deceased a with emotion i was q and wished to make her your wife a yes q though your acquaintance with her extended over only a couple of months a that is so q almost a case of love at first sight eh a as you choose sir q did she return your attachment a not as i could have wished q she refused you a i never offered myself to her in so many words q had you reason to suspect a rival a none in particular till the frenchman came q rivals generally then a naturally there were many to admire her q but no one in especial to excite your jealousy a no q did the deceased give you her confidence a not what you might call her confidence we were very friendly q she never spoke to you of her past life or of her former situations or of her relations a no never she was not what you might call a communicative young woman q you had no reason to suspect that she was carrying on with anybody unknown to you a no reason sir i cant answer for my thoughts q what do you mean by that a why i might have wondered now and again why she was so obstinate in resisting me q but you suspected no rival in particular i ask you again a a man may think things q will you answer my question a well then i didnt q are you speaking the truth a yes witness was subjected to some severe cross questioning on this point but persisted in his refusal to associate his suspicions with any particular person he argued only negatively he said from the deceaseds indifference to himself which he declared amid some laughter was utterly incomprehensible to him on any other supposition than that of a previous attachment counsel then continued q when after leaving the garden you were making for the red deer did you observe any other figure on the hill going in the same direction as yourself but in advance of you a there may have been i wont answer for sure q will you explain what you mean by that a i was what you might call preoccupied not thinking much of anything but my own trouble but yes i have an idea there was some one q how was he dressed a i cant say sir i never looked its only a hazy sort of impression q was he far ahead a he may have been very far or perhaps it was only the shadows i shouldnt like to swear there was any one at all q you have heard the witness henstridges evidence are you sure you are not borrowing from it the idea of this second figure a sort of simulacrum of yourself a well i may be unconscious as it were i cant state anything for certain q were you walking fast as you got near the inn a i dare say i was fast for me laughter what with one thing and another my throat was as dry as tinder q did you stop or linger for any purpose when approaching the inn a not that i can remember i may have what happened afterwards has put all that out of my head q you mean the news awaiting you on your return a yes q so that you cant tell me i suppose whether or not as you climbed the hill your coat collar was turned up and the peak of your cap pulled down a its like enough they were i had put the things on anyhow in my hurry but its all a vague memory counsel very well you can stand down daniel groome gardener was next called he stated that he was sweeping up leaves in the drive to the east side of the house that is to say the side furthest from the copse on the afternoon of the murder had heard the stable clock strike three and shortly afterwards had seen the young master come out of the head of the bishops walk and go towards the house which he entered by the front door he was looking he thought in a bit of a temper but the young master was like that all in a stew one moment over a little thing and the next laughing and joking over something that mattered had wondered at seeing him back so soon from the shooting but supposed he had shot wild as he sometimes would and was in a pet about it did not see him again until he witness was summoned to the copse to help remove the body q during the time you were sweeping in the drive did you hear the sound of a shot a amany sir the gentlemen was out with their guns q did any one shot sound to you nearer than the others a one sounded pretty loud q as if comparatively close by a yes it might be q from the direction of the bishops walk a i couldnt rightly say sir it wasnt a carrying day sounds on such a day travel very deceptive it might have come from across the road or further q at what time did you hear this particular shot a it might have been three oclock or a little later i couldnt be sure q think again a no i couldnt be sure sir i shouldnt like to swear q might it have been nearer half past three a very like i dare say it might this point was urged but the witness persisted in refusing to commit himself to any more definite statement john tugwood coachman edward noakes groom and martha jolly lodge keeper were called and examined on the same subject they had all distinguished or thought they had distinguished the louder shot in question but their evidence as to its precise time was so hopelessly contradictory that no reliance whatever could be placed on it sergeant detective ridgway deposed that having been put in charge of the case by sir calvin kennett he had proceeded to make an examination of the spot where the body had been found this was some twenty four hours after the commission of the alleged crime and it might be thought possible that certain local changes had occurred during the interval he understood however that the police had when first called in conducted an exhaustive investigation of the place and that their conclusions differed in no material degree from his own so that he was permitted to speak for them in the few details he had to place before the jury briefly his notes comprised the following observations the measured distance from the wicket in the boundary hedge to the tree against which the witness mr hugo kennett had stated that he rested his gun was nineteen and a quarter yards thence to the beech tree by which the body had been found was another fifteen feet between the wicket and the first tree there was a curve in the track sufficient to conceal from any one standing by the second or inner tree the movements of one approaching from the direction of the gate all about this part of the copse down to the hedge was very dense thicket which in one place in close proximity to the first tree supporting the gun bore some tokens as of a person having been concealed there if such were the case the movements of the person in question had been presumably stealthy the growth showing only slight signs of disturbance not easily detected his theory was that this person had entered possibly by the gate from the road had crept along the path or track until he had caught a glimpse through the trees of the deceased in conversation with mr kennett had then slipped into the undergrowth and silently worked his way to the point of concealment first mentioned where he would be both eye and ear witness of what was passing between the two and had subsequently whether torn by the passion of revenge or of jealousy issued noiselessly forth some few minutes after mr kennetts departure seized up the gun and either at once or following a brief altercation shot the deceased dead as she was moving to escape from him conformably with this theory there was no sign of any struggle having occurred but there were signs that the murderer had moved and conducted himself with great caution and circumspection unfortunately no evidence as to footprints could be adduced the ground being in too hard and dry a state to record their impression finally he was bound to say that there was nothing in his theory incompatible with the assumption that the prisoner was the one responsible for the deed on the other hand it was true that the mans movements between the time when the witness henstridge had seen him descending towards the road and the time of the commission of the crime which could not have been earlier than three oclock had still to be accounted for but it was possible of course that he had occupied this interval of three quarters of an hour in stalking and in finally running to earth his victim if he could produce witnesses to prove the contrary the theory of course collapsed the sergeant delivered his statement with a hard clear cut precision which was in curious and rather deadly contrast with the nervous hesitation displayed by other witnesses there was a suggestion about him of the expert surgeon demonstrating knife in hand above the operating table and in a voice as keen and cold as his blade raymond baron le sage was the next witness called it was noticed once or twice during the course of the barons evidence that the prisoner looked as if reproachfully and imploringly toward his master q the prisoner is your servant a he is my servant q since when will you tell me a he has been in my service now over a year q you took him with a good character a an excellent character q he is a gascon i believe a yes a gascon q a hot blooded and vindictive race is it not a a warm blooded people certainly q practising the vendetta a you surprise me q i am asking you for information a i have none to give you q very well we will leave it at that on the afternoon of the murder about half past two you entered the bishops walk a i had been out driving with miss kennett and passing the gate asked her wither it led she told me and i decided to go by the path leaving her to drive on to the house alone q why did you so decide a i had caught a glimpse among the trees of as i thought the maid annie evans and i wished to speak with her q indeed counsel was evidently a little taken aback over the frankness of this admission would you inform me on what subject a i had been accidental witness the night before of the scrimmage between her and louis already referred to and i wished at once to apologise to her for louiss behaviour and to warn her against any repetition of the punishment she had inflicted q on what grounds a on the grounds that the man being quick tempered and impulsive i would not answer for the consequences of another such assault sensation q and what was the deceaseds answer a she thanked me and said she could look after herself q anything further a nothing i went on and joined my friend sir calvin in the house q the deceased while you were with her offered no sort of explanation of her presence in the copse a none whatever q and you did not seek one a o dear no i should not have been so foolish laughter q did you speak to the prisoner on the subject of the assault a at the time yes q and what did you gather from his answer a i gathered that in his quick ardent way he was very much enamoured of the girls beauty q and was correspondingly incensed perhaps over her rejection of his advances a not incensed saddened q he uttered no threat a no q on the afternoon of the murder on your return to the house as just described you inquired for the prisoner a i inquired for him then and again later on our return from the copse after we had been to view the body q you were troubled about him perhaps a i was uneasy until i had seen and questioned him q when was that a he came in about five oclock and was immediately sent up to me q you asked him perhaps to account for his absence a i did q and what was his explanation a he made a frank confession of his quarrel with mr cleghorn described how his first intention on rushing from the house had really been to find the girl and throw himself upon her mercy but how once in the open air his frenzy had begun to cool and to yield itself presently to indecision he had then he said gone for a long walk over the downs fighting all the way the demon of rage and jealousy which possessed him and had finally getting the better of his black unreasoning mood grown thoroughly repentant and ashamed of his behaviour and had returned to make amends q and you credited that wonderful story a i believed it implicitly q well indeed sir did he appear overcome by the news which had greeted him on his return a he appeared stupefied that is the word q did he comment on it at all a if you mean in the self incriminating sense he did not q in what sense then a he cursed the assassin capable of destroying so sweet a paragon of womanhood laughter q very disinterested of him im sure thank you sir that will suffice counsel sitting down mr redstall for sir calvin rose to put a question or two to the witness q you have never had reason m le baron to regard the prisoner as a vindictive man a never impulsive yes q and truthful a transparently so to a childish degree q he would have a difficulty in dissembling a an insuperable difficulty i should think dr harding of longbridge was the last witness called he deposed to his having been summoned to the house on the afternoon of the murder and to having examined the body within an hour and a half of its first discovery in the copse the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the back from a weapon fired at short range practically the whole of the charge had entered the body in one piece death must have been instantaneous and must have occurred from the indications some two hours before his arrival or approximately at about oclock the wound could not possibly have been self inflicted and the position of the gun precluded any thought of accident he had since assisted by dr liversidge of winton made a post mortem examination of the body asked if there was anything significant in the deceaseds condition his answer was yes this completed the evidence at the conclusion of which and of some remarks by the coroner the jury after a brief consultation among themselves brought in a verdict that the deceased died from a gunshot wound deliberately inflicted by the prisoner louis victor cabanis in a fit of revengeful passion which verdict amounting to one of wilful murder the prisoner was forthwith on the coroners warrant committed to the county gaol there to await his examination before the magistrates on the capital charge the jury further being local men added a rider to their verdict respectfully commiserating sir calvin on the very unpleasant business which had chosen to select his grounds for its enactment and with that the proceedings terminated chapter x afterwards the inquest was over the provisional verdict delivered and all that remained for the time being was to put the poor subject of it straightway to rest under the leafless trees in leighway churchyard it was done quietly and decently the morning after the inquiry with some of her fellow servants attending and miss kennett to represent the family and so was another blossom untimely fallen and another moral a somewhat ghastly one now furnished for the reproof of the too hilarious christian audrey coming back from the sad little ceremony met le sage walking by himself in the grounds the baron looked serious and she thought dejected and her young heart warmed to his grief she went up to him and putting her hands on his sleeve i am so sorry she said so very very sorry he smiled at her kindly then took her hand and drew it under his arm let us walk a little way and talk he said and they strolled on together poor louis he sighed it is not true is it baron i dont think it is my dear but the difficulty is to prove that it isnt how can it be done at the expense only i am afraid of finding the real criminal have you any idea who that is he laughed actually laughed aloud have i not had enough of cross examination i could not help wondering why as i have been told you confessed to the warning you gave the poor girl about the danger of tempting hot blood and so forth yes that it was the truth yes but he put a finger to his lips glancing at her with some solemnity you were not going to say that it is my way to repress the truth no answered the girl with a little flush but only not to blurt it out unnecessarily my dear he said take my word for it that i always speak the truth o i only meant to say she began but he stopped her what would you do if a question were put to you which for some reason of expediency or good feeling you did not wish to answer i am afraid i should fib try my plan and answer it with another question it saves a world of responsibility that is a secret i confide to you an answer may often be interpreted into an innuendo which is as false to the speakers meaning as it is unjust to its subject i love truth so much that i would not expose it to that misunderstanding in this instance to have left the truth for some one else to discover might have cast suspicion on us both thereby darkening the case against louis but in general not to answer is surely not to lie no i suppose not baron she thought a little i wonder if you would answer me just one question what is that do you put any faith in that talk about there having been another man on the hill besides cleghorn he did not reply for awhile but went softly patting the hand on his arm presently he looked up if i were to say yes i should not speak the truth and if i were to say no i should not speak the truth so i follow my bent and you will not be offended with me are you going to take me for a drive to day i ask certainly if you wish it what a question i can answer that without a scruple i wish it with such fervour seeing my companion as my years may permit themselves where shall we go you shall choose very well then we will go north by the downs that we may take the great free air into our lungs and realise the more sympathetically the condition of my poor louis o dont it would kill me to be in prison baron you are going to stop with us are you not until the trial is over both you and your father are very good i may have however to absent myself for a short time presently we will see in the meanwhile i am your grateful baron he took vast snuff making his eyes glisten and somehow she liked him for it i shall be glad she said when that detective goes one will feel more at peace from the squalor of it all he shook his head i do not think he means to go just yet not why not ah that is his secret but what can he have to do now you must ask him not me all i can tell you is that he considers his work here not yet finished in fact from words i heard him let fall to your father this morning little more than just begun how very strange what can it mean let us hazard a conjecture that he is not wholly satisfied with the evidence against my louis it would be a happy thought for me o yes wouldnt it but i wonder what do you wonder if the question of that other figure on the hill is puzzling him too le sage laughed well we are permitted to wonder he said and humming a little tune changed the subject to one of topography and the situation of various places of interest in the neighbourhood audrey was perplexed about him that he felt and felt deeply not only the unhappy position of the prisoner but the disturbance which he himself had been the innocent means of introducing into the house she could not doubt yet the patent genuineness of this sentiment was unable it seemed wholly to deprive him of that constitutional serenity even gaiety habitual to his nature it was as if he either could not or would not realise the black gravity of the affair as if almost holding the strings of it in his own hands he could afford to give this or that puppet a little tether before reining it in to submit to his direction and then she thought how this impression was probably all due to that unanswering trick of his which they had just been discussing and which might very well seem to inform his manner with a significance it did not really possess or intend she left him shortly being called to some duty in the house and he continued his saunter alone an aimless one apparently but gradually after a time assuming a definite direction it took him leisurely down the drive out by the lodge gates into the road as far as the fatal wicket and so once more into the bishops walk going unhurried along the track he suddenly saw the detective before him the sergeant bent over it seemed in an intent observation of the ground was fairly taken off his guard he showed it as he came erect in a momentary change of colour but the little shock of surprise was mastered as soon as felt self possession is not long or easily yielded by one trained in self resourcefulness were you wanting me sir he said because if not because if not took up the baron wagging his head cheerfully what am i doing here interrupting you at your business well sir its you have said it not i so your business is not yet over sergeant am i to borrow any hope for my man from that was it the question sir you were looking for me to answer excellent my own way of meeting an awkward inquiry what do you mean by awkward why you wont answer me of course what sensible detective would and give away his case still i am justified in assuming that there is something in the business which so far does not satisfy you and i build on that o you do do you he rubbed his chin grittily pulling down his well formed lower jaw and stood for a moment or two speculatively regarding the face before him i wonder now he said suddenly if you would answer a question i might put to you ill see my friend chance it what made you so interested in this business before even your man was charged on suspicion you allude i allude to my finding you already on the spot here when i came down to make my own examination of it surely i have no reason to hide what i have already admitted in public i was uneasy about louis and wanted to look and see perhaps if hed left any evidences of his guilt behind him i admit i was anxious to assure myself that there were no such evidences and you did assure yourself quite you found nothing suspicious nothing whatever to connect with his presence here found nothing at all yes i did i found this the baron took from a pocket a common horn coat button and handed it to the other who received it and turned it over in silence i picked it up said le sage near the tree where the gun had stood why said the detective looking up rather blackly didnt you produce this at the inquest i never supposed for the moment it could be of any importance hmph grunted the sergeant and after a darkling moment put the button into his own pocket i dont know it may or may not be but you should have told me about it sir for the present by your leave ill take charge of the thing and now if youve nothing more to show me nothing then i should like to get on with my work if its all the same to you and i with my walk said the baron and he tripped jauntily away chapter xi the baron drives from the bickerdike ms on the day following the inquest the plot thickened it became really entertaining one did not know whether to appear the more scandalised or amused on the one hand there was a certain satisfaction in knowing that the last word was apparently not said in what had seemed to be a perfectly straightforward affair on the other ones sense of fitness had received a severe blow in short the impeccable cleghorn had been arrested and was detained on suspicion i saw him go off in a fly in charge of a couple of policemen and never did hooked cod fish on the dogger bank look more gogglingly stupefied than he over the amazing behaviour of the bait he had swallowed sir calvin stormed and blasphemed and demanded to know if the whole household of wildshott was in a conspiracy to shame him and tarnish his escutcheon but his objurgations were received very civilly and sensibly by the detective who explained that he must act according to his professional conscience that detention did not necessarily mean conviction or even indictment and that where a sifting of the truth from the chaff imposed precautionary measures he must be free to take them or abandon his conduct of the case whereon the wrathful general simmered down and contented himself only with requesting sarcastically a few hours grace to settle his affairs when it came to be his turn to wear the official bracelets and so for the while we were without a butler nor could one on reviewing the evidence be altogether surprised perhaps over that deprivation certainly cleghorns account of his own movements could not be considered wholly satisfying or convincing and he had admitted his lack of any witness to substantiate it it seemed incredible with a man of his substance and dignity but is not the history of crime full of such apparent contradictions after all he had had the same provocation as the other man and had departed apparently the same way to answer it and as to his moral condition after the event all testimony went to prove that it was worse than that of the gascon anyhow this new development however it was destined to turn out added fifty per cent to the excitement of the business cleghorn it seemed inexpressibly comic as day followed day succeeding this terrific event however progressively other things might be assumed to be moving no ground was made in the matter of tracing out the dead girls origin or connexions and that in spite of the publicity given to the affair it was very strange and i was immensely curious to know what could be the reason her portrait was published in the police gazette and exhibited outside the various stations but without result i saw a copy of it and did not wonder it had been reproduced enlarged it seemed from a tiny snapshot group taken by one of the grooms in which she had figured quite inconspicuously and was like nothing human i spoke to ridgway about it and he said it was the best that could be done that no other photograph of her could be traced though all the photographers in london had been applied to and he owned frankly that there seemed some mystery about the girl i quite agreed with him and hinted that it was not the only one that remained to be cleared up he did not ask me what i meant but i saw by his next remark that he had understood what was in my mind why dont you persuade him sir he said to throw this business off his chest and get back to his old interests he takes it too much to heart it was to hugo he referred of course and i did not pretend to misapprehend him to tell the truth i was a little smarting from my friends treatment of me and not in the mood to be indulgent of his idiosyncrasies i might have my suspicions as to his involvement in a discreditable affair but i had certainly not made him a party to them or even touched upon the subject of the scandal to him save with the utmost delicacy and consideration if he had chosen to give me his confidence then and there i would have honoured it as it was since he showed no disposition to keep his promise to me made on the day of the shoot i considered myself as much at liberty to canvass the subject as any one else who had heard and formed his own conclusions from the doctors evidence it was true that to me at least hugh was doing his best to give his case away by his behaviour he seemed to make little attempt to rally from the gloom with which the tragedy had overcast him but mooned about silent and aimless as if for the moment he had lost all interest in life it was only that morning that moved by his condition i had come at last to the resolution to remind him of his promise and get him to share with me if he would the burden that was crushing his soul his answer showed me at once however the vanity of my good intentions thanks old fellow he had said but a good deal has happened since then and ive nothing to confide now that might be true in the sense that the danger was past and i could have forgiven his reticence on the score of the loyalty it might imply to a reputation passed beyond its own defence but he went on with some offensive remark about his regret in not being able to satisfy my curiosity and ended with a suggestion which however well meaning it might have been i considered positively insulting you are wasting yourself here old boy he said im not truth to tell in the mood for much and we oughtnt to keep you i feel that i got you here under false pretences but i couldnt know what was going to happen could i and so i wont apologise i think i really think that for the sake of all our feelings it would be better if you terminated your visit you dont mind my saying so do you on the contrary i mind very much i answered have you forgotten how at considerable inconvenience to myself i responded at once to your invitation and came down at a moments notice the reason as you ought to know hugh was pure regard for yourself and a desire to help and that desire is not lessened because i find you involved in a much more serious business than i had anticipated o if you put it in that way he began i do put it in that way i said and i dont take it very friendly of you that you should talk of denying me a privilege which you were ready enough to grant to that precious new baron of yours even pressing him to stay it was not i who asked him he murmured no i insisted i came to be helpful and i am going to remain to be helpful i dont leave you till i have seen this thing through well he said very equivocally i hope that will be soon and he left me to myself to brood over his ingratitude i was sore with him i confess and my grievance made me more unguarded perhaps in my references to him than otherwise i should have been i dare say he does i answered the detective but after all i suppose it is his heart that is affected he looked at me keenly you mean sir o what you mean i answered and that i can see that you mean whats the good of our beating about the bush my friend wouldnt be the first young fellow of his class to have got into trouble with a good looking servant girl no he said no in a hard sort of way they are not the kind to bother about the consequences to others where their own gratification is concerned ive knocked up against some pretty bad cases in my time so thats what you gather from the medical report partly from that not wholly ah i dare say now being on such friendly terms with mr kennett youve been taken into his confidence not directly but in a way that invited me to form my own conclusions what then it doesnt affect this case does it except in suggesting a possible motive for the crime on the part of some jealous rival thats it its of no consequence of course except to the girl herself from any other point of view his assurance satisfied me and taken by his sympathetic candour i could not refrain from opening my rankling mind to him a bit the truth is i said that the moment i came down i saw there was something wrong with my friend indeed he had written to me to imply as much he was upset like was he commented the detective he was in a very odd mood said i an aggravated form of hysteria i should call it i had never known him quite like it before though as i dare say you have gathered his temperament is an excitable one up and down like a see saw he talked of his dreaming of sitting on a gunpowder barrel smoking a cigarette and of the hell of an explosion that was coming and then there was his behaviour at the shoot the next day ive heard something about it said ridgway queer wasnt it more than queer i answered i dont mind telling you in confidence that i had reason at one time to suspect him of playing the fool with his gun with the half intention you know an accident and all the bother ended he swore not when i tackled him about it but i wasnt satisfied i tried to get him to go home leaving his gun with the keeper but he absolutely refused and he refused again to part with it when in the afternoon he finally did leave us saying he was good for nothing and had had enough of it if only then he had done what i wanted him to do and left his gun behind this wretched business might never have happened ah said the detective he feels that i dare say and it doesnt help to cheer him up well sir id get him out if i was you distract his thoughts and make him forget himself he wont mend whats done by moping all very well i answered to talk about making him forget himself but when im forced to affect an ignorance of the very thing he wants to forget if were right what am i to do you might think that after having had me down for the express purpose of advising him as i have no doubt was the case in this scrape he would take me more into his confidence and not at least resent as seemingly he does any allusion to it well you see said the detective from his point of view the scrapes ended for him and so there isnt the same need for advice but id keep at it if i was you and after a time you may get him to unburden himself i had not much hope after what had passed between us but i held the sergeants recommendation in mind and resolved to watch for and encourage the least disposition to candour which might show itself on my friends part perhaps i had gone a little further than i should have in taking the detective into my confidence about a scandal which after all was no more than surmise but it was so patent to me that his judgment ran and must run with my own that it would have been simply idle to pretend ignorance of a situation about which no two men of intelligence could possibly have come to differing conclusions and moreover as ridgway himself had admitted true or not the incident had no direct bearing on the case these days at wildshott otherwise a little eventless for me as an outsider found a certain mitigation of their dullness in the suspicion still kept alive in me regarding the barons movements and in the consequent watchfulness i felt it my duty to keep on them i dont know how it was but i mistrusted the man his secretiveness the company he kept the mystery surrounding his being who was he why did he play chess for half crowns why had he come attended as according to evidence never before by a ruffianly foreign man servant ready on the most trifling provocation to dip his hands in blood that had been outside the programme no doubt men who use dangerous tools must risk their turning in their hands but what had been his purpose in bringing the fellow throat cutting robbery i was prepared for any revelation abduction perhaps the baron was for ever driving about the country with audrey in the little governess cart in the meanwhile following that miscarriage of his masters plans whatever they might be mr louis victor cabanis had been had up before a full bench of magistrates and the police asking for time in which to compact their evidence had been remanded to prison for a fortnight the delay gave some breathing space for all concerned and was i think welcomed by every one but hugo i dont know by what passion of hatred of the slayer my friends soul might have been agitated perhaps it was that perhaps mere nervous tension but he appeared to be in a feverish impatience to get the business over he did not say much about it but one could judge by his look and manner the strained torment of his spirit we were not a great deal together and mostly i had to make out my time alone as best i could sometimes in a rather pathetic way he would go and play chess with his father a thing he had never dreamed of doing in his normal state i used to wonder if the general had guessed the truth and how he was regarding it if he had according to all accounts he had been no puritan himself in his younger days i have said that audrey and the baron were about a good deal together they were and the knowledge troubled me so much that i made up my mind to warn her you appear to find his company very entertaining i said to her one day audrey had a rather disconcerting way of responding to any unwelcome question with a wide eyed stare which it was difficult to undergo quite stoically do i she said presently why you would hardly favour it so much otherwise would you perhaps not you see i take the best there is i cant help it if the choice is so limited thats one for me but never mind im content he should do the entertaining if i can do the helpful to me mr bickerdike i hope so a little as hugos friend i feel that i ought to have some claim on your forbearance not to say your good will i think at least that on the strength of that friendship you need not resent my giving you a word of advice on a subject where in my opinion its wanted i have a father and brother to look after me mr bickerdike im aware of it audrey and also of the fact that for reasons sufficient of their own no doubt they leave you pretty much as you like to go your own way it may be an unexceptionable way for the most part but the wisest of us may occasionally go wrong from ignorance and then it is the duty i dare say the thankless duty of friendship to interpose you are very young you know and one cant help seeing rather forlornly situated will you please to leave my situation alone and explain what this is all about frankly then i offer this in confidence i dont think the baron very good company for you why not its a little difficult to say if you had more knowledge of the world you would understand perhaps theres an air about him of the shady continental adventurer whose purpose in society wherever he may seek it is never a disinterested purpose hes always one may be sure after something profitable to himself in one word spoil what do we any of us know about the baron except that he plays chess for money and consorts with doubtful characters your father knows i believe little more than i do and that little for me is summed up in the word suspect one cant say what can be his object in staying on here when common decency one would have thought seeing the trouble he has been instrumental in causing should have dictated his departure but whatever his object it is not likely one feels convinced to be a harmless one and one cannot help fearing that he may be practising on your young credulity with a view to furthering it in some way i wish you would tell me will you what he talks to you about she laughed in a way which somehow nettled me doesnt it strike you she said as rather cheek on the part of one guest in a house to criticize the behaviour of another to his hostess o if you take it in that way i answered greatly affronted ive nothing more to say your power of reading character is no doubt immensely superior to mine well i dont think yours is very good she answered and i dont see why the question of common decency should apply to him more than to another dont you i said now fairly in a rage then its useless to prolong the discussion further this is the usual reward of trying to interpose for good in other peoples affairs some people might call it prying into them she answered and i flung from her without another word i felt that i really hated the girl intolerable pert audacious young minx but my rebuff made me more determined than ever to sift the truth out of this questionable riddle and face her insolent assurance with it at the proper time chapter xii the baron walks from the bickerdike ms i was still in this resolved mood when something happened one night which confirmed my worst suspicions showing me how faithfully i had weighed and measured the character of the man posing as a benevolent guest in the house the hospitality of which he was designing all the time in some mysteriously villainous way to abuse on that night i had gone to bed rather late outstaying in fact the entire family and household whose early country ways my degenerate london habits found sometimes rather irksome it was past midnight when i turned out the lights in the billiard room and taking a candle made my way upstairs there was a double flight rising from a pretty spacious hall and both the barons room and my own gave upon the corridor which opened west from the first floor landing as i passed his door i noticed that a thread of light showed under it proving him to be either still awake or fallen asleep with his candle unextinguished which for some unaccountable reason a thrill of excitement overtook me no sound came from behind the door the whole house was dead quiet i stooped to peer through the keyhole a naked light burning beside ones bed is a dangerous thing but the key being in the lock prevented my seeing anything soft footed i went on but not to sleep i determined to sit up and listen in my own room for any possible developments i dont know why it was but my heart misgave me that there was some rascality afoot and that i had only to wait patiently and go warily to unmask it and i was not mistaken time passed enough to assure the watcher at last of my being long in bed and asleep when i was aware of a stealthy sound in the corridor all my blood leaped and tingled to the shock of it i stole and put my ear to my own keyhole and at once the nature of the sound was made clear to me he had noiselessly opened his door and come out into the passage down which he was stealthily creeping in a direction away from me i dont know how i recognized all this but there is a language in profound stillness when silence is at its deathliest one can hear almost the way the earth is moving on its axis i waited until i felt that he had turned the corner to the stairs then with infinite care manipulated a fraction at a time the handle of my own door and slipping off my pumps emerged and followed hardly breathing in pursuit at the opening to the stairs i paused discreetly to give my quarry law and with sovereign caution peered round the corner and saw him he was in his pyjamas and carried an electric torch in his hand reminding me somehow thus attired of the actor pellissier only a little squatter in his build he descended soundlessly throwing the little beam of light before him and reaching the foot of the flight turned to his left at the moment that i withdrew my head but i could see from my eyrie the way he was going by the course of the travelling light and i believed that he was making for sir calvins study and the next moment there came to my ears the tiniest confirmatory sound the minute bat like screak of a rusty door handle i had noticed that very day how the one in question needed oiling and the evidence left me no longer in doubt it was for the study he was bound and with what sinister purpose that remained to see but i remembered the hidden safe in the room i had happened upon it once when left alone there a minute i paused to allow him time to settle to his business then descended the stairs cat footed at the newel post crowned with a great carved wyvern the kennett device i stood to reconnoitre pressing my face to the wood and looking round it with one eye and at once i perceived that i neither could nor need venture further he stood sure enough at the desk in the study fairly revealed in the diffused glow from his torch whose little brilliant facula was turned upon a litter of papers that lay before him but the door of the room he had left it so in his fancied security stood wide open precluding any thought of a closer espionage on my part i could only stay where i was concentrating all my vision on the event suddenly he seemed to find what he sought and i saw a paper in his hand something appeared to tell me at the same moment that he was about to return and i yielded and judging discretion for the occasion to be the better part of valour went up the stairs on my hands and feet as fast as i could paddle in a soft hurry to regain my room and extinguish the light before so much as the ghost of a suspicion could occur to him it would not have served my purpose to face him then and there and i had learnt as much as for the time being i needed to have detected our worthy friend in a secret midnight raid on his hosts papers was proof damning enough of the correctness of my judgment listening intently i heard him re enter his room as he had left it with supreme caution i was feeling a good deal agitated and the moisture stood on my forehead how was i to proceed what course to take my decision was not reached until after much debating within myself it might be guided by the generals chance assertion that some important document had been lost or mislaid in his room in which case i must act at once but if on the other hand he made no such statement it might very well be days or weeks before his loss were brought home to him in that event i would say nothing about my discovery trusting to lead the criminal on through his sense of immunity to further depredations by then i might have acquired what at present i lacked some insight into the nature and meaning of his designs holding the key to which i could face him with any discovery no i would not tell sir calvin as yet in such a case premature exposure might very easily prove more futile than unsuspicion itself the keystone being wanting all ones structure might fall to pieces at the first test but what a stealthy villain it was as i recovered it was to plume myself a little i confess on my circumventing such a rogue i would have given a good deal to know what was the character of the paper he had stolen hardly a draft for such would not have been left about not to speak of the crude futility of such a deed no there was some more subtle intention behind it blackmail perhaps but it was useless to speculate he had not at least touched the safe and that was so much to be thankful for now i came to my resolution i would speak to sir calvin on the subject when the moment was ripe and not before and then having so far justified my remaining on as his guest i would go in the meanwhile i would make it my especial and individual province to expose this rascal and thereby refute audreys detestable calumny of me as a sort of unpleasant eavesdropper and hanger on perhaps she would learn to regret her insult when she saw in what fashion i had retaliated on it chapter xiii accumulating evidence wednesday of the third week following the inquest was appointed for the magisterial inquiry and during the interval sergeant ridgway was busily occupied presumably in accumulating and piecing together various evidence of what it consisted no one but himself knew nor did it appear whether or not its trend on the whole was favourable or disastrous to the unhappy prisoner at the expense possibly of cleghorn or possibly to the complete exculpation of that injured man the detective kept his own counsel after the manner of his kind and if any had thought to extract from the cover of that sealed book a hint of its contents no reassuring message at least could have been gathered from its unlettered sombreness but nobody asked fearful of being thought to profane the majestic muteness of the oracle and the labouring atmosphere lowered unlightened as the days went on even m le baron most individually concerned in the fate of his henchman made no attempt to plumb the official profundity and that in spite of his curiosity about most things he seemed indeed oddly passive about the whole business never referring to it but indirectly and so far as appeared taking no steps to interview the prisoner or supply him with the means of defence if any sneering allusion was made to this insensibility by mr bickerdike or another audrey were she present would be hot in her friends vindication it may have been that in the course of their queer association he had confided to her sufficient reasons for his behaviour old viv on the other hand saw in her attitude only proof of the process of corruption he had suspected but whatever the case cheerfully detached the baron remained asking no questions of the detective and taking chess and life with as placid a gaiety as if no louis victor cabanis lay caged a few miles away awaiting his examination on a charge of wilful murder whether it were in some apology for a darkness which he could not afford to illuminate or to avoid teasing inquiries or for any other reason the sergeant came gradually to give the house less and less of his company he seemed rather to avoid contact with its inmates and his manner when he rarely appeared was sombre and preoccupied no one perhaps felt this withdrawal more than the house keeper mrs bingley with whom he had been accustomed to take his meals and who had found him when once her awe of his office was overcome a most entertaining guest full of intelligence rich in anecdote and deeply interested in everything appertaining to wildshott from its family portraits and accumulated collections to the beauty of its grounds and of the country in which it lay situated it must have been she said one day to her master to whom she was lamenting the sergeants prolonged absences such a relief to a man of his occupations to be able to forget himself even for an hour or two in such noble surroundings but perhaps he wants to show us that hes taking no advantage of the attentions paid him lest we might think he was trying to worm himself into our confidence or can it be that he has already found out from you all that he wants to know observed le sage who was present on the occasion with a humorous look im sure sir said mrs bingley with asperity that he is incapable of the meanness if you had heard him express the sentiments that i have you would never hint such a charge no there is some delicacy of feeling take my word for it at the bottom of this change in him and i cant help fearing that it means he has found out something fresh something even more distressful to the family which makes him chary of accepting its hospitality i only hope she paused with a little sigh youre thinking of cleghorn broke in her master damme ill never believe in respectability again if that mans done it god forbid said the housekeeper but i wish sergeant ridgway would appear more and more in his old way when he does honour me with his company her wish however was not to be fulfilled the detective more and more absented himself as the days went on and became more and more of an asian mystery in the fleeting glimpses of his presence vouchsafed the household dark taciturn abysmal he flitted a casual shadow through the labyrinthine mysteries of the crime and could never be said to be here before an echo of his footfall was sounding in the hollows far away a picturesque description of his processes perhaps but consorting in a way with the housekeepers fanciful rendering perhaps delicacy rather than expediency was the motive of his tactics perhaps having virtually completed his case he was keeping out of the way until the time came to expound it perhaps a feature of its revision was that distressful something menacing appalling foreseen by the housekeeper he had plenty otherwise to do no doubt in the way of collecting evidence consulting counsel and so forth which alone gave plenty of reason for neglecting the social amenities whatever the explanation however the issue was not to be long delayed the baron came upon him unexpectedly one morning in the upper grounds where the fruit gardens were and the espaliers and all the signs of a prosperous vegetable order there was a fair view of the estate to be gained from that elevation and the sergeant appeared to be absorbed for the moment in the gracious prospect he waited unmoving for the other to join him and nodded as he came up its pleasant to snatch a minute sir he said to give to a view like this people of my profession dont get many such i suppose not answered le sage nor of a good many other professions proprietary views like incomes are very unfairly distributed dont you think well thats so no doubt and among the wrong sort of people often enough le sage laughed are you one of the right sort of people sergeant i wont go so far as to say that sir but i will go so far as to say that if i owned this property id come to feast my eyes on it here more often than what sir calvin does the baron without moving his head took in the face of the speaker he saw a glow a subdued passion in it which interested him what spirit of romance to be sure might lurk unsuspected under the hard official rind here was the last man in the world whom one would have credited with a sense of beauty and he was wrought to emotion by a landscape you talk said he of your profession not affording you many such moments as this now to my mind it seems the profession for a man romantically inclined does it indeed sir why dont you live in a perpetual atmosphere of romance think of the mysteries which are your daily food thats it my daily food and lodging too the men who pull on the ropes for a living dont think much or see much of the fairy scene theyre setting thats all for the prosperous folks in front youd rather be one of them which would you rather sir be a police officer or the owner of an estate like this if such things were properly distributed as you say thered be no need perhaps for police officers at all you read the papers about a case like ours here and you see only a romance we whose necessity puts us behind the scenes see only in nine cases out of ten the dirty mishandling of fate give a man his right position in the world and hell commit no crimes thats my belief and its founded on some experience i dare say youre right its comforting to know in that case that my valet has always fitted into his place like a stopper into a bottle the detective stood silent a moment then turned on the speaker with a queer enigmatic look well i wouldnt lose heart about him if i was you he said drily thats good said le sage i can leave him with a tolerably safe conscience then what sir youre going away before the inquiry i must im afraid i have business in london which i can no longer postpone but how about your evidence after what you have said cannot you afford to do without it the detective considered frowning and rubbing his chin then said simply very well and made a movement to go they went down the garden together and parted at the door in the wall this was on the saturday on the following monday the officer appeared for the last time to arrange for his witnesses on the wednesday ensuing he carried his handbag with him and intimated that it was not his purpose to return again before the event they were all mrs bingley perhaps excepted glad to see the last of him and the last of what his presence there implied and welcomed the prospect of the one clean day which was to be theirs before their re meeting in court the sergeants manner at his parting was restrained and his countenance rigidly pale sir calvin receiving his formal thanks for the courtesy shown him remarked upon it and asked him if he were feeling overdone no sir he replied never better thank you i hope you yourself may never feel worse than i do at this moment something in his way of saying it some significance of tone or look or emphasis seemed to cast a sudden chill upon the air the general turned away with a slightly wondering puzzled expression and shrugged his shoulders as if he were cold there were one or two present who remembered that gesture afterwards identifying it with some vague sensation in themselves that same night the baron caused a considerable stir by announcing his intention of leaving them on the morrow they all had something to say in the way of surprise and remonstrance except mr bickerdike and he judiciously held his tongue even hugo showed a certain concern as a man might who felt without quite realizing what it was he felt the giving way of some moral support on which he had been unconsciously leaning he looked up and asked as the detective had asked what about your evidence it is said to be immaterial answered le sage i am speaking on the authority of the sergeant himself hugh said no more but he eyed the baron in a wistful questioning way he was in a rather moving mood patently looking forward to wednesdays ordeal with considerable nervousness and apprehension and not altogether without reason the inquest had been trying enough yet that had been a mere local affair conducted amid familiar surroundings to stand up in public court and repeat perhaps be forced to amplify the evidence he had already given was a far different and more agitating prospect what was in his mind who could know there was something a little touching in the way he clung to his family and in the slight embarrassment they showed over his unaccustomed attentions audrey falling in for her share laughed and responded with only a bad grace but the glow in her eyes testified to feelings not the less proud and exultant because their repression had been so long a necessity with her coming upon the baron in the hall by and by as he was on his way upstairs to prepare for the morrows journey she stopped and spoke to him can you manage without a valet baron as i have managed a hundred times before my dear must you really go i must indeed leaving louis to shift for himself i leave him in the hands of providence yes but providence is not a lawyer heaven forbid god you know like no lawyer tempers the wind to the shorn lamb brebis tondue dieu mesure le vent that is a good french proverb and i am going to france in the faith of it but you will come back again yes i will come back it will be all right about louis you will see she did not answer she had been holding him by the lapels of his coat running her thumbs down the seams and suddenly feeling a little convulsive pressure there he looked up in her face and saw that thick tears were running down her cheeks very softly but resolutely then he captured the two wandering hands and held them between his own my dear he said my dear i understand but listen to this have confidence in your friend the baron and on the morrow morning he left accompanied by mr vivian bickerdikes most private and most profound misgivings that he was going to london on some business connected with the stolen document was that gentlemans certain conviction but what was he to do expose at once or wait and learn more on the whole it were better to wait perhaps the fellow was coming back he had said so and to the same unconsciousness of there being one on his track who at the right moment could put a spoke in his nefarious wheel he was still considering the question when something happened which for the time being put all considerations but one out of his head by the first post on the very morning of the inquiry he received much to his astonishment a subpna binding him to appear and give evidence in court about what if any uneasy suspicion in his mind answered that question to it was to be attributed no doubt his rather white conscience troubled aspect as he presently joined the party waiting to be motored over to the castle in the old city where the case was to be tried chapter xiv the explosion the magistrates assembled to hear the case were four in number two of them being local magnates and personal friends of sir calvin who was accorded a seat on the bench they took their places at eleven oclock the court being then crowded to its utmost capacity the case stood first on the list and no delay was experienced in opening it as before mr fyler appeared for the police and mr redstall for sir calvin the prisoner was undefended at the outset of the proceedings a surprise awaited the public the prisoner having been brought up from the cells beneath the court and placed in the dock sergeant ridgway asked permission to speak addressing the bench he said that since the inquiry before the coroner which had ended as their worships were aware in a verdict by the jury of wilful murder against the prisoner louis victor cabanis facts had come to his knowledge which entirely disposed of the theory of the prosecution proving as they did an unquestionable alibi in the prisoners favour under these circumstances he proposed to offer no evidence against the accused who with their worships permission would be discharged smart in aspect concise in phrase the detective stood up and made his avowal and again though in an auguster atmosphere with a marked impression upon his hearers some of them had already encountered him no doubt and were prepared to concede to his every statement the force and value of an official fiat very well sergeant was the reply while the public wondered if they were going to be defrauded of their feast of sensation or if some spicier substitute were about to be placed before them they were not kept long in suspense following the sergeants declaration brief evidence was given by andrew marle shepherd and nicholas penny thatcher the former deposed that on the afternoon in question he was setting hurdles on the uplands above leighway at a point about three miles north east of wildshott park as the crow flies when he saw prisoner that was as near three oclock as might be prisoner had stood watching him for a few minutes while exchanging a remark or two and had then gone on in a northerly direction penny gave evidence that on the same afternoon at three thirty he was working in the garden of his cottage at milldown two miles beyond the point mentioned by the last witness when prisoner came by and asked him the time he gave it him and the prisoner thanked him and continued his way still bearing north by east until he was out of sight he was going leisurely both witnesses affirmed and there appeared nothing peculiar about him except his foreign looks and speech neither had the slightest hesitation in identifying the prisoner with the man they had seen there was no possibility of mistaking him this evidence said the detective addressing the justices again at the end of it precluded any idea of the prisoners being the guilty party the case for the prosecution holding that the murder was committed at some time between three and four oclock in the afternoon at three oclock the accused was proved to have been at a spot good three miles away from the scene of the crime and again at at a spot five miles away representing a distance which even on an extravagant estimate he could hardly have covered within the period remaining to him if the theory of the prosecution was to be substantiated there was no case in fact and the prosecution therefore withdrew the charge a magistrate put the question somewhat extrajudicially why had he not pleaded this alibi in the first instance the accused who appeared overwhelmed by the change in his situation was understood to say with much emotion and gesticulation that he had not been advised nor had he supposed that the deposition of a prisoner himself would count for anything and moreover that he had been so bewildered by the labyrinth of suspicion in which he had got himself involved that it had seemed hopeless to him to think of ever extricating himself from it he seemed a simple soul and the justices smiled with some insular superiority over his nave declaration he was then given to understand that he was discharged and might go and with a joyous expression he stepped from the dock and vanished like a jocund goblin down the official trap counsel for the prosecution then rose and stated that the charge against cabanis being withdrawn it was proposed to put in his place samuel cleghorn against whom although no definite charge had as yet been preferred by the police a prima facie case existed his examination and the examination of the witnesses concerned would probably prove a lengthy affair and he asked therefore that the case might be taken next on the list the justices concurring samuel cleghorn was brought up from the cells and stood to undergo his examination confinement and anxiety it was evident had told upon the prisoner whose aspect since the inquest had undergone a noticeable change he looked limp and deteriorated like a worn banknote and his lips were tremulous respectability in a sidesman caught pilfering from the plate could not have appeared more self conscious of its fall he bowed deferentially to the bench with a slight start on seeing his master seated there and making some ineffectual effort to appear at ease clasped his plump white hands before him and fixed a glassy eye on the wall the public reassured settled down like a music hall audience to a new exciting turn the bench assumed its most judicial expression and counsel adjusting its wig for the fray proceeded to open the case it is not proposed to recapitulate in extenso the evidence already given in bulk and essentials the two hardly differed the only marked changes being in the order of the witnesses examined and in the absence from their list of the baron le sage who however inasmuch as his sole use had been to testify to the character of his servant was no longer needed there was the same reference to the insuperable difficulty experienced and still unsurmounted in tracing out the deceaseds connexions the same statement by sergeant ridgway as to the fruitlessness of the measures taken and the same request that in default of further information such evidence of identification as was at present available should be provisionally accepted the bench agreed the detective sat down and counsel rose once more this time with a formidable eye to business mr fyler began by reconstructing so far as was possible the history of the crime from the evidence already adduced into the particulars of which it is unnecessary to follow him in summarising the known facts he made no especial point it was observed of bringing them to bear on the presumptive guilt of the prisoner but used him rather as a convenient model or framework about which to shape his story indeed when he sat down again it might have been given as even odds whether the conviction or acquittal of the accused man was the thing foreshadowed and what then after two attempts was the whole business to end in a fiasco incredible some one must have killed the girl the very atmosphere of the court moreover fateful ominous derided such a conclusion attend and wait it seemed to whisper counsel was no sooner down than he was up again and calling now upon his witnesses to appear they came one by one as summoned mrs bingley jane ketchlove jessie ellis kate vokes mabel wheelband and there the order was broken the examination of these five was in all essentials a replica of that conducted at the inquest but to the observant with one significant note added for the first time counsel showed as it were a corner of the card up his sleeve by suggesting tentatively insinuatively propos the question of a guilty intrigue that one or other of them might possibly have her suspicions as to the identity of the second party implicated in it the hint was disowned as soon as rejected but it had left a curious impression here and there of more to come of its having only been proffered to open and prepare the way to evidence the stronger perhaps for some such moral corroboration not one of the women however would own to the subtle impeachment and the question for the moment was dropped but it was dropped only tactically in accordance with a pre arranged plan as became increasingly apparent with the choice of the next witness this was dr harding who had made the post mortem examination and whose evidence repeated exactly what he had formerly stated it added moreover a detail which touching upon a question of time showed yet a little more plainly which way the wind was setting and it included an admission or correction no less suggestive in its import the question was asked witness at the inquest you stated i believe that death must have occurred at oclock or thereabouts is that so a i said approximately judging by the indications q just so i am aware that in these cases a certain latitude must be granted it might then in fact have occurred somewhat earlier or somewhat later a yes by preference somewhat earlier q how much earlier witness refusing to submit to any brow beating on the question finally at the end of a highly technical disputation conceded a half hour as the extreme limit of his approximation and with that the matter ended as he stepped from the box the name of a new witness a witness not formerly included in the inquiry was called and public interest already deeply stimulated grew intensified margaret hopkins widow deposed on oath she was landlady of the brewers dray inn at longbridge the inn was situated to the east of the town and a little outside it on the winton road one afternoon about five weeks ago a lady and gentleman had called at her inn wanting tea and a private room to drink it in they were shown up to a chamber on the first floor where the gentleman ordered a fire to be lighted tea was brought them by witness herself and they had remained there shut in a long time together a couple of hours perhaps they were very affectionate with one another and had gone away when they did go very lovingly arm in arm the gentleman was mr hugo kennett whom she now saw in court and whom she had recognised for the male stranger at once the name of the lady accompanying him she had had no means of ascertaining but her companion had addressed her as annie mr redstall rising to cross examine witness put the following questions q will you swear to mr kennett having been the gentleman in question a yes on my oath sir q you already knew mr kennett by sight eh a no i did not sir i had never seen him before and have never seen him since till to day i hadnt been settled in longbridge not a two month at the time he come q you say the two appeared to be on affectionate terms on companionable terms would perhaps be the truer expression eh a as you choose sir if that means behaving like lovers together laughter q what do you mean by like lovers they would hardly have made a display of their sentiments before you a not intentional perhaps sir but i come upon them unexpected when i brought in the tea and there they was asitting on the sofy together as close and as fond as two turtle doves laughter mrs bingley recalled reluctantly admitted having given deceased an afternoon off about the date in question the girl had returned to the house before six oclock reuben henstridge called repeated his evidence given on the day of the inquest omitting only or abridging such parts of it as bore on the movements of the frenchman and excluding altogether by tacit consent it seemed those references to the butlers approach which had brought such a confusion of cross questioning about his ears the following bodeful catechism then ensued q you say it was ten minutes past two when you saw cabanis break from the copse and go down towards the road a aye q and that having hung about after seeing him you eventually returned to the red deer inn reaching it at about a thats it q at what time did you start to return to the inn a three oclock or a bit after q what had you been doing in the interval a sulkily thats my business q i ask you again you had better answer a after a scowling pause setting snares then defiantly werent it the open downs q im not entering into that question well assume if you like that the downs and your behaviour were equally open you were setting snares thats enough did anything suddenly occur to interrupt you at your task a yes it did q what was that a the sound of a gun going off q from what direction a from down among the trees near the road q quite so now will you tell the bench exactly what time it was when you heard that sound a the time when i started to go home q about three oclock or a little after a thats it q you state that on your oath a yes i do it was as if a conscious tremor like the excitement of many hearts leaping in unison passed through the court dimly foretelling some approaching crisis the examination was resumed q what makes you so certain of the time a the stable clock had just gone three q and following on the sound of the gun you left your snare setting and made for home a aye q for what reason a because i thought they might be working round my way q whom do you mean by they a the party as was out shooting i made sure at first it come from them q what made you alter your opinion a i see them as i went up the hill afar off nigh asholt wood q now tell me why didnt you mention all this at the inquest a because i werent asked q or was it because you feared having to confess to what made you bolt and from what occupation when the shot startled you no answer very well now attend to this you have heard it propounded or assumed that the murder took place some time between and oclock do you still adhere to your statement that it was just after three when you heard the sound of the gun a aye q you are on your oath remember a all right master q and you adhere to it a yes i do q that is enough you can stand down a sibilation a momentary rustling and shuffling as on the close of an engrossing sermon when tension is relaxed and the hymn being prepared for followed the dismissal of the witness a few glanced furtively hardly realizing yet why they were moved to do so at a rigid soldierly figure seated upright and motionless beside the justices on the bench but the sense of curious perplexity was hardly theirs when the next witness was claiming their attention this was daniel groome the gardener whose evidence generally a repetition of what he had formerly stated was marked by a single amendment the significance of which he himself hardly seemed to realize it appeared as follows q you stated before the coroner that this louder shot heard by you occurred at a time which you roughly estimated to be anything between three and half past three oclock is that so a no sir q what do you mean by no a ive thought it over since sir and ive come to the conclusion that my first impression was nearer the correct one q your impression that is to say that the shot was fired somewhat about three oclock a yes sir q what is your reason for this change of opinion a because i remembered afterwards sir having heard the clock in the masters study strike the quarter past i had gone round by then to the back of the house q and you had heard the shot fired while at the front a yes sir this witness was stiffly cross examined by mr redstall who sought to shake his evidence on the grounds that he was consciously or unconsciously seeking to adapt it to what was expected of him but the poor fellows honesty was so transparent and his incomprehension of the gravity of his statement so ingenuous that the only result of his harrying was to increase the impression of his disinterested probity he said what he believed to be the truth and he adhered to it he went and the usher tapping with his wand on the floor called in a loud voice on vivian bickerdike to appear and give evidence a famous writer has asserted that there are two kinds of witness to whom lawyers take particular exception the reluctant witness and the too willing witness to these may be added a third the anxious witness who being oppressed with a sense of responsibility of his position fears at once to say too much or too little and ends by saying both bickerdike entered the box an acutely anxious witness the trend of some recent evidence had left him in no doubt as to the lines on which his own examination was destined to run and he foresaw at once the use to which a certain conversation of his with the detective was going to be put now it was all very well to hold the sergeant guilty in this of a gross breach of confidence but his conscience would not thereby allow him to maintain himself blameless in the matter he should have known quite well being no fool that a detective did not ask questions or invite communications from a purely altruistic point of view and that the apparent transparency of such a mans sentiments was the least indication of their depth by permitting pique a little to obscure that fact to him he had done his friend for whom he had a real very warm regard a disservice to which he had now in that friends hearing to confess so far then it only remained to him to endeavour to repair through his sworn evidence the mischief to which he had made himself a party but could any reparation stultify now a certain issue to which he had seen it suddenly aghast that too open candour of his had been seduced into contributing what horrible thing was it which was being approached threatened in the shadow of his friends secret the thing was monstrous damnable yet he could not forget how it had appeared momentarily adumbrated to himself on his first hearing of the murder but he had rejected the thought with incredulous scorn then as he would reject it now of whatever sinful weakness hugh might be capable a crime so detestable so cruel was utterly impossible to him he swore it in his heart but his faith could not relieve him of the weight of responsibility which went with him into the witness box it was like a physical oppression and he seemed to bend under it counsel took the witnesss measure with a rolling relish of the lips as he prepared giving a satisfied shift to his gown to open his inquisitions q you are on very intimate terms i believe mr bickerdike with sir calvin and his family a with sir calvins permission i think i may say yes q you have seen the prisoner before a many times q could you as a guest speak to his general character a it has always appeared to me quite unexceptionable q not a violent man a o dear no q at dinner on the night before the murder did you notice anything peculiar about him a he appeared to me to be upset about something q and you wondered perhaps having only arrived that afternoon as i understand what domestic tribulation could have discomposed so stately a character laughter a i may have i had always considered cleghorn as immovable an institution as the monument the laughter which greeted this sally appeared to reassure witness somewhat as did the unexpected lines on which his rather irregular examination seemed to be developing but his confidence was of short duration the very next question brought him aware of the true purpose of this preliminary catechism which was merely to constitute a pretext for getting him into the witness box at all q was your arrival that afternoon may i ask in response to a long invitation or a sudden call a with a sudden stiffening of his shoulders as if rallying his energies to meet an ordeal foreseen a sudden call i came down in response to a letter from my friend mr hugo kennett inviting me to a few days shooting q mr hugo kennett is a particular friend of yours is he not a we have known one another a long time q intimate to that degree i mean that you have few secrets from one another a that may be q and can depend upon one another in any emergency a i hope so q there was a question of emergency perhaps in this case a i am bound to say there often is with mr kennett q will you explain what you mean by that a i mean i hope he will forgive my saying it that his imagination is a little wont to create emergencies which nothing but his friends immediate advice and assistance can overcome he is apt to be in the depths one moment and on the heights the next he is built that way thats all q was this a case of an emergency due to his imagination a i wont go quite so far as to say that q then there was really a reason this time for his having you down at short notice a i may have thought so q we will come to that had he mentioned the reason in his letter to you a no the letter only said that he badly wanted bucking and asked me to come down at once q he gave no explanation a none whatever q in the letter or afterwards when you met a no q you found him in an uncommunicative mood a somewhat q kindly say what you mean by somewhat a i mean that while he told me nothing definite about his reason for having me down he did seem to hint that there was trouble somewhere q what were his exact words a i cant remember q were they to the effect that he was in a devil of a fix with a girl and could only see one way out of it sensation a aghast nothing of the sort now i recall he described himself as sitting on a barrel of gunpowder smoking a cigarette and waiting for the explosion that was to come q thank you another effort or two mr bickerdike and your memory may need no refreshing did you find your friends manner now as strange as his talk a it might often have seemed strange on such occasions to those who did not know him q answer my question please a reluctantly well it was strange q stranger than you had ever known it to be before a perhaps so q i suggest that it was wild and reckless to a degree the manner of a man who had got himself into a hopeless scrape and saw no way out of it but social and material ruin a it was very strange i can say no more q would you have considered his state compatible with that of a young man of good position and prospects who had entangled himself with a girl greatly his social inferior and was threatened by her with exposure unless he in the common phrase made an honest woman of her mr redstall rising to object the bench ruled that the question was inadmissible it had created however a profound impression in court which from that moment never abated counsel accepting their worships decision resumed q had you any reason to suspect a woman in the case a it was pure conjecture on my part q then you did entertain such a suspicion a not at that time later perhaps q after the murder a yes after the murder q when a the moment i heard it had been committed i was told by a groom q about the woman or the murder a about the murder q when was that a when i returned from shooting that day q you returned alone i believe a yes q mr kennett having left you shortly before three oclock a i fancy about that time q and at the moment you heard there had been this murder committed that conjecture that association between your friend and the murdered girl came into your mind a it was wholly preposterous of course i dismissed the idea the moment it occurred to me q you dismissed the idea of mr kennetts having been involved with the girl a no of his having committed the murder sensation q but you still thought the entanglement possible a i thought it might account for his state q why did the first idea associating mr kennett with the crime occur to you witness hesitating the question was repeated a in a low voice o just because of something nothing important that had happened at the shoot that and the extraordinary state i had found him in q will you tell the bench what was this unimportant something that happened at the shoot a with emotion it was nothing probably my fancy and he denied it utterly q now mr bickerdike if you please a i thought that in in pulling his gun through a particular hedge that morning he might have done it with less risk to himself that was all q you suspected him in short of wanting to kill himself under the guise of an accident a i swear he never admitted it i swear he denied it q and you accepted his denial so implicitly that you asked him to go home leaving his gun with the keeper is that not so a yes q he refused a yes he did q did not much the same thing occur again later in the afternoon a nothing of the sort at all shortly before three he came to me and said he was no good and was going home q what did he mean by no good no good in life a no good at shooting q and again you asked him to leave his gun with you a no i did not not directly at least q please explain what you mean by not directly a he may have understood what was in my mind i cant say he just laughed and called out that he wasnt going to shoot himself and wasnt going to let me make an ass of him and with that he marched off q and that is all a all q he didnt by chance in saying im not going to shoot myself lay any particular emphasis on the last word a certainly not that i distinguished the whole suggestion is too impossible to any one who knows my friend q thank you mr bickerdike that will do if witness had entered the box like an oppressed man he left it like a beaten his cheeks were flushed his head bowed it was observed that he purposely avoided looking his friend in the face as he passed him by on his way to the rear of the court the excitement was now extreme all attention in the midst of a profound stillness was concentrated on a figure come more and more with each adjustment of the legal spy glass into a definite focus it was felt that the supreme moment was approaching and when the expected name was called a sigh like that of a sleeper turning seemed to sound through the hall the prisoner in the dock had already long been overlooked forgotten he had been put up it seemed as a mere medium for this deadlier manifestation and his purpose served had ceased to be of interest he stood pallid with his hands on the rail before him rolling his one mobile eye the only apparently mystified man in court as hugo entered the box he was seen to be deadly pale but he held his head high and stood like a soldier morally and physically upright facing his court martial he folded his arms and looked his inquisitor steadily in the eyes mr fyler retorted with an expression of well assured suavity he was in no hurry having netted his fowl he could afford to let him flutter awhile he began by leading his witness only more briefly the way he had already conducted him at the inquest but with what new menace of pitfalls by the road the discovery of the body the incident of the gun prejudiced now in the light of the possible moral to be drawn from witnesss hurry to get rid of it and his loathing of the weapon the marked agitation of his aspect when seen by the gardener the interval in the house with its suggestion of nervous collapse and desperate rallying to face the inevitable ordeal that significant outburst of his at the inquest when he had exclaimed against an implication of guilt which had never been made his admission of having bantered the deceased about an assignation an admission fraught with suspicion of the scene of passion and recrimination which had perhaps more truthfully described their encounter all these points were retraversed but in a spirit ominously differing from that in which they had formerly been reviewed and then at last in a series of swift stabbing questions and hypotheses issued the mortal moral of all this sinister exordium q you chaffed the deceased you say sir with being where she was for an assignation a something of the sort q something of the sort may be nothing of the sort i suggest that this so called chaff is better described as a quarrel between you will you swear that that was not the case a no i will not q then your statement was a fabrication a i accused her of being there to meet some one q you accused her i am your debtor for the word will you swear that she was not there to keep an assignation and that assignation with yourself a i swear it most positively our meeting was quite accidental q on your part a on my part q but not on hers a i am not here to answer for that q pardon me i think you are i suggest that expecting you to return by the bishops walk she was waiting there to waylay you a she might have been on the chance q i suggest you knew that she was a i say i did not know q well you took that way at least and you met and quarrelled i suggest that the person you accused her of being there to meet was yourself and that the dispute between you turned upon the question of her thus importuning you is that so a after a pause yes q and i suggest further that the reason for her so importuning you lay in her condition for which you were responsible a yes it is true sensation q she entreated you perhaps to repair the wrong you had done her in the only way possible to an honourable man a witness seeming to stiffen as if resolved to face the whole music at last she had already urged that she pressed to know that was all if i had made up my mind to marry her i refused to give a definite answer just then since my whole career was at stake but i promised her one within twenty four hours i was very much bothered over the business and i dare say a bit impatient with her she may have upbraided me a little in return but there was no actual quarrel between us i went on after a few minutes leaving her there by herself and that is the whole truth q we will judge of that you say the meeting was none of your seeking a i do say it q now please attend to me you were on your way back when you met deceased from the shooting party which you had abandoned a yes q you have heard what the last witness stated as to a certain incident connected with that morning was his statement substantially true a i cant deny it it was a momentary mad impulse q and being forestalled was replaced possibly by an alternative suggestion pointing to another way out of your difficulties a i dont know what you mean it was just the culmination as it were of a desperate mood and was regretted by me the next instant q was it because of your desperate mood that you refused to be parted from your gun when you finally left the shoot and returned home a no but because i declined to be made to look a fool q i put it to you once more that you knew when you went home carrying against all persuasion your gun with you that the deceased would be waiting for you in the copse a it is utterly false i knew nothing about it q very well now as to the time of your meeting with the deceased i have it stated on your sworn evidence that that was at three oclock or thereabouts and that after spending some ten minutes in conversation with her you resumed your way to the house which you reached at about appearing then according to the evidence of a witness in a very agitated state a i was upset i own naturally under the circumstances q what circumstances a having just promised to do or not to do what would affect my whole life q no other reason a no q did you hear the sworn statement of the witness henstridge and another that the report of the shot which could have been none other than the fatal shot was heard and fixed by them at a time estimated at a few minutes after three oclock that is to say at a time when according to your own admission you were in the deceaseds company a it is an absolute lie the crisis had come the long expected blow fallen but even in the shock and echo of it there were some who found nerve to glance from son to father and wonder what super dramatic incident yet remained to them to cap the days excitement they were disappointed not by one sign or movement did the stiff grey figure on the bench betray the torture racking it or concede to their expectations the evidence of an emotion not even when as if in response to some outspoken direction a couple of policemen were seen to move silently forward and take their stand on either side the witness box and then suddenly counsel was speaking again he addressed the bench with an apology for the course imposed upon him since it must have become apparent as the case proceeded that the tendency of the prosecution had been to turn more and more from its nominal objective in the dock there had been a reason for that however and he must state it the inquiries of the police and more especially of the distinguished detective officer sergeant ridgway had latterly gradually but certainly led them to the conclusion that the motive for the crime and the name of its perpetrator must be looked for in another direction than that originally and seemingly inevitably indicated this change of direction had necessarily exculpated the two men concerned in to days proceedings but it had been thought best to submit one of them to examination for the purpose of exposing through the evidence affecting him the guilt of the presumptive criminal that having been done the police raised no objection to cleghorn like the other accused being discharged he then went on to summarize the evidence as it had come by gradual degrees to involve the witness kennett in its meshes the scrape into which the young man had got himself his dread of exposure the wildness of his talk and behaviour the incriminating business of the gun and finally the sworn testimony as to the time of the shot and he ended by drawing a fanciful picture of what had occurred in the copse i ask your worships he said to picture to yourselves the probable scene here has this young lothario returned his heart full of death and desperation since the frustration of his first mad impulse to end his difficulties with his life knowing or not knowing we must form our own conclusions as to that that his destined victim awaits him at the tryst if tryst it is her heart burning with bitterness against the seducer who has betrayed her each resolved on its own way out of the trouble she upbraids him with her ruin and threatens in her turn to ruin him unless he consents to right the wrong he has done her he refuses or temporizes and she turns to leave him thinking she is about to put her threat into immediate execution goaded to desperation the gun in his hand only tentatively adhered to at first perhaps decides him he fires at and kills her the deed perpetrated he has to consider after the first shock of horror how best to conceal the evidences of his guilt he decides to rest the lethal weapon against a tree with the intention of asserting or at least not denying if subsequently questioned that he had left it with one of its barrels loaded concocts in his mind a plausible story of a cigarette and an oversight and hurries on to the house where in his private room he spends such a three quarters of an hour of horror and remorse as none of us need envy him his nerve by then somewhat restored he decides to take the initiative in the necessary discovery and affecting a sudden recollection of his oversight returns to the copse to fetch his gun with the result we know all that it is open to us to surmise what we may not surmise is the depth of depravity in a nature which could so plan to cast the burden of its own guilt upon the shoulders of an innocent man one dumb white look here did the son turn on the father who met it steadfastly as white and unflinching we have heard some loose talk your worships went on counsel as to the appearance of a mysterious fourth figure in this tragedy we may dismiss i think that individual as purely chimerical a maggot if i may so describe it of the witness henstridges brain there is no need i think you will agree with me for looking beyond this court for a solution of the problem which has been occupying its attention painful as the task is to me i must now do my duty without fear or favour in the face of any considerations social or sentimental whatsoever by asking you to commit for trial on the capital charge of murdering annie evans the witness hugo staveley kennett a warrant for whose arrest the police already hold in their hands not a sound broke the stillness as counsel ended only a muffled rumble like that of a death drum from the wheels of a passing wagon in the street outside and then the blue clad janissaries closed in the magistrates without leaving the bench put their heads together and the vote was cast hugo staveley kennett we have no alternative but to commit you to take your trial on the capital charge a sudden crash and thump broke in upon the verdict cleghorn had fainted in the dock chapter xv the face on the wall the morning of the inquiry found m le baron in paris in his old rooms at the montesquieu he was in very good spirits smiling and buoyant and not at all conscience smitten over his desertion of his servant in his hour of need it will be a not unwholesome lesson for the little fanfaron he thought teaching him in the future to keep a guard on his tongue and temper he foresaw be it observed that certain issue and felt no anxiety about it but his face fell somewhat to an added reflection i wonder if they have committed him for trial by now poor girl and he shrugged his shoulders with a tiny sigh having crossed by the night boat from southampton one might have looked for a certain staleness in the barons aspect on the contrary he was as chirpy as a sparrow having slept well throughout a pretty bad crossing and since had a refreshing tub and brush up he sat down though very late with an excellent appetite to his petit pain and rich coffee and brioche and having consumed them took snuff at short intervals for half an hour and then prepared to go out m le barons movements seemed carelessly casual but he had in fact a definite objective and he made for it at his leisure it lay on the left bank of the river in or near the district calling itself loosely the latin or students quarter he crossed the river by the pont des arts and went straight down the rue de seine as far as the rue de tournon where he turned off in the direction of st sulpice the great bell up in the high tower was crashing and booming for a funeral and its enormous reverberations swayed like atlantic rollers across the fields of air in all the world st sulpice bell is the death bell so solemn so deep and so overwhelming it sounds m le baron paused to listen a moment is it an omen thought he and am i going to hear bad news somewhere at the back of the church in a little street called the rue bourbon le chteau he came to the shop of a small dealer in prayer books and holy pictures and pious images it was a poor shop in a faded district and suggestive of scant returns and lean commons for its inmates a door as gaunt and attenuated in appearance stood open to one side of the shop and by this the visitor entered with the manner of one who knew the place a flight of bare wooden stairs rose before him and up these he went to the first to the second floor where he paused a little breathless to knock on a door que diable cried a hoarse voice from within whos that for answer the baron turned the handle and presented himself it was a ragged comfortless room he entered frowzy chill without a carpet and with dirty whitewashed walls a table stood in the dingy window and at it was seated the solitary figure of a man emaciated melancholy eyed ribault his name a designer on the staff of the petit courrier des dames some of his work lay before him now he looked up from it with a startled exclamation and rose to his feet those were clad in list slippers for the rest he wore a rusty frock coat and at his neck a weeping black bow m le baron he exclaimed in wonder and welcome who would have thought to see you again am i that sort then answered le sage with a smile i am sorry i left so poor an impression ah but what an impression cried the other fervently an angel of goodness a samaritan a comforter and a healer in one well well m ribault said the baron you are still at the old toil i observe always at it monsieur but in my plodding uninspired way not like my friends ah he was a great artist was jean truly he had a wonderful facility has he left you but for the grave monsieur we had not otherwise been parted tears gathered in the poor creatures eyes he sighed with a forlorn resigned gesture hearing his words a shadow crossed the visitors face that foreboding bell he muttered he was genuinely concerned and not for one only reason you will tell me all about it perhaps m ribault he said he was never himself again after that accident answered the designer all your tenderness your care your disinterested help could do no more than earn for him a little respite from a sentence already pronounced he was virtually a dying man when you last left him monsieur the light of your healing presence withdrawn the shadow came out and was visible to me ah but he would talk of you often and often and of how you had smoothed the bitter way for him he confided in you much he told you his little history something of it ribault it was the history of a brave man monsieur of patient merit eternally struggling against adversity of conscious power having to submit itself to necessity there was that in him could he but have indulged it ah if you had only seen seen what my poor friend monsieur he died in june but before he died he drew in pastel on that wall on that bare wall a face that was like the fine blossom of the aloe crowning and vindicating with its immortal beauty the harsh and thorny ugliness of those long necessitous years it was his testament his swan song less than its perfection would have made a smaller artist and it was produced by him from memory as he sat there dying in his chair from a memory of whom ribault i will tell you one day shortly before his death there had come to see him a step brother of his an englishman of whom i had never heard nor he spoken he had a lady with him this brother one of the most beautiful you could picture and her loveliness entered into jeans heart he could not forget it he had no ease from it until his art came to dispossess him of its haunting i watched him at work it was marvellous the wall broke into song and flower under my eyes that was the man monsieur that was the man it was his own soul blossoming and having done what he must he grew once more at peace two days later he was dead i see no face on the wall ribault alas no monsieur alas alas no when he returned this strange relation this vandal after his brothers death to arrange for the funeral and dispose of his effects he saw the drawing and he denounced it he did more in his anger he seized a cloth and before i could interpose that miracle that dream was but a featureless smudge upon the wall and even then he would not be satisfied until the last rainbow tints had vanished the frown on m le barons brow was again darkening its habitual placidity what excuse had the man to offer for an act so outrageous he demanded warmly the designer shrugged his shoulders what excuse but of the jealous and coarse grained he said that the ladys permission should have been asked first that anyhow the artist being dead it could not matter and that he had no idea of leaving the portrait there to become the cynosure of common eyes he was a hard man monsieur and we came to words the visitor grunted m ribault what was the name of this goth it was the name of my friend monsieur what christian and surname the same precisely one monsieur they were beaux frres no more with such it may be indubitably and the ladys name i could show you sooner than pronounce it it was written by jean under the portrait but the portrait is lost nevertheless it is not altogether forgotten before it was destroyed i had borrowed a camera from a friend and achieved a reproduction of it alas monsieur but a cold shadow of the original a sadness a reflection but such as it is a record i would not willingly let perish the barons brow was smoother again his eyes had recovered their good humour but this is interesting my friend he said might i be permitted to see it who sooner cried the designer monsieur has only to command he went to a cupboard and presently produced from it a photograph mounted on brown paper which he presented to his visitor you must not judge from it he said more than you would from the shadow of an apple tree the colour of its blossom but is it not a beautiful face monsieur beautiful indeed answered le sage profoundly pre occupied and did the brother know you had secured this transcript he asked presently of a truth not monsieur sooner would i have died than tell him ah for minutes longer the baron stood absorbed in contemplation of the photograph then suddenly he looked up i want you to part with this to me my friend monsieur it is yours there is none to whom i would sooner confide it you have the negative truly yes keep it and print no more from it for the present above all keep the knowledge of your possessing it from the goth between wonder and sympathy the frenchman acquiesced no doubt he would want to destroy that too he said exactly answered le sage now listen my friend i have a commission for you it was a very handsome commission the nature of which need not be specified since it was in effect merely a delicate acknowledgment of a service rendered and if the acknowledgment was out of all proportion with the service that was m le barons way and one not to be resented by a poor man who was also a reasonably proud man so the two parted very good friends and the baron went back to his hotel in high good humour with himself and all the world on the following night he was in london ensconced in rooms in a private hotel in bloomsbury where he learnt from the papers of the latest startling development in what had come to be known as the wildshott murder case so he thought it works according to plan he had managed to procure while in paris a personal introduction from a certain eminent official to a corresponding dignitary in the metropolis but for the present he kept that in his pocket there were some smaller fry to be dealt with first aids of the great approach chapter xvi the baron finds a champion from the bickerdike ms who that was present at that scene could ever forget its anguish and pathos its fierce dramatic intensity will remain for all time indelibly seared on my soul could i believe in my friends guilt knowing him it was impossible and yet that seemingly incontrovertible evidence as to when the shot was fired if he had done it if he had done it not his own nature but some fiend temporarily in possession of it must have directed his hand but i would not believe he had done it i would not until i had heard him confess to it with his own lips however appearances might be against him he should find an unshakable ally in me and if the worst were to come to the worst and the trial confirm his guilt beyond dispute there would be that yet for me to plead in revision of my former evidence so cruelly surprised from me to plead in virtue of my intimacy with the unhappy boy that in the moods to which he was subject he was apt to lose complete control of himself and to behave on occasions veritably like a madman it might mitigate extenuate who could say but in the meantime i would not believe not though the world accused him before he was taken away he and his father met in a room below the court sir calvin coming across the floor after the committal looked like a white figure of death death stark but in motion he walked straight on avoiding nobody but a little stagger as he passed near me was eloquent of his true state i was moved impulsively to hold out my arm to him and he took it blindly and we descended the stairs together in a bare vault like office we found my poor friend he was in charge of the two policemen who had arrested him his deadly pallor was all gone and succeeded by a vivid flush he held out his hand with a steadfast smiling look take it or not sir he said it was taken and hard wrung just that one moments understanding and the two fell apart thank you sir said the boy simply i did not do it of course the father laughed it wrung one to hear him and to see his face one of your judges hughie he said wheezing hilariously old crosson you know him told me not to lose heart that appearances werent always to be trusted he ought to know eh after three attempts i wanted you just to hear me say said the other hurriedly that im glad its come not the way it has but the truth ive behaved like a blackguard sir and its been weighing on me you dont know how its been weighing its been making my life hell for some little time past but now you know and its the worst of me bad enough but not the unutterable brute theyd make me out he turned to me so they got at you viv he said never mind old boy you meant the best it was an infamous breach of confidence i burst out it was that sergeant led me on yes said hugh i supposed he was at the bottom of all this but i cant help his witnesses it was the truth i told he has betrayed the house i said hotly he was engaged to serve but to this sir calvin greatly to my surprise and indignation demurred in a hoarse broken way if he thought his duty lay this road it was his business like an honest man to take it we want no absolution on sufferance eh hughie my boy no sir no you will see that i am properly advised as to the best way to go to clear myself thank god my mother isnt alive it was said with the first shadow of a break in his voice and the general could not stand it he gave a little gasp and turned away his fingers working at his moustache shell see to it hughie he said indistinctly that that its all made right there was never a more truth loving woman in the world but you shall have your advice for forms sake the best that can be procured thank you sir it was intimated that the interview must end the two men just faced one another an unforgetable look and then the father turned and rigid as a sleep walker passed out of the room without another word i lingered behind a moment just to whisper my friend bonne chance then hurried after the retreating figure we entered the car in silence and drove off alone together leaving the household witnesses to follow later all the way it must have lain in the mind of the stiff figure beside me with what other expectations in what other company we had made the outward journey i thought it best not to disturb him and we reached the house without a solitary sentence i believe having passed between us once there sir calvin walked straight into his study and i saw him no more that day what was the true thought in his heart faith scornful and triumphant or some secret misgiving who could tell perhaps for the first time some doubts as to his own qualifications as a father were beginning to move in him some tragic self searching for the seed of what might or might not be in this fruit of his blood the day stole by on hushed wings a sense of still fatality brooded over the house the voiceless almost unpeopled quiet told upon my nerves and kept me wandering aimless and solitary from room to room near evening audrey was sent for by her father i saw her and saw her for the first time since our return as she disappeared into his study what passed between them there one could only surmise but at least it was marked by no audible sounds of emotion in that dead oppression i would have welcomed even her company but she never came near me and i was left to batten as i would on my own poisonous reflections they passed and passed in review with sickening iteration the same wearisome problems the evidence my hateful and unwilling share in it my friends dreadful situation against the detective i felt a bitter animosity no wonder that conscious of his treachery to his employer as i still persisted in regarding it his manner had changed of late and he had held himself aloof from us even that cynical official fibre i supposed could not be entirely insensitive to the indecency of eating the salt of him he was planning to betray i was so wroth with him that i could have wished if for no other reason than his discomfiture to vindicate my friends innocence the thought sent me harking back once more over familiar ground if hugh were innocent who was guilty if another could be proved guilty or even reasonably suspect the whole evidence against the prisoner fell into discredit who then now not this overwhelming business itself had been enough to dismiss wholly from my mind its haunting suspicions regarding the baron so secret so subtle so inexplicable could it still be possible that he was somehow implicated in the affair if not was it not at least remarkable that it should have coincided with his coming involved his servant been followed by that midnight theft of the paper and then suddenly there came to me with a little shock of the blood a memory of our conversation in the keepers cottage on the fatal day of the shoot how curious he had been then on the subject of poachers of their methods of their proneness to violence on occasion he had asked so innocently yet shown such shrewdness in his questions that even orsden had laughingly commented on the discrepancy and that mention of the muffling properties of a mist in the matter of a gunshot why it was as if he had wished to assure himself of the adequacy of some precaution already calculated and taken to mislead and bewilder in a certain issue the thought came upon me like a thunderclap was it could it be possible that some blackguard poacher had been made the instrument of a diabolical plot perhaps that fourth shadowy figure that had never materialised perhaps henstridge himself who had volunteered the damning evidence and whom it would be ones instinct to mistrust le sage and henstridge in collusion was it an inspiration did i stand on the threshold of a tremendous discovery in spite of the feverish excitement which suddenly possessed me i could still reason against my own theory the motive what possible motive in murdering an unoffending servant girl again what time had been the barons in which to complot so elaborate a crime but supposing it had all been arranged beforehand before ever he came i had not overlooked the mystery attaching to the girl herself it might cover for all one knew a very labyrinthine intrigue of vengeance and spoliation and then in a moment my thought swerved and the memory of cleghorn returned to me cleghorn white and abject grasping the rail of the dock cleghorn fainting where he stood what terrific emotion had thus prostrated the man relieved from an intolerable oppression was mere revulsion of feeling enough to account for it or was it conceivable that he too was after all concerned in the business a third party and overwhelmed under his sense of unexpected escape from what he had regarded as his certain doom i was getting into deep waters i stood aghast before my own imagination how was i to deal with its creations it was an acute problem my decision on which was reached only after long deliberation it was this i would keep all my suspicions and theories to myself until i could confide them to the ear of the counsel on hugos behalf in the meantime some relief from the moral stagnation of wildshott had become apparent with the opening of the day succeeding the inquiry that deadly lethargy which had followed the first stunning blow was in part shaken off and the household though in hushed vein began to resume its ordinary duties sir calvin himself reappeared white and drawn but showing no disposition to suffer commiseration in any form or any relaxation from his iron discipline the events of the next few days i will pass over at short length they yielded some pathos embraced some preparations included a visit i may mention here a decision of the generals which a little in one direction embarrassed my designs just or unjust to the man he would not have cleghorn back one could not wonder perhaps over his determination yet i could have preferred for the moment not to lose sight of my suspect we heard later that the butler as if anticipating his dismissal had gone directly after his release up to london where no doubt he could be found if wanted i had to console myself with that reflection the valet louis we came to learn about the same time had taken refuge pending his masters return he had got to hear somehow of the barons absence with an excellent roman catholic lady who had pitied his case and offered him employment he had no desire very certainly to return to a house where he had suffered so much of a visit i was allowed to pay my friend in the prison i do not wish to say a great deal the interview took place in a room with a grating between us and a warder present the circumstances were inexpressibly painful but i think i felt them more than hugo he was cheery and optimistic outspoken too in a way that touched me to the quick i want to tell you everything viv he said hurriedly below his breath i want to get it all off my chest you guessed the truth of course but not the whole of it there was one thing id like you to tell my father if you will it makes me out a worse cur than i admitted but i cant feel clean till ive said it it began this way i surprised the girl over some tricky business god forgive her and me thats enough said about it and i bargained with her for my silence on terms ill say for myself that i knew already she was fond of me but it doesnt excuse my behaving like a damned cad anyhow she fell to it easily enough and then the fat was in the fire it blazed up when she discovered you know it seemed to turn her mad she must be made honest my wife or she would kill herself she said i believe in the end i should have married her if viv old man i loved that girl i loved her god knows with what passion yet i tell you my first emotion on discovering her dead was one of horrible relief call me an inhuman beast if you will i dare say its true but there it is i was in such a ghastly hole and my nerves had gone all to pieces over it if i had done what she wished it meant the end of everything for her and me i knew the old man and that he would never forgive such an alliance would ruin and beggar us i had been on a hellish rack and was suddenly off it and the momentary sensation was beyond my own control does the admission seem to blacken the case against me i believe i know you better than to think so im only accounting in a way for my behaviour on the night of the the why all the time at the bottom of my soul i was crying on my dead darling to come back to me that i could not live without her o viv why is it made so difficult for some men to go straight he paused a moment his head leaned down on his hands which held on to the bars i did not speak his allusion to the tricky business he had surprised the girl over was haunting my mind how did it consort with my latent suspicion of a mystery somewhere hugh i said presently you wont tell me what she was doing when you first no i wont he interrupted me bluntly think what she became to me and allow me a little decency ive told you all thats necessary more than i had ever intended to tell you when i promised you my confidence im sorry for that viv god knows if i had spoken to you at first it might have altered things but i couldnt make up my mind while a chance existed or i thought it did she put me out of my last conceit that day swearing she was going to expose the whole story it was all true that i said she may have been waiting there on the chance of my passing i swear i didnt know it we had our few words and i gave my promise and passed on the evidence about the shot was a black lie i can say no more than that i give his words and leave them at that making no comment and drawing no conclusions if his admission as to his first emotion on learning of his release might repel some people i can only plead that one mans psychology like one mans meat may be impossible of digestion by another i found it i confess hard to stomach myself but then i had never been a spoilt and wayward only son we talked some little time longer on another matter which had indeed been the main object of my visit the nature of and counsel for his defence i had undertaken at sir calvins instance to go to london and interview his lawyers on the subject thus sparing the father the bitter trial of a preliminary explanation and i told hugo of my intention what a good fellow you are viv he said fondly i dont deserve that you should take all this trouble about me if i can only appear to justify my own indecent persistence in remaining on to help i said stiffly i shall feel satisfied i could not forbear the little thrust that wounding remark of his had never ceased to rankle in me well i asked for it he said with a flushed smile but dont nurse a grudge any longer i was hardly accountable for what i said in those days a man hardly is you know when hes on the rack o i forgive you i answered theres a virtue sometimes in pretending to a thick skin and we parted on good terms my journey to london was arranged for the morrow after the interview i had one of my passages with audrey before going i dont know what particular prejudice it was the girl cherished against me but she would never let us be friends i saw scarcely anything of her in these days and when we did meet she would hardly speak to me i could have wished even to propitiate her because it was plain enough to me how the poor thing was suffering her pride and her affections both of which i think were really deep seated were cruelly involved in the disgrace befallen them they found some little compensation perhaps in the improved relations established between her father and herself circumstances had brought these two into closer and more sympathetic kinship it was as if they had discovered between them a father and a daughter and so far poor hugos catastrophe had wrought good but still the girls loneliness of heart was an evident thing pathetically grateful as she might be for the change in her fathers attitude towards her she could never get nearer to that despotic nature than its own limitations would permit you are pining for your baron i suppose i said on this day goaded at last to speak by her insufferable manner towards me the taunt was effective at least in opening her mouth you are always hinting unpleasant things about the baron mr bickerdike she answered turning sharply on me dont you think it a little mean to be continually slandering him in that underhand way i saw it was still to be battle and prepared my guard that is your perverse way of looking at it audrey i answered quietly from my point of view it is just trying to help my friends by maligning them to their enemies she answered i suppose that was why you confided to sergeant ridgway all you knew about hughs affairs it gave me a certain shock i knew that she had read a full report of the proceedings but not that she or any one had drawn such a cruel conclusion from it confided is the word audrey i answered with difficulty levelling my voice i cant be held responsible for that breach of trust yes thank you for that smile but i know what was in my heart and it was to help hugh over a difficult place i foresaw for him my weakness was in thinking other men as honourable as myself but anyhow your stab is rather misplaced since i wasnt maligning as you say my friends to their enemies but the other way about as i see it well dont see it she said insolently perhaps just consider it as possible i may happen to know more about the baron than you do o i dare say hes been yarning to you i answered and quite plausibly enough to a credulous listener but if i were you i wouldnt attach too much importance to what he tells you about himself ill say no more as to my own suspicions though events have not modified them i can assure you but i will say that regard for your brother should at least incline you to go warily in a matter which may have a very strong bearing on his interests she stood conning me a moment or two in silence please to be explicit she said then do you mean that you believe the baron to be the real criminal i positively jumped good heavens i cried dont make me responsible for such wild statements i mean only that in the face of your brothers awful situation you should be scrupulously careful to do nothing which might seem to impair the efforts of those who are working to throw new light on it i dont say the baron is the guilty one but it is possible your brother is not is that all she cried she stepped right up to me so that our faces were near touching mr vivian bickerdike she said hugh did not commit that murder i tell you in case you do not know i never said he did i answered involuntarily backing a little her eyes were so pugnacious how you persist in misreading me i only want to be prepared against all contingencies amongst which i suppose is the barons wicked attempt to exculpate himself to me by encouraging my suspicions against hughie she laughed with a sort of defiant sob in her voice ill tell you what i truly think that he is a better friend to my brother than you are and i hope hell come back soon and when he does i shall go on listening to and believing in him as i do think i believe in no one else and in the meantime ill tell you this for your comfort he is really english and really the baron le sage he takes his title from an estate in the cevennes which was left him by a maternal uncle and he is very rich and i dare say very eccentric in wanting to do good with his money and that is enough for the present and he plays chess for half crowns and steals private papers i cried to myself scornfully as she turned and left me poor foolish creature it was no good my trying to convince her and i gave up the attempt then and there chapter xvii and audrey audrey had been starting for a walk when detained by the interview recorded in the last chapter she left it burning with indignation and passionate resentment that this man could call himself a friend of hughie and conceive for one moment the possibility of his guilt he pretended to be his intimate and did not even know him how she hated such laodicean allies and that he should dare to try to involve her in his doubts and half concessions it was infamous it had needed all her sense of the confidence her father placed in him and of the authority to act for him which he had delegated to him to stop her from saying something so cuttingly rude that even he could not have consented to swallow the insult and remain on she did mr bickerdike as we know a sad injustice the truth was one suspects that in all this business of his friends exoneration the unhappy gentleman was flying in the face of his own conscience and doing it for pure loyaltys sake he could not quite bring himself to argue against appearances in the justices sense but he hoped and he tried to take a rosy view of his own hopes it was not to be expected of him or of his disposition that he should feel or express that blind and incorrigible staunchness to an ideal natural in a devoted blood relation yet it should be counted to him that he was staunch too and on behalf of a cause which in his heart he mistrusted perhaps his suspicions anent the baron were conceived more in a desperate attempt to discover a way out for his friend than in any spirit of strong belief in their justification but audrey was prejudiced against him and the prejudices of young people are like their loves unreasoning and devastating she was very miserable poor girl proud friendless solitary essentially companionable by nature the social restrictions of her state man administered had deprived her of all warm intimacies among her own sex she was not allowed to know those she would have liked to know the few selected for her acquaintance she detested there was none to whom she could appeal for understanding or sympathy repellent to them all in her pride was it likely they would spare her in her humiliation the very thought made her hold her head high and filled her heart with a hard defiance nobody cared nobody believed but herself and her father poor hughie to be so admired and courted in prosperity so slandered and abandoned in adversity never mind the truth would be known presently and then the humiliation would be theirs who had unwittingly betrayed their own abject natures she crossed the high road and entering the thickets beyond proceeded in a direction almost due west that way lay the least association with all the squalid events of the past few weeks and she knew that if she pushed on over the boundaries of wildshott she would come presently to a place of quiet woods and streams and easeful solitudes she wanted to avoid any possibility of contact with her fellow creatures and to be alone it was a glowing september day when everything save her own unquiet heart seemed resolved into an eternal serenity of peace and happiness never again to be broken the coney had lain down with the fox and the stoat the ageing bracken had renewed its youth in a sparkling vesture of diamond mist the birds were singing as if a dream spring had surprised them in the very thought of hybernating presently going among trees audrey came out on the lip of a little shelving dingle at whose foot ran a full bountiful stream watering a wooded valley and at once she paused because the figure of a small sturdy boy was visible below her busy about a spot where a tiny fall plunged frothing and merry making into a pool which it tried to brim and could not she paused watching the figure and suddenly driven by some inexplicable impulse she was going quickly down the slope to speak to it it was a revulsion of feeling a sob for a voice in the wilderness a cry to give herself just one more chance before she flung away the world and took loneliness for her eternal doom the boy hearing her coming lifted his head then rose to his feet he had been engaged over a fly rod which he held in his hand mornin miss he said grinning and saluting are you fishing jacob me and the master miss hell be back in a minute hen been whipping the stream up ways her lip curled ever so slightly there might be better occupation than fishing for a man who cared hes thinking said jake thinking she echoed scornfully yesm he says to me he says jacob fishing helps a man to think and what dyou suppose ive been thinking about jacob well why who it was as killed annie evans he says the boy looked up shyly we knows anyhow as it werent master hugo miss do you did he say that jacob she spoke softly with a wonderful new glow about her heart yesm said the boy he did that you should ha heard him yesterday giving squire redwood the lie we was hunting otter miss and was on to his spraints when squire said something bad about master hugo as caught sir franciss ear he went up to him he did and he told him hed lay his good ash spear across his shoulders unless he withdrew the expression redwood that great powerful bully cried miss kennett yesm and squire looked that frit it might ha been a boggle had sudden come to life and faced him but he did what he was told and saved his shoulders he did he did she put her hands up to her throat a moment as if to strangle the emotion that would not be suppressed and in the act heard his footstep and turned he came with wonder and pleasure in his face audrey he exclaimed what good luck has brought you here i dont know frank she answered a little wildly but it is good luck and i thank it why do you who hate hunting hunt otters sir because they kill my fish he replied promptly and so spoil your thinking i suppose she said he seemed to understand in a moment and his face flushed jake has been t talking has he he said jake im ashamed of you and did redwood save his big shoulders she asked jake cried his master reproachfully she laughed and sobbed together frank will you leave your things here and come a little way with me please o audrey you know not only a little way if it could be they walked together along the green bank of the stream from sunlight into luminous shadow and forth again parting the branches sometimes always with the water like a merry child running and talking beside them suddenly she stopped and turned upon him if it could be she said repeating his words that is to say if i had not a murderer for a brother he cried out good god what do you mean hugh is not a murderer you declare it in spite of all frank all what i know him and thats enough for me for me yes and for you o frank she could not keep them back they came irresistibly and rolled down her cheeks you dont know what you have done what you have lifted from my heart and i said you were not a man like him o forgive me frank dear hush he said he took her arm and tucked it close and comfortable under his and led her on i am not if it comes to that he said you dont mean that unkindly no you never would of course but i can be glad to think it now glad that you are not he is not good frank i should hate him for what he has done i can say it to you now if he were not suffering so dreadfully for what he has not done i know audrey poor fellow for what he has not done that is the point how are we going to p prove it i have been pushing some private inquiries for my part about that mysterious figure seen or not seen by henstridge on the hill i cant get it out of my head that there really was such a figure and that if we could only t trace it we should hold the clue to the riddle have you been doing that frank and i thought you had forsaken us like the rest that was ungenerous of you audrey dear i should have come and told you only i was delicate of starting you perhaps on a false scent and thought it better to w wait till i had something definite to offer frank did you read of the inquest i was present at it in the background o do you remember the master of the poor man who was supposed then le sage i should think i do his b benevolent truthfulness was a thing to wonder over i think it is he and i are great friends he is away for the moment but when he comes back i wish you would let me introduce you to him why audrey i know him already have you forgotten hansons cottage and our talk about the poachers a r remarkably shrewd old file i thought him so he is i have such faith in him somehow somehow i feel that all will come right when he returns i do wish he would it is all so dreadful waiting will you tell him about your theory when he does of course i will dont go yet audrey she had stopped yes frank i am going i feel that every moment taken from your fishing is robbing hughie of a chance audrey after what youve said poor hugh ill not be thought a man at his expense but are you going to let me hope just a little again are you serious dear his sister think a m martyrs sister the greater honour mine she could not help a little laugh over the picture of hugh a martyr i love you frank she said but not quite that way well i love you all ways he answered so that any little defect in yours is provided for how good you are to me she sighed if its to be thought of it must not be on any consideration till hugh is cleared agreed he cried joyously then we are as g good as engaged already you dear she said and jumped at him i will kiss you once for that no put your hands down handy pandy sugary candy and there sir and now please to go back to your fishing she smiled to him and hurried away a fine pink on her cheek after the rain fine weather after despair reassurance she was not alone she had these two good staunch friends frank and little jacob to stand by her her heart was singing with the birds sparkling with the mist when she reached home she found another comfort to greet her mr bickerdike had already started for london then she did a queer shame faced thing in a queer shame faced way she got out some old dogs eared music long forgotten childish exercises and sat down to the piano to try if she could remember them she played very softly in a young stumbling fashion all stiff fingers and whispering lips it did not come naturally to her and she had long arrears of neglect to make good but she persevered if it was a question of qualifying herself for the intellectual life she must not throw up the sponge at the first round after a strenuous hour she had more or less mastered no exercise for two hands in czernys first course and had got so far on the road to audley chapter xviii the baron returns from the bickerdike ms i had a long and interesting interview with sir calvins lawyers when i used the occasion to unburden my mind of some of the misgivings which had been disturbing it i spoke theoretically of course and without prejudice and no doubt considerably impressed my hearers who were very earnest with me to keep my own counsel in the matter until one of the partners could run down which he would do in the course of a few days to examine into all the circumstances of the case on the spot and above all not to let the baron guess that he was in any way an object of my suspicion they had of course heard of the murder and its sequel and had been expecting their clients instructions for the defence they were very sympathetic but naturally cautious about advancing any opinion one way or the other at this stage of the affair and the gist of the matter was relegated for discussion in diem i do not however describe the interview at greater length for the simple reason that as things came to turn out it bore no eventual fruit but that will appear i stayed three nights in town and returned to wildshott on the fourth day from my leaving it going to sir calvins study straightway and being bidden to enter what was my chagrin and astonishment to find the baron already in the room before me having anticipated my own return by some twelve hours or so he was seated talking with his host on some matter of grave import i at once assumed from the serious expression on the faces of the two even le sages habitual levity appeared subdued while as to the general i thought he looked like a man in process of rallying from some great shock or recent illness he sat with his head hunched into his shoulders all the starch gone from him and with a fixed white stare in his eyes as if he were battling with some inward torment what had the man been saying or doing to him my gorge rose i was seized with a fierce anger and foreboding was i witnessing the effects of that very villain blow so apprehended by me as in course of preparing when that significant journey to london was first announced my eyes instinctively hawking for evidence pounced on the embrasure which contained the safe the curtain was drawn aside the door open and on the table near sir calvin stood a packet of papers the tape which had bound them fallen to the carpet had he by chance been learning for the first time of his loss and too late i was tired and my temper perhaps was short in my infinite disgust at discovering how this man had stolen a march on me i made little attempt to control it what you back i exclaimed for my only greeting and you he responded placidly this is a happy coincidence mr bickerdike i passed him and went to shake sir calvin by the hand the look of my poor friend as he gave me formal welcome inflamed my anger to that degree that i could contain myself no longer i felt too that the moment had come that it would be criminal in myself to postpone it longer that i must give this fellow to understand that his villainy had not passed wholly undetected and unrecorded forgetting i confess in my exasperation my promise to the lawyers i turned on him in an irresistible impulse of passion how sir i said have you succeeded in reducing my friend the general to this state there followed a moments startled silence and then sir calvin stiffened and sat up and cleared his throat bickerdike he said dont be a damned ass thats as it may be sir i said now in a towering rage you shall judge of the extent of my folly when you have heard what i insist upon making known to you he sat looking at me in a frowning wondering sort of way then shrugged his shoulders very well if you insist he said i have no alternative i answered if i am to do my duty as i consider it at this crucial pass when the life of a dear friend hangs in the balance all stuff of punctilio must be let go to the winds if i hold the opinion that an evil influence is at work in this house operating somehow to sinister but mysterious ends it would be wickedness on my part to withhold the evidence on which that opinion is founded i do think such an influence is at work and i claim the condition in which i now find you as some justification for my belief you are quite mistaken said my host utterly mistaken i bowed very well sir and i only wish i were as mistaken about the character of this gentleman whom you have admitted to your acquaintance and your hospitality sir calvin looked at le sage who sat still all this time with a perfectly unruffled countenance he laughed now good humouredly and bent forward to take a pinch of snuff come come mr bickerdike he expostulated brushing the dust from his waistcoat of what do you accuse me that is soon said i answered and said more easily than one can explain the general impression of underhandedness one receives from you i intend to be explicit and i accuse you to your face of having secretly left your room one midnight when the house was asleep i gave the date and stolen a paper from sir calvins desk here he looked at me oddly to be sure he said do you know mr bickerdike your half face looking round the post that night reminded me so ludicrously of those divided portraits one sees in picture restorers shops that i was near bursting into laughter you may have eyes in your ears i cried rallying from the shock but that is not an answer to my charge he turned to sir calvin the sixty four knight move problem you remember i told you that not being able to sleep i had come down to borrow it from your desk and work it out in the small hours the general nodded and looked at me upon my word bickerdike he said you mustnt bring these unfounded charges i dont know whats put this stuff about the baron into your head but you must understand that hes my very good friend and much better known to me than he seems to be to you come if i were you id just apologize and say no more about it it was the collapse of my life i will own to it fairly and save my credit at least for a sense of humour to think that all this time i had been building such a structure on such a foundation i was bitterly mortified bitterly humbled but i trust that i did the gentlemanly thing in at once accepting sir calvins advice i went straight up to the baron and apologized it seems ive been making a fool of myself i said and i know how that must distress you he answered heartily think no more about it your motive has been all through an excellent one to help your friend at somebody elses expense and if ive failed you at a pinch its not for want of a real good try on your part and as to my underhand ways o they necessarily disappear with the rest i interrupted him when ones moon stricken one sees a bogey in every bush well well said sir calvin impatiently thats enough said we hadnt quite done our talk when you came in bickerdike shut the door when you go out theres a good fellow the hint was plain to starkness i slunk away feeling my tail between my legs in the hall to add to my discomfiture i came upon audrey her face fell on seeing me o have you come back she said in a discharmed voice fairly paying me with my own bad coin yes i said and now i have everybody seems to love me she looked at me queerly the baron has returned too isnt that delightful she laughed and moved away then came again on a mischievous thought o by the by there was another thing i might have told you about him the other day all the half crowns he wins at chess he puts into a benevolent fund for poor chess players he says a half crown on a game is like a benedictine neither too much nor too little it is just enough to bring out the brilliancy in a player without intoxicating him i said meekly yes audrey i expect he is very right and it is a good thought of his for the poor professors she stood staring at me a moment said what is the matter with you then turned away moving much more slowly than before all the wind seemed knocked out of me by this blow and i remained in a very depressed mood it was my greatest mortification to realize on what vain and empty illusions i had been building a case for my friend i will do myself so much justice but whatever i planned seemed to go wrong i had better retire i thought and leave it to better heads than mine to grapple with the problem nor did my amour propre achieve any particular reinstatement for itself from my interview with sir calvin on the subject of my journey made entirely on his behalf i found him when at length he called me to it very distrait and i thought not particularly interested in what i had to tell him he seemed to listen attentively but in fact his answers proved that he had done nothing of the sort everything since my return appeared somehow wrong and peculiar it might have struck one almost as if a cloud had passed away and a threatened tempest been forgotten and yet hugo was in his prison and nothing new that i could see had happened i told his father as he had asked me to do about the circumstances of his wrong doing and even in that failed greatly to interest the general he did not appear to be particularly shocked no doubt his principles in such respects were old fashioned and took for their text that licentious proverb which in the name of love and war exempts a gentleman from those bonds of truth and honour which alone make him one he was in a strange state altogether distraught nervous excited by turns and yet always with a look about him which i should have described as exultant pride at high tension what was the meaning of everything during the following day or two i kept myself studiously in the background proffering no opinions on anything and only pleading mutely to be put to any use i could reasonably serve my attitude commended itself to audrey at last frank and the baron she once said to me have been meeting and having a long talk together i wonder if you will disapprove mr bickerdike two heads are better than one i answered and as good as three when the barons is counted in im not sure you werent right audrey and that im not a worse judge of character than i supposed she looked at me in that queer way of hers thats jolly decent of you she said and so ill say the same to you its something to be a gentleman after all cryptic but meant to be propitiatory i forgave her she had recovered her spirits wonderfully she knew or felt i think that something was in the air though she could not tell what and it made her confident and happy i fancy it was her dear friend the baron who kept her on that prick of expectancy without quite letting her into the secret sometimes now she would even condescend to speak with me do you know she said one day that sergeant ridgway is coming down again from scotland yard to see us no i exclaimed he cant have the atrocious bad taste o but he is she said the first commissioner or the public prosecutor or the lord high executioner or somebody isnt satisfied with henstridges evidence and hes got to come down and go through all that part of it again hes to be here to morrow to see my father at two oclock well i said i hope we shant run across one another thats all no she answered in a rather funny way i dont suppose you exactly love him i will say no more since i have reached the threshold of that extraordinary event which was to falsify at a blow every theory which i in common with hundreds of others had built up and elaborated about the wildshott murder case chapter xix the dark horse sergeant ridgway turning up punctually to his appointment was shown into sir calvins study where he found not his former employer but the baron le sage seated alone characteristically the detective showed as little surprise at seeing who awaited him as he did embarrassment over his return to a house whose hospitality he had according to mr bickerdike so cruelly abused he could have understood no doubt no reason for his feeling any his commission had been to discover the murderer of annie evans and according to the best of his lights he had executed that commission it was not his fault if it had led him in a direction tragically counter to the expectations of his employer he had been engaged for a particular purpose and he had dutifully pursued that purpose inevitably if unfortunately to a regrettable end but sentiment could not be allowed to affect the detectival philosophy or the law became a dead letter in professional matters he was and had to be a simple automaton wherefore no sign of uneasiness was visible in his expression as he entered the room nor was there discernible there a trace of animus of any sort he was quite prepared if necessary to own himself in the wrong his high superiors had expressed themselves as dissatisfied with a certain portion of the evidence very well he would bow to their scruples and make a thorough re investigation of that part of the case he understood that the landlord of the red deer inn had been warned and was to meet him here this afternoon personally he did not hope much from the interview or attach great importance to a rumour which he understood had got about since the inquest but whether that rumour embodied a fact or proved on examination as unsubstantial as most canards of its kind the finding of the murderer of annie evans remained as it had been his sole object and purpose in undertaking the case all this or the moral gist of it the detective took it upon himself to explain to the baron in the course of the brief conversation which ensued between them he spoke drily deliberately as if measuring out his words rather with the air of plain stating a professional view point and instructing counsel than of asking for sympathy his hearer made a curious study of him the while wondering and calculating why he was being chosen the recipient of this extrajudicial confidence perhaps after all there was a thought more embarrassment under the surface than the other cared to admit perhaps just a hint of a human desire to make a friend in a difficult pass for the rest it was the familiar figure of their knowledge which had returned upon them keen handsome dark eyed economical of speech potent in suggestion of a certain inscrutable order of mentality and exhibiting as always that faint discrepancy between mind and material distinction in the one a touch of theatricalism and vulgarity in the other le sage took him up on one point the baron who was looking extraordinarily pink and cheery had already explained that sir calvin was engaged with a visitor in another room and had asked him to receive and entertain the sergeant during the short period of his absence am i to be allowed to opine he said with a smile that the rumour to which you refer bears upon your instructions and is connected somehow with mr cleghorns mysterious double the detective looked at the speaker curiously meaning he said meaning that supposititious figure on the hill about which mr fyler was so inquisitive at the inquest but which he seemed most unaccountably to overlook before the magistrates ah said the detective drily i expect hed come to the conclusion which was my own that it wasnt really worth another thought o so im mistaken in fancying any association between that and your particular mission well well it shall be a lesson to my self sufficiency by the by sergeant weve never had our long deferred game of chess what do you say to a duel now while were waiting no time sir chess takes a lot of thought so it does but it can be sampled in a problem these tests are rather a weakness of mine look here he led the way to the window which it being a mild warm day stood wide open and in which was placed the usual table with the board on it and half a dozen pieces on the squares theres a neat one i flatter myself i was at work on it when you came in black knight or dark horse shall we call it to play and mate in three moves take the opposition and see if you can prevent it he moved the knight mechanically the detective put down his hand and responded with a bishop at the barons third move the other looked up and looked his adversary full in the face le sage had stepped back he had a way sometimes of thrusting his hands into the tail pockets of his coat and bringing them round in front of him so he stood now with a curious smile on his lips dark horse wins said he my mate i think sergeant john ridgway the door opened with the word spoken pretty loudly and there came quickly into the room an inspector and two constables of the local police followed by sir calvin and another gentleman i have the pleasure said m le baron to the new comers of introducing to you the murderer of annie evans alias ivy mellor he had hardly spoken when the detective turned and leapt for the open window the table which stood between him and escape went down with a crash he had his foot on the sill when a shot slammed out and he stumbled and fell back into the room the barons bullet had caught him neatly on the heel of his shoe knocking his leg from under him at the critical moment before he could rise the police were on him and he was handcuffed and helpless a clean shot though i say it said the baron coolly as he returned the revolver to his pocket no hes not hurt though i may have galled his kibe look out for him there they had need to they had got the man to his feet and were holding him as if in doubt whether he needed support or not when he resolved the question for them and in unmistakable fashion this way and that foaming snarling tearing with his manacled hands now diving head foremost now nearly free and caught back again into the human maelstrom three stout men as they were they had a hard ado to keep and restrain him but they got him exhausted and quiet at last and he stood among them torn and dishevelled his chest heaving convulsively dribbling at the mouth his face like nothing human you you he gasped glaring at his denouncer if i had only guessed if i had only known it would have been short shrift for me i expect said the baron shrewdly it would said the prisoner that inn keeper it was you contrived the trap was it you damned smiling traitor the mortal vehemence he put into it what i had always suspected but could never quite unmask thought le sage the dramatic fire vicious and dangerous banked down but breaking loose now and again and roaring into uncontrollable flame the second gentleman who was in fact the chief constable of the county put in a reproving word come ridgway keep a civil tongue in your head my man the detective laughed like a devil civility you old fool if words could blister him id ransack hells language for them till he curled and shrivelled up before me well said the gentleman reasonably youre not improving your case you know by all this my case cried the other ive got none it was always a gamble and i knew it well enough from the first but id have pulled it through if it hadnt been for him id have pulled it through and hanged my fine gentleman his son there as sure as theres a god of vengeance in the world he wrenched himself in the hold that gripped him and bare chested snarling like a dog in a leash flung forward to denounce the father curse you do you hear id have ruined and hanged that whelp of yours as surely as he ruined and murdered the girl that was mine till he debauched and stole her from me when i put the shot into her it was as truly his hand that fired it as if his finger had pulled on the trigger shed betrayed me and it was him that led her to it and by doing so made himself responsible for the consequences the inspector thought it right here to utter the usual official warning it was curious to note in his tone as he did so a suspicion of deference almost of apology such as might characterise a schoolboy forced to bear witness against his headmaster ridgway turned on him with a jeering oath you can save your breath cully that devil spoke true it was i killed ivy mellor and him that old dogs son that ought to hang for it m le baron spoke up is it necessary to go further gentlemen since he confesses to the double crime i think not said the chief constable remove him inspector the three closed about the prisoner who submitted quietly to being taken away but he forced a stop a moment as he passed by sir calvin who greatly overcome had sunk into a chair the baron leaning above him and spoke with some faint return to reason and self control i dont know how much you think youve found out youve got to prove it mind no confession counts to hang a man unless theres proof to back it par exemple said the baron looking up a skeleton key a coat button a packet of letters a false character a falser impersonation a proposed disinheritance and to end all a confederate murdered and the plot to hang an innocent man for the deed altogether a very pretty little list my friend ridgway to those who held him seemed to stagger slightly he stood gazing with haggard eyes into the face of this deadly jocular nemesis who so utterly unsuspected by him had all this time it appeared while he smiled and smiled been silently weaving his toils about his feet he had not a word to answer but a sort of stupor of horror grew into his expression as if for the first time a cold mortal fear were beginning to possess him then suddenly he stiffened erect turned and passed mutely out of the room the chief constable lingered behind a moment come calvin old man he said pull yourself together the things over and well over thanks to your wonderful friend here by george as remarkable a shot sir as you are a strategist i dont know which i admired most the way you stalked your quarry or the way you brought him down really quite simple little matters of deduction and sighting answered the baron beaming deprecation if you make a practice as i do of never loosening your bolt in either case till youre sure of your aim ha said the gentleman well i congratulate you calvin and i congratulate us all on this happy termination to a very distressing business i hope now the order of release wont be long in coming and that your poor unfortunate lad will be restored to you before many hours have passed a pallid but wondering face peered round the door may i come in said mr bickerdike chapter xx the baron lays his cards on the table sir francis orsden and the baron le sage walked slowly up the kitchen garden together it was a windless autumn morning such serene and gracious weather as had prevailed now for some days and the primroses under the wall were already putting forth a little precocious blossom or two feeling for the spring there was a balm in the air and a softness in the soil which communicated themselves to the human fibre reawakening it as it were to a sense of new life out of old distress such feelings men might have who have landed from perilous seas upon a smiling shore the two talked earnestly as they strolled on a subject necessarily the most prominent in their minds said le sage are we not a little apt to judge a man by his business as that a lawyer must be unfeeling a butcher cruel a doctor humane and a sweep dishonest but it is not his profession which makes a man what he is but the man who makes his profession what it appears in him a lawyer does not appropriate trust funds because he is a lawyer but because he is a gambler so a detective is not impeccable because he is a detective but because he is an honest man you wonder that he can be at the same time a detective and a desperate criminal well i dont ah youve got a reason just this what is in that lawyers mind when he steals imagination it leaps the dark abyss to wing for the golden peaks beyond where easy restitution passed it sees its dreams fulfilled what was in ridgways mind when he planned his tremendous venture imagination again it may be the angel or the devil of a piece spur a pegasus or ride a broomstick the butcher the baker the candlestick maker may any of them have it and still be the butcher the baker and the candlestick maker the last thing of which a lawyer as a lawyer would be guilty would be the bringing himself within the grasp of the law the last thing of which a detective as a detective would be guilty would be the making himself a subject for detection what induces either of them then to sin against the logic of his own profession imagination alone and always the primary impulse to everything that is good and bad in the world a man may be blessed with it or he may be cursed contain it in his being like the seed of beauty or the seed of dipsomania and ridgway like the latter it would seem so the man is by nature a romantic i once got a glimpse of the truth in a conversation i had with him what flashed upon me in that momentary lifting of the veil was a revelation of fierce vision immense passion it was like taking a stethoscope to a mans heart and surprising its secret a d diseased heart eh one may say so diseased with imagination which is like an aneurism often unsuspected and undetectable until put to some sudden strain it bursts in blood you mean in this case i mean that the murder was not premeditated that is my sure conviction it was the result of a sudden frenzied impulse finding the means ready to its hand the man had plotted but not that why should he since it meant the ruin of his visions ah you forget baron we will come to that what i want to impress upon you at the outset is that ridgway was at soul a gambler circumstance accident may have made him a detective if it had made him a bishop it would have been all the same that fire that energy kept under and banked down would as surely have roared into flame the moment fate drew out the damper that moment came and with it the vision he saw in it certain hazards leading to certain ruin or certain fortune like a gambler he counted the cost and took the odds since they seemed worth to him what he failed to count on was a certain contingency which a less imaginative man than he might have foreseen the possible treachery of a confederate and such a confederate exactly it was to sin most vilely against all his instinctive code and worse it was to stab him with a double edged dagger i th think i can pity him for that and so can i and for this reason coolness is or should be the first quality of a gambler gamblers for that reason do not easily fall in love but when they do fall they fall hard they fall headlong they do not so much fall as plunge as a gambler plunges all heaven or all hell the stake there is no doubt that ridgways passion for this girl was a true gamblers passion to gain or lose her meant heaven or hell to him i can quite believe it baron but d damn it how much longer are you going to keep me on tenterhooks le sage laughed they had been strolling and pausing and strolling again until they had approached by degrees the upper boundary of the estate where amid great bushes of lavender and sweet marjoram stood a substantial thatched summer house cosily convenient for the view let us go and sit in there he said and i will unfold my tale without further preamble as he spoke a figure dodging about among the raspberry canes came into view hullo cried orsden bickerdike whats he doing here i think i know said the baron he went over to the elaborately unconscious gentleman who pretending to see him for the first time glanced up with a start and an expression of surprise which would not have deceived a town idiot and accosted him genially looking for anything mr bickerdike just the chance of a late raspberry the birds may have left was the answer o i wonder if i can provide any fruit as much to your taste you havent a half hour to spare i suppose mr bickerdike came promptly out from among the canes certainly he said i am quite at your service what is it only that i am under promise to sir francis to unfold for his delectation the story of a certain mystery and the steps by which i came to arrive at its elucidation it occurs to me but of course if it would bore you not at all i am all eagerness to hear well it occurs to me that you have a leading title to the information if you care to claim it since it was in your company that i found my first clue to the riddle was it indeed baron you excite me immensely what was that let us all go in here and i will tell you they entered the summer house and seated themselves on the semi hexagonal bench which enclosed a stout rustic table now said sir francis his eyes sparkling out with it every bit baron and give our hungering souls to feed le sage took a pinch of snuff laid the box handy dusted his plump knees with his handkerchief and leaning back and loosely twining his fingers before him began i have this my friends to say to you both before i start what i have to tell my story and not the most creditable part of it is fundamentally concerned with one about whom it might be thought my obligations as his guest should keep me silent that would be quite true were it not for a single consideration so vital as to constitute in itself a complete moral justification of my candour in a few days or weeks the whole will be common property and that figure subjected i fear to a pharisaic criticism which will be none the more bitter for his friends having anticipated it and rallied about him moreover he himself has bound me to no sort of silence in the matter but on the contrary has rather intimated to me that he leaves to my discretion the choice and manner of his defence or apologia it may be admitted perhaps that he does not see these things quite from our point of view he derives from another generation and another code of morals but for what he is or has been he has paid a very severe penalty and we must judge him now by what he has suffered rather than by what he has deserved so much for this confidence which i beg you to consider is still though unenforced a confidence due to you sir francis through your coming matrimonial connexion with the family mr bickerdike with a start and a positive gape which lifted his eyebrows looked across at the young baronet who grinned and nodded and to you my friend for your unshakable loyalty to a much tried member of it and with that i will quit grace and get to the joint the macuba came once more into action the box was again laid aside and the two settled down finally to listen in the following narrative said m le baron what was and remains conjectural it must be left to events to substantiate i claim so much though for myself i entertain no doubt as to the truth my story opens in the caf lunivers in paris where we two mr bickerdike strangers to one another were sitting one september afternoon precisely a year ago we got into talk on the subject of a neighbour an artist and an object of interest to us both who was busily engaged in sketching into a book pencil memoranda of the more noticeable hats worn by passing ladies he worked fast and cleverly and was manifestly an adept at his craft presently after having watched him for some time i asked you if you had observed anything peculiar about his hands you had not it seemed and no more was said but there was a peculiarity and it was this when he lifted his right hand as artists will do to measure the perspective value of an object it was always the second finger of the hand which he interposed before his eye i watched him do it over and over again and it was persistently the same why i found myself asking myself was the trick due to some malformation of the first finger or to some congenital impulse not to the first i was presently able to convince myself to the alternative proposition i was fated to receive an answer both affirmative and illuminating but it was not to come just yet you remember what followed the stranger suddenly closed his book rose started to cross the road and was promptly knocked down and run over by a passing cab i hurried to his assistance and found that he was pretty badly injured he was lifted into the cab and accompanied by myself and a gendarme was conveyed to the st antoine hospital in which he remained for some weeks both there and in his own apartments after his discharge i visited him frequently and was able to show him some small attentions such as in our relative positions mere humanity demanded of me he was poor in his art an enthusiast and very little sympathy was needed to win his general confidence his name was john ridgway the two listeners glanced at one another in a puzzled questioning way but neither would venture to interrupt and the baron continued he was john and ridgway pronounced reedsvay but for the sake of a necessary distinction i will call him henceforth jean jean lived with a friend caliste ribault in two rooms in the rue bourbon le chteau a little dull out of the way street in the latin quarter they both worked for a living on the petit courrier des dames but with jean it was a weariness and a humiliation and always he had before his eyes the prospect of ultimate manumission and recognition he was an artist from his soul outwards to his finger tips but alas his immortality was destined to be of sooner arrival he never properly overcame the effects of his accident and last june he succumbed to them and left his friend alone now in the course of our conversations jean had told me a strange story about himself a story which i never knew at the time whether to credit or to part credit or to attribute entirely to the invention of an imaginative nature born ostensibly of humble parentage he was in reality he said the legitimate son of an english officer of wealth and distinction whose name he could claim and whose heir he could prove himself to be contingent on the production of certain documentary evidence which he knew to exist but which since it remained in the possession of the putative father it was impossible to cite this alleged evidence touched upon the question of a sham marriage a clerical impostor officiating which had turned out to be a true marriage and the names of the contracting parties were recorded with that of the clergyman in question as witness on the fly leaf of a little roman catholic vade mecum which had belonged to jeans mother but of which her would be wronger had secured possession and which he retained to this day so much jean told me omitting only the fathers name which he withheld he queerly stated from a feeling of jealous pride for the honour of that which was his own honour but which was presently to be suggested to me in a very singular fashion you may perhaps recall mr bickerdike how at dinner on the night of our first arrival here our host in answer to some observation of mine about a certain picture hanging on the wall raised the second finger of his right hand before his eye to test an alleged misproportion in one of the figures of the composition the action though of course i was already familiar with sir calvins injury instantly arrested my attention a vision of the caf lunivers and of the busy hat sketcher leapt irresistibly into my mind i saw again the lifted second finger and i saw with astonishment what lacking that clue had never yet so much as occurred or suggested itself to me the existence of a subtle but definite family likeness between the two men that sign manual had solved the problem of paternity and given some colour at least to my friends romantic tale let me put it quite clearly before me sat as i was convinced the father of the man in paris calling himself john ridgway but who claimed the right on whatever disputable grounds to call himself if he would john kennett judge of my feelings from that moment i was possessed of a piece of knowledge whose significance i could not then foresee but which was already half consciously associating itself in my mind with that other curious discovery that a well known detective who bore the very same name as my friend was operating on a case somewhere in the neighbourhood to return now to jeans story and my natural comments thereon i asked him assuming for the occasion the truth of his statement if he had never made an endeavour to assert his rights and if not why not his answer did not strike me then as convincing though i had full reason later to alter my opinion to attempt and fail he said would be merely to disinter a long buried scandal and expose to renewed odium the character of a mother whom he fondly loved moreover for himself he had no ambitions save such as centred in his art to which he was wholly devoted nor any nerve or desire to take that position in the world to which his birth entitled him she had told him the story one day on the occasion of one of his rare visits to england where she lived when she was lying very ill thinking it right that he should know and leaving it to him to decide for himself what action in the event of her death he should take or not take in the matter she was i understood a woman of french origin in modest circumstances and many years the widow of a quartermaster sergeant in the british army from that necessitous household jean himself had early broken away to follow his bent in paris in which city he had remained working and struggling for a livelihood ever since the days of his adolescence he was a man of twenty eight when i knew him there for the present i will leave jeans story turning from it to a subject of more immediate interest to you namely the murder of ivy mellor and the methods by which i was enabled to bring the crime home to the actual delinquent i can claim no particular credit for my part in the business destiny acting blindly or providentially as you will had woven about me as a web is woven about a spider a most extraordinary concatenation of coincidences from whose central observation point i was able as it were to command all strands of the design my casual encounter with mr bickerdike in paris the discovery that he was there to meet mr kennett the son of a gentleman already slightly known to me the accident witnessed by us my subsequent visits to the patient and his confiding to me of his story my second meeting with mr bickerdike in london and the coincidence of our common invitation to wildshott the act which betrayed jeans father to me and seemed to confirm the truth of the mans story the news that a second john ridgway was at work in the neighbourhood in all this considered alone there lay some grounds perhaps for wondering entertainment but surely none for suspicion it was only when the murder occurred that any thought of a connexion amongst the parts flashed inevitably into my mind and since fate had placed if in any hands in mine what clues might exist to the truth i was determined from that moment to pursue them to the end the key to it i found in a skeleton key again the macuba came into requisition and again the baron savoured over a refreshing pinch the excitement of his hearers a skeleton key he repeated i discovered it before ever sergeant john ridgway had had a chance of looking for it on the very spot where the poor things body had lain it must have been jerked from her hand she had probably just produced it from her pocket by the shot which killed her and had remained there undetected during and after her removal i was fortunate in securing it only a few minutes before the sergeant came down to examine the place of the crime now what had annie evans to do with a skeleton key she a modest servant girl of irreproachable character as the housekeeper had just informed us i examined the key it was of the usual burglarious pattern seemed newly turned had a slight flaw or projection on the barrel end and was splashed with an ugly bluebeard red had annie after all been quite the impeccable person mrs bingley supposed i wondered i thought of the manner of her engagement of her untraceable connexions and i wondered i wondered still at the inquest when as it seemed those same relations were still hopelessly to seek i wondered no longer when on the day following the inquiry i came upon the sergeant intently examining the ground about the scene of the crime i came upon him unexpectedly and surprised him what was he looking for he had already overhauled every detail of the girls belongings had he missed something which he had expected to find among them a skeleton key possibly but how could he have known she possessed such a thing obviously there was only one answer because he himself had provided her with it for what reason he john ridgway naturally my mind flew off at a tangent to the other john ridgway my parisian jean and his extraordinary story a reputedly sham marriage which nevertheless had turned out genuine documents in proof and their possessor my host was it conceivable that this john ridgway was interested in the recovery of those documents and had employed a female confederate to steal them for him it was quite conceivable and quite true for that as appeared by degrees was actually the case but why was this john ridgway interested in the recovery of those papers we shall see in the meanwhile to what conviction had my reflections led me that the detective and the girl were in collusion for a certain purpose but much was to be deduced from that conviction that the girl was an imposter that she had secured her situation very possibly by means of a false character written by herself or her confederate that quite certainly her name was not annie evans at all hence the calculated impossibility of tracing out her connexions so far then so good we come now to the frustrated business of the theft and the crime which was its terrible consequence it had inevitably occurred to me that the safe in sir calvins study must be the repository and known by the confederates to be the repository of the papers in question else if of easier access they had long ago been abstracted and used to serve their purpose probably as it appeared to me the girls first business had been to secure an impression of the keyhole in wax which she had despatched to ridgway receiving back from him in exchange the master key i seized an opportunity to examine the safe and detected about the spot in question certain faint marks or scratches in the paint which i had once before taken some curious stock of and which i now perceived might well correspond with that little sharp projection i spoke of at the end of the key i even once tried the key in the lock myself that was on the night mr bickerdike when you stalked me poor vivian looked unutterably foolish but without detecting me in my second descent which occurred after you had returned to your room and found it easy to manipulate then the girl had already been secretly at work there fumbling her job maybe but why in that case had she not secured the plunder given notice to leave and at once cleared out because as it was perfectly legitimate to infer from the evidence at the inquest she had in the meantime fallen desperately in love with our young friend and had refused to take any further part in a transaction designed to dispossess him of his name and inheritance now that is to anticipate matters a little perhaps but grant my deduction sound as indeed it proved to be and what followed necessarily a breach between the two confederates of a very violent nature to the detective it meant betrayal and the ruin of his plans would that consideration be enough in itself to goad him on to murder with a man of ridgways character and trained cautiousness of disposition i did not think it probable assuming then that the murder were his act what more overmastering motive could have driven him to it what but jealousy the one passion uncontrollable by even the most self disciplining nature he was himself passionately enamoured of his own beautiful decoy and she had betrayed not only his interests but his love the crime had been in the expressive french phrase and in the fullest sense a crime passionel i had it to figure the course of events even was now no difficult task for the imagination we will begin with mrs bingleys timely advertisement for a housemaid upon which the confederates happened and which gave them perhaps suggested to them the very opportunity they desired once the girl was established in the house the two corresponded we know that she received letters though none could be found after her death of course not she would have taken scrupulous care to destroy all such incriminating evidence including the fraudulent character but they corresponded and probably on her part very early in a tone which gave her accomplice to suspect with growing uneasiness that all was not right with her accident it could have been nothing else brought him down professionally and opportunely into this part of the country he took the occasion to write and arrange for a secret personal interview with her we had it from the housekeeper that a letter was received by annie quite shortly before her death and she answered appointing the bishops walk for their place of meeting of that i have no doubt she was there to keep her engagement with ridgway and not to waylay the other his appearance on the scene was quite fortuitous and as it turned out the most fateful contretemps that could have happened he came and we know from his own confession what passed between them with what she upbraided him and with what threatened ridgway had overheard it all he had arrived at the place duly to his appointment and on his first entering the copse had probably heard or perhaps caught distant sight of the other male figure coming his way and had slipped into the thick undergrowth for concealment his propinquity unsuspected by the girl she had delivered herself in his hearing of her deadly secret and he knew at last of her double treachery to him the lover gone he came out of his ambush and damned her with the truth likely even then it was the presence of the gun so adversely left to his hand which compelled him to the deed it was the act of a demented moment unthinking and unpremeditated it was not until reason had returned to him that the idea of the diabolical vengeance it might be in his power to wreak on the seducer began to form in his mind to bring the murder home to him what a frenzy of triumph in the very thought it possessed him devilishly and verily from that moment it was as if the man had bargained away his soul to the evil one everything appeared to favour him the mood the motive the conduct of his hated rival most of all the fact that to his own hands by some extraordinary freak of opportunism had been committed the control of the case how near he came to success in his inhuman design needs no retelling but meanwhile there was the murder committed in that instant of madness probably he had not much hope at the time of escaping its consequences probably in his desperate state with all his schemes gone to wreck he did not much care he had had his bloody revenge for an intolerable wrong and the rest was indifference to him he replaced the gun where it had stood and left the spot possibly as sanity returned to him some instinct of self preservation may have induced in him a certain mood of precaution there is evidence to show i think that he lurked for a time in the woods before leaving them for the open hillside but that he did leave them eventually to make his way up the hill we have henstridges evidence to testify now from the first i had never succeeded in convincing myself that that hypothetical figure on the hill was as wholly a figment of the imagination as most people seemed to consider it the cap pulled over the eyes and the turned up collar what butler ever turned up his coat collar were strong presumptions in my mind that mr cleghorn had not been their wearer then the figure had been described as advancing hurriedly yet it had taken twenty minutes or so to cover a distance of two hundred yards you may object possibly that in all your experience of sergeant ridgway you have never seen him wear on his head other than a black plush homburg hat i answer that on the day of the murder he was wearing a cloth cap easily in the distance to be mistaken for the cap worn by mr cleghorn i know this because in the course of one of my drives about the country in the company of a very charming young lady i had made a point of calling at the sergeants one time lodgings at antonferry i had procured the address from sir calvin where at the cost of a little insinuative word play i was able to ascertain that the sergeant had gone out wearing a cloth cap fairly early on the day of the murder and that he had returned late and seemingly in an exhausted condition from a long walk he had and that hypothetical figure hurrying over the hill at the moment with little concern for its safety had been the figure of sergeant ridgway tramping back to his lodgings in antonferry after the murder he had passed by the inn making north by west and had long turned the bend of the lonely road before mr cleghorn mistaken by henstridge for the same figure had arrived at the red deer and turned in at the tap the baron paused for refreshment while sir francis applauded softly his whole face beaming delight and approval have i convinced you so far continued the narrator of the efficiency of the toils in which i was manuvring to entangle my suspect very well here was another little pice de conviction in spying about the scene of the crime i had picked up in addition to the skeleton key a button it was a common horn coat button and was lying on the spot whence the gun had been fired jerked off probably by the recoil now the sergeants overcoat was one of those light covert coats which button under an overlapping hem i took occasion to examine it one day when occupied with sir calvin he had left it in the hall it had been fitted i observed with a set of brand new buttons which nevertheless did not correspond with the little buttons on the cuffs those exactly matched the button i had found while the others were of a distinctly different pattern obviously he had discovered his loss had failed again to make it good and so for precautions sake had renewed the entire set it was an unpardonable oversight in such a man to have forgotten the sleeves i made the button over to him or could it be an exact duplicate of it which i had procured telling him in all innocence where i had found it he took the little blow very well without a wince but i could see how it disturbed him he never suspected me i think of more than an amiable curiosity i have often wondered why because he wasnt a fool interposed mr bickerdike with a slight groan le sage laughed or because i am more of a knave than i appear said he so let bygones be bygones he helped himself to a weighty pinch of rappee and put down the box with a grave expression i come now he said to the supreme crux of all the apparently damning evidence as to when the fatal shot was fired if it were fired somewhere about three oclock at the time stated by two witnesses then hugo kennett and none but hugo kennett must be despite all specious arguments to the contrary the actual murderer but it was not fired at three oclock as i believe i shall find reason to convince you it was fired a good twenty or twenty five minutes later and this is my justification for saying so you will remember that at the magisterial inquiry the witness daniel groome revising his former evidence stated that he had heard the clock in his masters study strike the quarter past three he by then having gone round to the back of the house thereby proving that the report of the gun which had reached him while he was still at the front must have occurred during the first quarter of the hour now i have taken the pains since my return to question daniel groome very closely on this matter and with what result you will be surprised to hear the stable clock to which daniel is accustomed to listen strikes the quarters one for the first two for the second and so on the study clock to which daniel is not accustomed to listen strikes the half hour only a single stroke but the single stroke represented to daniel the quarter past and therefore he concluded when he heard that single stroke sound from his masters study that it was recording the first quarter instead of as it actually was the second and on this ingenuous evidence not realizing in the least what he was doing was that simple man prepared to tighten the noose about his young masters neck but if daniel groome was wrong it followed of necessity that henstridge must be wrong also as of course he was he had been simply got at by the detective and officially bullied and threatened into stating what was wanted of him as a matter of fact he had had no idea of what the time was at all but had taken any suggestion offered him the fellow is a blackguard and a coward and would swear any mans life away for thirty pieces of silver i did a little persuasion with him on my own account again during one of those refreshing drives sir francis and taking a leaf out of ridgways book had little difficulty in bringing him to his knees he was abject when i had finished with him parenthetically i may suggest here what i am convinced was the case that our murdering friend had also got at mr fyler but in another sense he had persuaded i mean that astute lawyer into believing that there really was nothing worth considering in that hypothetical figure which we may name the fourth dimension and that was why i take it the point was not taken up again by counsel before the magistrates very well now we have got so far as to convict sergeant ridgway of murder following on a plot to disinherit with the help of a confederate the very man whom he schemed to charge with the crime so we arrive necessarily at the question who was this annie evans whom he had chosen for his accomplice in the business and whom he had ended by so foully doing to death to get at the whole truth of the story it was essential that the mystery of their connexion should be traced to its source to any one not possessed of the clues which fortune had placed in my hands it must have appeared nothing less than astonishing that with all the wide publicity given to the case the victim should have remained virtually unidentified and unclaimed she was beautiful she was in domestic service two facts one might have thought favourable to an easy solution of the riddle still her origin remained a mystery and so remains to all but the few instructed to this day but that very mystery which to those wanting the master key appeared so insolvable was to me who possessed the key illuminating that the girl was in domestic service at the time of her death was no proof that she had ever been in domestic service before it would be much more in accord with my conception of the astute and far seeing detective to suppose that he had anticipated that danger of recognition by assigning to his confederate a part through which it would be impracticable should difficulties arise to trace her she had not been in service before in fact the business of the photograph confirmed me in that view you will remember that travesty of annies likeness which appeared enlarged and reproduced from a snap shot in the official prints it was completely unrecognizable and was intended by ridgway to be unrecognizable he knew that no other recent photograph of her existed at all and for the very good reason that she had not for some time been in a position to be photographed you will understand why in a moment it was of paramount importance to him both first and last that his accomplice should be and remain unidentifiable essential to that condition were her innocence of former service the absence of any photographic record and the employment of a false name it was of no use consequently my thinking of running annie evans so called to earth i must look for her under another title how was i to ascertain that title it was here again that chance or providence came i will not say in a totally unforeseen way but at least in a most obliging way to my assistance it occurred to me that at this stage of the proceedings it would be well for me to pay a visit to my parisian john ridgway and endeavour to extract from him if he could be persuaded to part with them the fullest details possible of the story with whose outline he had already acquainted me something it might be much i felt had remained untold which if revealed would possibly throw such a light upon the obscure places of my quest as would enable me from that moment to present my case without a flaw i went to paris mr bickerdike not to london as you supposed only to learn from jeans bosom friend that caliste ribault of whom i have already spoken that his loved comrade had departed this life in june of this year that was a blow i confess my hopes seemed baffled my journey in vain yet it was so far from being the case that not the artists living lips could have more shouted the truth into my soul than did the evidence of his dead hand i will tell you how one day shortly before jeans death caliste informed me there had come to visit him a stepbrother an englishman of whom he caliste had never before heard nor jean spoken this stepbrother bore the same christian and surname as jean and he had come accompanied by a girl of such beauty that the dying man could not dismiss the thought of her face from his mind until he had made from memory a coloured drawing of it on the white washed wall writing her name beneath now his step brother being dead john ridgway had come once more to arrange about the funeral and the disposition of the deceaseds effects and perceiving the face on the wall had been very angry so angry that he had immediately seized a cloth and completely effaced the drawing so that not a vestige of it remained why you ask you will understand later thus again fortune seemed to laugh at me but it was laughter like that of a mother who dangles over the mouth of her child a cherry to be his in a moment and sure enough in such a moment caliste informed me that though the picture was destroyed a copy of it remained in the shape of a photograph which he himself had taken of the original he showed me the photograph and the face i saw was the face of annie evans but ivy mellor was the name written underneath i had found out what i wanted and more i had discovered that the two john ridgways were step brothers and light and still light broadened on the path before me i got ribault to part with the photograph to me cautioning him to say nothing about his possessing the negative to any one and with my prize i came on the following day to london thereafter my task was an easy one possessing that face and that name and associating both with the name of a famous scotland yard detective i had only to place the matter in the hands of a very clever and trustworthy private inquiry agent of my acquaintance to find out all that i needed his investigations with the details of which i need not trouble you yielded the following information ivy mellor had been not many months discharged from a reformatory to which she had been committed for three years for procuring a situation as nursery governess with a forged character and obtaining goods by false pretences she was the illegitimate daughter of an actress now dead and was possessed herself of some decided histrionic ability upon her discharge ridgway had somehow got hold of her or had been got hold of by her with the result that he had fallen a complete slave to her attractions it was probably she who had been his evil genius from the first probably she who had planned and perpetrated the written character which had procured her an entre to wildshott he promised her great things in the event of success and in view of those great things she held him at arms length there were to be no questionable relations between them the man was hopelessly infatuated he used to visit her under an assumed name probably kept her in the unequivocal sense i am giving here not only the agents report but some of my own conclusions drawn therefrom summarized they showed my case complete so far as effect was concerned i had only now to penetrate to the cause it could be fathomed i believed but fathomed in one direction alone i determined to go boldly to the fountain head and challenge there a decision in sir calvins hands lay the final verdict i could hardly doubt what it would be or that for the sake of the whole truth he would yield at last to daylight the guarded secret of a long past episode i judged him rightly and i need say no more he told me the story produced for my examination the written evidence and left me to deal with the matter as i would but one remark more i have to make before running as briefly as i can through the main points of the narrative unfolded to me while in paris i had procured from my very good friend m despard the head of the secret police an introduction to our own first commissioner i saw the latter confided to his interested and rather horrified ears the whole truth of the case so far as i had then conceived and mastered it and arranged with him the little trap which was to entice john ridgway into our midst again conditional always on my procuring that supplementary evidence which was to prove his guilt beyond any possibility of doubt the rest you know we come now to the final chapter which like the postscript to a ladys letter contains in hazlitts phrase the pith of the whole in relating it i choose my own words and must not be understood to aim at reproducing the actual terms in which it was revealed to me by sir calvin i wish to give a mere brief or abstract of a painful story and i wish moreover to warn you once more that certain reflections and conclusions of mine not affecting the main body of the narrative were and are conjectural and must so remain unless and until the accused himself shall confirm their accuracy and that in my soul i anticipate will be the case here then is the story in the early part of the year sir calvin kennett then a young cavalry officer of twenty six unmarried and only latterly succeeded to his inheritance was living in cairo attached as military representative to the british legation there while in that situation he made the acquaintance of a very beautiful young frenchwoman mademoiselle desilles the daughter of a tobacconist in a modest way of business between whom and himself a mutual attachment sprang up pure and sincere on her part passionate and unscrupulous on his madly enamoured yet hopeless of prevailing against the virtue of the lady young kennett had recourse to the vile and dishonourable stratagem of a sham marriage which he effected through the instrumentality of a worthless acquaintance one barry skelton who had come abroad in connexion with some oxford missionary society and who though not yet in holy orders was supposed to be qualifying himself for the priesthood with the aid of this scamp the cruel fraud was perpetrated and mademoiselle desilles became the wife as she supposed of sir calvin the union for reasons seeming sufficient as urged by the pseudo husband was kept a present secret even from the girls father whose death about this time greatly facilitated the success of the imposture in july of that year occurred the definite revolt of arabi pasha and the landing at alexandria of a considerable british force and sir calvin was called upon to rejoin his regiment in view of the operations pending he went leaving his wife as i will call her in the distant way to become a mother in a skirmish near mahmoudieh he lost the first finger of his right hand a casualty not without its bearing on subsequent events he was present at tel el kebir in mid september and again two days later at the entry of the british troops into cairo when he took the occasion his passion in the interval having burned itself out as such mere animal transports will to break the truth to mademoiselle desilles of the fraud he had practised on her i make it no part of my business to comment on his behaviour then or previously or to imagine the spirit in which his revelation was received by his unfortunate victim no doubt each of you can supply the probable text for himself as his sympathy or his indignation may dictate it is enough to state the compromise by way of which the deceiver could find the heart to propose to condone his offence this was no other than that in order to save her credit and that of her unborn infant a marriage should be instantly contrived between his unhappy dupe and a certain quartermaster sergeant george ridgway a widower with a single young child a boy who had been in the secret yet who strangely enough had no more inherent vice in him than was consistent with good nature a weakness for beauty in distress and a conscience of the easiest capacity in the matter of hush money this man was no doubt a personable fellow the womans situation very certainly desperate and deplorable anyhow following whatever distressful scenes she was brought to consent the two were married and shortly afterwards the child was born in london whither the couple had removed in the interval i am quite prepared to believe that george ridgway made his wife a good husband during the few years which remained to them in company for he did not very long survive his marriage moreover sir calvins liberality had placed the two in such comfortable circumstances that no excuse for discontent existed the quartermaster sergeant adhered honourably to his part of the bargain and it was not until long after his death that the question arose in the widows mind as to whether or not she was justified in continuing to mislead her son in the matter of his origin of that in a moment in the meantime the two children step brothers in fact were brought up together and considered themselves as half brothers they were both christened john the younger through some unconquerable perversity of the mother in insisting on calling him after her seducers second name an anomaly which however open to curious comment at first was soon no doubt lost sight of in the inevitable nicknames which affection would come to bestow on the pair still for the purposes of distinction i will continue to call the one john and the other jean jean was popularly regarded as the ridgways child though in truth no child was born of their union john though the elder by some three years was frequently as time went on mistaken by those who did not know for the younger of the two boys an error also not without its bearing on subsequent events jean from the outset betrayed if it could have been guessed an unmistakable sign of his origin in the use of his second for his digit finger an inherited trick due to the shock caused to his mother by the sight of sir calvins mutilation associated as it had been with all the agony and despair of that time he was a dreamy boy and early developed artistic proclivities i have no means or intention of tracing the career of either of the children up to and beyond manhood at some period as we know jean went to paris at some period john joined the metropolitan police force with subsequent promotion to a valued position in the criminal investigation department i pass from these ascertained facts to an estimate of the circumstances which first engendered in the latters mind a thought of the daring project which has ended by bringing him to his present situation now i have already told you how jean on the occasion of a visit to england had been at last made acquainted by his mother with the true story of his paternity she told it him being herself under the fear of death at the time and there is no doubt that the poor woman still believed perfectly honestly in the legality of her first marriage not only before heaven but on the practical testimony of the little catholic vade mecum in which the names of the contracting parties with their clerical witness had been inscribed she believed moreover on the strength of some muddled innuendo gathered from the quartermaster sergeant that the creature barry skelton had deceived as much as she herself had been deceived by sir calvin and that he had actually been an ordained priest at the time of the marriage it was not true i think the ordination having occurred subsequently as the general took pains to make known to her for she wrote to him on the subject of the vade mecum begging him to return it to her hands whence he had appropriated it when he deserted her why you may ask had he after securing possession of persisted in retaining through all these years that damning witness to his guilt for the very same reason of the evidence it contained which to her stood for proof to him for disproof of the legality of the marriage wherefore he could not make up his mind to destroy it but he thought it well to pay a visit to his correspondent to assure her that she was completely mistaken in her surmise and that the continuance of his support depended upon the utter future abandonment by her of any such attempts on his forbearance still thinking for her boy the fond soul was not convinced so little was she convinced that when her death came actually to be imminent she called john to her side and confided to him the whole story begging him to look after his step brothers interests and to vindicate if possible his true claim to the name and estates of kennett something about which she told him jean already knew and john promised she was not his mother remember he may have been for all we are aware to the contrary a cold and undutiful stepson but he promised we know for he went after her death to paris to visit the other to acquaint him of his mothers end and to discuss with him the strange story she had committed to his keeping he went accompanied by a beautiful young creature of his acquaintance whom he had brought with him probably for no other reason than her pleasure and his own infatuation only to find jean himself at the point of death was it then for the first time that a daring idea began to germinate in his mind i think so whether spontaneously or at his companions instance i believe the conception of the plot dated from that moment jean dead what was to prevent him john from personating his step brother from claiming himself to be sir calvins son from profiting by the evidence which was said to prove that sons legitimacy as to that he had only mrs ridgways word but it had been uttered with such solemnity and conviction by a dying woman as to leave little doubt of its truth at worst the thing would be a gamble but there was that in the very romantic hazard of it to appeal to his imagination at best it would be prosperity beyond his dreams and what were the odds to consider them was to find them already curiously in his favour the similarity of their names the fact that he himself had always been regarded as the younger the early death of the quartermaster sergeant and the consequent long removal of the one most damaging witness to the truth jeans prolonged absence from home in a foreign city his own more apparent devotion to the woman to be claimed as his mother he could find nothing in it all inimical to the success of the plot only the first essential would be to obtain possession of the vade mecum there was full reason to believe from what sir calvin had told mrs ridgway that the book to this day was jealously retained by him for the reason stated in his secure keeping how to recover it so the conspiracy was hatched ivy mellor was to be the means the condition of her success the bestowal of her spotless hand upon the rightful heir of wildshott a splendid dream a transpontine melodrama but john saw at once that a first condition of its success lay in a scrupulous obliteration of all clues pointing to the identity of his confederate hence his anger on discovering the portrait and the immediate measures taken by him to wipe it out of existence well we know the rest how the beautiful accomplice betrayed her trust how she developed a passion for the very man whom she was scheming to disinherit how to be sure she came to recognize that she could much more fully and satisfactorily realize her own ambitions by baulking than by furthering the designs of her fellow plotter to be the wife of the problematic heir of wildshott might be a good thing to be the wife of the heir of wildshott in esse a gentleman a soldier and an antinous was certainly a better so having surrendered to love she played for the greater stake and she lost we can pity her she was frankly an adventuress we could pity him were it not for the thought of that inhuman revenge yet he had provocation perhaps beyond a gamblers endurance to find the very woman for worship of whom he had been scheming away his position his reputation his soul of truth and honour not only turned traitor to his best interests but faithless in the worse sense and for his rivals sake to her pledge to him well one must pause before utterly condemning and after all it was only a moments madness served by opportunity yes i can pity him i have a notion too that she told him what was not the truth that she had already destroyed for her loves sake the evidence of the prayer book if she had it was the last touch yes i can pity him gentlemen that is the story m le baron ceased speaking and for a time a silence held among them all then presently mr bickerdike asked there is only one thing baron which remains to puzzle me a little was not ridgways employment in the case originally agreed to by sir calvin in response to a suggestion of yours that is quite true was sir calvin himself then never moved to any sort of emotion or curiosity over the association which the detectives name would naturally awaken in his mind emotion i think not it would hardly describe a psychology so little superstitious as that of the general the similarity of the names would have struck him as no more than an inconsiderable coincidence with all his practical qualities imagination is the last thing he would care to be accused of but curiosity well perhaps to a certain extent though neither deep seated nor lasting you have to remember that from first to last i suppose he never knew or troubled to know what the sergeants christian name was and even had he learned it it would have conveyed nothing to him as he knew no better nor again probably had ever troubled to know by what name his own disowned son was called and very certainly he had never condescended to note the name of the quartermaster sergeants individual offspring i see and had you yourself in suggesting the sergeant for the case any arrire pense at that time connecting i had merely a curiosity my friend to observe the owner of a name really ipsissima verba to me so oddly associated in my mind with the teller of a certain fantastic story in paris then you did not know but of course you didnt he turned to the baronet i congratulate you with all my heart orsden thanks old fellow said sir francis its all due to him there ill give his health in b bob cratchits words heres to m le baron the founder of the feast chapter xxi a last word miss kennett still in process of qualifying herself for a musician was at work on czernys fifth exercise which like the pons asinorum of an earlier strategist could present an insuperable problem to an intelligence already painful master of the four preceding to pick up one note with her was like the clown with the packages to drop half a dozen others to give its proper value to the right hand was to leave the left struggling in a partial paralysis still she persevered lips counting eyes glued to the page pretty fingers sprawling until a sudden laugh at the open door of the room startled her efforts into a shiver of unexpected harmony she looked up with a shake and a smile that suggested somehow to the observer a bird scattering water from its wings in a sunshiny basin o frank she exclaimed and stretched herself with glistening easefulness you p poor goose he answered youll never play you know she jumped up with a cry and ran to him do you mean it are you sure absolutely would you mind if i didnt not half so m much as i should if you did but i tried to please you you know but it doesnt please me you know she looked at him doubtfully he took her hands his eyes glowing i love you for trying you dear he said but i shouldnt love you if i let you go on trying nor i expect would any one else pig she exclaimed audrey he said you couldnt play when i fell in love with you so why should i wish you to now it would never be yourself and thats what i want of all things let every one develop the best thats in him and leave affectation to the donkeys so youll just come over to bartons farm with me to give me your advice about the loveliest litter of bull pups you ever saw he had something to say to her and when they were on their way he came out with it soberly i wanted just to tell you he left a full confession and and it showed how the baron had been right in almost every particular she made no answer for a little but presently she said softly i think i should like to be the one frank to write and tell him so yes audrey again the silence fell between them and again she broke it in the same tone we heard from hughie this morning only a short letter he wrote from karachi where they had just landed they were going straight on to rawul pindi he nodded now let us talk of something else the end footnotes found in manuscript transcribers notes the edition published by collins clear type press
